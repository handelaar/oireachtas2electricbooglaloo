      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether in the case of pensions payable by Saorstát Eireann under Clause 10 of the Treaty and paid to persons resident in countries outside the British Commonwealth income tax is deducted at the source, and whether in the case of such pensioners resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland income tax is deducted at the source.</P>

      <P>In the case of all pensions payable at a public office, including pensions under Article 10 of the Treaty, income tax is deductible at the time of payment by virtue of No. 11 of the rules applicable to Schedule E of the Income Tax Act, 1918.  This is the general position.  In the case, however, of pensioners who satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that they are resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland and are not resident in Saorstát Eireann for 1926-27, and later years, the position for those years is governed by the Double Income Tax Agreement which was confirmed by the Finance Act, 1926.  Under that Act such pensioners are entitled to total relief from Saorstát Eireann income tax by way of repayment or otherwise.  Where practicable, i.e., when the title to relief is established in time, exemption is granted at the source and the pension is paid in full.</P>

      <P>This decree was reopened under Section 2 (3) of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, and on rehearing an award of £2,500 was made.  £300 of this amount was, I understand, in respect of the clearance of debris and the reconstruction of portion of the injured premises by the applicant, and this part of the award, with £116 8s. 3d. in respect of costs and expenses, was paid in November, 1925.  The balance, £2,200, is subject to a full reinstatement condition, and can be paid only according as reinstatement is carried out.  The applicant's solicitor was informed on 7th November, 1925, of the steps necessary to secure payment, but, as far as I am aware, no effort has yet been made to comply with the condition attached to the award.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention has been called to the dismissal of certain officials of the National Land Bank on the branches being closed, <Col N="2536" /> following the transfer to the Bank of Ireland, and the refusal of the bank to fulfil the promise made by the Minister in the Dáil on July 20th, 1926, viz., that any member of the permanent staff of the National Land Bank for whom the Bank of Ireland would be unable to find employment would receive compensation by way of superannuation allowance equivalent to two-thirds of their salary; whether he is aware that one of the dismissed officers in question was formally acknowledged on May 27th, 1925, to be a permanent official of the National Land Bank, and whether in these circumstances he will notify the Bank of Ireland of the necessity for fulfilment of the terms of the agreement that were communicated to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been called to the fact that the services of two lady officials of the National Land Bank have been dispensed with, and I presume this is the matter to which the Deputy refers.  The agreement with the Bank of Ireland in regard to staff matters provided, as I stated in the Dáil on 20th July last, that &ldquo;the permanent staff of the National Land Bank shall be dealt with in accordance with the practice of banks in dealing with their permanent staffs.&rdquo;  My statement as to &ldquo;compensation by way of superannuation allowance equivalent to two-thirds of their salary&rdquo; applied accordingly only to people who are reckoned as permanent bank officials for the purposes of superannuation. The compensation award regulating the practice of banks in the matter of superannuation does not apply to female clerks, and gives them no rights to compensation should their services be for any reason discontinued beyond the usual legal notice.  In the present cases the legal notice would have been one month, during which the employees would be expected to work, but in pursuance of my agreement with the Bank of Ireland, a gratuity of one year's salary will be paid to each of the ladies in question.</P>

      <P>I have seen the statement of the editor of the &ldquo;Cork Weekly Examiner&rdquo; to which the Deputy refers. I have also compared the reports of Mr. Wolfe's speech which appeared in all the local newspapers.  They are identical not merely in substance but in detail.  I may add that although Mr. Wolfe told the Assistant Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána that it was a week or ten days before the issue of the proclamation in connection with the Cobh murders that he saw two of the men named therein in a street in Cork, I have since seen in the &ldquo;Cork Examiner&rdquo; of the 16th instant the following extract from a report of a speech delivered by Mr. Wolfe at Bantry:&mdash;&ldquo;He saw two of them after the Proclamation was issued walking through the streets of Cork.  He said that before and would say it again.&rdquo; Mr. Wolfe was reported as saying in this connection. in his Skibbereen speech:&mdash;&ldquo;They issued a proclamation for the apprehension of a number of <Col N="2539" /> Republicans... two of whom he saw walking the streets of Cork a few days previously.&rdquo;  I have come to the conclusion that, for the moment, Mr. Wolfe's political ambitions are overriding considerations which the Deputy and I would agree ought to prevail even in the weeks preceding a general election.</P>

      <P>A claim to Unemployment Benefit made by Robert Ivors, of Pluckerstown.  Kilmeague, Co.

The claimant having been notified of this decision, appealed to the Court of Referees, whose recommendation is being further considered in the light of fresh facts which have come to light since the case was first before the Court.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that British manufacturers forwarding their goods to Saorstát markets are specially favoured by cheap through rates while the Saorstát producer or manufacturer forwarding his produce to British markets is penalised with abnormally heavy freights; whether as native development or production under such conditions is utterly impossible he will introduce at an early date legislation protecting Saorstát <Col N="2540" /> producers and manufacturers from such penal imposition, and afford them an opportunity of competing on favourable terms in British markets with the producers of other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is founded on several misapprehensions. A through rate between Great Britain and the Saorstát applies in both directions, and the assumption that it applies only from Great Britain to the Saorstát is mistaken.  Through rates are fixed by making from the sum of the local rates a reduction which, generally speaking, is proportionately the same whether the traffic consists of manufactured goods from Great Britain or agricultural produce from the Saorstát.</P>
      <P>Section 29 (2) of the Railways Act, 1924, already gives the Railway Tribunal all the jurisdiction over through rates which it is possible to give it.  I am not aware of any means by which further legislation could give the Saorstát control over the rates charged by shipping companies and the British railways.</P>

      <P>There are 54 industrial schools and 2 reformatory schools. The curriculum of these schools includes instruction in the subjects of the National Schools programme, in so far as the ability of the children renders this possible.  As industrial training and instruction in trades are also given to the older pupils in reformatory and industrial schools the programme in the ordinary school subjects followed by classes of these <Col N="2541" /> pupils is not usually as extensive or advanced as in the corresponding classes of a National school.</P>
      <P>There are no official regulations regarding the number or qualifications of the teachers who are employed by these schools; these matters are determined in each case by the manager of the school.  As far as can be ascertained from official information available at present, the total number of teachers employed is 395.  Of these, 191 may be taken as teachers of ordinary school subjects and the remainder as teachers of trade subjects of various kinds.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions of service of these teachers are a matter of arrangement between themselves and the managers of the schools, and the financial contribution made by the State to the schools in the form of capitation grant is intended to provide for the cost of the education as well as the maintenance of the children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the President considered that a Thursday polling may unduly prolong the counting of the votes over Sunday in some constituencies? Even in County Dublin, although it is concentrated, it will take more than two days.  It took up to 4 <Col N="2550" /> o'clock on the morning of the following day at the last election to get the counting finished, and that would bring it into Sunday.  In some constituencies, like Tirconaill, Kerry and Mayo, where they have to bring ballot boxes from outlying islands off the coast, it takes even longer.  Is the counting to proceed on Sunday, or is it intended that the counting should be suspended, and all the ballot papers locked up again, put back into a box and sealed?  You cannot very well leave them in the boxes into which they are being sorted. It seems to me this would cause a good deal of delay and inconvenience.  Is there any reason why there should not be a Wednesday polling to obviate this difficulty?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy Cooper has said. In some constituencies the count will take four days.  The first day after the polling will go in getting the ballot boxes brought in from remote parts. The most of the second day will certainly go in checking the boxes.  It will mean in that case that after checking the boxes the whole thing will have to be carried over Sunday.  I think the President ought to give some consideration to that.  Certainly, as far as some people are concerned, there would be, to say the least of it, a good deal of suspicion as to what might or could happen if the boxes are going to be locked up for the week-end and the counting discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It ought to have been within the knowledge of every person for the last three or four weeks that Thursday, 9th June, was the earliest date upon which the polling could take place after it was announced that it was our intention to have the dissolution on the 23rd May.  It is the earliest date according to the Act on which the polling could take place.  The only way to meet the objections made by Deputies Cooper and Morrissey would be to have the polling on the following Wednesday.  I do not know whether there are many people with sufficient electioneering appetite to demand another week of speeches and so on.  The idea was to get the election over sufficiently early to permit of the <Col N="2551" /> tourist traffic, business, and so on being affected to the least possible extent, and that is the earliest date.  It is possible, with a little extra work and a little organisation, to finish the counting of the votes within two days, but I do not think that even the inconvenience of the Sunday intervening would justify putting back the election until the following Wednesday.</P>

    <Title>PUBLIC BUSINESS. - AGRICULTURAL CREDIT BILL, 1927&mdash;FROM THE SEANAD.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider the amendments from the Seanad to the Agricultural Credit Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment 1.&mdash;Section 2.  After the word &ldquo;Corporation&rdquo; in line 28 the word &ldquo;Limited&rdquo; inserted.</P>

      <P>I move that the amendment be agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 2.&mdash;Section 4, sub-section (1).  All from and including the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 11 deleted down to the end of the sub-section and the word &ldquo;Limited,&rdquo; within the inverted commas, substituted therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the amendment be agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 3.&mdash;Section 4.  A new sub-section added at the end of the section, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  A trustee may, unless expressly forbidden by the instrument (if any) creating the trust, invest any trust funds in his hands, whether at the time in a state of investment or not, in any shares of the Corporation which are at the time of the investment fully paid-up as to capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the amendment be agreed to.  The capital of the Corporation is to be paid-up, half at one time and the rest on call.  Obviously it could not be a trustee security until the capital was fully paid up.  It was considered that it would be useful, after the capital had been paid up, to make the investment a trustee investment, and for that purpose the amendment is inserted.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 4.&mdash;Section 7, sub-section (3).  The following words added at the end of the sub-section:&mdash;&ldquo;and (except in the winding-up of the Corporation) shall be so repayable only out of moneys which are profits as ascertained in accordance with directions of the Minister and in the winding-up of the Corporation shall be so repayable after the creditors of the Corporation have been paid in full.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the amendment be agreed to.  As sub-section (3) stands, the Minister could at any time demand repayment of any moneys advanced by him in respect to his guarantee in the matter of share capital, interest or certificates, and the Corporation would have no alternative except to pay that out of, say, deposits or other funds of that sort.  That is considered wrong.  It was considered that <Col N="2557" /> any repayment of moneys should be made out of profits, and that the Minister should not be in any better position than any other creditor.  It is to meet that point that the amendment was inserted in the Seanad and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 5.&mdash;Section 11.  The section deleted and the following new section substituted therefor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>11.&mdash;The Articles of Association of the Corporation shall provide:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  that the number of directors (including the Chairman) shall be seven, of whom four shall be elected by the shareholders with the usual provisions for co-option to casual vacancies and three shall be nominated by the Minister from time to time as occasion requires.</P>
      <P>(ii)  that so long as the Minister holds more than two hundred thousand shares of the Corporation the Chairman of the directors shall be nominated from time to time by the Minister from amongst the three directors nominated by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the amendment be agreed to.  This amendment sets out that the directors shall be nominated from time to time by the Minister, and in addition the provision for co-option to casual vacancies.  There was no provision in the section as it stood for the election of the ordinary directors.  This amendment sets out that that matter should be dealt with in the Articles of Association.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 6.&mdash;Section 12, sub-section (1).  Lines 57 and 58 deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the amendment be agreed to.  This is the most important amendment that is being inserted.  In connection with this amendment I might deal with another amendment in order to explain it to the Committee.  Section 12 gives a list of the persons to whom, and the purposes for which, the Corporation may lend money.  It is proposed to add to this list another section, which is set out in amendment 8 from the Seanad, and which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2558" /> Section 12, sub-section (1).  Before paragraph (e) a new paragraph inserted, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(e) to any person (other than a co-operative society) for the purpose of purchasing for agricultural purposes land which was immediately before the purchase comprised in a security held by the Corporation from the vendor of such land.</P>
    <P>By amendment 10 from the Seanad it is proposed further to add to the section, and this amendment reads:</P>
    <P>Section 12, sub-section (1).  Before paragraph (f) a new paragraph inserted, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(f) to any person (other than a co-operative society) for the purpose of paying off a loan which was originally made to him before the passing of this Act wholly or mainly for the purpose of purchasing land for agricultural purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to the first amendment, the Corporation may not lend money to a person for the purchase of land de novo, but under amendment 8 it may lend money to purchase land which is held by the Corporation as a security. The Corporation may make a loan, say, to a creamery, and may hold land as a security for the loan, but they may want to liquidate the security, and it is considered that for the purpose of its ordinary operations, even though it may not make a loan to a person to buy land de novo, it is felt that, nevertheless, the Corporation should be in a position to make a loan to a third party to buy land which the Corporation itself holds as a security, and which the Corporation wishes to sell up.  With regard to amendment 10, it is considered that the Corporation should have the right to liquidate a loan already made for the purchase of land, and for that purpose this amendment is introduced.</P>
    <P>The view taken in the Seanad on this Bill was that these arrangements should exist, not so much to create new farmers, because that is the work of the Land Commission and of other bodies, but to provide credit facilities for existing farmers, and it was on that principle that these changes were <Col N="2559" /> made.  It was also pointed out that the report of the Banking Commission was expressly against the lending of money for the purpose of buying farms de novo, and, in the circumstances, while I have no strong views on the matter one way or the other, I am accepting the amendment.  I do not think it makes any difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the second provision would enable the Corporation to turn a land asset into a liquid asset in order to enable it to lend money to a third party to buy land.  If the Corporation get that land back again as a security from the third party who has made the purchase, where is the liquidation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously this is to meet a case where the Corporation held land as a security and wants to sell it up, and where it would be unable to sell unless it could make a loan to a third party to purchase the land.  This amendment covers that.  It reads: &ldquo;to any person (other than a co-operative society) for the purpose of purchasing, for agricultural purposes, land which was immediately before&rdquo;&mdash;that is to prevent, so far as you can prevent, any wangling between the Corporation and other parties&mdash;&ldquo;the purchase comprised in a security held by the Corporation from the vendor of such land.&rdquo;  Obviously, that allows the Corporation to make a loan to a third party to buy land which the Corporation wishes sold and which they hold as security.  As I understand from the Deputy, his point is that he is afraid it will also admit of certain cases which are not contemplated.  Is that the Deputy's point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that you are enabling the Corporation to advance money for the purpose of paying off a loan which they have already made.  It does not get them any further.  It is merely that they are giving money out of one pocket and getting it back into another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many reasons for selling it, besides the actual <Col N="2560" /> value of the security.  The bankers want it, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not seem to get you any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a common every-day occurrence for a banking institution to lend money to a third party in order to buy a security which they hold?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was a case of advancing part of the money on sufficient security it would be somewhat different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely you must leave that to the directors.  The directors must see when it is advisable to lend money and how good is the security.  I agree that unless you have competent directors it is merely taking the money out of one pocket and putting it into another, but the directors must see to that.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 7.&mdash;Section 12, sub-section (1).  Before the word &ldquo;designed&rdquo; in line 8 the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the amendment be agreed to.  It was considered that this was a very wide section as it stood.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) to any person engaged in or proposing to engage in an enterprise designed for the service of farmers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Personally I am against limitations.  I think a certain amount of discretion should be left to the directors, but that limitation to insert the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; there seems to be right.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 8.&mdash;Section 12, sub-section (1).  Before paragraph (e) a new paragraph inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension.  I have not got the responsibility for the making of the loan.  It will be a matter for the directors. They will observe the ordinary banking canons when they come to make a loan.  They will make a loan where they think it is desirable, and where they think it is undesirable they <Col N="2562" /> will refuse to make a loan.  They will be limited by the terms of the Act, but they will exercise the powers given under the Act in every case where they think it is desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the amendment be agreed to.  The paragraph to which the amendment refers reads:</P>
      <P>Any co-operative society which at the time of the making of the loan or advance carries on the business of selling by retail any goods which are neither actually nor usually ....</P>
      <P>These are the words deleted.  These words were inserted in order to enable a creamery, say, to deal in foreign butter if it wished and to cover the case of an egg society and so on.  They were never quite satisfactory, and it is considered best to delete the words. There is a further amendment, No. 15, which deals with the same matter and which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  Where the goods sold by a co-operative society are mainly goods produced by that society or its members, any similar goods occasionally sold by such society may, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have been so produced although in fact produced by and purchased by the society from other persons.&rdquo;</P>

The amendment which we have just passed implies that it is the Minister for Finance who is to make the list of appointed banks, but the first of these three amendments which I am now proposing gives him power to do so.  Consequently it is necessary to take out paragraph (f) of sub-section (8).  The second of these amendments gives power to the Minister for Finance to consult the Minister for Justice in view of the fact that it is the county registrar who will keep the registers, and, consequently, the Minister for Justice must be communicated with.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>New Section.  Before Section 28 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;28.&mdash;(1)  It shall be an obligation on every person (hereinafter called the debtor) who seeks from another person (hereinafter called the creditor) the grant or continuance of credit to disclose in writing to the creditor (if required in writing by the creditor so to do) whether there is or is not a chattel mortgage subsisting in respect of any of the debtor's farming stock and the particulars of every (if any) such chattel mortgage.</P>
      <P>(2)  No creditor shall disclose any information furnished to him by the debtor in pursuance of this section save in so far as such disclosure may be necessary or proper for the purposes of a prosecution under this section or for the institution or conduct of legal proceedings for the recovery of moneys due by the debtor to the creditor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the amendment be agreed to.  I regard this amendment as being an improvement on the Bill.  It means that if a person applies for credit, or to continue credit, to another it shall be the right of the other to ask him in writing if he has got a chattel mortgage on his stock, and the reply must be in writing.  It is made clear in sub-section (3) that the person need not reply, but if he does he must tell the truth under a penalty not exceeding £20.  The request must come in writing, and there is also a penalty for wrongful disclosure.  This does not seriously interfere with the secrecy of the chattel mortgage.  A request can only be made by the person who is being asked for credit, and it enables a trader to find out whether there is a chattel mortgage, but it does not enable him to go to the Register to find out.  It was a little bit harsh that a creditor should have to issue a process to get a decree and lodge it with the sheriff in order to find out whether there was a chattel mortgage.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 28 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;28.&mdash;(1)  Whenever a farmer (hereinafter referred to as the intending mortgagor) agrees to make and the Corporation or a recognised bank (hereinafter referred to as the intending mortgagee) agrees to take a chattel mortgage (hereinafter referred to as the proposed chattel mortgage) the intending mortgagor shall furnish to the intending mortgagee a statement in writing stating whether he is or is not then indebted to the Corporation or any recognised bank (hereinafter referred to as the existing creditor) and, if he is so indebted, the name of the existing creditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2567" /> (2)  If in such statement the intending mortgagor states that he is so indebted the intending mortgagee shall send by post to the existing creditor a notice in writing stating the intention of the intending mortgagee to take a chattel mortgage from the intending mortgagor, and if either the intending mortgagee fails so to send such notice or the proposed chattel mortgage is made within seven days after the day on which such notice is so sent the proposed chattel mortgage shall be deemed to be fraudulent and void as against the existing creditor.</P>
    <P>(3)  If a chattel mortgage is made without such statement being furnished by the intending mortgagor to the intending mortgagee and the mortgagor was at the date of such chattel mortgage indebted to the Corporation or a recognised bank such chattel mortgage shall if the intending mortgagor was so indebted to the Corporation and the Corporation is not the mortgagee be deemed to be fraudulent and void as against the Corporation and shall if the intending mortgagor was so indebted to any recognised bank be deemed to be fraudulent and void as against every recognised bank (other than the mortgagee) to which the intending mortgagor was so indebted.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every person who shall make a statement in writing in pursuance of this section which is to his knowledge false or misleading in any material respect shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and be liable on conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding two hundred pounds, or, at the discretion of the court, to penal servitude for three years or imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move that the amendment be agreed to.  This is a long amendment, but its length is largely due to the difficulty of drafting, owing to the fact that we are dealing with banks and the Corporation.  If they were all banks it might be drafted in one section.  It means that if a person applies to the Corporation for a loan and the Corporation propose to take a <Col N="2568" /> chattel mortgage on the applicant's chattels, before executing the mortgage they must find out whether the applicant has a loan or does business with another recognised bank.  If the applicant admits that he is doing business with or has a loan from another bank, the Corporation must acquaint the other bank of its intention to take a chattel mortgage seven days previously. Similarly other banks must acquaint the Corporation.  In other words, it must be mutual.</P>

It was agreed that unless there were power for the Corporation to issue certificates against securities other than mortgages on land the Corporation would be starved.

      <P>This was inserted by a Senator who believed that the words &ldquo;in any company or concern with which the Board proposes to make any contract&rdquo; were not sufficient, and that these words should be added, &ldquo;or any interest in such contract.&rdquo; That is to say, or having any interest, not merely in the company or concern, but in the actual contract.</P>

      <P>Amendment 7.&mdash;Section 12, sub-section (1).  The words and figures &ldquo;31st day of December, 1932&rdquo; deleted in lines 34-35 and the words &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>

      <P>Amendment 9.&mdash;Section 12.  Two new sub-sections added at the end of the section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2577" />&ldquo;(7)  In this section the expression the appointed day' means the 31st day of December, 1932, or such later date as the Minister, after consultation with the Board, may by order made under this section appoint.</P>
    <P>(8)  The Minister may by order made with the consent of the Minister for Finance before the 31st day of December, 1932, appoint such date subsequent to the said 31st day of December, 1932, as with the consent aforesaid he thinks proper to be the appointed day.</P>
    <P>Every order made under this sub-section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if either such House shall, within one month after the first day on which such House sits after such order is laid before it, pass a resolution annulling such order, such order shall be annulled accordingly without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment 10.&mdash;Section 13, sub-section (3).  The words and figures &ldquo;31st day of December, 1932&rdquo; deleted in lines 23-24 and the words &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    <P>Amendment 11.&mdash;Section 15, sub-section (8).  The words and figures &ldquo;31st day of December, 1932&rdquo; deleted in lines 67-68 and the words &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    <P>Amendment 12.&mdash;Section 21, sub-section (1).  The words and figures &ldquo;31st day of December, 1932&rdquo; deleted in lines 49-50 and the words &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    <P>Amendment 13.&mdash;Section 21, sub-section (1).  The words and figures &ldquo;31st day of December, 1932&rdquo; deleted in line 55 and the words &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    <P>Amendment 14.&mdash;Section 21, sub-section (2).  The words and figures &ldquo;31st day of December, 1932&rdquo; deleted in lines 57-58 and the words &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2578" /> Amendment 15.&mdash;Section 21.  A new sub-section added at the end of the section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  In this section the expression &lsquo;the appointed day&rsquo; has the same meaning as it has in Section 12 (which relates to advances from the Central Fund to the Board) of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>All those relate to the same point.  That is, as one of the amendments states, that the words and figures &ldquo;31st December, 1932,&rdquo; be deleted, but in fact the words are reinserted with an allowance for an enlargement of that date.  The words are actually taken out and &ldquo;the appointed day&rdquo; put in, but in amendment 9 the expression &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;the 31st day of December, 1932, or such later date as the Minister, after consultation with the Board, may, by order made under this section, appoint.&rdquo;  The order enlarging the date must come before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and the adverse vote of either House rejects it. So the matter is left on a sliding scale, but the 31st of December, 1932, is kept as the day towards which the Board in the first instance must work.  It has been agreed in the Seanad that that should not be rigidly adhered to.  That amendment was proposed here in a spirit of pessimism which I had to counter; my counter to it was to stick fast to the date.  It was proposed first in that spirit.  Secondly, it was proposed in a way by which no provision was made for a financial adjustment which would be necessary if the date were enlarged.  I thought it necessary that that should be done; the Seanad tried to set out a method for financial adjustment, but the method adopted was found unsuitable.  All this provides is that the date may be enlarged, and that would involve financial adjustment.  It would be met in the ordinary way by a Vote coming before this House and brought up afterwards in the form of a Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in this case, has gone from the hard and fast date discussed by this House in the various amendments.  The appointed <Col N="2579" /> day does not seem, as far as one can gather, from the amendment moved in the Seanad and accepted by the Minister, quite definite.  It may be any day. Why the Minister is accepting so very indefinite a day, when he was so keen on the date 1932, is inexplicable to one who has been present and has taken part in the various discussions on this matter.  Does the Minister fix any definite date as the appointed day in this amendment?</P>

      <P>Amendments 7 to 15, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 16.&mdash;Section 32, sub-section (3).  The sub-section deleted and a new sub-section substituted therefor as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Amendment 17 deals with the old matter of the unauthorised undertaker who becomes a permitted undertaker under the provisions of the legislation being discussed. It was thought in the Seanad that the clause would be strengthened in the direction which I indicated was my own point of view, by the insertion of these words in the amendment.  The words are placed there to strengthen the clause and to state more clearly what the agreement was with regard to the unauthorised undertaker.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>Every other of which shall when received by the former undertaker be paid into its general revenue account in relief of rates.</P>

      <P>Amendment 27.&mdash;Section 56, sub-section (4).  After the word &ldquo;which&rdquo; in line 21 the following words inserted &ldquo;having regard to the items of cost included in the comparative rate of charge for a supply of electricity in bulk.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is of considerable importance.  It refers to the cost of generation, as dealt with in Section 56.  In sub-section (4) of that section &ldquo;cost of generation&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;all costs incurred by an undertaker which ought properly to be allocated to those parts of his undertaking engaged in the production of electricity,&rdquo; including various things.  The <Col N="2583" /> portion of the sub-section I have just read is to be amended and enlarged by the insertion of the words indicated in the amendment before the House.  The first portion of that sub-section would, therefore, read: &ldquo;In this section the expression &lsquo;cost of generation&rsquo; means all costs incurred by an undertaker which, having regard to the items of cost included in the comparative rate of charge for a supply of electricity in bulk, ought properly to be allocated ....&rdquo;  It was decided in the Seanad that, in making a comparison between bulk supply cost and cost of generation locally, care should be taken that the items taken into account in arriving at one cost should be the items taken into consideration when estimating the cost in the other case.  A special provision follows the quotation I have made from the sub-section that in the case of the authorised undertaker's generation cost certain items are to be included.  The effect of the amendment is to insist that, in deciding on the cost, regard is to be had to the items of cost included in the comparative rate charged for supply in bulk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean that it is laid down that the same items should be included in both calculations? When the Bill was before the House, there was an amendment in my name dealing with the items which would be covered as forming the cost of generation at a station taken over. How does the present provision clear up the items of comparison as between the two?  Obviously, the comparison must be at a certain point&mdash;that is, the point of the authorised undertaking that is going to be taken over.  In connection with the rate that is going to be charged from the Shannon, the comparable rate will be the rate at the point at which the generation took place before.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  A later portion of the sub-section which is not being changed deals, I think, with that point.  We are leaving that.  Sub-section (4) simply said previously that &ldquo;cost of generation&rdquo; means all costs incurred by an undertaker which ought properly to be allocated to those parts <Col N="2584" /> of his undertaking engaged in the production of electricity.  Then there are two points specially referred to&mdash;&ldquo;including (in the case of an undertaker who brings electricity from the generating station of such undertaker to a central station, for distribution therefrom to consumers, the costs (if any) incurred by such undertaker in bringing such electricity to such central station.&rdquo;  That still remains.  If it were Shannon power, as opposed to the locally-generated Dublin power, there would be added on to the bulk supply cost the cost of bringing that bulk supply to the point at which it would be distributed.  That still remains. There is the exception that there is not to be included any capital charges which remain to be borne by an undertaker after taking a supply of electricity in bulk under the provisions of the section.  That exception still holds. Making an exception of these two points&mdash;that in locally-generating cost there should not be included capital charges which remain to be borne after taking a supply of electricity in bulk, and that to the bulk supply cost there is to be added the cost of bringing the bulk supply to the point at which it will be centrally distributed by the local undertaker&mdash;the amendment simply makes it clear that, otherwise, the two charges are to be pretty well built up of the same items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital charges would be eliminated in connection with the undertaking altogether when the Shannon scheme would be accounted for by compensation.  The actual fact will be that the Shannon power will be delivered at the point of distribution of the original undertaker whose undertaking has been taken over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making one mistake.  There is no question of compensation on this amendment. It does not deal with acquisition. It deals with the supply of electricity by the Board.  It is only a matter of setting bulk supply prices against the generating station cost. The capital charges to which I have referred cannot be taken into account. That was always provided for in the <Col N="2585" /> sub-section, and it remains.  There is the extra cost imposed on bulk supply of bringing the bulk supply from the outskirts of the particular city to the point at which it will be distributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is borne by the Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That forms an item special to the Board's selling price for bulk supply.  Outside these two items, the amendment simply insists that the comparison shall be of identical items.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 28.&mdash;Section 59, sub-section (1).  All from and including the words &ldquo;The Board&rdquo; in line 50 down to the end of the sub-section deleted.</P>
      <P>Amendment 29:&mdash;Section 59, sub-section (2).  Before sub-section (2) a new sub-section inserted, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Board in making scales fixing the methods of charge and rates of charge for electricity supplied to consumers in a district served by a transformer station which is co-terminous with or includes an area which was previously the area of supply of an authorised undertaker whose undertaking has been acquired by the Board under this Act shall not include any charge in respect of liabilities assumed or payments made by the Board in consequence of the acquisition by the Board under this Act of an undertaking in a district served by any other transformer station.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment 28 is a deleting provision.  All except the first paragraph of Section 59 (1) disappears. Amendment 29 then inserts instead of the second paragraph what is on the paper as sub-section (2).  The original sub-section (1) is broken up into two sub-sections.  The first is the first paragraph of sub-section (1) as it is.  The second will be the substitution for the deleted portion of sub-section (1).  The difference between the deleted portion and what it is proposed to insert is that previously the second part of that sub-section was designed to allay the fear that cost from an area other than a particular acquired area <Col N="2586" /> might have to be borne by the consumers in that acquired area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prohibition of that was set out in terms, the section being amended, I think, at the end of the Report Stage, by the insertion of certain words.  And those certain words were, on examination, found to make absolute nonsense of the second portion of the paragraph. So, consequently, merely as a matter of redrafting that paragraph, some improvement had to be made in it.  In addition there are changes, and the main change is that previously what was spoken of as an area&mdash;that is, the area of supply of an authorised undertaker&mdash;is now spoken of as the district served by the transformer station.  It should be recognised that the transformer station area can, and in the case of Dublin will, include several areas which were previously the areas of individual authorised undertakers. I have spoken of this before, and said that as a matter of general amalgamation and consolidation the keeping independent and apart of Pembroke, Rathmines and Dublin, and keeping all these present consumers apart from additional consumers in the three areas, and keeping even those further apart from the new consumers in the additional area to be served by the Dublin transformer station, was an objectionable feature of the section, and I said that I would try to have an amendment which would put an end to it. This is the amendment by which, when Dublin, Pembroke and Rathmines are acquired, the area about which charges would be made would be the district served by the transformer station.  I put before the Seanad the result of 59 (1) as it stood and I phrased it in this way that the Board would have to have separate charges for the present Dublin consumers, separate charges for the present Pembroke consumers, and separate charges for the present Rathmines consumers; and three further separate charges for the new consumers in the present area of the Dublin area of supply; for the new districts in the present area of Pembroke and the new districts in the present area of Rathmines. They should have a seventh charge for the consumers in the area outside of Dublin, Pembroke and Rathmines <Col N="2587" /> which would be served by the transformer station.</P>
    <P>Under this all these people can have the same charges imposed upon them. The people who are likely to lose by this are the new consumers in the area to be served by the transformer station in the area outside Dublin, Pembroke and Rathmines, which will be served by the transformer station; because they can have a network for themselves at much less cost.  They will have to pay a certain part of the cost not merely of their own network but the cost of the acquisition of the network of the other three places.</P>

      <P>Yes, in the Dublin area at present there are varying rates, and so in the bigger area there will be varying charges.  All that is now entailed is that heretofore the Dublin people, with their varying rates, had only to bear whatever liability was assumed by Dublin, and the Rathmines people had to bear whatever liability was assumed by the taking over of Rathmines, and the Pembroke people had to bear whatever liability would be assumed by the taking over of the Pembroke undertaking.  In the future it will be possible to have the actual cost of the whole taken together, and assumed as a single liability to be borne by the consumer in the whole Dublin area.  That is the proposal in amendment 29, which is substituted for the second portion of Section 59 (1).</P>

      <P>There are varying charges.  There is a system in Dublin by which one can pay a certain fixed unit rate for power and lighting, or one can choose to pay a certain percentage of one's valuation, plus a lesser rate per unit.  All the Board will have to see will be that the liability which we have assumed by the taking over of Dublin, Rathmines and Pembroke and the building of a new network in the area surrounding it, is met.  They will have to recoup themselves for a certain number of years, having made up their minds how best to get it.  That is one device to get increased consumption. They may say: &ldquo;We will charge the old unit rate,&rdquo; or they may say: &ldquo;We will make it a certain per centage of the valuation plus a lesser unit charge. That is likely to give us a bigger consumption.&rdquo; That is to say, the lesser unit charge plus a per centage of the valuation of the house.  That type of variation will still remain.</P>

      <P>We do not always agree.  We have different constituencies. This is a very far-reaching thing, and if it were carried to its logical conclusion it would mean not only dealing with the transformer area but with the whole country.  In other words, this is practically a flat rate. Now, obviously, the Minister means, by variations in the rates, variations in the conditions under which the consumer takes his current, justifying him in variations of the rates as compared with his neighbour.  Practically what it amounts to, as far as I understand, is that the transformer station and the transformer area now in Dublin will be taking in Dublin city as it has been developed, and Pembroke and Rathmines and the undeveloped areas outside. There will be a certain amount of injustice applied there, because we have contended that the people of Dublin, who have been responsible in the past for the building up of the Dublin station should not be deprived of the results of their work.  Practically it amounts to this: that in the future outside areas that have not been developed at all will be developed.  I think the Minister means that the expenses of the extension of the facilities in connection with the distribution of electricity will apply to the undeveloped areas in the same way as it applies to the developed districts.  In other words, the undeveloped districts will not pay anything for developing their districts in the price they are to be charged.</P>

If that area is developed and if cables are laid for serving the district, will the consumers still be charged exactly the same rate as Dublin or will there be a different rate, because of extensions, wiring, cables and all the other necessary things that will be involved? I am not prepared to controvert the argument if it were used, but if it applies in that case it would apply equally to the whole of the country. The same argument can be used in connection with the development of rural and urban districts throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so, but the President seems to neglect to appreciate that development under the Bill is not going to be a matter for the city or for the local authorities, but for the Board.  So far as constituencies are concerned, the privilege of serving that particular constituency departs from the city member altogether and becomes a matter for a Board which is non-political as far as the Minister for Industry and Commerce is able to make it non-political.  Therefore the interests of that district are rather the interests of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Board's day has not come yet, and possibly neither has Deputy Hewat's.  The Deputy as representing Chapelizod, has failed to do his duty by Chapelizod.  If he only knew it, he is doing Chapelizod a great wrong.  In future Chapelizod will pay not only for its own network but for part of the cost of the very efficient and extravagant network of Dublin.  If Chapelizod were to be segregated as a new area and fed on its own, and its costs were to be apportioned only to the cost of building, wiring and constructing a network in that area, the residents there would get electricity fractionally cheaper.  It would be an area in which the network could be constructed more cheaply.  The Dublin <Col N="2591" /> network is an extravagant one, beyond the needs of the people, but it is an extremely safe network and there it has a distinct advantage.  If there were a network constructed at Chapelizod it could be built much more cheaply than what is proposed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>What is extravagant in the Dublin network?  Is it that the underground mains were extravagantly constructed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one part of it, and then there is the particularly solid way in which the mains were constructed. Works were constructed in a very expensive way at the beginning, and the maintenance charges remain. As regards Chapelizod, I mean there could be constructed an entirely efficient network, but there need not be so much money put into it.  Of course, as regards the Dublin network, the view was once held that the different constructions should be of a particular type; but that view has gone.  Chapelizod could have a network, and a good network, at a cheaper rate than what was constructed in Dublin.  I used the word extravagant in relation to what might now be done corresponding with the needs of the people.  I did not mean to say that money was deliberately thrown away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has merely to consider the map of the Dublin area and see where the Pembroke system runs into the heart of the Dublin system.  One can easily visualise the anomalous and peculiar position that arises.  One will see that there is no case for keeping the areas separate.  Take the case of Ringsend. The mains for Dublin pass through Ringsend, and yet Ringsend cannot be fed from those mains; it must be fed from Pembroke.  If there were established a tramway system on the basis of the administration areas in Dublin, one would have to get off the Dublin trams the moment one gets across the Rathmines boundary, and one would then proceed to take a Rathmines tram. Similarly at Ringsend, one would have to change into a Pembroke tram.  That would mean three different sets of trams.  There are a whole lot of considerations like that with which one <Col N="2592" /> could deal.  There is one factory established here, and it is so situated that it gets two currents, one an alternating current and the other a direct current. By doing away with separate areas that type of absurdity will disappear. The consumer who is going to benefit by this arrangement will be, first, the Dublin consumer, and, secondly, the Pembroke consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this satisfaction for Dublin consumers. When those mains were laid down 24 or 25 years ago, the loans in respect of the work were arranged to extend over a period of 35 or 40 years.  The least part of those loans has now to be paid. The work was done at a time when the cost was not by any means as high as it is now.  It was work well done at that time.  It was work which, if done now, would be pretty expensive; that is, the work done to-day would be much more expensive than the work done at that time.  These advantages will be very much appreciated in a short time by the citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had no opportunity of considering these amendments, or even of comparing them with the Bill.  We only saw them when we came into the Dáil at 5 o'clock.  I have not the Bill with me, because I did not know that it would be up for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has not a copy of the Bill with him, that is not my fault, but even walking into the Dáil at 5 o'clock one can see that amendment 27 has relation to Section 56 and amendment 29 has relation to Section 59.  Any ordinary business man could see that the two sections have different meanings and that there <Col N="2596" /> is nothing in common between them.  We have passed 27, dealing with the bulk supply offered by the Board to an undertaking that is going to remain and to distribute itself.  We discussed that, and then we came to this other section, which deals with the Board's power to fix methods of charge and rates of charge for electricity, and that may happen in a variety of circumstances. It may be that the Board will settle the charges for electricity to an authorised undertaker still remaining an authorised undertaker, or it may mean that the Board, having acquired the authorised undertaking, will set out to make scales in that particular area.  The second portion of the section which dealt with that, after saying that the Board has power to make rates and to fix scales, went on to say mainly this, that each area should bear its own liability.  In the change made by the Seanad that area has been enlarged from the area previously served by an authorised undertaking to districts served by a transformer station.  Applied to a concrete case, that means that if all the areas around Dublin were to be taken over, as the section stood it would have been necessary for the Board to keep seven distinct rates &mdash;the present consumers in the three areas, new consumers in these three areas and the rate of charge for whatever new consumers were added outside the area of Dublin, Pembroke and Rathmines.  Under this amendment the Board will have power to strike a rate over the whole area served by the transformer station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite clear. The Minister is really emphasising the very considerable change that has taken place owing to the amendment made in the Seanad.  In other words, as the Bill went through this House it dealt with each authorised undertaker separately.  The amendment from the Seanad gives the Board power, and practically makes an order that, no matter how many authorised undertakers there may be in the district conforming to the district practice, the whole area is to be thrown into one flat rate.  The main objection to that is that there is no right to do any such thing in connection with an authorised <Col N="2597" /> undertaker.  For instance, take the area of Dublin and throw that into one until such time as legislation comes about for the amalgamation of the city and townships.  Until then I maintain that authorised undertakers are individual units and can manage their own affairs within the ambit of the Bill.  This amendment is so far-reaching that it anticipates legislation for the amalgamation of the townships.  It says the whole transformer area is to be put on the basis of a flat rate scale. If that principle is applied to different authorised undertakers in the Dublin district, why has the Bill given authority to the various authorised undertakings to carry on the work until such time as they are taken over by the Board?  Then the Board becomes supreme and does what it likes, practically.  The amendment makes a very considerable alteration in the whole aspect of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am precluded from explaining anything to a Deputy who has not got the material in his hands.  To say that all the guarantees are gone is nonsense.  The whole argument put up here was that Dublin was to be made pay for unremunerative undertakings down the country.  I was discussing this when Deputy Thrift called attention to the matter and elevated three points for further consideration. I said that I had no feeling in favour of keeping apart Dublin and the two townships, nor would I have any feeling in favour of keeping <Col N="2598" /> separate and apart some undertaking down the country, the present consumers in that area and outside consumers who might be added in the wider area, and I held there would be no injustice in that type of amalgamation. That type of amalgamation is proposed by the Greater Dublin Commission, and that type of amalgamation, if effected here, will decrease the charge for all consumers.  The only person I believe who will have a right to complain under this is a future consumer, in Chapelizod or some outlying district, who can say definitely that he is being mulcted to pay for the heavy costs of the areas acquired.</P>

      <P>Amendment 30.&mdash;Section 59, sub-section (5).  Before sub-section (5) two new sub-sections inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  Every scale made by the Board fixing the methods of charge and the rates of charge for electricity by a local authority which is an authorised undertaker shall be made and from time to time revised by the Board so that, as far as is reasonably practicable, no contribution from any rate made by such local authority will be required for the purpose of defraying any expenses which such local authority may incur whether under this Act or otherwise in respect of the authorised undertaking of such local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6)  The Board shall not make any scale fixing the methods of charge and the rates of charge for electricity by a local authority which is an authorised undertaker whereby the charge for electricity used by such local authority for lighting purposes shall be fixed at a rate which is higher than the rate fixed for consumers <Col N="2599" /> using electricity for lighting purposes and for the like hours of supply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>31.&mdash;Section 61, sub-section (3). After the word &ldquo;Board&rdquo; in line 22 the following words inserted &ldquo;which expense shall be taken into consideration in fixing the rates of charge for electricity for all areas for the benefit of which such generating station is maintained.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move that the amendment be agreed to.  This is a different matter.  It was referred to in the Dáil, and I made a certain statement with regard to it.  That was adverted to in the Seanad, but, arising out of the amendment, a different point emerged.  If a station is taken over in the area, and is ordered by the Board to be closed, wholly or partly, and if some portion, or the whole of it, is retained by the Board, then it has to be retained at the expense of the Board.  This further addition is made, &ldquo;which expenses shall be taken into consideration in fixing the rates of charge for electricity for all areas for the benefit of which such generating station is maintained.&rdquo;  Let me come back to Dublin.  If the Dublin station were taken over with all its liabilities and the Board thereafter decided that it was to be used as a stand-by, the cost of maintaining the station would be spread, not over the Dublin consumers or over Dublin, Pembroke and Rathmines, but over every consumer in all the areas for which that station remained a stand-by.</P>

      <P>Of course we agree that that is satisfactory, and is only to be expected.  If the Dublin station was closed down it would be one thing, but if it is maintained and made available for use in the future that would be another question.  This is, I suppose, the last time I shall have an opportunity of commenting on this matter.  The Dublin station is a very valuable one, and whatever excuse or argument can be used against the city being compensated for its property, if the station ceases to exist or practically <Col N="2600" /> becomes scrap, there is another very serious consideration which has not been taken into account.  If the station is maintained and is found to be a valuable asset, then the Board has got that valuable asset for nothing.  While I congratulate the Minister on going as far as he had gone, although it is only a little in that direction, still it could not be maintained that Dublin citizens should maintain a station that was taken over as scrap.</P>

      <P>43.  New section.  Before Section 96 a new section inserted as follows:</P>
      <P>96.  The Shannon works (including any portion thereof separately handed over to the Board by the Minister under this Act), shall, while in the exclusive possession and control of the Board, be exempt from assessment for poor rate and also from assessment for any other rate made by a local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the amendment be agreed to.  This is an important new amendment.  The question as to the liability of the Shannon works and of the property handed over to the Board for income tax and for rating was a matter about which there was some doubt.  It is now clear that income tax will have to be paid by the Board until a Finance Act amends that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position as it is under the law is clear.  The Board will have to pay income tax on its property as well as Schedule A tax and profits tax.  This amendment is designed to put it beyond all doubt that the Shannon works handed over to the Board by the Minister &ldquo;shall, while in the exclusive possession and control of the Board, be exempt from assessment for poor rate and also from assessment for any other rate made by a local authority.&rdquo;  The amendment is putting the Board, in relation to the Shannon works, in the position as an authorised undertaking under municipal control.  The Board is set up to give a service, to give it without profit, and to give it to the whole community, and it is submitted that the Board, in regard to an aggregation <Col N="2603" /> of municipalities, will be in the same position as any municipal undertaking is in relation to its own ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of municipal undertakings, the municipalities get the benefit of the generating stations, and to charge them with rates would presumably be taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another; but can the same argument be applied to the whole question of taxation? Let us take the case of Government property.  In the past, I think, it was not subject to rating, but occasionally grants were made in lieu of rates.  I think that was the underlying principle of taxation in the past.  I am not a very good authority on local government, but I think I am right in stating that.  This is an undertaking which the Minister says is for the benefit of all.  The Minister has argued consistently right through the Bill that the ratepayers and the consumers were not one and the same persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, what is the Minister's argument in this case in favour of this amendment?  It simply means that he is going to charge the non-consumer a rate for something that he is getting no benefit for.  Taking the works as a whole, distributed over the whole country, why should they be exempt from rates?  I cannot follow the logic of this at all.  I can see why a local authority, confined within its own area, could argue that there was no use in making a transfer entry of a sum of money in favour of the local rates from its own electricity undertaking.  That argument, however, cannot be applied to this scheme in any sense, because a big portion of the country, at its inception at any rate, will not even be served with electricity. In the case of a district in which the service is maintained, a district through which the transmission lines pass, and in which valuable way-leaves may be taken, why should not the local authority be paid rates in respect of all this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to <Col N="2604" /> make it clear to the Deputy that my words were carefully chosen when I made the statement to which he refers. I said that I submitted to the House that it was reasonable that the Board, in relation to an aggregation of municipalities, should be in exactly the same position as a municipal undertaking now is in relation to its own ratepayers. That is not the consumer, and I am not speaking of the consumer.  The Dublin electricity undertaking at the moment does not not pay rates, although the electricity consumers and the ratepayers are distinct persons. There are about 15,000 electricity consumers and about 50,000 ratepayers. That situation holds, and I am simply carrying out that situation in regard to an aggregation of municipalities all over the country that is to be served by the Board.</P>

      <P>In common with Deputy Hewat, I, too, must take strong exception to this amendment. It is of particular significance to my constituency, because the Shannon works are situate there.  I see no reason why this wealthy Corporation should <Col N="2605" /> not pay rates the same as anybody else &mdash;the same, say, as a small co-operative store in the neighbourhood.  There is a bad principle enshrined in this amendment, and I ask will the cost be so prohibitive to this Corporation as to render it desirable that we should assent to the proposition that the Shannon works should not pay poor rate.  I fail to see how that proposition can be maintained.  I did not realise that this amendment would be taken this evening, and therefore had no opportunity of looking up some figures.  I am just wondering what the valuation, say, would be on the power house.  Would it be £1,000?  I rather think that it will be a very big sum.  I should think, at all events, that the valuation on it would be as big as the valuation on some of our very large drapery concerns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take it that the valuation is only £2,000, will <Col N="2606" /> the amount of rates to be paid be so large that we ought to enshrine this objectionable principle in the amendment. I do not think so, and further, I think it is an injustice to the County Clare that the Shannon works should not have poor rate levied on them just as any other building in the county has. That is not the only objectionable feature, because, as a result of this scheme, the valuation of the county is going to be reduced, not perhaps to a very large extent, but at any rate appreciably.  Deputies are aware that quite a considerable area of land is being permanently taken over in connection with the Shannon works.  It may be 500 acres or more.  I have not the figures by me and cannot give the exact figure, but assuming that the area of land taken over is 500 acres the valuation on that land would be £500 or £600, because some of that land was highly valued.  The county, therefore, is going to lose the benefit of the rates from all that land if the House assents to this proposal.  So far from getting any increased revenue from these buildings the county is going to lose the amount of rates paid on what was formerly agricultural land.  It may be said that the sum involved is only a few hundred pounds, but in a poor county like Clare that is something that the local authorities cannot afford to ignore.  I see no reason why, under this amendment, the Government should depart from the principle of making ex gratia payments in lieu of rates.</P>

At all events, on the rates question there is no justification, in my opinion, for setting up a precedent whereby a system that is going to supply portion of the people of the country&mdash;it may be a big portion or otherwise&mdash;but even on the Minister's own admission it will only supply portion of the people&mdash;is allowed to go through all districts, erect transmission lines, flood lands, and erect buildings, and yet pay nothing to local rates in the way that any local undertaking of the same sort would be called upon to pay.  It may be said that an ex-gratia payment may be paid by the Board.  I do not know whether it will or not.  If a payment is made, well and good, but I think the principle of the amendment is unsound.</P>

Bardolph at any rate was a concrete human being, but Deputy O'Connor Hogan has only the assurance, or rather he has the Minister's lack of assurance, which is unusual, and the guarantee of a hypothetical Board that has yet to come into being.  What is the reality of the situation?  I am not so concerned with the transmission system, but I am concerned with the Shannon works, comprising all the buildings for the generation of electricity, together with all the lands and premises acquired by the Minister, under this Bill, as set out in Section 1. Can it be doubted that these works are not going to place some burden on the local ratepayers?  The Siemens-Schuckert Company have, in the execution of these works, acquired lands and erected buildings which, under this proposed amendment, will be exempt from rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is breaking the law, because I saw no provision of this kind in the original Shannon Electricity Bill, but in any case we should not validate and legalise a wrong procedure because the men living in huts who are employed on these works are not exempt from illness or from accidents.  They are liable to become a charge on the County Board of Health.  In addition, the roads leading to the works are under a very much heavier burden of traffic than they would otherwise be.  The ratepayers have to pay for that.  The local authorities have to pay and also to meet certain charges for drainage, lighting, etc., and these charges will almost inevitably continue.  It may be that the system of huts and barracks will be gradually discontinued and the people who are employed on this work will obtain lodgings in the district. Even if that is so, the individuals letting them lodgings will benefit, but the ratepayers as a whole, the small farmers, will not derive any great benefit from having these works in the neighbourhood.  Therefore it is equitable and reasonable to ask that the Shannon Electricity Works should, like every other industry, be liable for the normal burden of rates.  We do not, when a tobacco firm or a boot factory establishes itself in our midst exempt it from rates for a number of years to encourage it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the ratepayers derive benefit from its operations and the money is taken out of one pocket and put into another pocket, but the Minister is going to take money out of the pocket of the small farmer who will use electricity to a very limited extent and put it into the pocket of the big consumer.  It may be the only way that we can develop this country industrially, but I have my doubts.  I think it would be much wiser to have approached the matter with more deliberation and to reconcile the small farmer.  The Minister has his eye all the time fixed on the electricity consumer, and is ignoring the ratepayer and every other interest&mdash;the ratepayer and the people who navigate the Shannon&mdash;in the interests of the electricity consumer.  I admire his single-minded purpose, but though I do not often hanker for a speech from the Minister for Local Government I must say that I would like to be told what he thinks in regard to this particular amendment.  It seems to me one of the occasions on which the swan song of an extern Minister might be heard. The Minister for Local Government might have said what the effect on local authorities would be if this amendment is passed.  I am sure that it is unpopular with local authorities, but they are not my local authorities. In the absence of Deputies from the neighbourhood of the Shannon, with the exception of Deputy Hogan, I do not know that it is for me to challenge a division, but if a division is challenged by Deputy Connor Hogan I shall vote with him.</P>

      <P>I want to make the position quite clear.  The Shannon works at the moment are being carried out for the Government and are therefore exempt from rates.  They are just as much exempt as any new building which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would erect.  When Deputy Cooper gets dithyrambic about validating <Col N="2611" /> something that was wrong I wonder will he urge the same thing when the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs puts up a new telephone exchange or post office and applies to have it exempt from rates.  It automatically applies.</P>

      <P>The Shannon works are being built by a big percentage of local labour.  Deputy Connor Hogan is annoyed when he sees something taken from Clare in the form of lands used for agricultural purposes.  That is the very reason why Government property pays bounty in lieu of rates.  That there is a recognition of the fact that something has to be paid to make up for the deprivation of a local authority for land they occupy.  That is done by ex-gratia payment, and it can be done here in the same way.  Just as any Government building, just as a municipal undertaking which is an authorised undertaking, is exempt from rates, so the Shannon works ought to be exempt for the same reason, namely, that there is a benefit.  Of course, there is a tremendous and continuing benefit to Clare and Limerick arising out of these works.  Deputy Cooper has gone to the other side and says that heavy traffic is tearing the roads to pieces. The Deputy talked of the extra strain on roads just as if the extra traffic was carried backwards and forwards and no one gets the benefit.  Surely there is considerable benefit in the regions adjacent to the works as a counter to the heavy traffic.  The roads are not torn up without a certain profit to the district.</P>

Deputy Cooper talks about establishing an evil precedent.  This is not an evil precedent.  The precedent is there, but the Deputy tries to make a distinction of the factory.  Obviously Government buildings and local undertakings <Col N="2612" /> are exempt, and for the same reason it is proposed to exempt these works, namely that they are not profit-making concerns.  One need not take Deputy Hewat's example of the railways. The circumstances are not the same, as railways pay dividends.</P>

      <P>Amendments put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 104.  The section deleted and the following new section substituted therefor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>104.&mdash;(1) The Executive Council may by order transfer from the Minister or the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland (in this section referred to as the Commissioners) respectively to the Board all or any of the functions, powers, and duties conferred or imposed by or under any statute on the Minister or the Commissioners (as the case may be) in relation to the care or conservancy of the navigation or the drainage of the River Shannon or any tributary thereof or of works constructed for the improvement of such navigation or drainage, and any such order may transfer all or any of such functions, powers, and duties in relation either to the whole or to any particular parts or part of the said river or any tributary thereof.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where by reason of the existence of the Shannon works it is impracticable for the Commissioners to exercise the functions and powers or perform the duties conferred or imposed on them by any such statute as aforesaid in accordance with the provisions of such statute the Commissioners shall exercise such functions and powers and perform such duties as nearly as may be practicable, having regard to the existence of the said works, in accordance with the provisions of such statute, and upon an order being made by the Executive Council under this section transferring all or any of such functions, powers and duties to the Board, the Board shall exercise the functions and powers and perform the duties to which such order relates as nearly as may be practicable, having regard to the existence of the said works, in accordance with the provisions of such statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2615" /> (3)  Whenever any functions. powers, or duties are transferred to the Board by an order under this section the Executive Council may by the same or any subsequent order authorise and require the Board to exercise and perform all or any of such functions, powers, and duties in relation to all or any of the canals, locks, wharves, piers, landing places, quays, or other works constructed by the Minister under the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925 (No. 26 of 1925), and upon such order being made the works to which such order relates shall be deemed to be included in the works in relation to which such functions, powers, and duties are exercisable by virtue of the statute by which the same were created and such statute (with such modifications, if any, as are specified in such order) shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>(4)  Whenever any functions, powers, or duties are transferred from the Commissioners to the Board by an order under this section the Executive Council may by the same or any subsequent order transfer to and vest in the Board all or any of the locks, lock-houses, eel-weirs, or other property which immediately before the date of such order were vested in the Commissioners and were used by them either for the purpose of or in connection with the exercise or performance of the functions, powers, or duties so transferred or for the purpose of providing revenue for the exercise or performance of such functions, powers, or duties.</P>
    <P>(5)  Whenever any functions, powers, or duties are transferred from the Commissioners to the Board by an order under this section the Executive Council may by the same or any subsequent order transfer from the service of the Commissioners to the service of the Board any person employed by the Commissioners in relation to or for the purpose of the exercise or performance of such functions, powers, or duties, and every person so transferred shall thereupon become and be a servant <Col N="2616" /> of the Board upon the same terms as to remuneration and superannuation, pension or gratuity (if any) as those on which he was employed by the Commissioners immediately before such transfer and shall for the purpose of such superannuation, pension or gratuity (if any) be entitled to reckon his period of service with the Commissioners as service with the Board.</P>
    <P>(6)  Whenever any functions, powers, or duties are transferred from the Commissioners to the Board by an order under this section the Executive Council may by the same or any subsequent order impose on the Board the obligation to pay as from the date of such order any pension which at the date of such order is payable by the Commissioners to a person formerly employed by the Commissioners in relation to or for the purpose of the exercise or performance of such functions, powers, and duties, and thereupon the Board shall become and be liable to indemnify the Commissioners against all and every liability in respect of such pension as from the date of such order.</P>
    <P>(7)  An order made by the Executive Council under this section transferring any functions, powers or duties from the Commissioners to the Board may be expressed and if so expressed shall operate to require the Board to keep a separate account in relation to the exercise by it of the functions and powers and the performance by it of the duties to which such order relates and may be expressed and if so expressed shall operate to require that the functions, powers and duties to which such order relates be exercised and performed by officers and servants of the Board employed by it solely in relation to such functions, powers and duties.</P>
    <P>(8)  No order made under this section shall come into operation until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been approved by resolution of each such House.</P>

      <P>I move that the amendment be agreed to.  This is a <Col N="2617" /> long amendment, but the changes made are not very big additions to what was previously in the Bill.  Sub-section (1) is very much the same as what was previously in the Bill.  Sub-section (2) is to the effect that where, owing to the existence of the Shannon works, it is impracticable for the Commissioners to exercise certain functions, they shall exercise them so far as practicable. Sub-section (3) is practically the same as the old sub-section.  Sub-section (4) is to the effect that not merely are functions and duties to be assigned but also the property of the Commissioners of Public Works.  Sub-sections (5) and (6) refer to the transfer of the staff and continues their existing rights as to pensions, emoluments, and everything else.  Sub-section (7) indicates that any order made by the Executive Council in regard to the transfer of functions may be expressed and, if so expressed, shall operate to require the Board to keep a separate account of the property which previously belonged to the Commissioners.  The last sub-section provides that no order made under the section transferring the property can become operative until approved by positive resolution of both Houses.</P>

      <P>This amendment alters the Bill and, so far as this House is concerned, deletes Section 104 altogether.  At this stage one could hardly criticise the alteration made by the Senate after full discussion.  No doubt, the amendment improves the section, but, clearly in this matter, we are legislating before our time, before there is any need to legislate, and we are making provision for the care and navigation of the river on the basis of the Minister's claim that everything must be subservient to the Board in connection with the generation of electricity. How far-reaching that dictum may be it is hard, at present, to say, but there can be very little doubt that it is far-reaching, and the Minister, in deciding to force through such legislation regarding the navigation of the Shannon under the new order of things, is doing something which, I contend, is neither justified nor necessary.  In so far as the amendment is considered by <Col N="2618" /> the other House to be an improvement on Section 104, in my judgment the responsibility for the section ought to rest with the Minister, and I do not agree with the section, either as it stands, or with the form in which it is proposed to be amended.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 47.&mdash;Section 105, sub-section (2).  Before sub-section (2) a new sub-section inserted, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Where as a result of an order made by the Minister under the foregoing sub-section prohibiting navigation in or upon the River Shannon or any particular part thereof any water right, fishing right, or other right existing in respect of the River Shannon or the part thereof to which such order relates is terminated, restricted or otherwise interfered with, the termination, restriction or interference of such water right, fishing right or other right shall for the purposes of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925 (No. 26 of 1925) be deemed to be authorised by that Act and the said Act shall apply accordingly.</P>
      <P>48.  Section 105, sub-section (2). The word &ldquo;any&rdquo; deleted in line 62 and the words &ldquo;such limited&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
      <P>49.  Section 105, sub-section (2). The words &ldquo;as may be required by the Board for the purposes aforesaid&rdquo; added at the end of the sub-section.</P>

      <P>Amendments 47, 48 and 49 go together.  It was pointed out that Section 105, which takes power to prohibit navigation on the Shannon, for certain purposes, might have given the Minister powers larger than what was necessary, and three changes had to be made.  The first is simply to secure, as was always understood, that where as a result of an order prohibiting navigation on the Shannon any water right, fishing right, or other right is terminated, restricted, or otherwise interfered with, the termination, restriction or interference shall for the purposes of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925, be deemed to be authorised by <Col N="2619" /> that Act, and the said Act shall apply accordingly.  It means that if there is such prohibition leading to the interference stated here, compensation will be paid.  The other two amendments are to limit the operation of the section somewhat.  Instead of its being for any period of time it is now for such limited period of time specified in that behalf in such order as may be required by the Board for the purposes aforesaid.</P>
      <P>Amendments agreed to.</P>

      <P>The last amendment is to meet the point raised in the Seanad that previously the operative date with regard to determining conditions of service and rates of pay, etc., was the 31st March, 1927.  It was pointed out that certain generating stations might not be closed down for many years after that, and the suggestion was made that the conditions of pay should be stereotyped as on the date of the acquisition order.  As a counter to that it was pointed out that that might be liable to abuse and that an undertaking about to be acquired might raise salaries and improve conditions to stave off acquisition for a certain time.  This, while guarding against abuse, does give the other point <Col N="2621" /> that the conditions shall be those in operation at the date of acquisition.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Seanad has agreed to the Resolution which we sent up to them from the Dáil this evening, and that, therefore, all the necessary formalities in connection with the dissolution are now complete.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to impose unduly on the time of the House at this final stage, but in view of the historical circumstances of our times, it is but just and right that I should briefly review the work of this, the fourth Dáil. This is the concluding stage of the first Dáil which met free from external or internal aggression.  It has had to discharge much more onerous and much more far-reaching business than fell to any of its predecessors.  During its four years' life all the compensation claims of the pre-truce period have been dealt with, and in the case of post-truce claims there remain some 400 cases to be disposed of out of nearly 20,000 cases.</P>
      <P>We have passed through the Oireachtas in the four years of the fourth Dáil 183 Public and 9 Private Acts, and at the conclusion of its existence two Public Bills of major importance have not been finally completed in the Dáil.  Some of the measures absorb a large amount of parliamentary time by reason of their nature&mdash;such as Appropriation Acts&mdash;which follow an examination of the estimates of expenditure over the whole field of public service.  In addition to completing the Currency Bill and the Dentists Bill, the main Appropriation Bill for the year 1927-28 will fall for consideration by the new Dáil on its assembly. It is fair to say that whatever may be the wish of the electorate, these three Bills, or variations of them, must be dealt with by the new Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We finish at this Session much indebted <Col N="2622" /> to the members of the Dáil. We feel a pardonable pride in membership of the fourth Dáil, by reason&mdash; apart from its historical significance&mdash; of its close attention to business, of the very many and generous efforts to improve the Bills introduced; of the courtesy which has been its distinguishing characteristic, and of the minute and careful examination of the Estimates. The work has been for the members of the Dáil exacting, and it would be natural that the strain should have its effect.  During that long and eventful period the Oireachtas has laid the foundation of the State&mdash;it has made a big contribution to the history of its period in the work it has done.</P>
    <P>We have lived in the fourth Dáil from a time fraught with the consciousness of danger to the period in which we have enjoyed the consciousness of peace.  The institutions which the Oireachtas has established have contributed towards easing that difficult situation.  The Dáil has done its work well.  It owes much to the ability, forbearance, tact and goodwill of you, A Chinn Comhairle.  The Dáil has made an advance in parliamentary integrity when it decided that the holder of the office of Ceann Comhairle should be removed from the sphere of political controversy.  That decision implies a remarkable appreciation of the manner in which you, sir, have discharged the duties of your high office; it is an expression of our confidence in your wisdom and judgment.  Indeed, I might say that in the minds of most of us the term Ceann Comhairle and Deputy Micheál O hAodha are synonymous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in my appreciation of the work of the Dáil, and particularly of your own work, A Chinn Comhairle, in the Chair, in charge of the Dáil, and in matters of procedure, in directing the Dáil. I am very confident in the statement that whatever may be said to the credit of the Dáil could only be said by the fact that you have occupied the chair. I think that this is, perhaps, an occasion when we might review, very shortly, the position that we occupy and have occupied.  The President has given certain figures as to the amount of work done.  We are a body of <Col N="2623" /> men and women&mdash;with the assistance of the Seanad&mdash;imposing many millions of taxation on the people, and we have spent it.  For good or ill it is spent. The important feature, I think, that might well be emphasised is that a body of elected persons have been able to meet, have been able to discuss and criticise legislative proposals, and when passed with all their defects, however imperfect, however wrong they may have been in the eyes of the Opposition, those proposals have become law; the fiat goes forth and must be obeyed.</P>
      <P>The fact that we are a legislature, and that the will of the people, as expressed by that legislature, becomes effective in the country is a very important fact.  It throws upon those of us who are in positions of responsibility the obligation of realising how great a privilege we have enjoyed to act in this Chamber as the supreme authority in the nation.  Perhaps in fifty years the people who are writing histories will look back upon this period and say, &ldquo;What a great time it was to have lived in.&rdquo;  We may frequently feel regretful, but, as sometimes we read histories and thrill at the events that took place in the days that are past, people in the future will say that the present time was a great time to have lived in.  The truth is that we are living in a history-making period&mdash; one might say at the beginning of a new epoch.  It is of the most tremendous significance that the law and the government of the people of the country are being fashioned by an elected assembly whose will, once given expression to in statute, is made effective by the courts, and, when necessary, by the powers of the State.  That is a great thing to think of, and once we do think of it we must realise the immense privilege that has been accorded us to take part in this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we all have to pay special tribute to the work that has been done for the Dáil, and even for the individual member of the Dáil, by the staff of the Dáil.  Those of us who have been in more intimate contact with the staff than others by reason of committee work&mdash;who have had an opportunity of looking in at the machine and <Col N="2624" /> seeing how it works&mdash;are able to appreciate the great amount of silent, valuable work that has been done by the staff of the Oireachtas.  I think it is desirable that we of this Parliament &mdash;the first effective Parliament, I think &mdash;should make record of our appreciation of that work.</P>
    <P>We have also made friends here. Some of us will not meet again in the Chamber for a year or two years, but we may meet in other places.  We may have had our friendships and our quarrels, but I think it may be said quite freely and fairly that there has been general good feeling in the House. I think the character of the House is such that we can all look back on the four years as a period of friendliness and fellowship&mdash;acute differences, frequently violent opposition, but, withal, a feeling of camaraderie and goodwill. There is not much more to say, except that we will all do our best for our own sides and we will look forward with interest, and, perhaps, pleasure, to the new faces that will be seen on those benches in a month's time.</P>

      <P>I wish to endorse, and to express my appreciation of, the remarks of the President and Deputy Johnson as to the work that has been done by this Dáil.  I express that appreciation on behalf of my Party and on my own behalf.  As to the remarks made about you, A Chinn Comhairle, we, on these benches, heartily re-echo them.  To do otherwise would be difficult.  Your conduct in the Chair for the past four years was excellence itself.  It was, I am sure, your advice and guidance which engendered the good spirit and good fellowship that obtained outside this Chamber, no matter how warm the debates were inside. I assure you we all appreciate your conduct in the Chair.  On behalf of my Party and on my own behalf, I endorse the remarks made by the President and by Deputy Johnson.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Independents&mdash;a small Party of this House which contributes more than its fair share to the debates&mdash;I want to join in thanking the President for what he has said and in thanking you, A Chinn Comhairle.  The President said that we had laid the foundations of the <Col N="2625" /> State in this Dáil.  I think we have done more.  We have put up the scaffolding and we have designed the architectural plan on which the edifice is to be built.  Whatever builders may come after us will find themselves provided with established precedents and established traditions which were created in this Dáil.  They were created by co-operation.  We came together, most of us strangers, inclined, perhaps, to that most persistent of our national maladies&mdash;suspicion.  I remember the time when the Opposition used to suspect the Government and used to watch very carefully to see that every member of the Government played the game.  In the last two years we have not had occasion to do that. We have learned to know each other, we have learned to respect each other, and, while holding hard to our own peculiar opinions, we have learned to be friends.  That friendship will not die with the Dáil.</P>
      <P>We stand by the side of the tomb of the fourth Dáil and I, for one, cannot speak without emotion at the grave of an assembly where I have passed the four happiest years of my life.  But I do think that the feelings of mutual respect which were born here will not die but will be carried into our public life throughout the country, for the good of the country.  I feel, A Chinn Comhairle, that it is almost impertinent to join in any tribute to you.  I should like to emphasise what Deputy Johnson has said of the debt we owe to the staff of the Dáil, and I should like to pay my peculiar tribute of gratitude and sympathy to those who are called upon to report our debates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like this occasion to pass without associating myself with the statements that have been made.  With the whole of the President's statement I am not quite in agreement, because I think a lot of legislation was introduced which was not really necessary.  I have to say, however, in common with the other Deputies who have spoken, that I, as a plain member of the Dáil, have received the utmost courtesy both from the supporters of the Government and from the different Parties in the House.  In particular, I have received the greatest <Col N="2626" /> consideration from you, A Chinn Comhairle, and from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  As a private member who has endeavoured to do one man's part, I must say that I received the same attention on all sides as if I had the support of a Party.  I sincerely hope that the great majority of the people of Ireland will appreciate the importance of men endeavouring, as legislators, to better the position of the people of this country.  I do not think that this is an opportune time for making a political speech, but it is my view, and the view of the people as a whole, that unity must be brought about and that Irishmen must work hand in hand for the betterment of their country and not devote their time to disputes about words.  I return my sincere thanks to you, A Chinn Comhairle, to the members of the different Parties, and particularly to the staff of the Oireachtas, who have treated me with the utmost courtesy.  On any occasion on which I required their assistance they were always most willing to facilitate me.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concluding the proceedings of the fourth Dáil and some of the remarks I had hoped to make have been anticipated, particularly by Deputy Johnson, I think it is right to say that this is a special occasion.  In time an occasion such as this will become an ordinary occasion, an occasion perhaps for trite sayings and for conventional courtesies; but we here and now find ourselves in a different position.  We have been privileged to take part in the first National Assembly, endowed with full powers, functioning in this country, deriving its power from the people and free to exercise that power, and exercising that power freely, over a full parliamentary period.  In that way the occasion is a special one, and for that reason there has rested upon the members of this Dáil in particular a great responsibility, a greater responsibility than will rest upon members of other Houses in future.  We have been in the position that we had to establish precedents, to make conventions, to create an atmosphere which we hope will be useful in the future.  That responsibility was realised by members and the <Col N="2627" /> restrictions placed upon members by that responsibility were loyally accepted.</P>
      <P>In forming an estimate of an Assembly such as this we must first get a correct standard, and the correct standard is a parliamentary standard.  If we want to judge our proceedings here we must judge them by the proceedings in parliaments generally.  It is sometimes forgotten that one of the main purposes of a parliament is to ensure the fullest-freedom of debate. We have endeavoured to carry out that purpose here, and I think we have succeeded.  I do not need to recall to Deputies instances which will go to prove that the limits of what is known as parliamentary language are very wide indeed.  We have had here vigorous discussions; we have had bitter denunciations; we have also had heated interchanges; but these things, in my judgment, are simply indications of a healthy life, and in spite of them we have had, as has been said already, between the members of a House of different Parties and divergent views extraordinarily good personal relationships. I have noted one thing which is, I think, quite remarkable, and that is that Deputies representing the same constituency but of different Parties appear to be almost always in the utmost harmony.  I have never had to preside over any debate in which members from the same constituency endeavoured to score one off the other. That of itself is, I think, a great tribute to members of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>A tribute has been paid to the staff of the Dáil.  I think on this particular occasion, at any rate, that was a proper thing, and I was very glad to hear it from Deputy Johnson and other Deputies.  Nobody appreciates as much as the Chair the assistance which has been rendered in the working of the Dáil, both before and during meetings, by the staff, who, when we began here, had no experience whatever of parliamentary work.  On their behalf I desire to express thanks for the high compliments which have been paid to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2628" /> Very gracious and very pleasing things have been said about the Chair. On behalf of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on my own behalf, and on behalf of the other Deputies who from time to time have occupied the Chair, I desire to thank Deputies for these expressions. While, however, the Chair and while individuals in the Dáil may help to give a particular character to a House such as this, in the end the character of the House is determined by all its members; it is determined not only by Ministers and by leaders of parties, but also by back benchers who speak but little and even by those back benchers who speak not at all, because they all go to form the public opinion of the House.  To all these and to the co-operation which the Chair has experienced from all these is due the atmosphere that has obtained in the Dáil.  The work of the Chair would have been impossible but for that co-operation which has been loyally given, not only by the leaders of parties in the House, but by every member of the House.</P>
    <P>This Parliament is a new Parliament and this State is only a few years old; but it must not be forgotten that the people from whom we derive our authority represent an ancient nation whose honour and whose high repute it has been our duty and our privilege to maintain.  In the annals of this House, at any rate, I think it will be found that we have done our best to maintain that honour and these high traditions.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas in its wisdom has thought fit to deny me the pleasures of combat at the election.  I have formed, as Deputies have said before me, a considerable number of friendships with different Deputies in the House, and although I am prohibited from politics and political speeches, perhaps I would be allowed to say that if I had the choosing of a new House I would make very little change; I do not know that I would make any change at all.</P>
    <P>With that the business of the Fourth Dáil is now concluded.</P>

      <P>Mr. Thomas McHale originally claimed the sum of £296 1s. 6d. for goods supplied.  The claim was investigated locally by a representative of the Department of Defence, who reported in July, 1924, that a portion of the claim totalling £101 12s. 5d. was in respect of goods supplied to Irregulars. The balance of the claim for goods supplied to the National Forces was discharged on July 22nd, 1924, by a payment of £194 9s.  In August, 1924, Mr. McHale admitted, in writing, that portion of the goods originally claimed for, to the extent of £58 14s., was supplied to Irregulars, but, despite that admission, he subsequently rendered another account for £71 15s. 10d. &mdash;the subject of the present question &mdash;in respect of the balance of his original claim as for goods supplied to the National Army.  The claim in question was not certified by any officer of the National Army, and there are no grounds for its reconsideration.</P>
