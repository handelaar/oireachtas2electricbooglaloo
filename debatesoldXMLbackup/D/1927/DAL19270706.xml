      <P>Usually a Bill of this sort is introduced after a number of complaints have been received in connection with abuses.  Now, whether it is that there is an objection on the part of persons affected to bring under notice those abuses I do not know, but very few complaints have reached the Department of Justice in connection with that matter, and there is a general impression that the present Act is working satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>Discussions have taken place with the Actuary, who has been requested to submit the tentative scheme drawn up by the Minister for Education to a thorough investigation.  The Actuary is now actively engaged upon the examination of that scheme in the light of such information as could be furnished by the education authorities as to the numbers and conditions of service of secondary teachers in the past and the probable effects of the improved conditions by which they have recently benefited.  The Deputy will readily understand that a pension scheme which is intended to cover a class with such varied conditions of service as the secondary teachers must be examined at the outset with the greatest care.  I do not anticipate that I shall be in a position to make a definite statement before the recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GilbertHewson" hpid="Mr. HEWSON Mr. HEWSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, with a view to initiating general economy in the administration cost of Public Services in the Saorstát, the Dáil is of opinion that the allowances and expenses payable to its members should be reduced, and that accordingly steps should be <Col N="470" /> taken to amend the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>Although the Act referred to in my motion is dated 1923, I think the scale of remuneration dates from 1922; to be exact, from the 1st July, 1922, in the case of Deputies.  I find on record that the scale was actually opposed in September, 1922, chiefly on the grounds of the poverty of the country and also upon the grounds that political parties might bear the expenses of their members.  The motion in opposition was seconded and the House was divided upon it.</P>
    <P>I will leave it to this House to decide as to whether the country has grown richer or not since 1922.  If I may go back to 1922 upon another point, I would like to refresh the memories of Deputies as to the conditions that then existed.  We are aware that there was civil war in the country and I think the personal safety of Deputies was then involved.  They functioned at considerable risk and they travelled at considerable inconvenience.  Their accommodation here was not at all of the best and was not at all the most comfortable. Those conditions, I suggest, have changed considerably for the better.  Then there is the further question of the cost of living.  The cost of living, which, I presume, affects Deputies as well as other people, has been considerably reduced.  I hold in my hand various ready reckoners issued from time to time by the Department of Finance.  I see one suggests a decrease in the cost of living bonus of 8/26ths as from from the 1st September, 1922; another, a further decrease as from the 1st September, 1923; and still another decrease as from the 1st March, 1925.  In the current number of a paper published in Upper Merrion Street, &ldquo;The Civil Service Journal,&rdquo; I find the distinct suggestion that another reduction will shortly take place.  That being so, I need not stress the point that the cost of living has reduced since the days when Deputies were content with the present remuneration.  Some of them thought it was too much.</P>
    <P>During the first debate of this session I listened to remarks as to the number of hungry people in this <Col N="471" /> country and as to the condition of some of them in the matter of clothing. It was said they were so badly off that they were prevented from standing in a queue at the employment exchanges, and many had to go early to worship, if they went at all.  Those conditions undoubtedly existed, not only in the cities, but in the country.  We also see our industries closing down except where they are subsidised or protected. We see the agricultural depression. In the present session a Deputy referred to butter touching 8d. per pound.  In my own county eggs were sold at 5d. a dozen this year. The year before last oats went to 7d. per stone and in a neighbouring county I was informed on good authority that oats changed hands at as low a price as 5½d.  Barley was down to 10/- a barrel.</P>
    <P>The year before last beef and mutton only maintained a fraction above the pre-war level, while the expenses of the farmers in most respects are nearly double.  I think the agricultural community generally may be divided into five classes&mdash;(1) those living on savings made during the European War; (2) those living on working capital; (3) those who are living on credit; (4) those who are living on charity and (5) those who are living on air, which fortunately is plentiful.  This being the condition of the country, and that being the measure of the change since 1922, I venture to think that the motion against this scale which was opposed in 1922 to a degree sufficient to divide the House is not altogether out of place to-day.</P>
    <P>I have heard two points of view expressed against reducing the scale of remuneration of Deputies.  One is the point of view of those who think their services are worth more.  Those of us who have read electioneering speeches are familiar with the suggestions from Ministers that they are worth double what they get.  That being so, the rank and file must be excused if they think in similar terms.  But if everyone got his own valuation in this world I think we would need more millionaires working benevolent funds.  The other point of view I am familiar with is that the <Col N="472" /> dignity of a lot of those Deputies demands more than they get.  I believe that is the view taken in rather high quarters.</P>
    <P>I do not go so far as to suggest a scale of reduction to-day, because it is possibly a matter for negotiation, but I do venture to move the motion standing in my name.  I hope that in this House I shall find a seconder, though I am not quite clear on the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>By the leave of the House, I move my amendment as a substantive motion.  It now reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That with a view to amendment of the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act, 1923, the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) (Amendment) Act, 1925, and the Ministers <Col N="473" /> and Secretaries Act, 1924, a Select Committee consisting of eleven Deputies, to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, be appointed to consider and report as to the salaries and allowances that should, in future, be paid to, and the travelling facilities that should, in future, be provided for, members of Dáil Eireann; and that the quorum of the Select Committee be five.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I originally put this down as a motion and subsequently I thought that there might not be sufficient time for it to be reached and that, therefore, it would be better to take it as an amendment.  My object in doing so was precisely the same as the object I had in view when proposing to move an amendment in similar terms to the amendment proposed by Deputy Johnson on Friday last.  I regarded Deputy Johnson's amendment as approaching the subject from a wrong angle.  I similarly regard the proposal made by Deputy Hewson.  With the object that both Deputies have in view I am in entire sympathy.  I believe that the time is opportune for initiating a general policy of retrenchment and economy; but I do not think that it is right that one item, as proposed by Deputy Johnson on Friday, and another item as proposed by Deputy Hewson to-day, should be singled out and made a subject for inquiry or reduction.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal to be said for the point of view expressed by Deputy Hewson.  There is no doubt that the country is passing through a very grave and serious economic crisis. There is no doubt that money is exceedingly short in all Departments of State, and in all phases of the life of the State.  There is no doubt that our adverse trade balance is very large, and that it is, if anything, on the increase. According to our trade statistics the trade of the country is certainly not increasing in bulk.  Also, we cannot lose sight of the fact that there has been, and is, a general cry throughout the country for economy. But I consider that the way of approaching this subject in regard to the cost of maintenance of that portion of the Oireachtas for which we can speak, <Col N="474" /> and upon which we are entitled to speak, namely, the Dáil, is to have a re-investigation of the conditions which bear, or should bear, upon the amount of the allowances and salaries which we here in the Dáil, either in the House itself or through a Select Committee, would think fit should be paid to Deputies.</P>
    <P>This proposal of mine is in one respect wider than the original Terms of Reference, setting up the committee in 1923, because this will include Parliamentary secretaries.  In another sense, it is narrower because it does not include the officers of the Dáil.  Perhaps I may explain to the Dáil the reason for that omission.  The officers of the Dáil had their numbers and remuneration settled by a committee which was set up on 23rd March, 1923, by a resolution of the Dáil.  That committee consisted of the Minister for Finance and the Ceann Comhairle.  They were appointed to be a Standing Committee to determine the number, grading, remuneration and terms of office of the Oireachtas staff, and, in order to reconsider or to re-investigate that question, the resolution of March, 1923, would have to be rescinded, and I take it, certainly by way of amendment to Deputy Hewson's proposal, that would not be in order for me to move.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee includes the Chairman of the Seanad, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I omitted to mention that.  Of course the staff of the Dáil are in reality civil servants, and I suggest that the proper means of investigating their position would be by the same method as should be adopted in regard to the Civil Service at large. In proposing to set up this Committee the object that I have in view, I put it plainly, is economy, but the reason why I think it is necessary that such a Committee should be set up is because this is a matter which, in my view, is preeminently one for the deliberations of a Select Committee of the Dáil, and not one for a general discussion upon the floor of this House.  This is no Party question, and I am sure will not be regarded as such, and if this Committee makes a report upon the questions submitted <Col N="475" /> to it, it will be for the Dáil to approve of its recommendations or not. I think it would not be out of place, and, indeed, would not be asking too much if, when this Committee does make a report, the Dáil were to consider the advisability of foregoing a percentage, even a small percentage, of the amount by way of allowances which the Committee would think to be suitable, owing to the conditions at the moment.</P>
      <P>The motion asks for a report as to the salaries and allowances that should in future be paid and provided for members of Dáil Eireann.  I would suggest that if there is no change suggested by this Committee by way of economy, if this Committee thinks, which it may, and which I do, that the allowances at present made to Deputies are not excessive in view of the tasks they have to perform, still it would be possible for the Dáil then to make a temporary provision foregoing for the time being a small percentage of that sum. It will not make a great difference to the cost of running the State, but it will be at least this: it will be an earnest of the desire of every party in this House that they are anxious to give an example to the country and to do something towards economy.  It is said that charity begins at home.  I suggest it would be no harm for us to show that economy should begin at home, too, and if this Committee comes to the conclusion that the salaries are not too large, a conclusion with which I would agree, and if they come to the conclusion that the allowances are not too large, a conclusion with which I would also agree, I certainly think it would be taken as an act of good faith with the people on the part of the Dáil if they were temporarily to forego a percentage of these sums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there is a distinction between salary and allowances, and when I heard mention made the other day, in the course of the debate, of salaries to Deputies I was inclined to intervene, because of course we know that the sums we get by way of allowances are not salaries at all.  They are merely allowances to enable us to attend to our duties as Parliamentary <Col N="476" /> representatives.  I hope that the Dáil, considering this from a non-party attitude, will adopt the suggestion that I have thought fit to make: that they will set up this Committee, and that this Committee will, with the experience of the last four years at their disposal, go into all matters which have been suggested to them for their consideration and that they will make a report to the Dáil.  The object of my making this proposal is identically the same as the object which prompted Deputy Johnson and Deputy Hewson to make their proposals during last week.  I trust that when this Committee is set up, if it is, that it will explore every avenue to see whether some form of economy cannot be effected in these matters, and that if they are of opinion that it cannot, that the Dáil will then come to the conclusion that we should do something by way of declining to accept our full allowances, and show the people that we are in earnest in regard to the policy of retrenchment and of economy which was preached from so many platforms during the General Election and which the people of the country are crying for in all corners of the land to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support Deputy Redmond's motion which is now before the House as a substantive motion.  I could not support the original motion of Deputy Hewson because in that motion there was an implicit inference that the allowances received by Deputies were excessive. I do not think that could be justified from the point of view of earning and certainly could not be justified by any comparison.  I agree with Deputy Redmond that the use of the word &ldquo;salaries&rdquo; is bad, and &ldquo;allowance&rdquo; is not much better.  There is a Canadian word called &ldquo;indemnity.&rdquo;  In Canada they speak of the indemnity received by the members of their Parliament. With regard to the indemnities received for service in the <Col N="477" /> Dáil and comparing them with those of other Dominions you will find that they compare very unfavourably indeed.  A member of the Canadian Parliament receives £800 a year, while a member of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia receives £1,000 a year, and in addition to that there are advantages and amenities such as we never know.  The Australian members of Parliament have a free pass, a gold badge which they dangle on their watch-chains, which provides them with free travel over the Australian railways, not merely a voucher for a journey between Dublin and a Deputy's constituency as happens here.  The same gold badge obtains them free admission to any race meeting in the Commonwealth, which may or may not be to their profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFalvey" hpid="Mr. FALVEY Mr. FALVEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FALVEY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, they have not discovered the electric hare in Australia yet.  In addition to the amenities which I have mentioned, they are provided with billiard rooms, cricket pitches, tennis courts, and bowling greens, but we have not aspired to any of these things yet.  It may be that we are unworthy of them, but certainly when compared with the other Parliaments of the British Commonwealth we do not receive excessive remuneration.  I would go further and say that any Deputy who does his work here and attends regularly, especially in the case of country Deputies, and certainly any Deputy who pays his own election expenses, receives no profit whatever from the indemnity that he receives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen some cheap sarcasms in the papers that £360 per year is the goal of every Deputy's ambition, and that he is content when he receives that without having any regard to the returns made.  I think those are very empty and futile suppositions.  Any Deputy who does his work properly, attends regularly, and does his share of committee work, does work for the State valued more highly than at £360 <Col N="478" /> a year.  I could not accept Deputy Hewson's first proposition, but I agree that it is well that this matter should be considered by a committee, because there are existing anomalies.  £360 a year is not much for a man who devotes his whole time to the work and has no other means of support.  It is, indeed, very little, but it might be possible to reconsider the decision that exempts the whole of that £360 a year from income-tax, so that those who are comparatively better off in the world's goods may receive less than others who require it as their total support.  I think that is an argument for appointing this committee, and a second argument is that there is at present a loophole in our procedure and regulations.</P>
    <P>It is at the moment possible for an elected Deputy to go up to the Clerk's Office, comply with Article 17 of the Constitution, sign a book, and then go to Monte Carlo, never to set foot in the Chamber of the Dáil at all, and yet draw £30 a month for the whole term of the Oireachtas.  I think it should be within the power of this committee to frame some regulation that would prevent that, because that might easily become a public scandal.  A man might impress himself upon a constituency, might make up his mind not to stand again, and might simply become a pensioner of the State for the period of the Dáil.  I think the committee might easily give its attention to preventing that.</P>
    <P>I do not like the idea of payment by attendance.  It might mean that Deputies would come down here, sign a book, and go away.  It would be better if they did not come here at all.  It has great loop-holes, but I cannot help thinking that there might be some machinery by which it would be possible to cease paying allowances to Deputies who had not been in the Dáil for three months or had not voted in a division for a certain period of time. That would be within the terms of reference of Deputy Redmond's resolution; also, because I think there are ways of economy by which we can penalise the inefficient, the Deputy who does not attend and takes no part in committee work or work of the Dáil and because it is a saving to the State, <Col N="479" /> I support Deputy Redmond's resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a suggestion to Deputy Redmond when moving what is now the motion.  I held the view when this matter was up previously that the Deputies should not be put on the same footing and that two categories should be made, the Deputy who has his home in Dublin and the Deputy who has to come to Dublin to do the work of the State.  I do not care how far the Deputy has to come, let it only be from a neighbouring county, if he has to come up here during the Session, find accommodation in Dublin and pay his expenses, he is under the same expense as a Deputy coming from Donegal or Kerry.  If Deputy Redmond is prepared to add this distinction to his resolution, I shall support it.</P>

      <P>I say a man who has to live in Dublin cannot be put in the same category as the man who has to come up here, pay his expenses and leave his home and business behind him.  A man coming up from the country may leave his business for four days of the week; he may have to travel the night before, making it five days in the week. I do not know what the original idea behind the motion of Deputy Hewson was.  There are a good many people in this country prepared to elect men who have not a good deal of the world's wealth in money.  They may have a fair amount of intelligence and intellect. The electors think them good enough to send up here.  That kind of men would find it impossible to live on air, as Deputy Hewson said in part of his address.  Is the public representation of the Saorstát to be confined to people with plenty of private means who can afford to do this as a hobby or who are consumed by such an amount of vanity as to spend their all in order to be here as representatives?</P>

There is another class of individual and the Committee would be justified if it were only to deal with this class of individual alone, the men who come here, sign the book, and who, in the language of the people I know down the country, when they have done that, have nothing to do but draw their money.  We had instances of that in the last Dáil, of men who were elected and who scarcely ever attended.  They did attend at one period when a certain interest was in the offing, the Seanad Election.  After <Col N="481" /> that, they never attended again, but drew their money up to the last. Something should be done to deal with that class of individual.  If the Deputy is prepared to embody explicity the suggestion I make, that this Committee take into consideration the case of the Deputy coming up from the country and leaving his business as against the Deputy living in Dublin who is at no loss except the time he is losing here, I am prepared to support the amendment, but if he is not prepared to do that I think that the whole thing is not genuine and that it is not put up in the interests of economy.</P>

      <P>I do not think there will be much opposition on the part of any member of the House to the adoption of this proposal.  Looking at the text of it, it is difficult to see why there should be much objection to it, but we have to bear in mind what has led up to this proposal.  It seems to me that it is the culmination of the long unintelligent, unenlightened campaign for what is called economy.  We have had for a considerable time a demand on behalf of the Press and on behalf of a certain section of public men for economy.  Deputy Redmond says that there is a widespread demand for economy.  I do not think there is.</P>

      <P>Deputy Redmond and his colleagues in the late General Election not only demanded economy. but told us that millions could be saved and the election now being over, of course, it is up to Deputy Redmond to show us where the millions are to be saved.  I suppose this is the first step in the carrying out of his election promises.  There has been a good deal of talk about election promises.  As far as Deputies on these Benches are <Col N="482" /> concerned, we advocated on the hustings a definite, clearly-understood policy, and we made no promises except to do our best to have that given effect to in whole or in part.</P>
      <P>I am rather sorry that Deputy Redmond has not with him here some of his eloquent and well-informed colleagues who were, unfortunately, unsuccessful. One in particular would be always available as a substitute for the Minister for Finance, because he could throw millions about in all directions and show how half the expenditure of this country could be saved.  Reading one of his speeches delivered in Clare, I came upon a passage which I will quote.  This gentleman is Mr. O'Donnell, a very experienced gentleman, a barrister of over 20 years standing, and an ex-member of the Westminster Parliament. I would ask the Minister for Finance to take serious notice of this paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The economic and fiscal position of the Free State was very serious. Their total export trade was worth only forty millions a year.  The Government services cost thirty millions, and another five millions were spent in local government by the county councils.  That meant that only five millions were left for the upkeep of the entire people.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is certainly very illuminating, and the Dáil has certainly suffered a deprivation when we have not the pleasure and profit of that gentleman's advice.  It used to be said in the Westminster Parliament that when the Government were in a difficulty they appointed a Royal Commission.  Some people seem to think that Royal Commissions not being available, the next best thing is to appoint a committee. What I principally complain of in this respect is the attitude of mind that is behind this talk.  What this country wants is not economy.  It wants to spend more money.  What we want is not savings, but wise spending, well-thought out productive spending.</P>

      <P>Some of it is unqualified. We hear talk about Government services in the same unenlightened way as one hears talk about reducing rates.  People say they are elected to public boards to reduce rates. They are elected to do nothing of the kind.  At least they should not be elected to do it; they should be elected to spend rates, to spend them wisely and spend them well.  Comparisons are made between the taxes levied in this country and the taxes in other countries of similar size, quite ignoring what value is received for these taxes.</P>
      <P>In the same way, the rates in one town are compared with the rates in another town.  We are told that the rates in one town are 10s. in the £, and that in another town they are 20s. in the £. Yet a rate of 20s. in the £ might be a better proposition in that town than the rate of 10s. elsewhere.  That would be so if better value were given to the ratepayers.  The same test must be applied to national government.  Our job is not to save a few pounds here and there, but to secure that whatever money is raised is spent wisely and well, and is used in the best interests of the country.  This country does not want the false kind of economy that is talked about.  It wants development. The idle people of the country want work.  What is wanted is productive development, in order to stop the drain of emigration.  We want progressive and enlightened intelligence brought to bear on this question, and not to be peddling with pounds while millions are being wasted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>We can congratulate Deputy O'Brien upon his very candid statement.  As regards the original motion, if Deputy Hewson had more experience of the work of an ordinary <Col N="484" /> Deputy, I think his motion would not have appeared so soon on the Order Paper.  If Deputy Hewson's motion had not appeared on the Order Paper, I wonder would Deputy Redmond's proposal have appeared.  Under those circumstances, it is difficult for a member of the Dáil who wants to be candid with the country and with himself to see through the fog.  Speaking the other day on the motion by Deputy Johnson, I expressed the view that men should be paid for the service they give. A new member may come here because of the extraordinary things he has promised to do outside.  Such a member may be excused for thinking that the amount of work he will be called upon to do will be less than it has been found to be by other Deputies.  The members of my Party who have had four years' experience are of opinion that the work of a member of the Dáil is a whole-time job.  If the members do the work that their responsibility charges them with, it will be found that my assertion that membership of the Dáil is a whole-time job is true.  Those of us who have been for four years members of the Dáil cannot close our eyes to the fact that there are other Deputies who do not give the service I refer to.  That fact is borne in on many taxpayers.  The taxpayers rightly ask if Deputies are earning the allowances they receive.  It may be that the men who do earn their allowances are very often placed side by side with those who do not earn them.  It is regrettable that that should be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Party have all along advocated reduction of expenditure and a policy of spending wisely and well.  Early in 1923 we expressed the view that we were prepared to accept a reduction of our allowances if reductions were to be made all round.  I am not very clear as to what Deputy Redmond is aiming at.  He states that he wants the whole position examined.  If he wants it examined, I, too, want it examined.  I want it examined in the light of the knowledge I have gained for the past four years here.  I have expressed the view in my own constituency that the farmer who leaves his farm on Monday to attend to the business of the State here must neglect his farm and his <Col N="485" /> home.  He is obliged to pay somebody to look after his place.  I venture to suggest that no farmer and no businessman who attended regularly and punctually here during the last Dáil had his expenses covered by the allowance he received.  Realising that fact, we have to inquire as to what the real position is.  I do not know that we have so many philanthropists in the country &mdash;men who are so patriotic that they are prepared to come up here in the interest of good legislation and sound administration, and spend their own money in attending to the nation's business.  I would be almost suspicious of the man who would undertake to do that.  There is then the man referred to by Deputy Gorey, who wants to get here at all costs, and who is prepared to spend his own money because of the honour conferred upon him.  That type of man does not always turn out to be the best class of representative.  I confess that I should not like to see a state of things brought about in which we would have a number of men who could afford to spend their time in Dublin, because they have private means, in attending to the work of the country. I would have some anxiety as to how long the nation's work would continue to be done in the capital of the country. We might have men of that type, as we had before, who would be prepared to transfer the seat of Government elsewhere.  I, for one, am not prepared to make that change in the interests of economy.  There is then the man who considers that it would pay him to come here even on an allowance of £100. We have to be careful of the man of that mentality, because he will not do the nation's work either.  As Deputy O'Brien says, the kind of economy we will get from that policy will be bad in every sense.  On the other hand, the country expects, and rightly expects, good service from the men elected to this Assembly.  The country expects regular attendance and attention to work.  And it expects a little more than work here.  For myself, I have to say that when I get back to the country during the week-end, I am expected in two or three places at the same time, in order to advise and help the farmers in respect of various matters.  Other <Col N="486" /> elected representatives are expected to do the same thing.  Then some Deputies receive about two dozen letters each day, and when they go home during the week-end they have to meet about two dozen people.  As a matter of fact, the member of the Dáil who attends to his work has to do overtime. Deputies who have been in regular attendance here know that I state facts. In face of that, what is the honest course to pursue on Deputy Redmond's amendment?  We are prepared to support the amendment, and to have the whole position examined.  Perhaps if it were examined by the Dáil, it might be better for the country, because it would be better informed as to the work of its representatives.  Many of the people do not fully appreciate the amount of service elected representatives have to give.  If the matter were thrashed out here, the public would be better informed.  However, if it is considered wiser to set up this Committee to go into the matter minutely, we are prepared to give the proposal support. But in the examination of the position with a view to effecting economy, I think the past should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The amount of work that men have put in in the past must form some basis for this Committee in arriving at a decision as to what is an adequate allowance for representatives in the future.  Deputy Gorey made a point with regard to the men who have homes in Dublin, who, perhaps, one might also add, could in some cases give a few hours in the day to their business before coming to the Dáil. That is not true of Deputies who live in the country.  When they come away one hundred miles or more from their homes for the week, they cannot attend to their business.  What Deputy O'Brien has said is true, that the amount of work a man puts in for the allowance he gets determines whether it is an economy to make that allowance or not.</P>
    <P>This Committee undoubtedly will have great difficulties to overcome in making investigations.  I personally would much prefer, if it be at all possible, that the Committee would come to a decision and make an allowance of <Col N="487" /> expenses, or whatever you like to call it, for those who, when they get elected, are really doing the nation's work.  In every walk of life men expect to be compensated for the service they give. If a scale could be arrived at which would be adequate for the time and energy spent by Deputies who attend here, and that that was one of the points to be considered by this Committee, I feel that we would get economy&mdash;that we would either get more work from a good many Deputies or that we would save money.  The Deputies who do work, on the other hand, would not be pilloried by some uninformed persons who know that some men are not giving good service and look upon all the Deputies as being in the same boat.  That is the way I look at the matter.  Investigation, I think, will be good for everybody.  If we could arrive at a fair basis for the allowance we might get better service and more work from every elected representative, and if we got that we would arrive at such a state that men would have to come here and give service and then go back to their constituents and answer for the service they gave.  People then would be able to judge who gave good service and who did not.  It is only when that state of things is brought about that the man who gives service will be judged on his merits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise for the purpose of opposing the motion, because it appears to me that it is a sham proposition and not a reality.  The Deputy brought it forward expressing the hope and expectation that the Committee appointed would advise that no alteration should be made, and then that the House should forego a small percentage of its salary as an earnest of a desire for economy.  To my mind that would be no earnest of a desire for real or true economy.  It would be a mere histrionic gesture to catch the imagination of the country.  It  would not be building upon a sound and firm basis&mdash;such a basis as a real system of economy can be built upon. To my mind when this House considers the question of economy it should be <Col N="488" /> careful to tread the dusty road of common sense and not deviate from that road.  It should leave sporting in the green fields of theatrical display to other persons in other places.  We should keep ourselves down to hard facts, and should deal with those hard facts in an ordinary commonplace way and not endeavour to catch the eyes of the country by any would-be act of heroism.  I agree with what Deputy Baxter said.  I agree that to a very large number of Deputies the salary which they receive is not a real addition to their income.  I agree with him that there is many a man who, if he gave the time which he gives to the service of his constituents in this Chamber and outside to his business or to his profession, sitting at his desk or overseeing his farm, would be a far richer man at the end of the year.  I think that is fact which must be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I put these attacks on the salaries of Deputies upon quite another and I think a higher line.  To my mind, though these attacks and the motions in which they are embodied are not in themselves against the letter of the Constitution, they are against the spirit of the Constitution.  If you look at the Constitution you will see everywhere through it that it is a democratic Constitution.  It is as democratic a constitution as you can find anywhere, and it is of the essence of democracy that the members of the legislative assembly should be adequately remunerated.  Otherwise democracy becomes a humbug.  Give votes to people and those people are entitled to choose what representatives they wish&mdash;to choose persons who they think are the best suited to look after their interests, irrespective of whether those persons are or are not men of private means.  It becomes an impossibility for them to elect persons whom they would choose to elect if they are first to go out and see has such-and-such a man sufficient income to keep up the position, and therefore be above suspicion.  The only argument I have heard which caused me to think about this matter with any doubt was the argument put forward by Deputies Cooper and Baxter, that there were <Col N="489" /> persons who came here and who did not look after the interests of their constituents.  It appears to me that that question could be better gone into if a Committee were set up to see how attendance in this assembly might be enforced upon its members.  It would be open to that Committee to say that it might be done by reducing their salaries.  But that is not the real issue which is brought up by this motion. It appears to me that instead of inquiring into the question of salaries of Ministers and Deputies, this Committee should be set up merely for the one purpose of seeing how the attendance of Deputies could be enforced, and for those reasons I oppose the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is well the motion should be passed, but I want to warn Deputies that the likelihood is, that an examination into the situation in regard to the payment of salaries and allowances, and the provision of travelling facilities for members of Dáil Eireann, is more likely to result in an increased charge on the State than a decreased charge.  I feel that if this motion had not been moved for twelve months, or if the committee which may be set up were not to report until the members of it, consisting, as no doubt it would, of a considerable proportion of new Deputies, had had experience of what membership of the Dáil means in monetary cost, my opinion would be strengthened that the result of the inquiry would be an increased charge on the State.  I welcome the tone of the last speech, because it suggests to the House what I think should be necessarily taken into account, that is, that the Dáil is a representative assembly. We are really back at the fundamental question: Do we desire Parliament to be the instrument through which government is effected in the country? There are, no doubt.  Deputies who pretend that they would like to have the Government of the country run by Commissioners&mdash;even National Government. Notwithstanding the existence of such views, the majority opinion, I believe, still is theoretically in favour of the government of the country by a Parliament, consisting of Deputies, for the people.  Having once accepted that, <Col N="490" /> we have to ask ourselves what kind of a Parliament is it to be?  Is it, as is suggested, to consist only of members who are able to live in Dublin and do the work of Deputies out of their own means?  That, I think, is not going to be supported by any Deputy, not openly at any rate.  If not, you have to establish a standard.  What kind of a standard?</P>
      <P>I think it will be found on inquiry, and more clearly by experience, that the standard that has been set up is not a high one for a Deputy.  It is a low one.  Deputy Gorey has made the suggestion, more than once, that some distinction should be drawn between a Deputy who lives in Dublin and a Deputy who has to travel from the country.  But the majority of the Deputies who live in Dublin represent constituencies in the country which they must visit.  That is not done without expense.  If any consideration were to be given to these facts, from my experience of the past, I am convinced it would mean additional expense over and above the £30 a month now allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe some change is desirable in respect of travelling facilities.  I believe there should be greater travelling facilities.  I believe it would be to the advantage of the country if facilities for travelling were much more general.  I speak as one who has never had occasion to take advantage of the facilities regarding travel provided for Deputies from the country.  But a Deputy who represents a constituency many hundreds of square miles in extent does not as is commonly believed, have travelling facilities within his constituency. He ought to have them.  If he is to do his work effectively the ordinary Deputy who has no private means cannot afford to live in Dublin during the Session.  He has to reside in his constituency, and travel from one part of it to another at his own expense, to do the work of his constituents.  Travelling facilities ought to be increased, and I would go so far as saying that it would be to the advantage of the State if there were such a provision as Deputy Cooper suggested regarding travelling facilities for any Deputy in <Col N="491" /> any part of the country.  After all, Deputies are not merely representatives of a particular parish or constituency. We are supposed to have the interests of the whole country and the whole community at heart, and to have some general knowledge of the affairs and needs of the country.  On that score, I think a very good case could be made before this Committee, if it is set up, in favour of the extension of travelling facilities.</P>
    <P>As to the suggestion of Deputy Redmond, that Deputies might, of course, receive the nominal rate of remuneration or expense, but that as a gesture they might forego a percentage of their allowance voluntarily for a time.  I do not think there is anything in the Standing Orders to prevent any Deputy who so desires doing that.  Some Deputies might be able to afford it, and may be able to advertise the fact that they have done it.  There is nothing in the Standing Orders, so far as I know. to prevent that being done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said, that is histrionic. The Dáil is going to make a provision and then pass a resolution suggesting that it should deprive itself of a certain percentage of the allowances.  The argument we have been insisting upon follows, that some Deputies may be able to afford to do that, but other Deputies are not able to afford it.  Those who can afford it are free to do it.  I believe that the Committee, when they examine into this question, will find that all the alternatives put up are liable to greater objection than the scheme at present in operation.  There is what might be called the flat rate of remuneration, irrespective of attendance or activity.  In equity and fairness, it might be said that there should be some alteration, but when one sits down to try and devise the means of making a fair alteration, it will be found that the difficulties are enormous. and more anomalies will be found, unless <Col N="492" /> the Committee is going to set itself up as a judge of motives.  It cannot do that.</P>
      <P>After all, we have to take the risks that representative government involves, and one of those risks is that the people may choose unsuitable Deputies. But the people are paying! The Deputies who are chosen are not justified in sitting in judgment upon the character of their fellow-Deputies who have been elected by other constituencies, which can call them to account. You may say that some revision of the electoral law is called for, that a constituency might have the right of recall, or something of that kind, but that is a different question.  If the constituencies choose to elect, and re-elect, men who do their work in a particular way, well, it is the constituencies which have to pay and, possibly, the constituencies have to suffer, but the House has no right, I think, to set itself up as a judge of the motive of its fellow-members in matters of this kind.  Nevertheless, I am prepared to support the idea that a Committee should be appointed to revise the scales already in operation.</P>
      <P>I do that, first, because it may satisfy the House, and many members are here because they preached the doctrine of reduction of expenditure, and they should have an opportunity of examining the reasons why expenditure in this respect is on its present scale.  Then they will be better able to go back to their constituents and tell them that, in this respect at any rate, they are following a wrong trail, and that there is no real economy to be effected by a reduction in the expenses and travelling facilities given to Deputies.  I think, however, that the House and the country have a right to have a periodical examination of this kind, and that if it appears to such Committee that the case for a revision, even though it may entail increased costs on the Exchequer, is a good one, it will not have any fear of reporting in such terms, and that the Deputies who may find their outgoings greater than they anticipated, may have some recoupment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now refer to the question, for instance, of correspondence.  There are Deputies whose work is enormous in <Col N="493" /> respect to correspondence, and every Deputy has to pay twopence on every letter.  It is public work, and makes a very big hole in his £30 a month.  As, I think, Deputy Cooper pointed out, the Dáil nominally will sit for five years&mdash; it may be only four or three years&mdash; and, unfortunately, the electoral system does not allow elections to be run for nothing.  That also is a consideration. As I say, I welcome the idea that the Committee will sit.  I hope that it will not be asked to report until it has had some experience, and then, I believe, it will report in such a way as will not involve reductions, but may possibly involve increases to the National Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. WOLFE Mr. G. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this question has reached such a stage that it cannot be left where it is, and that this matter of setting up a Committee, as proposed by Deputy Redmond, must be proceeded with.  When I say that. I do not for one minute think that the salary allowed to Deputies is in any way excessive, provided they do their duty properly to their constituents and do their work here.  I do not think that anybody who has been here for the last four years, and who has attended to his work, has been in pocket one farthing owing to the salary he received. When I say that, I do not mean that the people who do not attend to their work&mdash;and there have been some such Deputies&mdash;should be treated in the same way as people who do.  When the country pays a salary to Deputies it expects them to attend to its business. I think, where it is clearly evident that this attention has not been given, reductions should be made.  That would be a matter for the Committee to consider if it is set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper has mentioned the fact that all legislative assemblies pay their members and pay them better than Deputies are paid here.  They may, of course, have more to do, or they may be richer countries.  Reasonable remuneration has been fixed to prevent men being at a loss which they could not possibly bear.  It should not be expected that anybody would be able to make a fortune out of his position as Deputy, any more than it is expected in the profession of the Church <Col N="494" /> or the Army.  There men are only supposed to make enough to get along and do their duty to their country.  I contend that the expenses of Deputies&mdash; Deputy Johnson has mentioned some of them&mdash;are extremely heavy.  If you put all these matters together, I think that any fair-minded man would come to the conclusion that Deputies who do their work are not over-paid and do not make any money out of their allowance.</P>
    <P>The reason, of course, that the system of payment of members has been adopted by all the legislatures of the world is that men of ability who have not money should not be shut out from the service of the State by the fact that they have not private means. Every legislature has adopted that system&mdash;even the British legislature, which was the last to adopt it.  There is no doubt that that system has had a good effect.  It has brought forward and given a chance to men of ability who would not otherwise be able to give their services to the State.  The State thereby has been enriched by men who would not otherwise have been in its legislative assembly.  I think that the day would be a very bad one on which we went back on the arrangement that has been made and that has worked with such great advantage. While I say that, I think there should be some discrimination and that the people who do not attend to their work should not be paid for what they do not do, that those who neglect their work for long periods of time should certainly not receive remuneration.  That I think, is a matter, amongst others, for the consideration of the Committee.  The matter having got to the stage at which it has arrived, the Committee, in my opinion, must proceed with its work, and I am sure that nothing but good will result from it and that the country will see that the money which it pays to Deputies is not thrown away, that good value is given, not only by the work done in the House. but also by the quality and ability of Deputies which it has elected.</P>

      <P>I intervene for two reasons: one, to explain that this is not a party question, so far as the <Col N="495" /> party of which I am the nominal leader in this House is concerned.  This matter was considered before, free from party lines or party considerations.  While on that I wish to say that I agree with the setting up of this Committee, though I do not agree with, and cannot understand, the views expressed by Deputy Redmond when he said that if the Committee were to report in favour of the existing remuneration and allowances, nevertheless, a deduction should be made.  I do not understand that, and I do not propose to attempt to understand it, and I am not supporting it.  The other point to which I wish to direct attention is the clock. One hour and a-half is the time allowed for this discussion, and we are getting very close to that.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to take up much time in concluding. From the general course of the discussion the proposal to set up a Committee appears to meet general favour, but, judging from the speeches which have been made, one would think that the opinion would be the other way, because during the course of most of the speeches the arguments brought forward were against the setting up of the Committee.  The speakers in most instances wound up by saying that nevertheless they would support the motion.  The discussion has gone on a rather narrow and rather wide path. Deputies seem to have forgotten or overlooked for a moment the fact that this was not a proposal to set up a Committee to investigate the question of allowances to Deputies only, but rather that it was to include the question of salaries payable to Ministers.</P>

      <P>This is a matter which will have to be decided eventually by the Chairman of the Committee <Col N="496" /> when the Committee is set up. The preamble of the motion refers to the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act and the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  That reference and the word &ldquo;salaries&rdquo; would appear to indicate that the motion covers not only allowances to Deputies, but salaries paid to any persons who are also members of Dáil Eireann, which would make it include Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, and the officers of the House, that is the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening statement I remarked that this was wider if anything than the amendment I proposed on Friday to Deputy Johnson's amendment, namely, that this included the question of Parliamentary Secretaries as well as that of Ministers.  Deputies seem to have confined themselves, whether through misapprehension or not, in spite of what I said in initiating the debate, to a discussion of the question of allowances to Deputies.  My whole object in proposing this motion in these terms was to include the cost in so far as was possible of the running and the up-keep of the Dáil, to include the Ministers and their Parliamentary Secretaries, as well as the office you hold, Sir, and that of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  That being so, I could hardly have imagined Deputy Johnson, or his colleague Deputy O'Brien, opposing it.  They have stated they are not going to oppose it, but most of their speeches seem to have tended in a direction contrary to the conclusion they seem to have come to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the President has stated that this is not to be considered by the Government as a party question, and of course it should not be.  As to not being able to follow the suggestion I made about the temporary renunciation by Deputies of a portion of the amount which may be allotted to them by this Committee, I merely made that as a suggestion, that in view of the serious emergency in which we are placed, in view of the grave financial condition of the country, it would be taken and should be met as a gesture of earnest on the part of the Dáil as a <Col N="497" /> body, and it would go forth to the country that they themselves were prepared for the time being to make some sacrifice to show the country the necessity of making general sacrifices all round in the interests of the State. That is all I have to say by way of winding up this debate, except perhaps to mention that besides being on a rather narrow path, dealing with allowances of the Deputies, it has gone very wide in that respect, because the whole question of anything in the nature of remunerations to Deputies has been raised and debated.  That question has already been settled by the Constitution. This motion does not raise that point at all.  It merely raises the question as to whether there should be a re-investigation, or a revision, as Deputy Johnson has suggested&mdash;a periodical inquiry into the amount that should be paid by way of allowances or salaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to intervene for a moment on account of one sentence used by Deputy Redmond. He spoke of the grave financial condition of the country.  There is no grave financial condition at the moment.  The position of the country, financially, is sound, as sound as it was last year, or the year before, or ten years ago.  It is I think, dangerous to allow a statement of that sort to go abroad.  We will in a short time go before the country in its present financial condition to ask for money for public services.  If that statement was allowed to go forth as the deliberate conclusion of this House. that there was a grave financial condition prevailing, it is likely that it would militate seriously against our credit, and the credit of the country is very important.</P>

    <P>That, for the purpose of any Act of the present Session to authorise the issue of gold coinage, to make provision for the issue of currency notes, having a legal tender quality, to terminate the issue of bank notes by individual banks and substitute an issue of bank notes by a central authority and to establish a Commission to manage and control the issue and redemption of the said currency notes and the issue of bank notes and to exercise certain other functions in relation to the currency, it is expedient to authorise&mdash;</P>

    <P>The Message prescribed by the Constitution has been received from the Governor-General.  The Money Resolution provides for expenditure under three heads, the first of which is in connection with the issue of gold coinage. No payment will fall to be made under that head for perhaps a considerable number of years, and even then the payment will be very small.  The second charge is under Section 38 of the Bill, and relates to the redemption of token coinage.  Expense will only occur when token coinage is being withdrawn for renewal or for replacement. The third head under which charges may fall to be made will be in giving effect to the ultimate State guarantee for legal tender notes, but I do not think that at any time any payment will fall to be made under that head.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £652,680 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1928, for payments in respect of destruction of, or injuries to, property within the period 21st January, 1919, to 12th May, 1923, inclusive, under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Acts, 1923 to 1926, and otherwise; and in respect of damage to, or loss of property and payments by way of indemnification or recoupment under the Indemnity Act, 1924 and for payment of grants awarded on the recommendation of the Property Losses (Ireland) Committee. 1916, as compensation for buildings destroyed in Dublin during Easter Week, 1916.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see, the amount asked for this year is very considerably lower than the amounts required in previous years.  There is a net decrease of £1,191,320.  This will not be the last Vote in connection with Property Losses Compensation, but the amounts that will be required in subsequent years will be very much smaller. We are nearing the end of the work in connection with the awarding and the paying of compensation, but as in the case of many awards reinstatement conditions have been attached, and as payments can only be made when reinstatements <Col N="501" /> are effected, there will be amounts to be paid in subsequent years. So far as the pre-Truce damage is concerned, the international Commission which awarded compensation ceased to function on the 31st March, 1926, but a large number of awards remained to be disposed of.  The great majority have now been discharged, except in cases where there were reinstatement conditions.  So far as Sub-head B is concerned, the number of claims lodged was approximately 25,800, and all the cases, except about thirty, have been heard.  There are a number of appeals outstanding, and the number of cases still to be disposed of is about sixty or eighty.  It is expected that the hearing of the appeals which have been lodged will take place very soon.  Reinstatement awards have so far been made amounting to £1,533,582, and £900,000 odd has been paid to date, so that on the 31st of last March there remained outstanding £697,000.  In the O'Connell Street area awards amounting to £294,000 were made, and a balance of £141,000 remains to be paid.</P>
    <P>So far as Sub-head C is concerned, it is expected that the payment of the £40,000 to the railway companies in respect of the reinstatement of property belonging to them which had been destroyed or damaged will be made this year, and no further payments will be made in subsequent years.  With regard to Sub-head E, the work of the Committee under the Indemnity Act involved the investigation of 5,270 cases and the amount of compensation paid to the 31st March, 1927, was £77,394. The provision made this year will complete the payments to be made under this heading.  Under Sub-head F, the amount remaining to be paid is the amount awarded for the destruction of the Royal Hibernian Academy's premises in Lower Abbey Street.  The Academy has not yet submitted any proposals for re-building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the point raised by Deputy Johnson, interest is not accruing on the sum of £6,780.  So far as sums awarded by the Shaw Commission were concerned, during a period interest did run.  That period has terminated and no interest is now accruing.  I did not know whether it would be possible in fairness to bring pressure upon people to reinstate, beyond the pressure of urging them to do so.  I do not know that it would be fair to penalise them for not reinstating because it is a fact that, in many cases, the compensation awarded would not be sufficient of itself to re-instate buildings.  People who had buildings destroyed were awarded the value of the old buildings.  These old buildings must be substituted by new buildings, and, consequently, they will, in most cases, have to add some money to the compensation awarded to effect reinstatement.  That makes it difficult to apply penal pressure of any sort to them.  But I think construction, speaking generally, is going on fairly rapidly and fairly satisfactorily, and I anticipate that within another year or year-and-a-half, practically all the money that is to be paid in connection with Property Losses Compensation will have been paid.  A time might come when we would say to people if they did not take steps to rebuild, or dispose of their awards to people with the necessary <Col N="503" /> capital to rebuild, that we would approach the Dáil for authority to make deductions from their awards. But I do not think we should do anything at present.</P>
      <P>I am not sure about the case of Liberty Hall at the moment, but I would agree with the Deputy that if the supposition he put forward in his question is correct, that it was the only building damaged in 1916 for which compensation was not paid, compensation ought to be paid.  I would undertake to investigate that particular matter, and, if it seems a proper case, to arrange to have words inserted under an appropriate sub-head, in a subsequent year, to enable payment to be made, but, as I say, I am not familiar with the particulars.</P>

They got the value of the old buildings towards the re-erection of the new building.</P>

    <P>The provision sought this year is the amount required to make certain periodical payments that were recommended by the Personal Injuries Committee; also certain payments which were previously made by the British Government in respect to injuries sustained by non-combatants in Easter Week, 1916.  Sub-head C deals with the necessary adjustments to be effected in connection with the injuries to certain persons during the Anglo-Irish War.  The arrangement that was come to with the British in that respect was that we would pay compensation to our supporters and that the British would pay compensation to their supporters. Where the people killed or injured were regarded as neutral or non-combatant, the compensation was shared. The local authorities were relieved of all liability for the decrees that were obtained.  A number of these decrees had been discharged by the local authorities before that arrangement was come to, and it was decided that the local authorities should be refunded the amounts so paid by them.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,190,435 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1928, for Superannuation, Compensation, Compassionate and Additional Allowances and Gratuities under Sundry Statutes; Compensation under Article 10 of the Treaty of the 6th December, 1921; Compassionate Allowances, Gratuities and Supplementary Pensions awarded by the Minister for Finance; the Salary of the Medical Referee; and sundry Repayments in respect of Pensions at present paid by the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no great change in this Vote, which, as Deputies see, is a very big and important one.  Sub-head (A) deals with the ordinary pensions for civil servants who retire in the normal course, except those who retire from the Post Office.  Provision is made for Post Office pensions in the Post Office Vote.  In sub-head (B) there will naturally be, of course, an increase from year to year.  That is for additional allowances and gratuities to established <Col N="506" /> officers retired in the ordinary course. Formerly, officers were awarded pensions based on sixtieths of their salaries, a sixtieth for every year of service up to forty years service.  Subsequently legislation was passed which enabled officers, if they so chose, to have their pensions assessed in eightieths, and to be paid a lump sum on retirement.  The additional allowances are the lump sums which are payable to officers on retirement, who will be paid eightieths instead of sixtieths.  Sub-head (C), as Deputies will see from the wording of the Estimate, is compensation allowances under Article 10 of the Treaty. (D) refers to the additional allowance payable in connection with those pensions under Article 10 of the Treaty. Sub-head (E) is for compassionate gratuities. These are gratuities that are payable to unestablished servants. They are payable under two Acts&mdash; either under Section 4 of the Act of 1887, or Section 3 of the Act of 1914. Under Section 4 of the Act of 1887 the gratuity may be granted to unestablished whole-time officers who have had, at least, seven years' service, and whose removal is in consequence of the abolition of their employment, or in order to facilitate improvements and effect economies, or (b) who having had fifteen years' service, retire on becoming incapacitated in mind or body from continuing in employment.</P>
    <P>The amount of the compassionate gratuities is £1 or one week's pay, whichever is the greater, for each year of service, so that the amount of these compassionate gratuities, as the Deputies will see, is very small.  The second heading under which compassionate gratuities is given is when an officer dies in his employment; a gratuity is given to his dependents.  As a rule, payments are made out of these subheads to persons who die or are killed in the execution of their duty.  They are only made in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (G) contains provision for grants payable under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  Sub-head (H) is self-explanatory, and the same applies to (I). Sub-head (J) represents the payments which are made by way of pensions to resigned and dismissed <Col N="507" /> members of the R.I.C.  The number of pensions so far awarded is 543.  There may be a few additional pensions awarded still, but the number cannot be large.  Sub-heads (L) and (LL) contain provisions for gratuities and pensions to members of the amalgamated police forces.  The bulk of the provision in (L) is in respect of the members of the late D.M.P.  The provisions under (LL) cover awards under Article 10 of the Treaty to members of the D.M.P. Sub-head (M) deals with repayment to the British Government in respect of civil pensions.  This particular sub-head will be steadily decreasing, and, as it decreases, sub-head (A), which represents the pensions that we pay ourselves direct, will increase. Sub-head (N) is a new sub-head, and represents, as the Deputies are aware, 75 per cent. of the pensions payable to ex-members of the R.I.C.  The other 25 per cent. is paid by the Northern Government.  As I previously explained in the Dáil, this 75 per cent. was based on the average distribution of the R.I.C. during a period of 20 years prior to disbandment.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if there is a list of the names of the persons who receive these pensions available for those who wish to inspect them.  There is some talk here and there through the country of persons in receipt of secret pensions, and I really think those who have to pay these pensions&mdash;in fact, I think, any citizen of the Free State&mdash; ought to be in the position of knowing the persons who are actually in receipt of pensions.</P>

      <P>There is no such thing as a secret pension.  I do not know whether the Deputy has been appointed a member of the Committee of Public Accounts or not, but if he has, he will, perhaps, discover that there could be no such thing, and that there is absolutely no possibility of such a thing as a secret pension.  As to the publication of lists of pensioners of any sort, that is a matter which I certainly would not like to give an opinion on without more consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the resigned and dismissed R.I.C., who subsequently joined the Gárda Síochána, are concerned, I am not sure at the moment whether their previous service would be taken into account or whether the pension which they are now entitled to, and which was suspended during their employment, will be supplemented by a pension representing <Col N="509" /> their subsequent service in the Gárda Síochána.</P>

    <P>This represents the amount that would be paid in rates on the various items of State property if they were owned by private individuals.  The amount will vary from year to year as the rates in different counties and county boroughs vary.  There have been certain decreases due to the fact that at one time rates were, in fact, paid by the Government on certain buildings on which no rates would have <Col N="511" /> been payable if they had been owned by private individuals&mdash;for instance, on the National Museum, the National Library and the National Gallery. These are educational institutions on which rates would not have been payable, and in future no grant in lieu of rates will be made.  Certain steps are also being taken in connection with model schools where there is perhaps a school and a residence, and where there was formerly a grant made in respect of the whole building.  In the future it will only be made in respect of the part of the building on which rates would be payable if owned by a private individual.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,700 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1928, for Secret Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purposes of the Secret Service Vote are the obtaining of information which is requisite for the security of the country and which cannot be obtained openly.  The amounts are paid out on the order of the Minister for Finance at the request of another Minister.  The Minister who is responsible for the requisition is required, at the end of the financial year, to give a certificate in the following form:&mdash;&ldquo;I hereby certify that the amount actually expended by me or under my direction for secret service in the year ended&mdash;&mdash; was so much and that the balance in my hands on the 31st day of March was so much, and I further solemnly declare that the interests of the public service required that the <Col N="512" /> payments should be made out of the Service Fund and that they were properly so made.&rdquo;  That is the form of certificate which has been in force so far as the British service has been concerned since 1888, and the British Public Accounts Committee in 1888 expressed the opinion that these certificates were satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The amount of the estimate is £4,000 less than the previous year, and I am not sure that it would be wise, in any subsequent year, to make the estimate less than £10,000, because this is not the sort of service for which, if the necessity arose, one could well come to the Dáil for additional sums on a supplementary estimate.  There might be a public danger of some sort which would require expenditure on secret service, and if the money were not in the Vote it would do more harm to come to the Dáil and say that a danger was threatening which required the provision of this money than perhaps even to fail to take the steps that should be taken.  I will read for Deputies the amounts voted in previous years and the amounts actually spent.  In the year 1922/23 the amount voted was £220,000, and the amount actually expended £118,762.  In the year 1923-24 the amount voted was £50,000, and the amount actually expended £39.236.  In the year 1924/25 the estimate was £35.000, and the amount actually expended £19,665. In the year 1925/26 the amount voted was £20,000. and the amount actually expended £8.995.  In the last financial year the amount voted was £14,000, and the sum actually expended £2,970.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that having regard to the very large expenditure of money in maintaining the Civic Guard, I think the amount asked for under this Vote is excessive.  I think that the list just read out by the Minister is a very sad one.  This proposed expenditure is, to my mind at any rate, an encouragement to spies and informers, and I regret that the Minister does not see his way to ask for a very much smaller sum. When you take into consideration the fact that we are not concerned with transactions in other countries I see no genuine need for any such expenditure <Col N="513" /> in a small country, and in portion of a very small island.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,100 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1928, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Tariff Commission (Tariff Commission Act, 1926).</P>
      <P>Deputies will remember that the Tariff Commission commenced its work towards the latter end of the last financial year.  Members of the Commission are civil servants in the Department of Finance, the Stationery Office, and in the Department of Lands and Agriculture. Their salaries are borne on the Votes of their own Departments.  The Secretary to the Commission is a junior administrative officer in the Department of Finance, and receives an allowance as salary to the Tariff Commission, which allowance is borne on this Vote. A lump sum is provided for clerical assistance, in view of the possibility that increased work may render such assistance necessary.  Provision is also inserted for the fees of expert advisers, who may be employed either as witnesses who would give evidence before the Commission or as a check on the evidence given by applicants, or they might be employed by the Commission to inspect and report on factories and plant.  It is hoped, in cases where an application for a tariff is passed, that the evidence of the opponents will render the calling of experts less necessary, and that the Commission may be able to assess the evidence offered by both sides without the assistance of outsiders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The travelling expenses of the Commissioners <Col N="514" /> may include journeys where they think it necessary to make a personal inspection of the factories and plant of applicants or of other factories and plants.  The incidental expenses include, as Deputies will see, the cost of advertising, and particularly of special reporting.  The Commission decided that verbatim reports of the evidence given before it should be made, so that when it came to prepare its report the evidence given over intervals of perhaps three months or more would be readily available to them.  Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Tariff Commission Act provides for the payment of fees by applicants.  A fee in any case is not to be less than £10 or more than £100.  The fees are fixed by the Commission with the sanction of the Minister for Finance and regard is had to the length of time and expense likely to be involved in the consideration of the applications. In most cases a fee in the neighbourhood of the maximum has been charged, but in some cases a small fee. The fee in respect of the application for a tariff on margarine was £50, and in respect of the application for a tariff on rosaries it was £10.  In the applications for tariffs on flour, woollens and worsteds and coach motor bodies, the fee fixed was £100 in each case.</P>
    <P>The procedure that takes place in connection with an application for a tariff involves a number of stages. First there is an application to the Minister for Finance.  Then there is consideration in the Department of Finance for instance of the representative character of the applicants, whether they do represent an industry or are entitled to a hearing.  Then the application is either referred to the Commission or rejected, because it is so general in character or because the people making the application are not representative.  I think I once got an application for a tariff on agricultural products.  I rejected it because, first, it was too general, and, secondly, it was made by one Committee of Agriculture. Even had it been for a tariff on barley I would not regard one Committee of Agriculture as having the representative character necessary. <Col N="515" /> When a case has been referred to the Commission the applicants are asked to submit detailed cases and lists of witnesses with their statements of evidence in writing.  When that has been submitted the fee is fixed and sanctioned by the Minister and the applicants are informed of the amount. When they have duly paid the fee the Commission inserts notices in the &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; and the daily Press announcing the application and inviting evidence from persons likely to be affected.  There is inspection by the interested parties of the documents lodged by the applicants so that those opposing the tariff may be in a position to know what case is being made for it and may be able to counter it. Seven days before hearing a notice of the hearing is given.  Then the case is heard, but, it may not be disposed of at one hearing.  Sometimes, several hearings are necessary and opportunities must be given to opponents to make their case and perhaps to be re-heard.  Then books and documents will often have to be submitted to an accountant for detailed examination.  It may be necessary in some cases to get expert witnesses.  In other cases it may be necessary for the Commission to see the plant and factory of the applicants and perhaps to see others.  In the case of the proposal for a tariff on margarine not only were the premises of the applicants in Waterford visited but other factories in Liverpool and London were visited by the Tariff Commission.</P>
    <P>It will not be possible for the reports to be made as quickly as perhaps some of us thought when the Commission was being set up, but there are certain cases in which all the evidence has been taken, and in which reports will very shortly be made.  I think in a couple of cases the Commission is simply faced with the task now of drawing up its report, but for the information of Deputies who may be impatient and think that a case could be disposed of satisfactorily in a month or two, I might quote the length of time that was taken by the United States Tariff Commission in reporting on certain cases submitted to it.  In the case of fabric cloths the <Col N="516" /> time of consideration was two years, five months.  Another very small item, paint brush handles, occupied three years and six months.  Sewed straw hats took two years and five months.  In the case of sugar the Tariff Commission in the United States was urged to hasten its consideration of the application and to deal with it as expeditiously as possible, and consideration took one year and four months.  In another case of butter it took one year and seven months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>These are as short periods as I have information of; in any case our Commission will not occupy such a length of time.  The work of the Commission has not been held up at any stage by reason of the fact that the members of the Commission have other duties.  When anything was ripe for consideration, the officers who were members of the Commission have been free to attend to it.  Arrangements have been made in the offices to enable them to get free, but in some cases applicants had not anything like all the facts in ordered form for presentation to the Commission at the first hearing and adjournments had to be made to enable applicants to get out facts which should have been got out earlier.  In other cases when the facts were put in it was not possible for the Commission to consider them.  Where those facts related to statistics, there had to be examination by an accountant.  The work is going on.  In a couple of cases the Commission has had all the evidence it wants, and it is only faced with the problem of weighing and sifting the evidence and coming to its own conclusions. Of the applications that have been received, eleven have been referred to the Tariff Commission.  The applications included margarine, coach and motor bodies, rosaries, flour, woollens and worsteds, down quilts. fish barrels, maize products, sole, insole. and harness leather and manufactured harness, cement, glass bottles, galvanised hollow ware, wheel-barrows, picture frames, bicycles, saw-mill products, and tin-ware.  Glass bottles are <Col N="517" /> the last which have been actually referred to the Commission.  The others have not yet been dealt with in the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>My explanation would be that if I thought I could ensure privacy I would lock it up until the end of the Recess.  In my opinion, when a tariff is going to be imposed as a result of the operations of the Tariff Commission, forestalling cannot be prevented.  Some people will have come to certain conclusions as a result of the proceedings before the Commission and you may have forestalling.  On the other hand, greater facilities for forestalling should not be made available.  I think myself as soon as the Report of the Tariff Commission is available a resolution imposing a tariff should be passed here.  That would give us a considerable time for the consideration of it and if the Dáil did not finally decide to impose the tariff, anybody who had paid it in the meantime would have their money repaid.  If the Dáil did decide to impose it a large amount of forestalling would be prevented.</P>

      <P>I asked a question here a couple of months ago whether workers formerly engaged in the manufacture of goods in this country, who now find themselves deprived of their means of livelihood owing to their former employers becoming agents for foreign-manufactured goods, could state their case before the Tariff Commission. I got a reply to the effect that they were debarred from stating their case. owing to the terms of reference. It is a matter which I think the Minister would be wise in reconsidering. Irish firms who formerly gave good employment now have machinery <Col N="518" /> standing idle because they find it is cheaper, owing to the facilities granted for importing foreign goods made in a cheap market, to act as agents for the class of goods which they formerly manufactured at home.  I will give one instance.  There is a well-known firm in Dublin city which formerly employed a large number of paper-bag makers.  Their machinery is now standing idle and they are importing paper-bags in tons for distribution here.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister whether something could not be done to alter the terms of reference of the Commission so as to permit workers who are now unemployed, as a result of the dumping of foreign goods, to present their case to the Commission. Alternatively the Minister might add to the powers of the Commission to enable them to hear the workers' side of the case as well as the employers'.  In some cases the employers may find that they are getting a handsome profit by acting as agents for foreign-manufactured goods, but at the same time they are keeping idle skilled workers who were formerly employed by them producing the same class of goods.  I think the Minister could do something in that case.  I am satisfied that the Tariff Commission is paying attention to all the complaints put before it, but employers who should put suggestions before them to promote employment will not do so because they are satisfied with the profit they are getting on imported goods, while workers formerly engaged in the trade are left idle.  I think the Minister should consider the matter so as to devise some means of allowing the employees to present their case before the Commission.</P>

The position at the moment is that the country is being flooded with buses made in England and other countries while practically all the coach builders in this country are idle.  A very large number of men who formerly found employment in this industry are now out of employment.  I am afraid that if the Tariff Commission decide on imposing a tariff the demand for buses in this country will be largely supplied before the tariff comes into operation.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum set down under sub-head (b) represents old claims, some of which have not yet been disposed of and some of which it may be difficult to dispose of because the records relating to them were burnt in the Custom House.  The cost of registration may be divided into four parts&mdash;expenses of secretaries or clerks of county councils, or urban district councils, who <Col N="521" /> are responsible for compiling the lists; expenses of rate collectors, who collect the information locally; expenses of printing and other expenses, including expenses for clerical assistance.  The franchise expense is equally divisible between the local authority and the State.  The expense which relates to the jury register is a local expense.  It is estimated that the work of the rate collectors in connection with the franchise involves twice as much trouble as the work in connection with the jurors, so that, so far as their remuneration is concerned, the State pays one-third of the total&mdash;that is, half of the franchise element.  In regard to printing, the cost of which is met on the Stationery Office Vote, it is estimated that the jury column costs one-seventh of the whole and that is a local charge.  The remaining six-sevenths of the printing cost is for franchise work.  Half the cost is borne by the State and half by the local authority.  As regards the other expenses, which include incidentals of all sorts, the amount is equally divided between the local authority and the State.</P>
    <P>The expense of the register has decreased substantially.  The first register, under the Electoral Act, 1923, contained 1,790,000 names.  The cost of that register, excluding the cost of printing, was £52,635, while the last register contained 1,745,000 names&mdash; about 45,000 less&mdash;the cost being reduced from £52,000 odd to £42,000 odd.</P>

      <P>I desire to draw the Minister's attention to the preparation by the rate-collectors of the voters' lists.  In various districts, this work is done in a very slovenly and indifferent manner.  There are names on the voters' list which should not be there, and there are names omitted from the list which should be on it.  I think in future more care should be insisted upon in the preparation of these lists. Some of the rate-collectors are wholly incompetent for the job.  I would suggest that the Gárda Síochána should be requested to assist in the preparation and checking of these lists.  They are not over-burdened with work in many of the rural districts of which I have knowledge, and a considerable number <Col N="522" /> of them are very capable men.  I do not think it would be unreasonable to ask the Gárdaí to assist in connection with these voters' lists.  Some of the rate-collectors employed in the preparation of these lists are, in my opinion, too dear at any price.</P>

There were other cases where all the occupants of the house were on the list, although some of them were only fifteen or sixteen years of age.  Those are matters that in future should not be overlooked.  The secretaries of the county councils, who are responsible for the publication of these lists, should be instructed in future to insist on the rate-collectors discharging their duties in a more careful and more businesslike manner.  If possible, the Gárda Síochána in the various districts should be asked to assist in the preparation of the lists, so as to ensure their absolute accuracy.</P>

The blunders in these cases could easily have been avoided if the Gárdaí had been called in.  I would suggest that this work might be linked up with that of the Census.  The two jobs are closely related, and, if my suggestion were adopted, a young person would go automatically on the register as soon as he reached adult age, while unqualified <Col N="523" /> persons would have their names removed from the register.</P>

      <P>I should like to emphasise what has been urged by Deputy White.  When the Act dealing with elections was going through the House, two or three years ago, a good many complaints were made about registration inaccuracies.  Promises were made by the Government that these inaccuracies would be reduced to a minimum. The last register did not bear out that undertaking.  Considerable fault was found with the register. Wrong names had been placed on the register, the names of other persons were omitted, while in some cases wrong addresses were given.  In some districts, the register was almost perfect, but in other districts it was very imperfect.  It depended on the particular official who was doing the work.  As suggested by Deputy White, I believe the Gárda Síochána would be the proper people to undertake this work&mdash;not because they have not enough to do, but because they are the people best qualified for the work.  The taking of the Census was referred to. That work was done by them.  I am afraid that if the Census were taken as a basis and the voters' register checked in that way, there would be great disparity indeed.  The Gárda Síochána would turn out a more accurate register than any rate collector could possibly do.  They know the people in their district.  If they were in charge of the work, young people who are not qualified would not be put on the register, and there would be fewer omissions of people who are qualified. I recommend the suggestion to the Minister.</P>

I understand that these rate collectors are well paid for furnishing the necessary names and I would suggest that when complaints are proved a fine should be levied.  In some cases, there is almost criminal negligence displayed in the preparation of the lists. In future where I find the lists are inaccurate, I propose to report the rate collectors to the Minister for Local <Col N="524" /> Government.  If they are well paid, there is no reason why they should not be made to suffer, if the work is not done.</P>

It is equally certain that other collectors with malice prépense cook the register.  They put on all the occupants of certain houses and omit persons in other houses who are entitled to vote.  It is only right that there should be some check on their operations.  I could, if necessary, prove positively that such a thing has occurred, and it is evident from the speeches of other Deputies that it occurs all over the country.</P>

      <P>With other Deputies, I think that more care should be taken in the preparation of the voters' lists.  During the recent election several cases came under my notice where persons on the register had a business address and a private address, but when they came to vote they found that the register showed that they had elected to vote at their business address and also at their private address. I know of one instance where that occurred to a man who had been on the list for an unbroken period of at least 15 years.  When he presented himself at the polling station where he had been voting for 15 years he was not allowed to exercise the franchise. He then presented himself at the other polling station for his private address, but was not allowed to vote there either.  Some steps should be taken in cases of that sort by which the persons concerned would be able to exercise the franchise.  We have all been appealing to the people during the recent election to come to the poll whether they voted for our particular Party or not, and if the marking of the register precludes those who are anxious to vote from exercising the franchise it is a very great hardship which should be removed at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputies who have spoken as to the state of the register, but I cannot agree with the remedy proposed, that the Gárda Síochána should take up this duty.  The obstacle to that is that rate collectors in many cases are getting a poundage rate far below what they should get for collecting the rates, and the added remuneration given them for preparing the voters and jurors' lists only gives them what you might call a decent salary for the work they do.  If you take that duty away from them, it is more than likely that the cost of collecting the rates will materially increase, and possibly the rate collection will be in a far more unsatisfactory condition than it is at present.  This discussion may have a very beneficial effect by having registration work done better in the future.  I was going to suggest, in order to see who exactly is to blame, that the official copies of the register for the last General Election should be examined by some authority to see who were not on that should be on.  There is nothing in these documents to violate the secrecy of the ballot-box or anything like that.  By that means you could ascertain exactly what rate collector had been at fault and you could penalise him in some way.  I think the suggestion about the Gárda Síochána is not feasible until we are able to pay the rate collectors a decent wage for the actual collection of the rates.</P>

      <P>There is an aspect of this which certainly applies to the County Dublin register, but whether it applies to other registers or not I cannot say.  Numeroús errors of the kind came to my attention.  I do not think that the responsibility for them lies with the compiler of the register, but that they occurred between the compilation and the printing.  There were, for instance, cases like this: there would be three or four persons in a house belonging to one family with one of those new-fashioned double-barrelled names, let us say, Conroy-Murphy. The husband would appear as Conroy-Murphy, the wife as Murphy, and the daughter as Conroy. It should have been apparent to anybody <Col N="526" /> with intelligence that the three persons were members of the same family and had the same surname. When they went to the polling station and gave their correct name, I can imagine that they were turned away. I think a little care in the checking of the register would have been very well repaid with more accuracy.</P>

      <P>The complaints which Deputies have voiced with regard to the register have been fairly general. I think that there will always be a certain percentage of inaccuracies in the register.  If we were to aim at having an absolutely perfect register, the expense of ensuring it would be considerable. I do think, however, that there was carelessness that should not have occurred.  So far as the fault lay with the rate collector, we are not without a remedy.  We can take steps, and in relation to previous registers steps were taken, to ensure that a rate collector who did his work badly, or very negligently, was not paid.  I had a case cited to me of one rate collector who produced a very bad register and lost £50 as a result.  Where a rate collector deliberately stuffed the register it would be possible to take even more drastic steps.  When I was Minister for Local Government I think I dismissed two rate collectors by sealed order for stuffing the register.  Of course such drastic steps could not be taken unless the register was very bad indeed, or much worse, perhaps, than the register is in any part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The police have been asked to look at the lists, and to raise questions with the revising officer in, I think, all parts <Col N="527" /> of the country.  I know that in some places that was done.  In order to get satisfactory work from the police it might be necessary to throw more direct responsibility on them, and to give them some formal responsibility in connection with it, rather than simply have a private instruction go from their superior officer to look over the lists and raise any questions they think fit.  That is a matter that has been under consideration.  At one time the question of giving the work now being done by the rate collectors to the police was considered, but at the time of the passage of the Electoral Act the police were newly out in the country and no change was decided on. I can only say that, in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Justice, I will have the matter discussed, and see what further steps can be taken to ensure that the register will be as nearly perfect as it is possible to make it without any great increase of expense.</P>

The complaints do not find their way to headquarters in the county, or to the secretary of the county council.  The most satisfactory way of dealing with the matter is to make it a duty of the police.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,618 <Col N="528" /> be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1928, for certain Miscellaneous Expenses, including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The greater part of the increase in this Vote arises from an increase in the grant to the Royal Irish Academy.  Up to last year the grant paid to the Academy amounted to £1,600.  It was found impossible for the Academy to continue doing its work with the funds at its disposal.  A position had been reached when it was almost impossible for the Academy to carry on.  The library, which is a very valuable and extensive one, containing books not available elsewhere, was falling into a state of disrepair, and there was no margin of income available for the purpose of rebinding a great many books that absolutely required attention. Consequently an increase was made in the grant, with a view to enabling the Academy to undertake that work, to put the library into repair and to prevent a great number of valuable books from being lost or unfit for use.</P>
    <P>During the present year there was consideration of other work which it was thought the Academy ought to do and which it was very anxious to do. The most important work was the cataloguing of the invaluable collection of Irish manuscripts which the Academy possesses.  A great mass of irreplaceable and valuable Irish manuscripts are stored in the strong room of the Academy.  These manuscripts are bound in miscellaneous volumes, the contents of which have never been catalogued.  One of the greatest difficulties of students working on Irish manuscripts has been that it was impossible to know exactly what was in existence, or where any particular one was to be found.  Lately the Academy has begun the work of preparing and publishing a detailed and scholarly catalogue of these Irish manuscripts. The cost of preparing that particular catalogue and printing it will be about £640 yearly for the next five years.  In view of the renewed importance the national language is having in the life of the country, it is most desirable that these manuscripts should be catalogued, <Col N="529" /> and that we should be in the position that the utmost use can be made of them by scholars.  It is necessary also, in order that people interested in Irish scholarship may have the best opportunities of pursuing their studies in this country, that Irish manuscripts elsewhere should be photographed and that the facsimiles should be available here in Dublin.  The Academy, as a result of the increased grant now proposed, undertakes the acquirement of photographs or copies of valuable manuscripts elsewhere so that they may be available here.</P>
    <P>It is also the desire of the Academy to publish facsimiles of certain Irish texts.  That is a work that can go on very slowly.  It is a costly work.  The Academy's own funds cannot be increased. As a rule, I think it only elects seven new members yearly.  It endeavours to maintain amongst its members a reasonably high standard of scholarship.  It would not be possible for the Academy to augment its membership without introducing large numbers of people who would not have the knowledge or the interest that members of the Academy ought to have.  I discussed with members of the Council of the Academy the question of increasing the membership subscriptions.  As a matter of fact, there are many people interested in the work of the Academy who are now, perhaps, worse off than they were, as a result of the war and changed economic conditions.  The Academy has even experienced a certain inclination on the part of members, at any rate in odd cases, to retire because they feel they could not pay even the small subscriptions that are payable.</P>
    <P>The other increase is one of £250 to the Royal Zoological Society.  That Society suffered very severely during the European War, and it was only with the greatest difficulty that it was able to carry on at all.  Excursion trains from the country were not run, the attendance fell off, subscriptions diminished, the cost of feeding became dear, and, as a matter of fact, the Society has not been able to recover its position.  The change of Government has also, I think, inflicted a permanent loss on the Society, because people who <Col N="530" /> were in the British army or other British services in distant countries gave gifts of animals.</P>

      <P>I want to say a word with regard to sub-head (b)&mdash;the National Theatre Society&mdash;Grant-in-aid, £1,000.  I note that an explanation is given that this grant-in-aid is towards the expenses of the Abbey Theatre.  I would like that that should not be a limiting provision, because I am not sure that the time has not arrived when a condition should be made in respect of that grant-in-aid, that steps should be taken to extend the activities of the Society to the country, that is to say, that the company, or a company, should carry plays into the country and not confine their activities solely to Dublin.  It is frequently said that the Abbey Theatre is a national institution and that the contribution by way of a subsidy of £1,000 gives it a character more national even than it has by its name, and that the public who are contributors from other cities should have an opportunity of enjoying the theatrical fare provided by the company which usually plays in the Abbey.  I know that occasional visits are made to Cork, but I think these are mainly private ventures.</P>

      <P>I make the suggestion that something in the way of secondary companies which are, in fact, training companies, should be encouraged, and it might be considered <Col N="531" /> between now and, perhaps, next year whether something in the way of conditions should not be imposed, that the Society should endeavour to recruit new members for the purpose of promoting playing in the country districts or, at least, in the larger towns.  It is not fair, and it is not good for the dramatic interests of the country that this work should be confined to the Abbey Theatre.  I would like it to be understood that the phrase explanatory of the grant does not confine it to the Abbey Theatre, but that it could be applied to theatres other than the Abbey&mdash;I mean towards theatrical work in the country.</P>

      <P>I see the point of the Deputy's suggestion.  If the phrase referred to were held to be restrictive I would be in favour of altering it.  I know that the directors of the theatre are anxious to have a secondary company, and are at present constructing in the building, of which the Abbey Theatre is a part, a little theatre which would be used for the production of works of young dramatists which, perhaps, might not be regarded as being technically good enough to be produced in the Abbey.  This little theatre will also be used for the training of actors Vote put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>The most remarkable thing in connection with this Vote is the fact that it shows a reduction of £18,036 on the previous year.  That, I think, is an indication of the efficiency with which this Department is run. There has, in fact, been a continual reduction in this Vote since the year 1924-25.  The Estimate for the year 1924-25 was £187,029; in 1925-26 it was £170,385; in 1926-27 it was £155,325, and this year it is £137,289, showing over that period a reduction of about £50,000, which is very considerable and which reflects credit on the way in which the Department has been conducted during that time.  The other point to which I may call attention is the fact that the Department made a great effort to encourage Irish manufacture, and it has been very successful in that effort.  For a long time the Department availed, to a great extent, of the products of the Saggart mills, but unfortunately these mills are now closed and there is no alternative source of supply.  At present it is impossible to purchase Irish paper with the exception of brown wrapping paper, satisfactory supplies of which at favourable prices have recently been procured from home sources.</P>
      <P>It is hoped in the near future that the Saggart mills will again be opened and the Department will avail to the fullest extent of their products. Meanwhile, the Department has availed to a very great extent of supplies of other kinds of stationery materials and every avenue for the development of Irish stationery is being explored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Department at present obtains exclusively from Irish manufacturers its total supplies of: Writing and fountain pen inks; leather goods such as gusset bags, attaché cases, etc.; gum and office paste (with the exception of small supplies of specialised articles such as glucine); cords and twine for wrapping purposes; rubber stamps; ink-stands&mdash;wooden; ink baskets; <Col N="533" /> wooden rulers; metal filing boxes; metal cash boxes; metal deed boxes; metal damping tins; pocket diaries; wood and cord folio boxes; canvas bags; and metal seals.</P>
    <P>The expenditure in Ireland in printing and binding and envelopes amounted to £88,631 in 1926-27.  It is important to note that £58,577 of this amount represents the estimated payment to those actually employed such as printers, bookbinders, and so forth. I thought it well to call attention to this fact, as I think it is not generally known that we are availing of Irish manufactured articles to such a large extent in this Department.</P>

      <P>I intervene in this debate only to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on what I think I may call a model Estimate.  On almost every sub-head there are reductions, and on those in which there are increases Deputies who observe closely will see that they are in the nature of capital expenditure, that they are increases for the purpose of buying trucks, scales, carriage of stores, typewriters, duplicators, etc.  We may hope that they will not recur in future years. On the whole, there is a general reduction, and I think we may congratulate the Stationery Office in hoping to persuade the public to buy more of the debates of the Oireachtas for the forthcoming year than in the present year. Old Deputies who have observed the Estimates for this Office will, I think, agree with me when I say that there has been a steady reduction in expenditure, and also a steady increase in efficiency; that all the functions of the Stationery Office have been well done, and that it provides an example perhaps other Departments might profit by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what the Parliamentary Secretary said about the closing of the Clondalkin Paper Mill, I would urge on him, even if it is necessary to guarantee a certain consumption of paper to those mills, to try and give the employment in my constituency that is very badly needed.  The paper was good.  There are prospects, I think, of a loan under the Trades <Col N="534" /> Loan Guarantee Act, and if the Stationery Office could give some undertaking to take an amount of paper for a reasonable period, say, two or three years, it might very much facilitate the re-opening of these mills. If the paper is not good, if it is dearer than could be bought elsewhere, I do not ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do it, but if it is as good paper as you could get elsewhere then I think you should give preference to the Saorstát, and give an undertaking to use that paper in the public service. As even new Deputies know, the Dáil consumes an enormous amount of paper.  I believe we would prefer to use the paper produced in our own country.  I urge on the Minister if there are negotiations, and if some reasonable continuity of demand is required, that the Stationery Office should give that continuity of demand, not without conditions, not without satisfying itself that the paper can be obtained at a reasonable price, but under these conditions it ought to try and help an industry that is capable of giving considerable employment.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be able to say that my experience of this Department has been that it has endeavoured at all times to give the greatest support possible to Irish products.  I regret that Deputy Cooper was a little astray when he spoke of the Clondalkin mill.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the Saggart mill, which is smaller, and yet quite an important undertaking.  I hope he will be able to give us a little more confidence in his expectation that the Saggart mill may be reopened, and perhaps he might go even a little further and tell us what the expectations are with regard to the Clondalkin mill. It might be used, to some degree at any rate, for the printing of paper required by this Department.  I know that the Department has been interested in both of these mills.  Though it may be a little bit wide of the mark, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could help the House by stating whether there is any possibility of the Clondalkin mill as well as the Saggart mill being reopened. The figure the Parliamentary <Col N="535" /> Secretary has given regarding the purchase of Irish manufactured goods, and the work of printing, is satisfactory, but it would be greatly increased for the future by the re-opening of these mills. I know the Secretary will help as far as it is in his power, by setting standards, and perhaps promoting the use throughout of certain standardised shapes, sizes, patterns and quality of papers.  That would make the work of the factory very much more successful than it has been in the past.  I think the Stationery Office could do a considerable amount in that direction.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with the two Deputies who have just spoken in a plea to the Ministry to endeavour to do something to give employment by the production of Irish paper.  Digressing, if I might for a moment, when discussing the insurance problem the other day I did not find myself in complete agreement with my friends on the other side of the House, but on the point now at issue I find myself in complete harmony.  There can be no doubt that the really pressing need at the moment is to find work for the workless.  I think it is a most regrettable state of affairs, considering the quantity of paper we are using and the quantity of paper that necessarily we are importing, that we are able to obtain no home manufactured paper except brown paper.  I think the suggestion put forward by Deputy Cooper merits very sympathetic consideration.  I do not think it would really amount to much if the Stationery Department had to pay even a somewhat higher price for supplies. I have no doubt that if Deputy Cooper's suggestion could be agreed to, that is, to undertake to take a reasonable amount from the Saggart mills, and also to give continuity of demand, that it would not be losing money but, on the contrary, gaining it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper made one proviso. He said he would not ask the Minister to do this if he were informed that the paper was not good.  My colleague on my right informs me that he has obtained paper from this mill and that its quality is unequalled.  I say that Deputy Cooper's suggestion should receive <Col N="536" /> very sympathetic consideration from the Minister when he is arranging for the buying of paper.</P>

I wrote many letters on it in Australia, and it seemed to me to be equal, and even superior, to the paper of Australia.  I would certainly include Saggart with Clondalkin, and I would also include other mills in the Saorstát, if there are other mills that can produce the kind of paper that is required.  My views are not confined to mills in my constituency; I think we should use all the Irish paper possible, to try to give employment.</P>

It certainly has no fault to find with the paper, which is of excellent quality.  The Stationery Office is actively interested in the reopening of Saggart and Clondalkin mills, and all the available information at our disposal is being given to those interested in their reopening.  During the last year in which the Saggart mills were operating, the Stationery Office doubled its orders to it, so that our attitude all along has been most sympathetic.  It is expected that the Saggart mills will be able to reopen shortly.  I understand that some hitch has occurred that will prevent the Clondalkin mills from opening for some time.  That is our information at the moment.  We are prepared to do everything in our power to facilitate the opening of both of these mills. Vote put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>There is very little change in this Vote.  The increase under sub-head A is due to annual increments of salary and to an extra week's payment to the weekly wage-earners, there being fifty-three pay days in the present financial year instead of fifty-two.  The travelling expenses are fixed at a figure which on the best estimation is what is required for the present year.  The expenditure really depends on the location and the number of cases that are submitted to the Department, but in the past financial year the actual expenditure was a little under £4,700, so that it is thought that the sum set down will be sufficient.  In the year previous it was just £37 over £4,800. The chief statutory duty of the Valuation Department is to carry out the revision of tenements if so requested <Col N="538" /> by local authorities, and the rating authorities in each year supply lists indicating the provisions required.  To carry out this work valuers are sent to every district, and an investigation is made in each case in which a revision is requested.  When appeals are made against a valuation fixed, a further visit, in each case by a different valuer, is necessitated.  If the appellant is dissatisfied with the result of that first appeal he proceeds to the Circuit Court, and a valuer is sent to the Court to give evidence.  Valuations are carried out by the Valuation Department for Estate Duty purposes, and under the Rent Acts when revisions of valuations are made, on application to the Valuation Office the services of a valuation officer are obtained.  The Appropriations-in-Aid consist principally of the fixed contributions that are paid by the various counties for the work of the Valuation Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During the year the reorganisation of the staff of the Ordnance Survey has been carried out.  That reorganisation was in contemplation when the Office was carried over, and has been in contemplation ever since the setting up of the Saorstát.  It was delayed pending an inquiry, which has been completed, except in one respect, into the work of the Office and into the question as to whether material had not been removed on the change of Government <Col N="539" /> from the Ordnance Survey which should not have been removed.  On the transfer of the service on April 1st, 1922, the staff of the Ordnance Survey numbered 214.  Subsequently thirty-two victimised officers, who had been discharged during the British régime, were reinstated.  This brought the total number of officers up to 246.</P>
    <P>Since that date deaths and retirements have reduced the numbers to 216.  The establishment fixed under the reorganisation is 182.  The Vote, therefore, at the present time does not give an exact picture of the cost of this particular service, because there is provision in the Estimates for 216 people, but there are only 182 actually working in this office.  The remainder have been sent on loan to various other departments, and as soon as possible these men who are not required in the Ordnance Survey will be definitely transferred to those other departments and their salaries will cease to be borne on the Ordnance Survey Vote.  Reorganisation has involved the abolition of a great and complicated variety of rates of pay which seems to have been related in some way to the pay of men in the engineering corps of the British Army.  The new rates of pay which are being established here are lower than the corresponding scales paid for similar work by the British in their Ordnance Survey Office, and the cost of our survey will be much cheaper than it would have been if the British had reorganised the staff as they did the staffs of nearly every Government department before the change over.</P>
    <P>The Committee to which I have referred was appointed on the 31st March, 1925, and presented an interim report on the 31st May, 1926.  The interim report of the Committee recorded its definite finding on all except two points.  One was the adequacy of the Trigonometrical data available at the Ordnance Survey, Dublin, and secondly the necessity or advisability of undertaking a re-survey based on what is termed geodetical levelling in Ireland The Committee have not proceeded further with their work.  The Chairman, <Col N="540" /> Mr. Sears, has ceased to be a member of the Dáil, but the Commissioner of Valuation, who is head of the Ordnance Survey, has made as careful inquiries as possible into these reserved matters, and he states he has satisfied himself that the requisite data relating to the Trigonometrical Surveys are available in the Ordnance Survey, and that in reference to the Geodetical Survey the cost would be forty or fifty thousand pounds.  The opinion of the Commissioner of Valuation is that it would be a costly luxury which might perhaps produce some trivial improvement in the accuracy of the survey-maps but which is not required and which would not justify the expense.</P>
    <P>One of the engineer members of the Committee, Mr. O'Dwyer, agrees with that, and we have not yet ascertained the views of Professor Purcell, who is absent in London.  I think it is most probable that the Committee will not think it necessary to proceed with any further investigations.  However, an effort will be made to get the Committee to come together and to consider these points and make a final report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that in this debate Deputy Johnson is referring to the matter of the agricultural grant going towards the relief of rates on agricultural land.  Why is it going towards the relief of rates on agricultural land?  Because the rates on agricultural land have increased by leaps and bounds since the first grant was made in 1898.  The expense of the Poor Law system and Home Help is at least three times as great now as it was then.  The maintenance of our roads, lighting, water schemes and so on for the benefit of the people represented, to some extent, by Deputy Johnson and his Party in this House have increased in cost and are to-day, in some cases, four times as high as when the first relief was given.  Something like 1/2 in the £ relief was given to rates in 1898, and the agricultural land was paying another 1/2 then. How do these figures compare all through the years?  The 1/2 went up to 2/4, to 4/8 and to 9/6, but still on the other side the other 1/2 remained.  The <Col N="542" /> cost of these services, which are public utility services that benefit men in the labourers' cottages and benefit the urban workers, are paid for by the ratepayers of the counties.  I might even go farther and say that other services are also paid for by the ratepayers of the different counties, to a very great extent services which are, in fact, not local but are really national services.  Deputy Johnson and his Party comment on the benefit that has been given to the farmers through means of the Supplementary Agricultural Grant.  This supplementary grant was long overdue.  For very many years indeed the farmers, out of their limited resources, were maintaining services at a standard far above their means.  I think Deputy Johnson knows that, and every Deputy here knows that as well as the Deputies on the benches where I sit.  Every Deputy who has had to do with local administration knows that if this supplementary grant had not been forthcoming the maintenance of local services throughout the country would have to be reconsidered from the taxpayers' point of view and from the point of view of the ability of the local taxpayer to maintain them at all. The ability of the taxpayer to do so was very questionable. We have reached that state in local administration.  Every service that Deputy Johnson's Party would like to have maintained could not be maintained if we were to depend on the people who pay the local rates.  The charges for these services have gone up far beyond what the people could pay.  The one section that has benefited by these services is the section represented in this House by Deputy Johnson, and if the Deputy is as fair in this as he is in other matters I think he will admit the truth of what I say. I am glad I got the opportunity of saying this.</P>

      <P>I am in the position that I am not opposing this grant and therein lies the difference between my attitude and the attitude of Deputy Baxter.  I say that the farmers are entitled, to this relief, and Deputy Baxter might have admitted that the unemployed workmen were entitled to <Col N="543" /> an increase in the unemployment benefit which they were going to pay back; and that is the essential difference between the two cases.  Deputy Baxter has talked about an increase in Poor Law charges, but he is going to have a greater increase in Poor Law charges by reason of the fact that he voted against the increase in unemployment benefit.</P>

      <P>During the recent election, members of Deputy Johnson's Party claimed that they represented the farmers.  Well, I think the farmers may well answer: &ldquo;save us from our friends.&rdquo;  Statements were made from the Labour benches that farm produce was up 200 per cent.  That statement is absolutely unproved.  The official records show that farm produce is on an average up 30 or 40 per cent.  Those who go to fairs, as I do very frequently, know well that a great many of the more important articles of produce are scarcely above pre-war rate. It is not necessary for me to go over the ground covered by Deputy Baxter, but in one word I will show what this increase in rates is.  When I first became a member of the Cork County Council, the total rate levied by the Council was considerably less than £200,000.  This year it is £450,000.  As Deputy Baxter has stated, a great many public services have been forced on the farmers.  Farmers have to pay for them.  I need not tell this House, nor need I tell Deputy Johnson, that if you follow it to its ultimate you will find that 90 per cent. of the money in Ireland is created or brought into the country by the farmers.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £45,388 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1928, for the expenses of Criminal Prosecutions and other Law Charges, including a Grant in relief of certain Expenses payable by Statute out of Local Rates.</P>
    <P>This Estimate, if we take out of account an Exchequer advance which was made last year in connection with the deposit which was required to be made in the matter of the American litigation, is very little changed.  The increase in sub-head A is due to the increments of salary and the employment of an additional copying typist in the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office which was necessitated by the additional pressure of work.  With regard to sub-head B, an assistant solicitor was appointed in the Treasury Solicitor's Office, and the number of clerical officers was increased from four to five. There is a reduction in the amounts for clerical assistance.  The Chief State Solicitor's Office is concerned mainly with the question of prosecutions.  The Treasury's Solicitor's Office does the work which arises out of the activities of the Commissioners of Public Works, the investigation of titles and the preparation of deeds charges and so forth in reference to land improvement and other loans and in the recovery of arrears.  He does the legal work involved in awards under the Drainage Act and the legal work arising out of the provision of accommodation and the acquisition of premises for the Gárda Síochána.  He also does the work which arises in connection with the Valuation Office and the Quit Rent Office.  What I have said indicates roughly the line of division between the legal work that exists between the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Treasury Solicitor's Office.  There is <Col N="545" /> a reduction in the provision for Under-Sheriffs owing to vacancies arising in the Office of Under-Sheriff in Wexford, Offaly and Waterford not having been filled.  The duty of these offices will be discharged by the County Registrars in accordance with the provision of the Court Officers Act of 1926.</P>
    <P>The provision for the expenses of prosecutors and witnesses is down.  The provision in this sub-head is mainly for recoupment to county and county borough councils in respect of expenses of prosecutors and witnesses at the Circuit Court and Central Criminal Court in cases of felony, which are a statutory charge on the local rates.  The provision here is more than the normal provision and includes a substantial element of arrears which have not been discharged.  The fact that these arrears exist is largely due to claims not having been made by the local authorities in proper time.  It is anticipated the normal amount instead of being £10,000 will be between £5,000 and £6,000 a year.  Included in the total figure of £11,500 there are other small items, such as the payment of subsistence allowances to witnesses in criminal cases in the District Courts and the calling in of medical practitioners in what the Gárda Síochána believe to be cases that may prove to be criminal cases, and payments to architects and engineers and other experts for the preparation of maps, plans, and models, and for giving expert evidence in connection with prosecutions.</P>

      <P>The fees of counsel include not merely prosecutions in the higher courts, but also fees payable for appearances for the State in departmental cases.  Of course, the great bulk of the fees is in connection with the criminal cases.  As regards sub-head F, which shows an increase of £1,490, the estimate is based on the expenditure of 1925-26 and 1926-27. Under this sub-head are included the various expenses connected with juries. When jurors are locked up for the night, vouched expenditure is allowed to cover the expenses of each juryman. <Col N="546" /> the sum not exceeding one guinea.  This covers all hotel expenses and other expenses in connection with the detention of jurymen not exceeding a period of 24 hours.  It also provides for the provision of meals for jurymen in other cases where they are not locked up for the night, but where the court orders meals.  It makes provision for the reports of judgments and the transcript of evidence, and also provides the money out of which counsel and solicitor are assigned, where they are assigned by the judge, to defend a poor prisoner indicted for murder. Provision is also made in this sub-head for the defence of prisoners in the pretruce period in cases where the cost of the defence was paid out of old Dáil funds; that is, cases which might have involved a capital sentence.</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-head G&mdash;expenses of litigation about Dáil funds&mdash; I am not yet able to indicate to the Dáil the amount of the total expenses of the litigation.  So far about £9,000 has been paid, and other bills have been received for sums of £2,000, and additional bills will be received.  In addition to the £9,000 which has already been paid out of voted moneys, a sum of something like five thousand dollars was paid out of the old Dáil funds prior to the winding up of that fund.  The expenses actually paid so far in the American action are £7,074, and in the action at home, £2,023.  There was paid on the 13th January, 1923, out of the old Dáil funds, a sum of five thousand five hundred and ninety-eight dollars.  I do not know what that represented in pounds at the time. There was also the sum in reference to which a vote was taken last year, of fifty thousand dollars, and £11,167 13s. 11d. had to be lodged in court as a security.  It was stated that would be repaid.</P>

      <P>It would seem to be more appropriate that these charges should be within the purview of the Minister for Justice.  I do not know how far I would be entitled to direct the Minister's attention to questions of policy.  I do not know how far the Minister for Finance would be prepared to answer questions of policy. There are two matters I would like to <Col N="547" /> refer to and they come under sub-head C. and sub-head E.  As the Minister has said, there is a reduction in the amount payable to under-sheriffs for the reason that on either the death or resignation of certain under-sheriffs, their work has to be done by County Registrars.  I have received complaints from the County Registrars of the excessive amount of work they have been asked to do in this regard, especially during the election period when they had to undertake the whole work in connection with the register.  I do not know how far the Minister is in a position to say whether it is the intention of the Government in future to adopt and continue this policy of asking the County Registrars to do this extra work, especially without any extra remuneration. I know that their time has been very fully occupied.  There is one instance I have in mind where the County Registrar had to attend in court at the time the Circuit Court was on, and he also had to attend to this work entailed by the election which occurred at the same time.</P>
      <P>Whatever Department is in charge of this matter should, I think, be prepared to investigate it.  The other question is one in regard not to the amount of the fees that are being paid to counsel under sub-head (E), but rather to the policy which has been adopted regarding State prosecutions.  Again I say I think there is a difficulty in dealing with this matter, because it seems to me to come within the purview of the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might be allowed to say a word on this matter. This Vote is accounted for by the Minister for Finance, because I think he has nothing to do with it.  The Attorney-General answers to the President, and the President is the Minister who would speak on anything affecting the office of the Attorney-General or the office of the Parliamentary Draftsman. So far as County Registrars and under-sheriffs are concerned, the Minister for Justice would speak for them.  Perhaps I need not express an opinion on the point of order, but I just mention that what may be the reason why this is accounted for by the Department of Finance is that it involves a considerable amount of expenditure.  The officers whose salaries are provided for are responsible to different Ministers. Anything that has to do with the Attorney-General's office would, I think, be answered by the President, and perhaps might be raised on the President's Vote.</P>

      <P>Under sub-head D the expenses of prosecutors and witnesses at assizes, Circuit Courts and District Courts for the year 1927-28 are given as £11,500, while last year the figure was £10,000.  That represents an increase of £1,500 on this item alone for this year.  I desire to bring to the notice of the Minister that there are a large number of small and insignificant cases returned by the District Justices for trial to the Circuit Courts where there is no hope of a conviction being secured and where you have a large number of professional and other witnesses brought to give evidence. This occurs not only in the county I come from, but in other counties.  We look upon it as nothing short of a public scandal to see twopence-half-penny cases that could be easily decided by the District Justice, if he had the power to do it under the District Court Rules, sent forward for trial to the Circuit Courts with an army of witnesses brought, say, from Inishowen to Lifford and from Rosses to Donegal and other parts of the county.  All this money could be saved if reasonable commonsense was exercised, and if our suggestions were adopted at the time that the District Court rules were going through this House and before they were finally approved of.  The accused persons sent forward for trial in these <Col N="550" /> twopence-halfpenny cases are invariably discharged or the jury finds them not guilty.  The whole prosecution from beginning to end is not worth anything like that.  What is happening is that the ratepayers' money is being squandered in this way.  This matter was brought to the notice of this House on two or three occasions by Deputies on these benches, but we got very little satisfaction and very little courtesy.  We alleged and we asserted at the time that adequate time was not given for the discussion of these District and Circuit Court rules. The flaws are now beginning to be discovered. This is a very serious matter and one that is of very much importance to the taxpayers of the country. It is something that the Minister should take a note of and see if anything can be done or have the law amended.</P>

I certainly am not able to give the Deputy any satisfaction in regard to the matter.  I think what Deputy Redmond first raised in regard to the county registrars might be raised on the salary of the Minister for Justice.  I might say that the intention is that the county registrars should do the work hitherto done by the under-sheriffs.  I think they all understood that on their appointments: that they would have to do that work as vacancies in the ranks of the under-sheriffs occurred.  It may be that great difficulty was experienced by these officers in doing their normal work during the election, because of the extra duties that fell on them, but elections occur comparatively rarely and one would not appoint an undersheriff simply in order that a county registrar might be relieved once in five years of these duties, which are so difficult to discharge during an election time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>This dockyard was taken over from the British Admiralty on the 1st April, 1923.  Owing to the great depression in the ship-building industry it has not been found possible either to dispose of it or to make any extensive use of it. This Estimate provides for the maintenance of the dockyard as economically as is consistent with keeping the buildings, plant and machinery in good condition.  The charge of maintaining this particular yard appears in the Estimate rather high.  That is accounted for by the fact that it is a pretty extensive yard and also by the fact that it is constructed on sandhills. There is great difficulty in keeping it free from water, and it needs continual drainage.</P>
      <P>The main heads under which expenditure is necessary are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Maintenance of buildings (Machine shops, stores, residences, dock, jetties, wharves, slips, etc.).</P>
      <P>(b)  Maintenance of plant and machinery in 22 machine shops.</P>
      <P>(c)  Lighting.</P>
      <P>(d)  Ferry service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the present Haulbowline has contained the only military hospital <Col N="552" /> in the South of Ireland.  The hospital at Collins Barracks, Cork, has now, however, been rebuilt by the Board of Works, and it is expected that the staff and patients at Haulbowline hospital will be moved to Collins Barracks by the end of June.  It is hoped that it will then be possible to reduce appreciably the expenditure on Haulbowline, and the question of its ultimate disposal will be taken up.</P>
    <P>The net amount of the Estimate is £16,900 as compared with £15,000 last year, an increase of £1,700.  Of this increase £1,220 on sub-head A is due to the loss of the Army contribution towards overhead expenditure arising out of the vacation of the Hospital by the military above referred to, and £480 under sub-head C is due to the higher cost of coal.  The Estimate includes provision for a staff of 88, consisting of tradesmen, labourers, etc., in addition to four supervising foremen.</P>
    <P>The dockyard is occasionally asked in an emergency to undertake a ship-repairing job for an outside firm, or for a Government Department.  Such work is charged for at cost, plus a percentage for overhead expenses.  It is impossible to say with any exactness what amount of such work may be undertaken in any year.  A token figure of £100 has therefore been included (sub-head B) as the cost of such work and a similar token figure included in sub-head D (Appropriations-in-Aid) for the receipts from such work.</P>
    <P>Owing to the fact that this dockyard was designed mainly for the construction of battleships it has not been found economic for the repair of merchant ships in many cases.  For that reason the dockyard is not as popular with sea-going craft as might be expected. Ninety men are engaged at Haulbowline under the charge of two supervising officers, and this has been found to be the minimum number with which the services and maintenance work proper could be carried out.  The staff consists of:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  A number of skilled mechanies of various trades, fully occupied on running repairs to ferry boats and working machinery, including the Electric Station supplying light to the Military <Col N="553" /> Hospital on the Island, the residents' houses, and light and power to the shops and yard.</P>
    <P>(b)  Seamen, engineers and labourers engaged on the ferry service between the Island and Cobh.</P>
    <P>(c)  Skilled tradesmen and labourers engaged on maintenance work proper, which includes maintenance of buildings, watermains and floating plant.</P>
    <P>(d)  Clerical staff and storekeepers.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>In addition to the Island there are certain wharves and piers on the mainland for which Haulbowline is responsible, and one of these works, Admiralty Pier, Cobh, was practically rebuilt by the Haulbowline staff in 1925.</P>
    <P>The staff also, from time to time, undertakes work on Government ships. The S.S. &ldquo;Tartar&rdquo; was overhauled at Haulbowline in 1925 at a cost of £603, and the steam tug &ldquo;Dainty&rdquo; is being reconditioned, work being done on her as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, however, that the cost of maintaining this particular dockyard is very considerable, and it is no easy matter to find the best solution for the problem.  Under more favourable conditions the yard might be a valuable asset to the State, but at present, to some extent, it may be regarded as a white elephant.</P>

Does the cost of that repair appear in any other account?  I referred back to the Appropriation Accounts circulated some little time ago, and I can see no reference to receipts to the Exchequer in respect to repairs of the vessel at Haulbowline.</P>

      <P>I did not quite catch everything the Parliamentary Secretary has said, but I would like to draw the attention of the House to the question of the future of Haulbowline itself.  It is a matter of very grave concern to the people of that district. Since the industrial stagnation has set in in Haulbowline after the British evacuation districts such as Passage, Monkstown, Cobh, and even Cork City have suffered very seriously.  Very definite promises were made during the election period by certain Government candidates as to the future of Haulbowline as a centre of industrial activity.  So far as I am concerned, and the Labour Party are concerned, we are prepared to help any efforts in the direction of establishing any industry in Haulbowline if a ship-building industry cannot be established there.</P>
      <P>Now it has been stated during that campaign that the Government had intentions, and it was stated very definitely what the intentions of the Government were, namely, that it was the intention to establish an industry for the manufacture of wireless apparatus and accessories.  Again it was stated that there would be an industry established for the purpose of the manufacture of electrical fittings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like that some indication should come from the Department concerned that these promises would be fulfilled, even partially fulfilled.  I have no doubt at all of the sincerity of the gentlemen who made these statements. As I have already said, every help that I can give and every help that can be given from these benches, will be given in that direction.  I hope that we in Cork, at any rate, and particularly in the districts immediately affected, will <Col N="555" /> get some indication that some effort will be made to have these promises fulfilled.  I listened to the Minister for Industry and Commerce the other day giving the figures from the live register of employment, but I want to inform the House that I know personally numbers of people in that district who have not got any work for the last four or five years.  Poverty is rampant in that district.  I am not drawing on my imagination. I do not want to paint any lurid picture of the poverty that exists there, but I can produce evidence of starvation practically in some districts in the area.  I know at least of one Minister who visited that district and made these promises, and I hope that something will be done to carry out these promises.  For my part, I promise that I will assist in every way.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Anthony referred to the manufacture of wireless apparatus, I am afraid he was treading on ground beyond the sphere of my influence.  The same confusion in regard to the ambit of different Ministries occurred before, and we are getting on to that ground again.  It is the intention of the Board of Works to do everything possible to dispose of this yard with advantage, not to the Government but to the people who are seeking work in that particular neighbourhood. As I have said, it is mainly owing to the fact that there was considerable depression in the shipbuilding industry that we have not been successful in our efforts up to the present. Several firms were negotiating with us about this matter before, but owing to the prevailing condition, the negotiations have not been successful.  One of the reasons we are maintaining these yards, at the present time, is to keep the present staff of over 90 workmen employed.  We cannot lay down any definite scheme for the future development of this yard.  We are open to receive suggestions, if anyone can bring <Col N="556" /> forward helpful suggestions in connection with this matter.  Several Deputies have been in touch with the Department for a considerable time trying to find if a solution is possible, but there is no good in making promises here that cannot be carried out.</P>

      <P>I, too, was near Haulbowline in the season for making wild promises.  I was asked if anything could be done in the near future to assist in creating some industry there that would replace the great industry that existed there when the British troops were in this country.  Ships were repaired there, and men earned from £5 to £7 per week.  Many of these men are now on the verge of starvation. I met some of them myself.  It is an excellent place for any industry. A few days ago the President stated that a loan would shortly be raised to enable waterworks to be carried out in various places by sanitary authorities. Could a national foundry not be established there for making water-pipes for these schemes?  The yard is just at the mouth of the harbour.  It would also be a good place for developing the fish-curing industry.  There are plenty of fish there at our doors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I desire to support Deputy Anthony's statement that there is no part of Ireland that has suffered more than Haulbowline, Cobh, Passage, and the surrounding districts owing to the departure of the British Navy from Cork Harbour.  I would like to impress upon the President&mdash;I know he was serious the other day when he was speaking, as he always is&mdash;that an industry might be established in Haulbowline, in connection with the water schemes which are to be started in various parts of the country.  One of the chief objections to schemes of this kind is that most of the money is sent across to <Col N="557" /> England for the purchase of pipes.  I would ask that Haulbowline be selected as a site for a factory to manufacture these pipes.  Then there will be no objection to any of these schemes, no matter where they are started.</P>

The Commissioner who was administering the Poor Law in South Cork last year exceeded his estimate by £14,000, which will have to be found by the people of the county.  That was to provide for distress almost entirely in the neighbourhood of Passage, the place to which Deputy Anthony alluded.  I really think, even if some temporary loss were incurred, it would be justified in the attempt to create an industry of some kind in this particular place.</P>

Deputy Doyle reminds me that this Vote has appeared in the Estimates since he came here. Since then, it has been a loss to the Exchequer.  Deputy Anthony on one side, has stated that Cork labour is very anxious to do everything possible to get an industry going there.  I do not know who will speak for the capitalists of Cork in order to show how keen they are about the starting of an industry.

    <P>The provision in this year's Estimate will be the normal provision for some time to come.  Originally the grants for the three colleges mainly concerned were University College, Dublin, £32,000; Cork College, £30,000; Galway College, £12,000.  During and after the European War, with the fall in the value of money, additional grants had to be given.  Last year a new arrangement was made, when the ordinary work of the College of Science was transferred to University College, Dublin, and the normal grant to University College, Dublin, was increased to £82,000.  At the same time, the Cork grant was increased to £40,000.  We were not at that time able to make any proposals in regard to Galway, but, subsequently, it was decided that the total annual grant to Galway should be £28,000.  It was promised during the last Dáil that an Act would be passed fixing the <Col N="560" /> amount of the income of Galway College in the same way as the income of the other two Colleges had been fixed. The amount under sub-head A is greater this year than last year, because the transfer of the College of Science was not effected until a certain number of months of the financial year had elapsed.  Consequently, the grant given to University College, Dublin, last year was not a full year's grant. Part of the expense of running the College of Science before the transfer was paid out of the Science and Art Grant.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £198,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1928, for payment of Subsidy in respect of Beet Sugar (No. 37 of 1925).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision in the estimate is for a total production of slightly over 13,000 tons.  It is well to say at this stage that it may be that that sum will not be sufficient and that an additional sum will have to be provided.  It is not possible to say what that additional sum will be.  It will depend partly on the yield of this year's beet crop and on the sugar-content of the beet actually supplied to the factory.  The total amount paid by way of subsidy last year was £181,502 4s. 9d.  That was less than the total sum voted, including both the original and supplementary estimates.  The subsidy was paid on 11,979½ tons of sugar.  There is no limit on the amount of sugar that the factory may produce and on which a subsidy may be paid during the first three years.  But in the two years following, the subsidy will only be paid on 10,000 tons of sugar, and in any one <Col N="561" /> of the last five years on 15,000 tons of sugar, but it will not be paid during the whole period on more than 125,000 tons.  Therefore, if it is paid on more than 12,500 tons in any one of the first three years, the amount on which the subsidy may be paid in subsequent years will be reduced.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the success of the factory was greatly facilitated by the fact that during the first years there was no limit on the amount on which the subsidy might be paid, so that the factory was able to go out and do its best to get growers.  For a long time it did not seem as if it would be able to get sufficient growers, but it was able to go all out for getting growers and was not compelled to make any nice calculations as to whether the acceptance of growers would lead to exceeding some limited figure or not.</P>

      <P>No decision could be come to until we had experience of another year's working, or perhaps two years' working, because we do not know exactly what profits a company may rely on.  We do not know what may turn out over a number of years to be the average yield of sugar, or the average yield of beet, or the difficulties factories may encounter in their working. The audited accounts of this particular factory will be presented to the Minister for Finance in respect of the first year's working some time before the end of September, next, and when we have that set of accounts, including the profit and loss account, and when we have, perhaps, another set of accounts, we will then be in a position to see what exactly are the prospects of the industry, what subsidy it would be reasonable to offer a subsequent factory, and what are the prospects of the industry becoming established here, so that it could carry on on some very low subsidy, or perhaps ultimately <Col N="562" /> without subsidy at all.  But I do not think that we would be justified in agreeing to the erection of another factory until we had some further experience. The experience of the first year was, of course, extremely encouraging. It was an experience that would lead us to believe that we would be justified in agreeing to the establishment of further factories, and that the industry will become a most important one here. But it might happen that last year was an altogether exceptional year, and that the results over a period might be very much less satisfactory.  In any case, while we can take the utmost encouragement from the results of the first year, we would require further experience before it would be fair to agree to the opening of another factory. We require more experience in order to know what would be the amount of the subsidy that we might reasonably agree to.  We had to agree to a high rate of subsidy in order to induce people to come in here, where no sugar beet had been grown, where nobody knew what difficulties would be encountered, but a subsequent factory would not be entitled to receive anything like the present subsidy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the latter point, I could not give the information. I would say that one of the most important ways, of impressing Irish farmers with the value of the pulp would be to let them know that American people were willing to buy and use it.  I happened to have a conversation with some of the officials of the factory about this question of the use of the pulp early in the last campaign, and they told me at that time for the first year or two they were not very hopeful of being able to dispose of anything like the whole of the pulp here, but that they did believe that in the course of a few years farmers here would become familiar with its value and certainly take a very large proportion of it.  I understand, as a matter of fact, that the English factories have had to send a large proportion of their dried pulp to America.  As to the question of price, I could not give any information to the Deputy at present, but you could not expect at any time that they should sell the pulp here at less than market price.  I do not think that it would be desirable that pressure should be put on them in regard to the price at which they should sell the products.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the statements that were made in connection with the starting of a factory, and the extremely high subsidy that is being paid, I think I am entitled to the information.  I am not guaranteeing the accuracy of this, but I have been told that it was sold more cheaply to the Americans than it was offered to the Irish farmers.  In view of the fact that Messrs.  Lippens are getting a subsidy higher than the first cost of the article, higher than the article could actually be bought for, I think that the Irish farmers are not being treated fairly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like a little more information as to this decision which the Minister has announced&mdash;<Col N="564" /> that the Government are not prepared to consider the question of a second factory before September, 1928.  I should like to know when that decision was come to&mdash;whether it is since the election or before the election.  If since the election, whether we can take it to be irrevocable; whether it is the new Executive which has come to the decision, and whether it is unconditional. For instance, there has been an increase in the price of sugar within the last year since the factory was first mooted.  The price may continue to be high and it may even rise further. There are possibilities that other people may offer to establish a factory here and be prepared to go into the business for a much less subsidy.  They may even offer a rate of subsidy which they would be prepared to build at.  Are we to take it that in no case is the Government prepared to consider the erection of a second factory until after two years' experience and two years' accounts have been presented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure it will be received with dismay by many people in Cork County that the Ministry have no thought of assisting the establishment of another factory until at least September, 1928, because they were certainly given to understand that there were immediate possibilities in that direction.  I think that in Offaly and other parts of the country similar projects were held out as likely possibilities.  But Cork particularly is interested in this matter; they have almost begun to consider who is going to get employment in the factory. If we are to have it now definitely as a matter of Executive decision that no consideration is to be given to the licensing of another factory before the second year's experience has been shown in accounts&mdash;that is September. 1928&mdash;then the people of Cork will know exactly where they are, and they will not be building upon a false foundation. There are undoubtedly parties interested at present and seeking information as to the possibilities of getting a licence for building a new factory, and I think we should have some information as to the conditions which accompanied this decision&mdash;whether there are any conditions or not, or whether it is a complete denial of any <Col N="565" /> possibility that a new factory will be established anywhere until the second year's experience has been proved.</P>

If we are to come to business we cannot discuss it in this way.  The factory has been started for one years and we have got certain results.  These results are encouraging, but as anyone who knows anything about agriculture realises, one year's experience of a crop is no good. Two years' experience of a crop teaches you a lot, and three years' experience teaches you a lot more.  In order not to be argumentative, let me put it this way: We will know in two or three years a lot more about the crop than we know now.

      <P>At a time when everyone wants economy, just for the sake of a little political capital, everyone rushes in and wants to know are we going to spend money immediately subsidising beet factories in every county.  That is what it comes to.  We must do things on a general principle. We cannot take out one county, no matter how deserving, and subsidise a factory there.  We are told now we are to rush and subsidise a factory, and not wait a year to get experience that would be invaluable to us if we could have it.  All that comes from people who complain of the high subsidy for the first factory.  I do not consider any subsidy too high for the first factory.</P>

      <P>Provided you are sure of getting exactly what you want. What you wanted for the first factory was the very last thing in technical competence.  Any money spent in the way of buying technical competence would be money well spent.  To extend the subsidy or anything like the subsidy you had to expend on the first factory to a number of factories, when the enterprise became a commercial proposition, would be the last thing in waste.  Yet, you have the same people who complain of the subsidy on the first factory anxious that we should rush in and start further factories, and subsidise them, and that we are, with the insufficient data of the first year, to consider what we are to give some foreigner to start another factory here. Deputy O'Gorman said this was an extravagant subsidy.  That is a question on which I would like to say one word.  It has been repeated all over the country.  Is it an extravagant subsidy? Consider the subsidy in England. People will say analogies lead nowhere in this, but I think they do, because even the sugar beet industry is competitive. Consider the industry in England. What is the average for 10 years, from 1922 to 1932 in England where they have fourteen years' experience, where there is no insecurity, in a country where money can be invested? It is 22/6 per cwt.  What is our average? 23/-.</P>
