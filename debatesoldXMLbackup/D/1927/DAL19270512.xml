      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he can produce the agreements arrived at between certain ex-members of the Railway Protection Repair and Maintenance Corps (Class 1) residing at Inchicore, Dublin, and referred to by him in the Dáil on Friday, 29th April, 1927; also pay books and pay sheets of the men concerned, and whether he will give the date on which the discharge papers referred to on same date, were scrapped.</P>

      <P>In regard to the agreements with the men referred to, the Deputy presumably refers to the forms of attestation signed by these men.  A copy of such attestation form <Col N="2328" /> will be furnished on request.  The pay books and receipts of the men concerned can be inspected at the Army Finance Office, Griffith Barracks, Dublin.  The alteration in the form of a discharge certificate of N.C.O.'s and men was made in July, 1925.</P>

      <P>In view of the answer which the Minister has just given, would he explain how he came to make this statement in reply to a supplementary question which I put to him on the 29th April last: &ldquo;The discharge paper that was then in existence was found to contain an error and it was scrapped.  The result was that these men, some of them, did get paid.&rdquo; From that answer I assume that when the discharge paper was found to contain an error it was scrapped, and the result of that was that the men were found to have been paid wrongly and the payment was stopped.  The Minister, in his answer now, states that the discharge papers were found to contain an error roughly two years after the money had been stopped from the men.</P>

The discharge, in some cases, is not on the form that I have spoken about here.  If the Deputy wishes I will arrange to meet him at my office on any day he names when we can go into the whole matter.  I think I can satisfy him that everything is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>As Section 1 covers everything I propose to deal now with the point that I intend to raise.  I want to direct the attention of the House to a matter arising out of the subsidy in respect to beet sugar.  When last I had an opportunity of dealing with this question I had not had an opportunity of seeing the agreement that had been entered upon between the Ministry and M. Lippens.  Since that time the agreement has been laid upon the Table, and it is now available for Deputies.  I think it requires a certain amount of attention and consideration in view of the liabilities that it involves which are greater than the liabilities of which the House was informed when the Beet Sugar Bill was being passed.  There are two sections of the agreement to which I want to direct special attention.  The agreement is dated the 15th October 1925 and it provides &ldquo;that the company shall be granted a licence or licences for the production of sugar for a period of ten years at least from the 1st October 1926.  The amount of sugar manufactured by the company on which the subsidy under Section 1 (1) (a) of the Beet Sugar (Subsidy) Act, 1925, will be paid shall be the <Col N="2333" /> total amount of sugar manufactured by the company in the three years commencing on the 1st day of October 1926, and shall not exceed ten thousand tons per annum in the two years commencing on the first day of October nineteen hundred and twenty-nine nor fifteen thousand tons per annum in the five years commencing on the first day of October nineteen hundred and thirty-one, provided always the total amount of sugar on which the subsidy will be paid shall not exceed one hundred and twenty-five thousand tons in all in the period during which the subsidy is payable under the Beet Sugar (Subsidy) Act, 1925.&rdquo;  There is a further clause in the agreement which is important: &ldquo;The Minister hereby undertakes and agrees with the company not to agree without the company's consent to the grant of a licence for the manufacture of beet sugar from home-grown beet within the area South 53º 25' and East 7º 40'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to direct special attention to the paragraph which speaks of the total amount of sugar manufactured by the company within the three years commencing 1st October, 1926.  Note that there is no maximum fixed in this agreement in respect to those first three years.  There is a maximum fixed for the subsequent two years of ten thousand tons per annum, and for the following five years of fifteen thousand tons per annum.  But there is no maximum fixed in respect to the first three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this matter was first dealt with in the House, in the Budget speech of 1925 (April 22nd), we had a statement from the Minister for Finance telling us what the temporary provisional agreement that had been arrived at with M. Lippens contained.  The House, at that time, was given certain information, including the estimate upon which the whole scheme was based.  The estimate was a ten-year estimate, with a total of 86,000 tons, at a total cost to the State of £1,961,000.  That estimate was built up on the assumption that for the first three years the tonnage of sugar on which the subsidy would be paid would be five, six, or seven thousand tons respectively. &ldquo;It is not proposed,&rdquo; the <Col N="2334" /> Minister said, &ldquo;to subsidise more than one factory at the present time.  This first factory is experimental....  I hope that, after a very short experience of the running of the first experimental factory, it may be possible to obtain much better terms....&rdquo;  The Minister also told us, in dealing with the question of the cost of this experiment: &ldquo;If it is a success, and leads to new and improved methods of tillage, improvement in dairy farming, and the finding of useful employment in the fields and in the new factories... the price is not too high, and the cost is not greatly in excess of the cost of the experiment at Kelham, in Great Britain, if capital losses there are taken into account.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>April, 1925, was the date of these assurances.  Then the Bill came, and was under discussion, and certain criticism was levelled at the proposal of the Bill on the score that the promise was over-generous to the company. Again, in June of that year, the Minister re-stated the figures upon which the scheme was based&mdash;eighty-six thousand tons over the ten years' period, and an estimated subsidy cost of £1,961,000.  The President, in the Seanad, pointed out in reply to Senator Barrington, who was urging a longer period of guarantee to the farmers than three years: &ldquo;It is impossible to spoon-feed every single contributor towards the success of this particular experiment.  It is one of a very expensive character, and everything was done to make it as cheap as possible. An extension in the direction mentioned by Senator Barrington would mean still a further price, and that price we are not advised it would be wise for us to pay.&rdquo;  As I told you, the price in mind by way of subsidy was £1,961,000, or round about that sum.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture, who might be presumed to have a clearer knowledge of the position and prospects of this experiment than the Minister for Finance or the President, said: &ldquo;... No one expects you will get 10 tons here in the first years, or exactly what they get in Holland.  If you did, the thing would be a gift. There would be a small fortune in it. When I say a small fortune, I mean a <Col N="2335" /> real good thing in it.  If you could get the same yield and the same sugar content as they get in Sweden, Denmark and Holland, and in England to a lesser extent, then of course it would be preposterous to enter into this arrangement with M. Lippens.&rdquo;  This was the June proposition, the estimate of five, six, or seven thousand tons per annum for the first three years reaching the estimated maximum of ten thousand tons at the end of the ten years' period.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture hoped that they would be able to work up to six thousand tons in the first three years.</P>
    <P>Then the agreement was made in October and for some unaccountable reason, while there was a maximum fixed for the two years beginning in October, 1929, upon which a subsidy would be payable, and in the subsequent five years beginning 1931, there was a blank&mdash;no maximum whatever fixed for the first three years.  It is under that agreement we are working. Following the agreement the plans in regard to the factory changed.  A bigger factory was decided upon and, as against the factory which was declared to be the most economical by Ministers, the factory of ten to twelve thousand tons capacity, there was built a factory which, admittedly, has a fifteen thousand tons capacity and I have a shrewd suspicion that it has a capacity for a good deal more than fifteen thousand tons.</P>
    <P>On the 8th February, this year, the Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;When the original estimate was being prepared twelve months ago it was anticipate that the area under beet would be about 7,000 acres, and the quantity of sugar manufactured would be about ten thousand tons.  The area actually planted was 9,500 acres, and the amount of sugar which will be manufactured this year will be about 13,000 tons.&rdquo;  There is a slight difference in the ultimate result.  As the Minister told us yesterday, the quantity of sugar manufactured was 12,000 tons. Then the Minister went on:&mdash;&ldquo;It does not really make any difference in the long run that the estimate has been exceeded <Col N="2336" /> as to the quantity of sugar manufactured.  We thought that during the first two or three years a lesser quantity of sugar would have been manufactured this year than has been the case, but our arrangement with manufacturing companies was that the subsidy would be payable on 125,000 tons during the ten years period.&rdquo;  I do not know what the Minister thinks about it not making any difference, but when this year it is found that you have to pay a subsidy of £24 10s. per ton on 12,000 tons and that in the last years of the ten-year period the subsidy will be at the rate of £22 per ton &mdash;if he thinks that would not make any difference, then I am afraid his watch over financial conduct in the State is not just as satisfactory as it should be.</P>
    <P>There are other consequences.  I think in formulating this agreement in the circumstances there was serious negligence, first in the omission to fix a maximum sum on which the subsidy would be paid during the first three years, and, secondly, in the neglect to give information to the Dáil and the country that the original project was being greatly increased.  The cost of this experiment to the State, by way of subsidy, instead of being anywhere near the estimate of £1,961,000&mdash;let us speak of two million pounds&mdash;may be up to four millions.  It is almost certain to be over three millions.  I say it may be up to four millions and I say that because there is no limit to what might be produced in the two years to come.</P>
    <P>The 9,200 acres on which beet was grown last year are to be increased for this current year to 15,000 acres.  So far so good.  The subsidy will be paid upon the produce of that 15,000 acres. If it happened that there was as good a year in yield this year as there was last year the factory might require to turn out 18,000 tons of sugar.  While it may be said that there is not much likelihood of as good a year as last year, I think one might take into account the whether and climatic risks together with increased experience and knowledge of the requirements of the crop, and on the whole there is every possibility of the crop being as successful in 1927 as in 1926.  It may be a <Col N="2337" /> very good thing, and I am quite willing to admit at once that it will be a very good thing indeed, if the acreage is raised to 15,000 acres as compared with 9,200 acres last year, and that the yield is still greater.  Let us bear in mind that that involves greatly added cost upon the State.  The essence of my complaint is that this agreement was entered into, throwing upon the State this unlimited liability, without informing the Dáil of the fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us yesterday that the amount of subsidy paid was £181,000 for last year's crop.  The estimate, it will be noted, was £194,000 It must be also taken into account that there should be added to the £181,000 a sum of £112,000 if we are to arrive at the actual cost of this subsidy from the State. That is the amount of the Excise duty, or the Customs duty, which is remitted on home manufactured sugar, so that the cost of this experiment in the year 1926-7 was £293,000, against an estimated cost of £122,000.  That is a very serious departure from the position as laid before the Dáil, and I think it is of the utmost importance that the Dáil should impress upon Ministers that when a statement of the probable cost of any service is laid before the Dáil, if there is any departure from that original statement Ministers are in duty bound to inform the Dáil of the new commitments, and that they have failed to do in this case.  They entered into this agreement which raised the figure from 86,000 tons, as a general estimate presented to the Dáil, to a maximum of 135,000 tons.  But what is the effect of this unlimited tonnage on which a subsidy is to be paid for the first three years?  We have the maximum fixed for 1929-30, and for each subsequent year, but no maximum fixed for 1926-27, 1927-8, or 1928-9.  We paid £293,000 for the year 1926-7.  It is not at all improbable that the subsidy cost to the State for the next year will be £450,000, and the year following, if the company decides that it is desirable still further to try the capacity of the plant, that £450,000 may even be increased.</P>
    <P>But there is another aspect of this agreement that I think is of even <Col N="2338" /> greater importance for the Dáil to take note of.  What I have said so far may be countered by the statement that agriculture is in a bad way, that this is a crop that is going to relieve agriculture, and that even though we have over-stepped the mark in not taking the Dáil into our confidence and are paying away double the amount we announced that we were willing to pay for these three years, it is worth the cost.  That may be the line of defence taken by the Minister.  But the end of this agreement and this policy of concentrating upon the extra large factory in the one area, is to make much less likely the building and the equipment of a new factory in any other area for the next three or four years. The area that has been given over as a monopoly to the present company covers half of the fair quality arable land of the Free State.  If one were to take a map and draw a line on it from, say, Swords to some few miles north of Tullamore and a little beyond Tullamore, and then go right South, just touching Clonmel, he would get an idea of the area that is monopolised to this company within which no other factory can be built in the ten years' period without the consent of this company.</P>
    <P>I have read recently appealing notices of meetings to be held in Tullamore with a view to having a factory set up there.  I am sorry Deputy Patrick Egan is not here, but he probably, as a Deputy in the Dáil, was unaware, or allowed his constituents in Tullamore to be unaware, of the fact that as a director of the Irish company he had entered into an agreement which would, in effect, prevent a new factory being set up in Tullamore. When we have given this privilege to the company to turn out up to 20,000 tons of sugar per annum&mdash;I am taking that in accord with the capacity of the plant&mdash;an agreement which will cost the State so large a sum as I have mentioned &mdash; probably £450,000&mdash;the chances of a second factory are very much minimised.  Tipperary, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, or even Meath and Westmeath, are almost closed up for quite a few years as places which might expect a subsidised factory, and <Col N="2339" /> that as a consequence of allowing this agreement to be signed with the unlimited provisions for the first three years and with this very big area practically monopolised by the existing company.</P>
    <P>I think it will be found that the company's policy will be to make the most of the first three years, when the rate of subsidy is £24 10s. a ton, that the total 125,000 tons will be absorbed in the first five or six years, and then no subsidy will be payable according to the present agreement.  The question will then arise as to what is to become of the farmers and what are they to look forward to in respect of the price for beet.  The company will be in a position to say: &ldquo;We are now clear with our subsidy; we have written off the cost of the factory; we have done well for the first few years of its existence, and you, the farmer, must accept a much lower price for your beet.&rdquo;  There will be no other factory in existence to act as a check upon the existing company, and the effect of this agreement, coupled with the policy of the company to have a big centralised factory with a monopoly at the unlimited tonnage, will be to preclude the chances of any other factories being established for the first five or six years, and then the existing company will have the farmers in a cleft stick. I say that the Government are entitled to condemnation for two things in this business: first, their failure to acquaint the Dáil with the fact that they had entered into a formal agreement which increased by 50 per cent. the liabilities of the State, as explained in the plans for the sugar beet experiment, and, secondly, that in making the agreement of October, 1925, they were seriously negligent in allowing the first three years' subsidy to be unlimited in amount and in granting to this existing company so wide an area of monopoly. I think it is a matter that ought to be the subject of close criticism by the Dáil and that a warning should be given to Ministers that they ought not to enter into new agreements which in effect add to the charge upon the State without disclosing the new facts to the House and to the public.</P>

Deputy Johnson is another addition to that rather big battalion of wiseacres and of critics after the event.  I would ask the Dáil to go back to the time when we were arranging this subsidy, when we were endeavouring to start the sugar beet industry, and to remember the debate that took place in the Dáil before the agreement was signed at all and in the course of making the agreement. I need not delay very long over what was said and what was not said here.  I do not remember that we got very much support from any Opposition quarter for the agreement.  It was criticism from start to finish.  The whole point of view was to throw doubt on the scheme, to show that for one reason or another a sugar beet factory would not succeed here, to make suggestions, all of which tended to keep out anybody who was even thinking of coming into the country with big capital.  I remember that, so far as I could gather, the scheme was disapproved by those on the Farmers' Benches, and I do not remember that we had any great support for any aspect of the scheme from Labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The lines of criticism all tended towards frightening capital away from the country.  Difficulties were put up from every quarter, from some quarters more than others, but the sole contribution from every quarter was to put up difficulties. That is what happened in the Dáil, but that is not the most serious part of it. We began to negotiate for a sugar beet <Col N="2341" /> factory in 1925, when things were not anything like as secure as they are now.  As far as Belgians, French, Czecho-Slovakians, or people generally were competent to do this work, work never done before in this country, I think we began in 1924.  The Civil War was then hardly over, and we were proposing to these men that they should come into the company and invest huge sums of money in an Irish enterprise.</P>
      <P>We had to go outside Ireland and the Committee interviewed probably every first-class firm in Europe.  They came to the conclusion that, approached from the technical point of view, from the point of view of getting a really competent firm, M. Lippens' firm was the one, and M. Lippens was brought over.  What kind of a reception did he get?  He went down the country and saw good farmers there all right.  But he was told by practically every business man that he interviewed in Dublin that he should not establish this factory here.  He was told this thing and that thing about Irish Labour; he was told about strikes; and that the Irish farmers would not keep their contract.  Everything possible that could be done to throw cold water on the scheme and to discourage him was done here in Dublin.  Some of this was done in my hearing.  Even after all that he decided to go ahead.  Does the Dáil think that in these circumstances it did not require at least some extra inducements to get a foreigner to spend £400,000 in a factory here? Where were these extra inducements?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that he should read the debates. There was a question of two factories, as the Deputy ought to remember&mdash; one a factory for handling the produce of 5,000 acres of beet and the other a factory for handling the produce of 10,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister <Col N="2342" /> take this quotation from the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;It is estimated that the complete equipment of the factory will run to the neighbourhood of £200,000 for the 10,000 tons?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The complete equipment of the factory, as a fact, entailed practically £400,000.  That is information which I believe to be correct.  In spite of everything that he heard and of all the circumstances, M. Lippens put up the factory.  We are told that we gave him too many inducements to that end.  What were these inducements? Does any Deputy deny that our subsidy, on the average, is close to the English subsidy at present?  If they do, let Deputies take the trouble of comparing the figures.  That is so, notwithstanding that there had been a sugar beet industry in England for fourteen years.  Surely it should be obvious, even before the event, to the so-called business-men and to the critics that it would take a somewhat greater inducement to erect the first factory than to erect a factory after fourteen years' experience.  Notwithstanding that there has been a sugar beet factory in England for fourteen years, the present subsidy to the Carlow sugar beet factory is very close, indeed, to the subsidy to the English factories. Yet we are told the subsidy is too great.</P>
      <P>Let us compare the conditions for a moment.  England, a settled country, no civil war, no rebellions, everything respectable, everything to induce foreign capital to come in, fourteen years' experience of sugar beet.  That is one set of conditions.  The other set is: The Irish Free State, the year 1924 &mdash;after everything that had occurred&mdash; no experience, good, bad or indifferent, of sugar beet.  Nevertheless, we were able to make an agreement with M. Lippens which, so far as the subsidy is concerned, when everything is taken into account, including the subsidy towards molasses&mdash;every item taken into account&mdash;is very close, indeed, to the English agreement when you take averages.  Yet we have done badly!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that people are merely able to criticise in this country.  People will not get anything done.  They will criticise&mdash;and they will criticise after the event.  When M. <Col N="2343" /> Lippens had decided to go ahead with the factory on the strength of the representations made to him, on the strength of a subsidy, which, as I pointed out before, was a modest subsidy, taking English standards into account, he naturally said to us: &ldquo;Well, if everything you tell us is true, if we can discount all that we have heard, some of which we have heard in the Dáil; if we can discount everything discouraging we have heard in the Dáil and outside; and if we are to take it that everything you tell us is true, there is just one guarantee, one piece of evidence we should like to have to show that we are fairly safe in going on, and that is a little Irish money.&rdquo; I am almost literally accurate when I say that not a penny was forthcoming. What was a foreign enterprising business-man to say, after not a penny was forthcoming?  But he went ahead and put up the factory.  Now that the first year is over, all the business-men and all the critics who would not invest one single penny in this factory, who did everything they could to discourage it, have now discovered that there is a big profit, and they are clapping themselves on the back and talking about how wise they are and how simple and foolish the Government were in going ahead.</P>
    <P>Really, I think people should have some perspective.  I can appreciate the point of view of the cautions man who says before the event: &ldquo;This factory is going to cost a lot of money.  You cannot afford a failure in Ireland; you have had enough of them and you cannot afford another; wait for a bit until things get somewhat settled and then try your hand.&rdquo;  I can appreciate that point of view, but I cannot understand the point of view of the man who says all that, and who then, because the scheme is an outstanding success, comes along and says: &ldquo;You should have known that the whole time; you should have known it would have been an outstanding success; you should have known you would get better crops of beet than in England; you should have known, notwithstanding that the Irish farmer had no experience of sugar beet, that he would grow a better crop than the English farmer; you should have <Col N="2344" /> known that there would be no strikes, and that he would get better value from the Irish workman than the English workman.&rdquo;  That point of view, to my mind, is shameless, and, as I say, the country is full of it at present. No one can get anything done.  No one will take a risk, come to his conclusions, back his opinions, and go ahead. Everybody waits until he gets both sides of the question, and is in a position then to blame the Government in any event.</P>
    <P>Farmers are said to be conservative. We know they are, and I think they are rightly so.  Supposing they acted up to their conservatism, and grew only 6,000 acres of beet the first year, what would the loss be?  Deputy Johnson might go into that question.  That was a likelihood.  Was there a single Deputy who would get up and guarantee 6,000 acres before the factory was started, even at the price of 54s. per ton?  Not one.  If we were debating this question to-day in that state of affairs, with a failure the first year, I can imagine how eloquent Deputy Johnson would wax, how he would have pointed out that we should have examined this very carefully, and given some further guarantees to the farmer &mdash;how we should have done this, that and the other thing.  Nobody had any evidence to show that the first year's crop would give a record content of close on 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I am on that point, I might say that Deputies should not jump to the conclusion that this is going to be permanent, and this is probably a big factor in the situation.  This whole debate is proceeding on the utterly false basis that you can afford to generalise from one year's experience.  Any farmer, anybody who has ever thought twice on the question, would see how utterly false that is.  There was an average yield last year of ten tons per acre.  Who is going to say that it will be eight tons next year, or what the average yield will be over a period of three years?  There was an average sugar content last year, which was a particularly good and favourable year, of up to 17 per cent.  Would some prophet just give his views as to what the sugar content will be next year, so <Col N="2345" /> that we shall have just a sporting chance&mdash;in any event, that we shall not be always up against criticism of the accomplished fact?  Will someone put himself in my position and indicate just what the future is going to be?  We on the Government Benches are always in the position that we have to make up our minds as best we can as to what the future is going to be, and state that, and stand over it after the event. I should like someone to get up now&mdash;there seems to be such a terrible lot of wisdom&mdash;and tell me, for instance, the weight of beet we will get next year and what the sugar content will be next year.  These are vital questions.</P>
    <P>Will the Deputy say, if there is only a yield of eight tons next year, that the factory will make any profit at all? Will the Deputy say&mdash;because his whole case is based on this&mdash;that during the next three years they are going to make such a profit that they can afford to throw away the £400,000 worth of a factory at the end of the three years and tell the farmers to go to Jericho?  That is his whole case, that is what it comes to.  I presume he has examined the position, and that he knows something about farming&mdash;a good lot, if I may say so; one side of it, anyway.  I daresay he has examined the figures.  Will he tell me for my information&mdash;I do not know a lot about it&mdash;what is the profit going to be next year, on the assumption that there is a yield of eight tons to the acre&mdash;a very high yield&mdash;and a sugar content of 15 per cent.?  Will the company be in such opulence that they will close their doors if that is repeated next year?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies not to show their utter lack of knowledge of agricultural conditions by arguing and generalising from one year's experience.  I have often been asked my opinion as to what is going to happen about sugar beet.  All I can say is this: The results of the first year are all to the good, but you cannot generalise about it.  It would take at least three years&mdash;I do not say two years&mdash;before we can get any accurate deductions from the experiences of the Carlow factory.  I do <Col N="2346" /> not say that we have not learned something this year.  We have.  So have the company&mdash;they have learned a lot. They have learned that they can change some of their processes, short circuit others, and so on.  I do not say we will not learn more next year and the year after, but at the end of the three years we will have a certain amount of solid information on which we can go.</P>
    <P>The Dáil is, forsooth, to blame the Ministry because the subsidy is so high and because there was a monopoly given over half the arable land of Ireland. Again, nothing like accuracy! That, of course, is not so.  It is not anything like one-half of the arable land of Ireland.  Deputy Johnson draws an absolutely unreal picture of what will happen.  Supposing a company came here and said they would like to start a factory within the area, and forty miles from the present factory, at their own expense, and that they would pay a good price for the roots and do it for half the present subsidy.  No factory, according to Deputy Johnson, could be placed there. That is just a little too innocent. Things do not happen like that in this world.  If M. Lippens was asked, &ldquo;Are you going to do the same thing,&rdquo; what is he to say?  No?  If he says &ldquo;no,&rdquo; what position is he in vis-a-vis the farmers there?  What position is he in for any contract outside his area?  He has only one factory.  He would like another, I am sure, on the same terms.  Admitting everything that Deputy Johnson says, supposing this is going to be a great success&mdash; that it can be a great success, even with a very much smaller subsidy&mdash;I do not think the company are fools; I have no reason to think it; I think they know their business.</P>
    <P>I assume that they would be anxious to share in that success, to extend their operations, and to get another factory. Supposing they adopt a dog-in-the-manger policy and refuse to allow anyone else to put up another factory, what position would they be in then? It must be remembered that there are greater sanctions in business than Acts of Parliament.  The Deputy will have to learn that.  If the Deputy means it, <Col N="2347" /> it shows an utter want of knowledge as to how business is done.  Is it to be thought that Messrs. Lippens, or the company, could take up the attitude of saying: &ldquo;We will not put up a second factory at this figure and we will not allow anyone else to do it&rdquo;?  We are also to be blamed, not so much that the subsidy is high&mdash;the Deputy has not argued that&mdash;but because it amounts in the aggregate to so much.  That is the criticism.  It is not that we have given a subsidy of 24/-, or whatever it is, per cwt., and that we should have given 20/-.  It would be difficult to make that case because you would have to go into accounts.  The case made was: &ldquo;Well, you said it would be about £120,000, but it is £180,000.&rdquo; Surely the Deputy does not object to that?</P>
    <P>Suppose the subsidy is 50 per cent. lower than the English subsidy and that on that calculation we expected that the subsidy would be £60,000, and it turned out that, because there was a much higher quantity of beet and a much higher sugar content, the subsidy increased to £80,000, would you not have the same position?  Does not that mean that the scheme has been a success, far greater than we ever thought? Deputies who know so much about this subsidy, should have told us that beet in the first year would give 17 per cent. sugar content and a yield of ten tons an acre, that we need not have given anything like the subsidy, that they would vouch for this, and that they were prepared to give a guarantee to that effect to Messrs. Lippens.  They kept that knowledge to themselves. Now, however, when a chemist has demonstrated with a test-tube and sulphuric acid that the sugar content is about 17 per cent., when a weighing machine proves that we get ten tons to the acre, and also when these facts are published in the Press, the experts tell us that we should have known all this beforehand.  I do not think that there was ever such an anomalous position as that.</P>
    <P>Here, after the first year, by every evidence, we have got a factory which is a great success, such a success that the Dáil is asked to pay more because <Col N="2348" /> there is such a large quantity of beet and such a high sugar content. Instead of congratulating us, Deputy Johnson comes along in the most formal way and sets up an indictment compared with which that of Warren Hastings was nothing.  I am sorry that we have not to pay them £200,000, as that would mean a sugar content of, perhaps, 18 per cent. and a yield of eleven tons an acre.  If it were £250,000, we could say that the minute this ten-year period is over there need be no subsidy as we have a better sugar beet than any other country in the world.  I hope that next year the Minister for Finance will be looking for £200,000 or £250,000 for the subsidy. That would mean that sugar beet can be grown in this country without a subsidy and I think we will have discovered that fact at a cheap price. The business thing in this matter is, first, to buy the highest technical skill; secondly, to make certain that the farmers will grow; thirdly, to make it worth their while to give the greatest possible care to the crop so that an experiment, such as it is, will not be rendered useless and will not be injured by factors which should not enter into it.  We could have got companies to make this experiment more cheaply but we might not have been so certain in drawing deductions from their results.</P>
    <P>Suppose the Dáil got a company to put up a sugar factory for, say, £100,000 and in two or three years time we were in doubt as to whether we could draw any real deductions from the failure that took place, or any deduction from the results of their experience; suppose we were wondering how up-to-date their methods were, whether they had the very latest machinery, whether they were doing their processes properly, what would we do then?  We would, I suppose, come along and try to get a more competent factory.  If we are seriously envisaging the problem, realising that this was purely an experiment and endeavouring to get accurate knowledge, the cheapest thing to do is to get a really first-class man and give him such terms that not one single element necessary for success would be absent. <Col N="2349" /> That is what we did, and that is the way to save money in the long run. This campaign about the existence of this factory is allied to the campaign that we should start other factories all over the country.  That campaign has come from the Labour Benches. Deputy Johnson indicated me outside this House for saying that we ought to think twice before starting another factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that now. The one objection I have is that, by the action you have taken in connection with this factory, you have prevented a second factory from being built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, we are now at one.  He indicated me for saying that a second factory should not be put up without the greatest care, bearing in mind our first lessons.  That campaign shows an utterly false point of view on the whole matter.  If the first factory were a commercial one, or a piece of camouflage, if it were put up as a temporary expedient or to prevent criticism, the way to prevent more criticism would be to put up another factory.  That is a wrong point of view.  We took the first factory seriously as an experimental factory. We are ready to pay what we have to pay for first-class technical skill in order to see that the experiment is so complete that it is one from which we can draw, with complete security, very obvious deductions.  We will not go on with the second factory until we have results to justify it.  That is the right point of view, and the criticism about £180,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We would lose ten, times more money by getting a cheap second-rate man to put up a factory and then sticking other factories up all over the country.  That is not our way of <Col N="2350" /> doing it.  We are told that this will prevent another factory from going up.  That leaves me breathless.  Why? Is it because this factory has been a success?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think that the Deputy was in absolute agreement with the Minister for Finance.  I thought he was putting up the case that this meant no second factory. What is to prevent a second factory, or rather how does this experiment prevent a second factory from going up?  Is it because it was a success?  If it were a failure, would it make it absolutely certain that we would have a second factory?  Surely, the Deputy is not arguing that if we put up a factory with a lower subsidy, it cannot compete with this factory.  I am at a loss to find a single reason that could be put forward by any Deputy to show that the success of this factory makes it more difficult to put up a second factory outside the area.  People say that a second factory could not be put up at a lower subsidy because it could not compete with this factory.  That is nonsense.  This factory cannot take any more beet.  The second factory could sell sugar against this factory. How is Tate doing it?  The Deputy's point is that the company could say that no factory can go up here, and that they can take all the risk of saying that.  In other words, they could say to the Government: &ldquo;We will not put up another factory here, and we will not allow anyone else to put it up.&rdquo;  Ordinary business influences and factors would compel them to put up a second factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had the same old argument trotted out about the unfortunate plight of the farmer at the end of the three years.  The farmer, apparently, is to be in a helpless position.  First of all, we have it on the authority of Deputy Johnson that the next two years are going to bring forth the most pronounced success.  You are going to get the same sugar content, the same yield of beets, and the factory is going to clear capital and make profit.  They will then say to the farmer that they <Col N="2351" /> will pay him only £1 per ton for his beet&mdash;that is, at the end of the third year&mdash;because the Government neglected to fix the price over a ten-year period.  First of all, that contention is based on a fallacy, which nobody has made the slightest attempt to establish. The Deputy could not prove his case, because he does not know what is going to happen during the next two years. He does not know that the factory will make the whole of their original capital and a fair amount of interest on that capital.  I hope the factory does succeed in doing that, because, if it does, there are bright prospects for sugar beet in this country.  Even admitting that they make £400,000 in the next two years, with from £50,000 to £100,000 as interest on that during the period, what are they going to do?  Are they going to close the factory?  You have here business-men with £400,000 capital in the shape of a factory.  Because they have made a good deal of money during three years, they are going to close that factory.  They will take in no more beets.  The same argument might be used about a big wholesale establishment, or about any other factory.  It might be argued that because a certain concern did extremely well in the first three years&mdash;cleared off its capital and made a big profit&mdash;the owners would be so satisfied that they would refuse to take in any more stuff for sale.</P>
    <P>It is argued here that the factory will refuse to give a price for beets which would, on the one hand, induce farmers to go in for the crop, and, on the other hand, leave a decent profit for the factory.  The factory will be in this dilemma: they have £400,000 worth of property; that property will be there, even though they make money. The mere fact that they make £400,000 cannot alter the fact that £400,000 of their good money is sunk in that factory. No business-man keeps his money idle.  On the one side, the factory will have to give a price which will induce farmers not only to grow beet, but to grow the requisite amount, and, on the other hand, they will try to square that with a decent profit.  Who has the advantage in the deal?  It might be a <Col N="2352" /> very serious thing for the factory to have to close down.  I put it to Farmer-Deputies who are listening to me that, when that deal comes to be made, the farmers will have most of the cards.  The farmers got on without sugar beet in this country for a long time.  If they wanted to bring the factory to its senses, would not one year do it?  Take the loss involved by the closing of the factory at 10 per cent. on £400,000, for one year. That would be £40,000.  Who are in the stronger position&mdash;the farmers or the factory?  When it comes to sitting down and fixing the price, there will, of course, be differences of opinion. There will be a good deal of discontent; there always is.  There will be discontent on the side of the factory and discontent on the side of the farmers.  But the ordinary laws of self-interest on both sides will settle that question, as they settle every other question of the same kind.  To pretend that at the end of three years the farmers will be absolutely at the mercy of the sugar beet factory is quite absurd.  The exact opposite would be much nearer the truth.  The actual truth would be that they will both be in a position to bargain. On the one side, the factory has to be kept going if there is not to be a big loss.  On the other side, the farmers are anxious to grow beet.  There are present all the elements of a deal, and there will be a deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. J. CONLAN Mr. J. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister was not warranted in stating that the farmers were critical of this scheme when it was before the House. They were critical of one provision in the Bill.  That was the provision for the guaranteed price to the farmer for three years, while the subsidy to the company was to extend over ten years. I still think that that was an unfair arrangement.  With regard to another farming crop which has been mentioned frequently in the House&mdash;the barley crop&mdash;the Minister, in combating the suggestion that a tariff should be put on barley, relied on the fact that the barley growers had only one customer. Does not the same argument apply here?  Will not the beet growers have only one customer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2353" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>And the opposite will apply, too&mdash;that the factory will have to give such a price that farmers will think it worth while to grow beet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very weak &ldquo;opposite.&rdquo;  I am very glad the scheme has been successful.  The farmers of Kildare, Carlow, Wexford, Offaly, and other counties were in a very bad position.  They could grow no crop at a profit.  I have myself grown no crop at a profit except beet, but beet I have grown at a profit.  I think it was a great boon to the farmers&mdash;especially in the tillage districts, where their circumstances are very poor indeed. Not alone was beet a great boon to the farmers, but it was a great boon to the labourers.  No crop will give more employment than beet, not alone to men, but to women and children. Women and children can do a great deal of work in connection with the beet crop.  I think the Irish farmer has vindicated himself.  A great many people put him down as a careless ne'er-do-well. He proved that the description was wrongly applied by his work in connection with the beet crop.  He guaranteed a certain acreage and he went over his guarantee.  I have been present at several field demonstrations, conducted by Belgian experts, and they told me that in nearly every case the cultivation was extremely good, and the care which had been bestowed on the crop extremely praiseworthy.  I stated that nearly all the tillage crops except beet have been unprofitable.  I can give an instance of what is happening in my own constituency on big tillage farms.  They are running the disc harrow over the turnip crop in order to slice them on the field.  They are ploughing them in because they have no stock to eat them.  Notwithstanding that the farmer's circumstances are not good, they are rising to the occasion as regards beet growing, and applications for an acreage far higher than the company are in a position to deal with are being sent in this season.  Having subsidised one farm crop, I wish the Minister would subsidise other crops which are badly in need of a subsidy.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  I do not want to give the Minister for Lands and Agriculture a pretext for making another speech, but when the Bill was passing through the Dáil I concerned myself almost entirely with the price that would be paid to the farmer after the period of guarantee had expired.  I think we are still in the dark about that.  This is, as the Minister says, a matter for bargaining. But the fact that more farmers have grown sugar beet than was anticipated and that the yield per acre of sugar beet has been higher than was anticipated, seems to put them in a worse position for bargaining than would otherwise be the case.  That is the only new light we have on the matter.  The question can only be tested ultimately by experience.  When the Minister says that there was no criticism on this point previously, I would remind him that there was criticism directed by the Farmers' Party and by myself to that particular point. The point cannot be regarded as settled yet.</P>

      <P>I am rather at a disadvantage, inasmuch as I have not heard Deputy Johnson's <Col N="2355" /> speech and I have heard only portion of the Minister's speech.  What I heard of the Minister's speech provokes me to take part in the discussion. I recollect well&mdash;I was sitting on the Government Benches at the time&mdash;that I took an active part in what I may style &ldquo;forcing&rdquo; a favourable view by the Government towards the project of establishing this new industry in the country.  The case that I persistently made was two-fold.  I pointed out that the possibility of the success of this industry was not problematical, that there was experiment enough with regard to beet growing to make it certain that beet could be successfully and profitably grown in this country and that a sugar factory, if properly subsidised, could be set up and would be the forerunner of many others.  I maintained likewise &mdash;contra to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture&mdash;that nothing could be shown promotive of the development of agriculture, as properly understood&mdash; namely as tillage&mdash;like the introduction of the sugar beet crop.  I remember that the Minister, without reference to me&mdash;probably because, at the time, we were both fighting for the same cause, the introduction of the sugar factory&mdash; said if every small farmer would put six acres more into cultivation it would do more for tillage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection was the figure &ldquo;six.&rdquo;  It had been demonstrated, to the satisfaction of foreign experts, that both the land, the climate and the environmental conditions in Ireland were favourable to this crop.  There was one very important sugar producer who was surprised when he came over here at the potentialities that the country presented for this crop.  It is true he did not put in a tender, because of many of the things which the Minister recited&mdash;representations as to instability, the flooding of the ground, and a number of other things.  Like many other foreigners interested in the exploitation of the country for sugar, he was under the impression that the <Col N="2356" /> farmers would not play up&mdash;that they could not be relied upon to give to the crop the requisite acreage to enable the factory to carry on.  There were many tenders.  The firm for which I interested myself provided the propaganda which was used by the Government at the Show in Ballsbridge and elsewhere.  We provided the figures in reply to a demand made in this House by leading members of the Farmers' Party, and no one argued more strongly against the project as compared with the value of the potato crop than the leader of the Farmers' Party, who afterwards was one of the foremost men at the opening in the glorification of the factory in Carlow. It was pointed out then, and it may be repeated once more, I accept the challenge that was made generally by the Minister.  The very figure that I used in the debates in the Dáil was 17 per cent.  It did not require the farmers to go in extensively for this cultivation and for the chemist's test tube to be applied.  We knew, beforehand, from very effective tests, that the yield would average 17 per cent., as against 15 per cent. in many continental countries, where the industry was a huge success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Conlan, I am very glad that this Carlow factory has succeeded, very very glad.  I was accused by the late Deputy Figgis, in the last days of the debate, that I had changed my front.  My reply then and my reply to-day is identical.  I am more concerned to get the industry firmly planted in Ireland than to promote the interests of any particular firm in this regard.  I rejoice that the thing is a success.  But let me remind the Ministry of one very important thing.  The success of this particular project is largely due to accident, because one of the features in favour of rival tenders was that the firm whose claims I was pressing on the Minister&mdash;the firm of Von Rossum&mdash;was prepared to put up a factory at a cost of £400,000, and to bring over Dutch experts to teach the people how to work.  When M. Lippens got the contract, having put in an estimate slightly lower than Von Rossum's, they had, as the Minister more or less unconsciously recalls, to make <Col N="2357" /> an attempt, through Irish financiers, to get Irish money.  Other tenderers saw the land and saw its rich capacity for the purpose and were willing to put in all the capital required and give our people a proper price and teach them the industrial work.  This firm, having once got the monopoly, for it was a monopoly, then proceeded to get Irish capital into the business.  The Minister says they failed, but not altogether, he should have added, and then the fortunate accident happened. Those interested in sugar production on the Continent, hearing of the good thing that the Belgian firm had got hold of, a monopoly for the sugar industry in a land that was reputed to be one of the finest for the purpose of beet growing, came along to ask about the project, and by one of those accidents that happen, one would be inclined to say, only in novels or in dramas, another foreigner entered into a chance conversation with M. Lippens, and said: &ldquo;If this is as good as it seems to be, don't put up a small factory, put up a very large one, and I will go into it with you.&rdquo;  That is what happened.</P>
    <P>I argued here repeatedly that for the success of the industry there should be, at least, two factories.  Even at the time that I was advocating, most strenuously, the giving of the subsidy to the Von Rossum firm, as offering the best advantages, I maintained that the proper course would be really to set up two and have the rivalry of the two as correctors.  What I feared at the time, and I put it up to several Ministers in their departments, would be that Lippens' factory would be what I styled a toy factory, and that it would merely play with the thing and get out without any loss or with a moderate profit, and that we should be left then with what seemed an experiment that was not wholly a success.  Unfortunately, I am speaking ex-tempore, and without the expectation of speaking on this matter I did not look up the reports, but I remember arguing that the amount of money which the Government were prepared to spend on the establishment in this country would suffice to create the two, if one were planted in the neighbourhood of <Col N="2358" /> Carlow and the other in Cork, and vice versa.  Now, because this foreign capital was added, M. Lippens' toy factory, fortunately, was not set up, but one on a very huge scale.  What is the result?  They are able to take beet from a very extensive territory, and there is the expense put on the faraway farmers of sending up beet, and anyone who knows this business is aware that the proper way to treat beet, when it has been raised from the soil, is to cut off the tops.  The tops are food for cattle; they can also be dug in for manure.  The beet bleaches and its sugar content is wasted if it comes considerable distances.  Therefore, one of the conditions of the highest measure of success is to have your sugar factory in the neighbourhood of the beet producing lands.  It would have been an immense advantage to the country to have the two factories, and we could have two factories, but now we have only one.  That is really the situation.  I believe what was good for agriculture in other States is good for us, where conditions are alike.  Beet growing is the basis of German agriculture; it has made the success of agriculture in France and Belgium, and the sugar industry is one of the great industries of the Dutch. We might have had these.  I believe we still could have them.  But the Minister asks how could the success of the one factory militate against the setting up of another.  Is not that obvious?  Is not it obvious that the Minister for Finance cannot afford to give the same subsidy again?  I do not think the Minister for Finance would dispute that.  Will he then get capital?  Will he get tenders again, forthcoming with the same alacrity as before, where the possibilities of profit are less?  We could have had two.  The two would have been in full blast at the present hour.  Now entirely new contracts would have to be made and a lesser subsidy offered.  Then you would have the complaint of breach of faith, that this Belgian factory on the faith of the subsidy given had secured huge capital to set up a correspondingly huge factory and embark on a big enterprise, and now a rival is set up on terms more favourable with <Col N="2359" /> which it could not successfully compete. Our credit with foreign countries would be impeached in consequence. The treatment given to Von Rossum had its unfortunate repercussions in making it impossible to persuade the Dutch to invest in the paper factory at Clondalkin.  That is how these things circulate amongst investors and business people in other countries.</P>
    <P>Now we had an extraordinary statement from the Minister for Finance, which in ordinary language would be called Bolshevik.  He told the farmers that they could exercise control over the sugar firm by withholding their beet for a year.  I know that that was one of the very fears that made Continental tenderers hold back.  It was the threat that such a combination amongst Irish farmers or the possibility, in view of what had happened in other connections, that made Von Rossum ask for high terms to cover these risks, and now we have a responsible Minister in the House putting it into the minds of the farmers that they could exercise this compulsion upon the factories.  I do not think that is right. I do not think it is consistent with the duties of the Minister's office.</P>

      <P>I think I never listened to a better attempt to damn a great project with faint praise than Deputy Johnson gave utterance to this afternoon in criticising the establishment of the beet factory.  Deputy Magennis says that this beet factory was bound to be a success, that he foresaw that it would be a success.  What reason had he for thinking that?  They attempted to grow beet in this country before.  I think it must be seventy or eighty years ago.  On the banks of the canal near Sallins there is a most interesting building, all overgrown with ivy.  It looks as if it was an ancestral castle of some kind.  In fact, it is nothing of the sort.  It was a sugar beet factory that was being erected and became bankrupt before it was finished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the matter was not a success.  It was a complete failure, and it stopped any more factories being attempted until the last year or so.  I think it required a good deal of courage on the part of anybody to start a factory in the country a year ago, or two years ago.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture drew attention to the fact that the country was only then emerging out of a state of chaos and civil war, and that it required men with more than the usual amount of grit, and hard-headed men of business, to undertake or even think of spending money in the country when it was just emerging from such a state of disturbance.  Not alone that. There was the uncertainty as to whether the climate would suit sugar beet.  There was nothing to show that it would more than any other country.  It was an experiment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse me, sir.  On a point of explanation that is what I intended to convey in my speech: before the tenders were sent in by continental firms experts had considered the whole matter, and were assured of its success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>It had not been tried here, at any rate.  It was not known whether or not the farmers would take to it.  Farmers are very conservative. They have their likes and their dislikes and stick to their opinions, and it was not known whether or not they would take to this matter, as they have done, and carry it to success.  Neither was it known what the conditions of labour might be.  All these things had to be considered.  I think a great deal of grit was evidenced on the part of these contractors by undertaking this in the circumstances.  It was only just that the guaranteed money to them should be equal to the risk they had to run, because they had to run a risk.  I think everyone is glad that the undertaking has been a success.  Of course everyone is wise after the event, and people <Col N="2361" /> are saying that the Government ought to have saved money in this way and in that, and that they gave far too much.  I do not think the country will view the matter in that light.  I think the people generally will be of opinion that the Government was wise in its determination that the first factory established here should be a success at all costs.  If it had been a failure, we would have heard no more with regard to the growing of sugar beet in this country.  No more factories would have been established here, whereas under the present happy conditions there ought to be no difficulty in the future in getting other factories established throughout the country.</P>
      <P>As the result of the success of this factory the subsidy will be much less in the future, and probably in time to come we may be the first or the second country in the world giving no subsidy for the cultivation of beet. There is only one country at present that gives no subsidy with regard to sugar beet.  The Government here have shown great courage and enterprise in this matter.  I think even their enemies will not deny that they have succeeded in establishing a great industry which is bound to have a most beneficial effect on the country as a whole.  This industry will give great employment in the future.  It will give a great chance to the farmers who badly need it. Their position at the moment is not a very happy one, but this will have the effect of giving them a helping hand. It will also be the means of providing employment for a very large number of men out of work.  That ought to be a matter of profound thankfulness for all of us.  I think that when the Government go to the country the success of this undertaking will not be the least feather in their cap.  They succeeded in establishing a successful sugar beet factory in the country at a time when things were in a rather perilous state.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson's speech was an indictment of the Government for an alleged breach of faith with the Dáil.  There was no breach of faith.  It is true that we estimated a production of sugar over the 10 years period amounting to 86,000 <Col N="2362" /> tons.  When I first brought the matter before the Dáil in the financial statement I made on the 22nd April, 1925, I said: &ldquo;The amount of sugar which will be manufactured in the factory here is, of course, problematical, but it has been roughly estimated that the amounts will be 5,000 tons of sugar in the first year and 6,000 tons in the second year and so on.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate on the Third Stage of the Beet Sugar (Subsidy) Bill, I said, in reply to certain remarks of Deputy Heffernan:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It will be in the interests of the factory to get not merely 5,000 acres, but 15,000 acres, grown if it can. If it makes a profit on 5,000 it will make a greater profit on 15,000, because the proportion of overhead charges will be less.  It will be the business of the factory to give a price which will induce the farmer to extend the area under cultivation, and it will be asked to do no more than that.  They should not give one penny more than will induce the farmers to grow the necessary quantity of beet, and the farmer should be satisfied with that.  It is better that the prices should be economic prices so that the farmer will give attention to the matter, be obliged to cultivate the beet properly, and try to get good crops with a high sugar content.  The price at which farmers will grow beet will be one of the factors to be taken into consideration at the end of ten years when the matter has to be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no suggestion at any time that the factory was going to be limited to 86,000 tons.  We only suggested that figure because we thought no more could be got.  The difficulty of inducing farmers to take it up in England was a difficulty which we thought would be found to exist here, and made us believe that it was no use mentioning any higher figure.  The whole course of the debate indicates that this was simply a guess, and that there was no desire to limit it to this figure.  What we were anxious for was to have an experiment on a sufficient scale to prove fully what could be done <Col N="2363" /> in the matter of sugar beet.  At one time we contemplated even a 5,000 ton factory, but we were not very happy about the idea of setting up a 5,000 ton factory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>We were not happy about that because that would not have shown what could be got out of sugar beet, and when we found that the firm of Messrs. Lippens was going to put up a big factory we were very glad of it.  We are very glad, too, that the acreage under beet has exceeded expectations, and that, although it may cost us more during the ten years period, there will be a saving in the long run, because, as I indicated earlier, the profits which may be made in this factory will be the basis on which subsidies for any factories in the future will be fixed.  I think there is absolutely no basis for the suggestion that there has been any breach of faith with the Dáil. What has happened is simply this: that the farmers have proved more willing to grow beet than we anticipated, the yield of beet has been better than we anticipated, and the sugar content has been better.  Deputy Johnson asked why there was no limit to the amount fixed for the first three years.  That provision is an indication that we had not as much belief in the adaptability of the farmers and of their readiness to take it up as we should have had. In the first year, about the time the agreement was signed, all sorts of difficulties were being suggested.  We were afraid that the acreage in the first year or in the first and second year would be very small, and we did not want to fix a limit for any of those years that would force the factory to be below the average of 12,500 tons for the ten-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is no other point that I need mention.  The matter was dealt with very fully by the Minister for Agriculture.  When the Bill was before the Dáil we had what I might call a grousing speech from Deputy Johnson. He was full of suggestions about extravagance in the terms that we were giving to the people who were undertaking <Col N="2364" /> the manufacture of sugar from beet here.  We had gone into the matter carefully and there could not have been a better price obtained.  The firm referred to by Deputy Magennis was also offering something like the same terms.  These were the only two reputable firms from whom we could obtain terms.  Deputy Johnson's talk about the excessive amounts that are being given amounts simply to a waste of time of the Dáil.  It would have been better for the Deputy to argue that we should have abandoned the sugar beet factory altogether.  The Deputy's contribution to-day is just in the same grousing spirit that he displayed when the Bill was before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to hear that the sugar beet factory is going to be a success.  It will be one means of teaching our people that our country can be made almost self-supporting if only they put their shoulder to the wheel and do things in a proper manner.  The growing of beet will provide employment for many who are out of work at the moment.  In speaking on this matter I have a double barrel to my gun, for the reason that it was in my district, at Buttevant, that the idea of growing beet first originated in this country.  They struggled hard at it for a time and got experts over from the Continent with the idea of establishing a beet factory there, but I am sorry to say their efforts were not successful.  I agree with Deputy Magennis that we should have more than one beet factory in the country and for the reason that he pointed out, namely, that the beet in the course of transit, over a long journey, loses a lot of sweetness.  I would appeal to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture that in the very near future they should try to establish a second beet factory at Buttevant. Buttevant is in East Cork, and as Deputies know, all the wise men come from the East.  I would like to point out to the Minister for Agriculture that in the opinion of experts the land around Buttevant, for an area of from 15 to 30 miles, is held to be some of the best in the South of Ireland for the growing of beet.  As the people in <Col N="2365" /> Buttevant were the first in the field in this connection, I hope that when the Government is contemplating setting up another beet factory they will have it established in that district. If they do that I can guarantee the Ministers that the people there, like the people in Carlow, will do everything in their power to make the project a success.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Daly that the people in East Cork made an attempt some years ago to establish this industry in their district. I have been informed that there were some French people over lately, and that they spoke very favourably of part of my district as most suitable for the growing of beet.  Midleton district would provide a most suitable site for a sugar beet factory.  However, we would not fall out if it was either at Buttevant or Midleton.  There is a splendid mill idle in Midleton, and I believe it would be most suitable.  I hope the Minister will give this matter his favourable attention.  The people would be more satisfied if the subsidy were divided.  I understood that there could be a second factory set up in Cork to serve Cork and Waterford and the surrounding districts.  We would not fall out if there was a factory built in any part of Cork.  The experts who were over lately spoke highly of Cork, and they thought it was one of the most favourable places in which to set up a second factory.  If the subsidy was divided fairly it would not cost the country very much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has spoken of the speech I made on the Second Reading of the Beet Sugar (Subsidy) Bill as a grousing speech.  The Minister appears to imagine that the duty of members of the Dáil is to take the propositions of Ministers, whether connected with legislation or finance, and neither criticise nor ask questions, but simply accept those statements as absolute and unquestionable and not requiring discussion or examination.  I am prepared to ask any member of the House to look up the debates on the Second Reading of the Beet Sugar (Subsidy) Bill, and consider whether the statements made <Col N="2366" /> by Ministers on the introduction of that Bill were in any way informative until after criticism had been levelled at the Bill.  Information had to be wrung out of Ministers, as a matter of fact, by putting counter-propositions, by examining such statements as had been made and placing the results of those statements before the House. Only then were we able to get any real evidence or estimates from Ministers of the probable cost of this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that my speech to-day was a grousing speech. Apparently again he thinks that when a scheme is propounded to the country with the assurance that it is an experimental scheme, and that the cost is so much&mdash;two million pounds&mdash;that is sufficient.  We are told that we cannot afford to make any promise about a second factory because of the cost of the first factory; we cannot afford to give an extended guarantee; we cannot afford to impose on the projected firm an extended guarantee to the farmers because it would be more expensive&mdash; even the limit of our expense.  Three months afterwards an undertaking is entered into which implies an additional expenditure of fifty per cent.&mdash; one million pounds.  The Minister thinks we should accept that without any question.  I hope if it is ever my good fortune to be here again that that view of one's duties will not prevail.</P>

The Minister for Defence listened to the speech of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, and I am fairly confident, if I can read his thoughts, that he was imagining what great assistance the Minister for Lands and Agriculture would be in the Chemical Department of the Defence Forces.  In the development <Col N="2367" /> of smoke screens the Minister for Lands and Agriculture was very efficient.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not meet the point that I made in my statement regarding his contention on the Second Stage of the Beet Sugar (Subsidy) Bill about the difficulties of this project and the cost of it.  Within three months there was a subsequent agreement which involved a 50 per cent. increase in the probable cost.  Entering into that agreement without intimating to the Dáil that there was a possibility even of multiplying the commitments by 50 per cent. is the kernel of my complaint. I complain that the Ministers entered into an agreement which added 50 per cent. at least to the commitments of the Dáil in respect to this beet sugar factory without intimating to the Dáil that there had been a change made in the plans.  In respect to the limitation to the one factory of the area covered by the greater part of Leinster and the effect of it, the Minister has pretended to be innocent or ignorant of the way in which the factory&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation. Surely the Deputy must not have listened to the speech of the Minister for Finance.  On the Third Stage of the Bill in 1925 he said: &ldquo;It will be in the interests of the factory to get not merely five but fifteen thousand acres if it can.&rdquo;  Is not that an intimation?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;It will be in the interests of the factory to get... fifteen thousand acres.&rdquo;  The plans and estimates put forward by the Minister for Finance were even minimised by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture when he spoke of hoping to work up to 6,000 tons in the first three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not dealing with acreage.  I will come to acreage in a minute.  The Minister for Finance had an estimate rising up to ten thousand tons of sugar.  The area that is monopolised by the company is defined in the agreement and it covers a line drawn from Swords a little <Col N="2368" /> west of Tullamore and direct south. What is the effect of the agreement? The Minister speaks of fifteen thousand acres.  That acreage is hoped for and has been roughly contracted for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke of fifteen thousand acres as having been mentioned by the Minister for Finance in the Dáil long before the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as something to be worked up to.  The Minister refers to this agreement.  The agreement was entered into in October.  I make this statement, and I am challenging correction, that between June, when the Bill was passed, and October, or immediately after the agreement was entered into, changes took place in the plans of the company.  Once they had got the agreement they decided to enlarge their plans and enter into a wider project.  Now they say that was because they found they had this opening in the agreement which varied distinctly from the project submitted in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the effect of this upon future cultivation and the possibility of a new factory or factories, it is obviously the policy of the company to increase the area under beet cultivation which would supply the factory as near the factory as possible.  This year, out of fifteen thousand acres projected, twelve thousand acres are in the counties of Carlow, Wexford, Kildare, Leix and Kilkenny.  The counties Offaly, Waterford, Wicklow and Tipperary are almost confined to the area under beet last year.  The extremities are going to be left out.  They have certain contracts for three years, I take it.  For instance, in Waterford, where they had 500 odd acres, the increase this year is up to nearly 600 acres.  In the nearer counties you have an increase of over 50 per cent.  The effect of that is that the areas more or less contiguous to the factory are going to be cultivated, and the areas at the outer edges of the monopolistic area are going to be left more or less uncultivated for beet, and the prospect of the second factory drawing from these extended regions is very small, indeed.  The effect of this agreement on a wider scale than was <Col N="2369" /> submitted to the Dáil is to limit the chances of a second or third factory being built.</P>

      <P>No, sir, it is not. The objection that was raised to the second factory when it was discussed on the Second Stage had reference to increasing the period during which the farmers would be guaranteed prices. The additional cost that that would involve was the basis of the objection raised from the Ministerial benches. Then, after having made that statement to the Dáil, they entered into the agreement which involved a 50 per cent. increase.</P>

The Ministry resisted the second factory on the ground of cost, and yet, as Deputy Johnson pointed out, at a later date they committed the State to a greater expenditure and received no return, for one factory concerning one area.</P>

      <P>Let me explain.  It means exactly what it says&mdash;all the factors connected with it, these factors being questions which had nothing whatever to do with cost&mdash;sugar content of beet, weight of beet, quality of beet, processes, and so on.</P>

All the factors had to be considered before making an agreement regarding a second factory.  Then in view of the financial factor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is the conflict between the story put up to us in the Dáil and the actual accomplishment which the Dáil and the country are committed to I say that that is not treating the Dáil fairly, and I hope that this course of conduct will not be repeated by Ministers.</P>

Would Deputy Johnson please imagine for a moment that if last year was a bad year, as this year probably will be, we would only have about half the tonnage, that it would not have a sugar content quite equal to what we had last year, that the subsidy to be paid this year might be only half, and that the whole thing is based on seasons, on tonnage and on sugar content.  Next year we may have 15,000 acres instead of 10,000, but we may have, and probably will have, a smaller subsidy to pay than we paid last year for the 10,000 acres.  These are things that Deputy Johnson and these other experts seem to forget altogether, and in making the statements they have made they ought to advert to these things that cannot be avoided and that must be taken into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKNoonan" hpid="Mr. NOONAN Mr. NOONAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOONAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The impression I have got from the speeches made by some Deputies is that these Deputies are surprised at the success of the Carlow factory, and in forming that <Col N="2372" /> opinion I do not know whether they are agreeably surprised&mdash;I fear not&mdash; at its success.  It appears to me that it would suit their book better and might suit their ideas if the Carlow factory was not what it really is, such a great success, if the Government had not undertaken that industry in Carlow, and if they had not given this subsidy for building up the industry and for making it the success it is, not alone in Carlow, but in the entire Free State, on account of the generous manner in which they have treated this factory.</P>
      <P>Another point I wish to put before the House is this, that the farmers have risen to the occasion, and that the farmers of the Free State, who have always been supposed to be lazy, slow, and not getting the return out of their land that they should get, have proved in these counties that are supplying the factory, that they are up, willing and ready to advance any industry in their own sphere, provided it pays them.  If the Government did not give the subsidy is it probable that the factory would have been a success?  If the factory was not a success, and if it were starved for want of the subsidy, it is more than probable that we would never again have another factory or have sugar beet made a success.  As Deputy Wolfe said, when that industry was undertaken some years ago in this country it was deemed a failure.  If the Government had not handled the situation as they have done it is more than probable that it would have been a failure again.  I would be very glad to see another factory set up, because I think the agricultural industry must be looked upon at all times as our primary industry, and I would be very glad to support the views of Deputy Daly and Deputy Dinneen in favour of another factory.  I hope that before two years pass we will have another factory.</P>

      <P>What Deputy <Col N="2373" /> Gorey said is undoubtedly true, but what Deputy Gorey said is utterly irrelevant to the present consideration. It is absurd for Deputies like Deputy Noonan to suggest, even by innuendo, that we who are criticising the Government's action in this matter are hostile to the sugar industry.  Does Deputy Noonan suggest that I audaciously lied when a few moments ago I joined with Deputy Conlan in expressing my great satisfaction at the success of the factory in Carlow?  Does he doubt the genuineness of that?  Should I not be less than human if I were to fail to rejoice over the success of a measure which I am proud to recall I had a very large part in inducing the Government to take, at a time when Deputy Gorey was full of the value of the potato crop as the basis of Irish agriculture, as against beet?  Deputy Noonan spoke of generous terms.  The terms were not generous.  The Government, I am free to acknowledge, drove a hard bargain at the time, and there were only, as the Minister for Finance rightly says, at the end two really admirable or bona fide tenderers whose terms could be considered.  The difference between them was very slight.  The terms of Van Lippens were considered more favourable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I stand up to repeat is this: that in the Dáil&mdash;and the Official Reports can be examined to test the accuracy of my recollection&mdash;I maintained that the amount of money that the Government could afford to spend, and were prepared to spend by way of subsidy on this would suffice to secure the establishment of two factories, and at the time when the case was being made that only one should be established, because the terms of M. Lippens were so much more favourable, I made the declaration that I quoted a few moments ago, that I was authorised to say, on behalf of Von Rossum, that I would accept these terms, and I asked, steadily and consistently, for two factories, believing then, as I still believe, that all the Irish farmer required was the opportunity and the facilities for developing tillage, and that he would seize them.  I had faith in the farmers of Ireland.  I knew that they were not rightly represented <Col N="2374" /> by Deputy Gorey.  I knew that there were other members on those benches who had a truer understanding of what the needs and the future of Irish agriculture require.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Johnson has shown, and shown beyond any refutation, unless dialectic attempts are made to transmute words to other meanings, is that the Government, assured this year that the utmost amount of money it could afford to expend upon the setting up of this new industry, which has provided a new basis, in my contention, for the agricultural industry, was a limited figure; yet, because of that happy accident that I have given a recital of in my speech to-day, the Government promoted the creation of a factory on so much larger a scale that the amount of subsidy now payable in respect of it is so great that there is no possibility whatsoever of a second factory.  What Deputy Noonan apparently does not realise is, that you can have a great success, over which you can rejoice, and yet wish to have a fuller success.  Would it not be better for the Free State to have a smaller factory in Carlow, quite as successful as this, pro tanto, and to have another factory in Cork, equally successful in the service of that environment?  The State would be very much richer for the two.  It would demonstrate that the success of the Carlow factory was not due to circumstances or conditions peculiar to that locality or peculiar to the working of that particular factory.  It would encourage other enterprises to set up a third and a fourth factory.  Why, only a few years ago there were but three sugar factories in England.  It was when Von Rossum was about to establish more that a petition was put up to him by some of us to do for Ireland what he had done so successfully for England.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is in this position, that the subsidy agreed upon for the Lippens factory, and the opportunity for full development given to it on a bigger scale than was anticipated, means that the Free State could not afford to pay as much of a subsidy to a second factory.  It is idle for Deputies representing Cork to stand up here and say: &ldquo;We look forward to <Col N="2375" /> another factory for Cork.&rdquo;  They might as well look forward to a slice of the moon to save them the cost of electricity, because the Minister for Finance has told them again and again in the House that it is out of the question. If we are to have another factory it will be with a lesser subsidy, and the Lippens factory can then, as I have pointed out already, complain of a breach of faith.  If this House had known at the time when Ministers were contending that there was only sufficient money available for one factory, that the Government would proceed to extend the scope of that factory and increase the amount payable to it out of the taxes of the country, it would have voted for two factories.</P>
    <P>The Ministry turned away the offer of a factory for £400,000 proceeding from the Dutch Sugar King.  That advantage could have been secured for Cork if M. Lippens selected Carlow or for Carlow if M. Lippens selected Cork. I cannot quote, unfortunately, after more than two years, the exact words used.  But I remember pointing out that if this chance were not taken full advantage of, if the colossal offer were not accepted, it would not be available later and that the time would come when the country would realise that it wanted and could make use of a second factory and that there would be no offer forthcoming.  That, I think, is a strong ground of indictment against the Ministry.  They deceived the House&mdash;they declared themselves in favour of what they called an experiment. It was pointed out repeatedly that the proper experiment was in the form of two factories, because the only thing experimental was not whether Ireland was suitable for the growing of sugar beet, but whether or not farmers would have sufficient enterprise and sufficient courage and inducement to do what. after all required from them &mdash;let us not forget&mdash;a somewhat courageous venture, because the nature of the beet crop was such that they should break up a huge amount of arable land. that it should be very heavily manured and very heavily and expensively worked, and that there should be a rotation of crops for four <Col N="2376" /> or five years.  So that the moment the farmer committed himself to the beet adventure he committed himself for a series of years to a certain line of farming operations.  Therefore it would not have been wholly unnatural, and certainly not proof of sluggishness, backwardness or any other kind of inertia on the part of the Irish farmer if he held back.  The point was to give them the inducement.  I remember arguing against Deputy Gorey at the time when he was eulogising the potato crop that we had before us the sad spectacle of a huge potato crop unsaleable, whereas the provision of two sugar factories, each demanding ready supplies in a year, would offer an assured market and a fixed price&mdash;the very ideal that the farmer wants.  Not only that, but it would have been possible, once the crop was certain of being available for the factory, that an advance price by way of instalment would be paid for it&mdash;it was a cash crop.  It is quite clear to demonstration from the argument of Deputy Johnson in his last speech that the Government have committed the country to an expenditure on a single factory which would have amply sufficed to provide two&mdash;not toy factories but admirably equipped, efficient factories, working the beet upon a fairly large scale.  The country has lost that advantage through the Ministry's action. Yet they boast about the success of their enterprise.  The thing has succeeded, no doubt, partly by accident and partly because farmers played up and exhibited that capacity which we, who believed in them, knew that they possessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we dispose of Section 1 I want to point out to the Dáil that in my opinion we are authorising the appropriation of something like £700,000 more than is likely to be needed for the services required.  I base that plea on the Appropriation Account issued to Deputies about three weeks ago.  Deputies looking at it will find a table showing the excess of estimates over expenditure for the year 1925/26.  They will find that we voted then £3,800,000 more than was actually required, and that that amount was returned to the Exchequer.  For two <Col N="2377" /> millions of that I will not charge the Minister with any error in accountancy. Two millions of that excess vote was due to the fact that the Property Losses Commission was not functioning as quickly as had been anticipated.  The Minister had no control over that Commission, and he, no doubt, did rightly in providing an adequate sum of money in case it worked more quickly.  But there still remains £1,800,000, which, after all, is a very substantial sum, the equivalent of more than 1/6d. on the income tax.  If Deputies will look at the report in detail they will see that there prevails throughout the public service a practice of over-estimating. Take a few sample items:&mdash; The vote for the Revenue Department was over-estimated by more than £36,000. The vote for Public Works and Buildings was over-estimated by more than £250,000, though that is in part due to a paper transaction.  Still, when you have a total vote of £894,000, and find £252,000 of that amount not spent, it makes you think the Estimates should be scrutinised more closely.  The Gárda Síochána Vote was over-estimated by £68,000, and the Prisons Board, which was even more remarkable, by £31,000. These are services in which you cannot estimate with absolute accuracy, but I suggest that they might easily be estimated more closely than has been done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Local Government and Public Health over-estimated by £44,000 on a total vote of £564,000. The office of the Minister for Education was over-estimated by £17,000.  I should have thought that the commitments of that office could easily have been foreseen.  The Department of Agriculture over-estimated by £42,000. The Land Commission over-estimated by £92,000 on a vote of £731,000. In the two big spending departments&mdash;the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Army&mdash;there were over-estimates of more than £200,000&mdash; in other words, more than 8 per cent. on each vote.  It is impossible to estimate absolutely accurately, but I suggest that for estimates to be habitually from 8 to 10 per cent. more than is required is placing an unfair and undue burden on the taxpayer.  I know <Col N="2378" /> that in his present Budget the Minister has made an allowance of £650,000 for over-estimating, but, judging by the experience of the past, I believe he might have allowed £2,000,000 for overestimation, and have given relief to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>We find in these days Deputies more prone to make speeches outside than inside the Dáil, and in those speeches outside there are promises of great savings and great economics and frequent suggestions that the income tax can be abolished and expenditure reduced on a large scale.  I confess that the only possibility of any substantial reduction in expenditure amounting to millions lies in checking the practice of over-estimating, because it constantly happens when the money has been estimated for&mdash;the Minister knows it as well as I do&mdash;a new subhead is opened and it is spent, not for the purpose originally foreseen by the Dáil.  The Minister may laugh, but this is an indictment on the efficiency of his Department, which is supposed to overhaul estimates.  If we have to face an over-estimate of £1,800,000&mdash;I am allowing for the two millions which is over-estimated on the Property Losses Vote and which I do not think he was to blame for&mdash;it is not desirable from the point of view of financial administration.  I am not approaching this in a spirit hostile to the Minister.  I realise as much as the Minister does that a great many of the claims of power to reduce expenditure on election platforms are fallacious, but I do suggest that a tighter system of financial administration, a tighter check on estimates, would be a sound, a constitutional, and, I think, an effective method of procuring economy.</P>
    <P>There is a general tendency to over-estimate. The Minister has admitted it by making allowances for it in his Budget, but the difference between us is that I think he has under-estimated it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence over-estimated by about 8 per cent.  There is a tendency in all except a few Votes&mdash;not in old age pensions, not in Supplementary Agricultural Grants, because these are fixed by statute&mdash;but in the current working of public departments there is a general tendency to over-estimate, <Col N="2379" /> and I believe it would be far better to cut those estimates more closely and if necessary to come to the Dáil with supplementary estimates later.  The Dáil has never been churlish in dealing with supplementary estimates.  As a rule they are granted readily the moment a case is made for them, even when they touch on matters of substantial importance. I suggest that the sounder and wiser way is to limit the spending departments rigidly, and, if the limit has been drawn too closely, to come to the Dáil and ask for supplementary estimates. Therefore I take this opportunity of suggesting that past experience has shown that the demands made in this Bill are likely to be excessive and consequently to impose an undue burden on the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>The effect of the amendment is to alter the number of members of the Council from nine to eleven to provide what was not provided in the Bill as introduced, namely, a separate representation for the College of Physicians and College of Surgeons, and, in order to secure the appropriate balance in the Council, keeping to odd numbers, to take an additional representative for the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>(2) Whenever a vacancy (in this Act called a casual vacancy) occurs in the membership of the Council by reason of the death, resignation, or disqualification of a direct representative or of a person elected under this sub-section to fill the place of a direct representative, the Council shall at its next meeting but one after the occurrence of such vacancy elect a registered medical practitioner resident in Saorstát Eireann to fill such vacancy.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment by the Minister for Industry and Commerce accepting the principle of Deputy Doctor Hennessy's amendment.

      <P>The point was that, in the case of a vacancy, it was provided in the Bill that the Council should co-opt a member, but it was pointed out that, if two casual vacancies occurred and if two members were co-opted, the medical practitioners would be deprived of representation for three or four years.  This amendment seeks to amend that so that an election would take place instead of co-option.</P>

      <P>I desire to draw attention to the fact that sub-section (4) of Section 28 makes provision for an appeal to the High Court and also for the evidence of persons of standing in the medical profession.  I suggest to the Minister that, on the Report Stage, he might consider the propriety of making provision so that the High Court might be assisted by a medical assessor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of providing for a medical assessor was considered and rejected after consideration. A medical assessor on a matter of that kind would, of course, give the court assistance from the point of view of a distinguished member of the profession, a member of standing and repute, but, in point of fact, where matters of professional conduct, or misconduct, are concerned it is not so much the point of view of an individual that one must aim at as the public opinion of the profession, so to speak. <Col N="2388" /> One could imagine individuals of quite high standing taking different views on the same issue.  I do not think that we could do better than leave it to the appellant on one hand and the Council on the other to marshal as many eminent members of the profession as each can to give the court the assistance of their views.  I know that the Minister has discussed and considered the question of assisting the court with something in the nature of an assessor chosen from within the profession, and that he decided not to embody a provision of that kind in the Bill.  It is however, open to the Deputy to discuss it further with the Minister on Report.</P>

    <P>The point of this amendment is that this body has a very definite set of duties to perform and we feel that if there is to be any question of delegation of its task, or any part of its task, <Col N="2389" /> it should be to a special Committee of itself&mdash;that it ought not to be open to the Free State Medical Council to assign to some person outside that body the task of investigating charges in a particular case.  It might be convenient for the Council to appoint two or three of its members to investigate and report, but the Council ought not, we feel, to go outside its own ranks and delegate to some person, not a member of the Council, any part of its task of investigation.</P>

      <P>I do not see any objection to the provision.  The Local Government Department frequently hold inquiries on oath.  Its inspectors, I think, are empowered to hold such inquiries.  We do not think it is unwise, where a man's reputation and whole professional career are in the balance, to give to the body that must try that issue the power to take evidence on oath.  It is a very <Col N="2390" /> serious matter for any practitioner to be struck off the register.  His whole life and career are in the balance.  The tribunal that must decide that issue ought to have power to put its witnesses on oath.  If there is a very serious view to the contrary, we are prepared to consider it, but that is our own view of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different opinions held about the question. The point that occurs to me is that if evidence is to be taken on oath it makes necessary the presence of some legally-qualified person to see that the evidence is taken in a legal manner. Otherwise, it is quite conceivable that difficulties would arise, particularly if there were a subsequent appeal.  If the Minister would inquire into the position, I would be prepared to bring the question up on Report.</P>

      <P>I have very little doubt that a practitioner fighting for his professional existence will be legally represented before this body.  There is nothing in the Bill which would restrict the Council, if they felt that they had need of legal assistance, from engaging some person.  I should think that most of the persons appearing before this Council in the position of defendants will probably take the precaution of being represented by a legally qualified person.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider the advisability of empowering the Council, as one of its ordinary functions in an investigation of this kind, to have a legal assessor? I quite agree with him that if there is a question of the professional reputation and future of a man at stake, the evidence tendered against him or for him ought to be on oath, and that witnesses should not be permitted to withhold their evidence under anything less than the penalty prescribed in the Bill. There is always in these cases the technical difficulty of the law of evidence. As the Minister knows, there is nothing more difficult for a court to determine than what exactly is evidence.  There <Col N="2391" /> is, for instance, the question of hearsay. This section would be, to my mind, highly satisfactory, provided it were clearly stated that the practitioner before the Council should be entitled to be represented by counsel and that the Council should also be empowered to have its legal assessor on such a trial.</P>

      <P>I will discuss that with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is a question, simply, whether or not the Council would require express powers for this purpose so long as there is nothing prohibitory in the Bill.  I should have thought that under the Bill as it stands it would be open to the Council, in any particularly difficult case where they thought there was need for it, to have the assistance of someone who would keep them right on matters arising out of the law of evidence.  Clearly, that is a point to be considered&mdash;whether there is need for an express provision in the Bill empowering the Council to have such assistance.  I will have the point looked into.</P>

      <P>So long as those words were there, they put the Medical Council in a position to employ a legal judge of these affairs.  But then the point is still left in doubt as to whether the practitioner is entitled to have the benefit of counsel to represent him, it seems to me, from the reading of the Bill, that the Council would have such complete power that it could refuse this privilege.  So long as there is opportunity for the Council to refuse to permit a man, who is practically on his trial before what is practically a court, to have legal assistance, it would scarcely be ideal justice.</P>

      <P>We are talking about things that are scarcely analogous.  In so far as this election would be analogous to any elections of the Dáil, it would be to a University. But there is a point of substance in it. It is a question whether a joint election is a true election, for this reason: Let us suppose that there are two vacancies, and eight or ten candidates, and you vote on the same paper for two persons.  That is one position.  The other position is that you proceed to fill one of the vacancies and then, with due advertence to the result of that election and who was the person who got in and who were the persons who did not, you proceed to have your second.  A man might vote differently, according to the way the election was taken.  You might get a different result. I am not sure whether, if you are out for a deadly accurate reflection of the wishes of the resident practitioners, it would not be better to have separate elections, because a man might vote on the second election with advertence to the first, and so on.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 7, to delete sub-sections (1) and (2) and substitute the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Corporation shall pay to its members dividends at the fixed rate of five per cent. per annum on the amount of its capital for the time being paid up and such dividends shall be paid by the Corporation half-yearly on such dates as shall be appointed for that purpose by the Directors with the approval of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2397" /> (2)  If on any of the days appointed under this section for the payment of half-yearly dividends the Corporation have not any or sufficient moneys available for the payment of the dividend so payable on such day the Corporation shall forthwith certify to the Minister the sum which with the moneys (if any) so available is required to pay such dividend and upon receipt of such certificate the Minister shall advance to the Corporation the amount so certified by the Corporation and the moneys so advanced shall be forthwith applied by the Directors in or towards payment of such dividend.</P>
    <P>The real difference between the amendment and sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 7 is that it is set out that dividends are to be paid on such dates as shall be appointed for that purpose by the Directors, with the approval of the Minister, whereas Section 7, sub-section (1) states: &ldquo;The Corporation shall not at any time pay to its members dividends at a rate exceeding 5 per cent. per annum on the amount of its capital for the time being paid-up.&rdquo; The amendment really inserts that the dividend shall be paid half-yearly.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <P>I move amendment 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 58, Section 11, to delete the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;seven&rdquo; and to delete the word &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;three&rdquo;; in lines 62 and 63 to delete the words &ldquo;(in addition to the said four directors) by the Minister from time to time as occasion offers,&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;from time to time as occasion offers by the Minister from amongst the three directors nominated by him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a fairly important amendment. The section, if amended, would read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Articles of Association of the Corporation shall provide that the number of directors (including the chairman) shall be seven, of whom three (not including the chairman) shall be nominated by the Minister from time to time as occasion <Col N="2398" /> requires, and that if and so long as the Minister holds more than two hundred thousand shares of the Corporation, the chairman of the Corporation shall be nominated from time to time as occasion offers by the Minister from amongst the three directors nominated by him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first change is that the maximum is reduced from ten to seven.  There does not appear to be any sufficient reason why it should be essential to appoint ten directors; seven appears to be sufficient.  Correspondingly, there is a change in the Minister's nominees from four to three, and it provides this change, that so long as the Minister holds more than two hundred thousand shares of the Corporation he shall nominate the chairman from these three. The position then will be that the Minister will have three nominees, and, in addition, any director he can elect or that his proxies can elect, as a result of any holding of shares he may have. It is considered that that will give him quite sufficient control of the operations of the Corporation.  It is very hard to say what a State bank is, but I think it is undesirable that, in ordinary day to day administration, this bank should be completely controlled by the Minister.  He does require, and should get, at any rate, control, in view of the fact that he is really liable for all shares as well as for the certificates. He guarantees both principal and interests, and for that reason he is entitled to have sufficient control, and should have sufficient control.  It is, I think, the duty of the Minister to see that he has sufficient control over the operations of the Corporation, so as to ensure that the State will not be called on to honour these guarantees.  I think it is clear enough he has that control in the Bill, but I do not think it is right to set out from the point of view that the operations of the Corporation, as carried out by the directors, will not be what they should.  On the other hand, the Minister will always have at least three nominees there.  If he has to take up more of the shares he will elect, of course, further directors, or will take his part in electing directors, in accordance with the number of shares he may have.  Election is one <Col N="2399" /> thing, nomination is another.  He has all the rights of election that he would be entitled to, so far as he holds any shares.  In addition, he has the right to nominate three directors.  Therefore, even if the Minister has no shares, he will have three nominees out of seven.  On the other hand, no certificate can be issued until the Minister agrees to give his guarantee, and that guarantee will be given in blocks of, say, £100,000.  Consequently, at any time he will be in a position to bring the operations of the Corporation to a standstill, if he considers, in the light of the knowledge which he can obtain from the minimum of three directors whom he will have, that the operations of the Corporation are not being properly conducted.  Of course, it is not desirable that a position should arise in which the only way the Minister would exercise his influence would be by refusing to guarantee certificates. The fact that he can do that, in my opinion, will amply safeguard him.  It will be just as much to the interest of the other directors as to the Minister to see that such a state of affairs does not arise as to make it necessary for the Minister to refuse his guarantee. Consequently I recommend that change to the Dáil, and I think it is sound.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the case the Minister has made is rather a case for giving the Minister the right to nominate four instead of three, the chairman to be chosen from the four. He has pointed out that the Minister is ultimately responsible for whatever commitments the bank may undertake, and, notwithstanding that responsibility, he is relinquishing control of the policy of the bank.  I think that is a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very debatable point, but it appears to me like this: Giving the Minister the right in all circumstances, even though he has no holding in the company, to nominate four means that the Minister takes the responsibility from the date of operation from the bank and from the other directors.  It would be open to them to say, &ldquo;You took care that we would be an absolute minority, even <Col N="2400" /> though we are shareholders; you took care that we are a minority, and that we cannot have an effective voice in the running of this bank, and you take to yourself responsibility for the administration of the business of the bank.&rdquo; I do not think that would be a desirable state of affairs.  On the other side, I think, that the interests of the Minister will be safeguarded by the fact that he has three directors there in any circumstances, with, of course, the opportunity of electing more if his holdings are bigger.  In addition, no certificates can be issued without his guarantee, and he will have a full knowledge of all the relevant facts every time he is asked for a guarantee, because he will have whatever information his nominees think it right to give him.</P>

      <P>In page 5, section 12, to insert before sub-section (2) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Corporation before lending or advancing money to the persons and for the purposes stated in the foregoing sub-section shall have due regard to the desirability of promoting the purchase of articles manufactured in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that, as far as possible, the Corporation will not loan money to any persons or co-operative societies without being satisfied, on investigation, that the money so loaned will not be used in the direction of purchasing, in other countries, goods or commodities, agricultural or otherwise, which might and could be manufactured here in the Saorstát.  At the moment we have these societies engaged in the importation of large quantities of foreign goods, flour and various other commodities as well as agricultural machinery, implements, etc.  We know that numbers of these articles are produced here at home, and it is not desirable, as I think the House will agree, that we should loan the money of the State to such societies in order to assist them in exporting additional <Col N="2401" /> sums of money from this country for such articles.  The amendment is a reasonable one and I hope the Minister and the House will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that if the amendment were inserted it would make no change in the section.  The amendment, as I read it, is not mandatory. It is merely a pious expression of opinion, and I say that although I am open to the question if I am right: &ldquo;Why not insert it?&rdquo;  In my opinion an amendment like this would be a dead letter in a section such as this.  I do not mean to say that it would not be the duty of the directors, so far as they could, to encourage Irish enterprise, but this amendment would be gratuitous in an Act dealing with credit.  To insert it would be to presuppose that the directors nominated would not have due regard to the point of view set out in it.  If you do insert it, well, there are a number of other aspirations that you might also insert, such as that the directors should have regard to this, that and the other.  I daresay that when anyone makes an application for a loan, and when that comes before the directors, they will have regard to five or six considerations which may not be present to us at the moment.  They will also have regard to many obvious considerations which are not inserted in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I think it would be a wrong principle to begin inserting in an Act words such as are in the amendment, merely because one Deputy places a special value on them.  If that were agreed to, it would lead to every other Deputy in the House facing legislation in the same manner, and inserting clauses to suit themselves, underlining some consideration in a general section which they might think should get special emphasis.  Moreover, it depends to a great extent on the particular transaction as to what they should take into account.  An amendment of this kind has no place, I submit, in a general section like this, and I ask the Deputy to withdraw it. It means nothing and would be completely out of place in a section like this.</P>

      <P>Then the condemnation that the Minister has levelled at this particular amendment is a condemnation of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  Am I to understand that the Minister is at loggerheads with his colleagues against the provisions of that Act?  The financial facilities provided under that Act are for the purpose of encouraging not only an actual business concern, but businesses that are related within this country.  I take it that that is the object of this amendment.  I am not sure whether it is not taken holus-bolus from that Act. Perhaps Deputy Hennessy would tell us.  I do say that the Minister, if he inquires from the Minister for Industry and Commerce or from the Minister for Finance, will find that the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act is not very far from this Bill in its financial principles.  It actually contains a provision of this kind, one of the purposes of which is the purpose that is sought for in this amendment.  The Minister's condemnation of this amendment is a condemnation of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister will see that there is more than that in it. The business of agricultural credit is to enable agriculture to get an advantage for the purpose of promoting its prosperity and, incidentally, to promote the prosperity of other industries auxiliary to agriculture.  One of the ways to do that is that the people lending money will have regard as to the purposes and the method whereby that money is being expended.  Let us take an instance.  Money may be loaned to <Col N="2403" /> any farmer for the purpose of erecting buildings on his farm or for the purpose of purchasing agricultural machinery or implements.  If you take the building of a hay-barn, we know that there are hay-barns built in Ireland, and it is not an unreasonable thing to ask that the people lending the money for the building of a hay-barn should require that hay-barn to be built by Irish labour, let us say, from Dublin, Wexford or Cork rather than from Scotland.

      <P>I do not know that there is any point in that.  We are loaning this money to co-operative societies for the purpose of assisting agriculture, and I think that the Dáil, before finally passing this Bill, should ensure that the money will be spent, as far as possible, in the interests of the State&mdash;that as little of this money as possible will go outside the State for agricultural or other articles which might be got at home.  There is unfortunately the desire on the part of many people to-day to go abroad for many things which are manufactured here.  They will not go to the trouble to satisfy themselves that such goods are manufactured here.  It is as necessary in this Bill as it has been in other Bills that we have passed here to ensure that the interests of the State are protected.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has foregone his liability to appoint a majority of directors.  He has thrown that overboard, and, consequently, there only remains the formulated declaration of the will of the Oireachtas in the Bill.  It is undoubtedly only a declaration of the intentions of the Dáil.  The intentions of the Dáil incorporated in a Bill of this kind will surely have some weight with the directorate, the chairman of which may be appointed by the Minister, and three of which will be appointed by the Minister.  I think a declaration of that kind inserted in the Bill would certainly have a distinct weight with the directors.  Now, I can imagine that the definite feeling amongst members of the House is that this agricultural credit should be provided for the purpose of promoting agriculture in the first place, and, secondly, assisting other auxiliary industries which supply the agriculturists.</P>
      <P>If that is the view of the House, I think it is a very good thing to have it incorporated in the Bill as an indication to this body of directors that it is the Legislature's intention that they should put it into operation to the best of their judgement.  If it is not put in it is open to the directors to say that the view of the Legislature is that these articles, which are to be provided out of the State guaranteed credit, may be bought in Belgium, Germany, England, Japan, or wherever they may be got at the lowest possible price.  It is a reasonable thing to argue, in this House at any rate, that the State guaranteed credit should be, so far as the directors think, reasonably and practicably used for the promotion of auxiliary industries in Ireland.</P>

      <P>You would have something made mandatory in the form Deputy Magennis mentions.  But why was not that done first?  If someone came along with such an amendment, nobody would vote for it.  We realise at once it would be impossible.  Look at the position the directors of the bank would be in.  Let us suppose that in the lending of money they were to give the preference to persons who were dealing in Irish manufacture, other things being equal.  They get an application for a loan.  They have to inquire whether the particular articles the intending borrower is dealing in are as good as similar articles produced in other countries.  They have to hold an inquisition in regard to every loan if they are to carry out the terms of the section.  They have to see whether the Irish article is as good as the English <Col N="2408" /> article, and, having examined the article&mdash;and this would be a very difficult task&mdash;they are then to give the perference to enterprises of that sort and to the person looking for a loan on that basis.  No bank could do that.  It is not the function of the bank directors. That is the reason you have a pious aspiration here; but it really means nothing.  The directors will, of course, take these things into account. They should.  That is what they are there for.  That is the best guarantee you have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to move amendment 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 55, Section 12 (3), before paragraph (a) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) any person applying under clause (e) of sub-section (1) for an advance to pay off a loan made by a bank and expended in the purchase of land, where dispute has arisen and agreement has subsequently been reached between the parties as to the amount properly to be repaid in view of the circumstances of the original transaction, unless and until the Corporation is satisfied that the amount so agreed upon is a reasonable and equitable determination of the applicant's indebtedness to the said Bank.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2409" /> Taken without the amendment the section would empower, by the Memorandum and Articles of Association, the new Credit Corporation to advance money to a farmer to pay off a loan or advance made to him by a bank for the purchase of a farm, and grievous difficulties might arise for the farmer in connection with a transaction of that sort.  The aim of the amendment is to provide in some degree some small measure of defence for the farmer. Those who have studied the Second Interim Report of the Banking Commission on agricultural credit will have noticed the admissions that are made in it with regard to advances made at a certain period for the purchase of farms.  Most of us will remember that in the first seven years after the great European war wholesale inflation took place; there was the most extraordinary debasement of the currency in history.  There had been, as we are all aware, a gold basis for the currency, and an obvious limitation existed upon the issue of bank notes as representative money.  But once the stage in the war was reached at which these restrictions were removed, there was wholesale debasement of currency, there was an unlimited issue of bank notes, and, furthermore, one of the evils of the banking system which will yet have to be challenged if society is to be saved from being a slave altogether to the monied interests, was in operation, that is, the issue of overdrafts by banks to persons, merely honouring the cheques that these persons are empowered to write and sign against some security, or with nothing at all except what the mere ipse dixit of the bank directors allows them to draw.</P>
    <P>In that period of inflation everyone who thought he saw a good thing, as it is called, everyone who thought he saw a means of making money if he had capital, got advances of this representative and flat money&mdash;mere paper. Amongst the other victims of this inflation were Irish farmers, who, seeing prices high, cattle selling at double the price they used to fetch normally, were induced to buy other farmer in the hope of making wealth.  In those transactions the banks participated.  That is <Col N="2410" /> not a mere allegation; the Banking Commission itself admits it.  I should by right quote largely from pages 9 and 10 of the report, but for brevity sake I will confine myself to this one passage:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Irish banks, like banks in other countries, undoubtedly made unduly heavy loans to farmers and farm interest.  At that time land values were high and rising, and there was a prevailing belief all over the world that they would be maintained.  Since then they have in many cases shrunk by 50 per cent., and bank loans which in 1920 appeared to be protected by ample margins are now of questionable value.</P>
    <P>That is, bad debts.</P>
    <P>Certainly many such loans can be paid off only slowly, or, in other words, they have assumed a &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; character.  That banks in such cases should be reluctant to increase their commitments on land or the security thereof is natural.</P>
    <P>About 1920 or 1921 the order came from the financial heads, great banking interests, the chiefs of the moneyed interests in Wall Street and in London, to deflate, and these loans were called in, credits curtailed, and notes cancelled. No one here in this island, remote from all these centres of operations, seemed to be aware of what was happening until they suddenly discovered that they were getting only half the prices that in that period of apparent wealth they were receiving for their produce and their cattle. What that means is that a farm bought with low value money has to be paid for in terms of a high value money, money twice the value, so that while the farmer and the workman are being exhorted to more and fuller production, really to meet these liabilities in the ordinary way would require more than double ordinary production.</P>
    <P>Many small farmers, and some large farmers, are in a bad way on account of these transactions into which they were induced to enter.  I will read out, with a few permissible disguises, details of two or three typical transactions of the kind to which I am referring.  This is one case, where a <Col N="2411" /> farmer&mdash;A&mdash;living in a western county borrowed from the Bank of Ireland in his town in the autumn of 1920 a sum of £15,000 to pay for a farm.  The rent was pretty high.  I cannot give the details, because it might be possible for some Sherlock Holmes to identify the borrower, but it was over £300.  The area was about 600 acres and the rent works out at something like £25 an acre.  Interest paid to the bank is £4,236, and amount now owing to the bank is £15,000&mdash;that is, the original advance and one year's interest.  The position of the purchaser at the date of purchase was an overdraft in the bank of close on £2,000.  Security, nature and amount of, held by the bank&mdash;all the security of any use that the bank holds are the deeds of a near relative's place, on which there was an incumbrance. Now, the bank advanced to this man, who is in this peculiar financial position, and with that type of security, £15,000, and that is still owing.  I submit that the bank was a participant in a speculation at a particular moment; furthermore, the money advanced was representative money, paper, not a gold basis, and no gold equivalent or security therefor.</P>
    <P>I take as a second example farmer B, this time in the Midlands and with another bank.  In the summer of 1921 he bought a farm, the price of which was £1,900.  He borrowed from the bank a sum slightly below that amount. The farm is free of rent, the area a little over twenty acres.  That was a pretty stiff price.  He has paid nearly £1,000 in interest to the bank, but still owes the bank the original advance, plus twelve months' interest.  At the date of purchase his position was that he owned a very small farm of what he describes as fair land.  He is a married man with four children.  He had four guarantors, I should add, one of them solvent.  I will take another case.  I have several, but this one will suffice.  It is the case of Mr. C, again in the Midlands, the same bank but not the same branch.  The farm was bought early in 1920, the price paid £6,000, amount borrowed from the bank £4,500, interest paid to the bank about £2,000, amount now owing £4,500, the original <Col N="2412" /> amount borrowed.  At the date of purchase the purchaser was employed on the farm of a relative.  The security held by the bank was another relative's comparatively small farm.</P>
    <P>The position is, naturally, that those who are struggling in these days of adversity to meet these liabilities find that they cannot meet them, and they are told that it is owing to economic law that they are hit so hard.  Just as we used to hear a good deal about the iron law of wages we are asked to believe that this pressure and this hopeless condition of the farmers, of which these examples are typical, are like the cases of the men where the Mississippi has overflowed its banks, what the lawyers call the act of God.  But what I want to draw attention to is that this is not the act of God; it is the act of the banking firms, it is the work of the moneyed interests, the inflation brought about by them and the sudden deflation brought about by them.  The order went forth from the headquarters of the banking interests, deflation began, and this unhappy position has been created.  If it were proposed that a bank should be able to shift its losses by forcing upon a farmer an agreement as to the amount at which the indebtedness should be fixed and so enable the farmer to come to the Credit Corporation and ask for an advance, it is quite easy to see how pressure, undue and unfair, could be put upon the farmer to call it an agreement, whereas in reality it was a one-sided case.</P>
    <P>I daresay the Minister will reply that the Credit Corporation may be trusted to do what is right and to exercise wisdom and discretion as in the other case.  The important thing is that the public have a right to know whether or not a State body is being set up, with State guarantees, in order to enable banks to get free of difficulties into which they have themselves entered and into which they induced others to enter, when everyone believed that great profits were to be made out of agricultural produce.  The important thing to note is that the Banking Commission, which was made up largely of bankers, were fair enough and frank enough to point out the real character of a joint stock bank, <Col N="2413" /> and to point out that it has no bowels of compassion&mdash;in Biblical language&mdash; and no heart of mercy.  I am quoting from page 10, on which, after making a number of comments, they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All this is no necessary criticism upon the banks themselves, but is merely a statement that since they are organised as deposit banks they are charged with a certain kind of responsibility; and it is their primary duty to discharge that responsibility. They are, moreover, concerned with the shareholders' demand for a profit, and, like private enterprises, they naturally feel it a duty to promote the interests of their owners to the utmost degree that is honourably possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that apologia for the joint stock banks there is an admission which is followed up later:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That banks in such cases should be reluctant to increase their commitments on land or the security thereof is natural.  That in such cases the farmer who desires to borrow upon what he considers good security should feel that the banks are unduly conservative or restrictive, is equally natural.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The difficulty, therefore, for a farmer to carry on with his bank, to which he owes money already, is that the bank takes the same view as the Minister for Agriculture expressed here the other day, that land is a very poor security.  Deputy Sir James Craig followed him almost immediately with the remark that farming was in a very bad way.</P>
    <P>That being the view the banks have, they will be very naturally anxious to get their accounts settled up and they could put pressure upon a farmer to agree by saying to him: &ldquo;The amount of the indebtedness is so-and-so, now go along and get from the Credit Corporation the amount to clear that off and all will be well between us, and you may get a further advance from us if you need it, or, at any rate, you will have your credit restored.&rdquo;  It is to prevent transactions of that kind in the interest of the farmer who is hit that the amendment is proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the old suggestion <Col N="2414" /> that the banks should write off part of the debts due to them&mdash;that is to say, the overdrafts.  In my opinion, that is possible on one condition only. It is at least logical to ask the banks to write off a part of the debts due to them if you couple it with the proviso that they shall also write off a part of the debts due by them, namely, the deposits.  That has at least the merit of being logical and could be done. That is called in plain English national bankruptcy.  That is to say, if we reach the stage that the banks of the country are to write off a part of the debts due to them and if, as it must be, as a corollary to that they are also to write off a part of the debts due by them, namely, deposits and securities which they hold, then, as I say, that could be done.  It would be quite logical, but it is known as national bankruptcy. It is bankruptcy, and bankruptcy is a well-recognised way out of difficulties. I do suggest, however, that you cannot debate such a question as the desirability of going bankrupt as a nation&mdash; and that is what it would amount to if all the banks were to be taken in&mdash;on an amendment on the Report Stage of a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the amendment itself, there is a misconception.  The Corporation when applied to for a loan by any applicant will not take into account whether the money is required in order to finance a reasonable and equitable liquidation of some other loan.  That is not their business.  Their business, apart from special considerations about the objects for which the loan is required, which are set out in the Bill, is to see whether the applicant can offer security for it, and whether he is the sort of person who should get a loan.  That is their primary function. It is not their function to see whether the particular amount applied for represents an equitable or reasonable liquidation of another loan.  It might be a perfectly equitable and reasonable liquidation of another loan, from Deputy Magennis's point of view, and at the same time the Corporation might have to refuse to advance the money for the purpose, because the applicant had no security, either of a personal <Col N="2415" /> character if you like, or a property security.  On the other hand, it might be&mdash;I am again speaking from the Deputy's point of view&mdash;an inequitable liquidation of an old debt, and yet the Corporation might be in a position to advance the money, because there was ample security forthcoming.  So that the amendment is, I suggest, due to a misconception of the functions of this Corporation.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that an amendment largely to ensure what Deputy Magennis appears to require is needed in the Bill.  The Banking Commission made a recommendation that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;in order that any outstanding conditions of friction or dissatisfaction as between the banker and the farmer may be brought to a close by enabling the latter to transfer his loan if he so desires; and, secondly in order to enable any bank which so desires to obtain liquidation of long-term loans,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>the proposed institution should be specially authorised to take over or rediscount loans which have already been made to farmers or farm interests. That is the proposal in Section 12 (1) (e).  But the Commission go further and they say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It should be carefully observed that, in the event of such transfer, the new institution would expect those who are already responsible for the loan to continue to guarantee it, unless, of course, some basis of adjustment could be found which would make it possible to effect a release.  The new institution could obviously not undertake to assume any responsibility for losses possibly resulting from unwise loans heretofore made.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is generally admitted that many of the loans were unwise.  The instances that Deputy Magennis read out seem to suggest that they were of a kind that would not be granted to-day or at any time other than the period of war inflation.  There is a possibility that a Board which may be manned by a majority of banking directors will stress the desirability, as expressed by the Banking Commission, to transfer <Col N="2416" /> these loans, and by such means remove the friction or dissatisfaction that exists as between the banks and the farmers&mdash;to transfer the dissatisfaction and friction to the Credit Corporation. The Corporation may well be wise and require that the present or other guarantors should again guarantee, but unless there is an agreement regarding composition, I think it is very unlikely that a banking firm acting on its own would do that.  But a group of representatives of banking firms, who wanted to transfer the liability, might be induced to do this thing, and, as I gather, the object of the amendment is a fair one&mdash;to make it an obligation upon the Corporation to examine into the circumstances of the original loan and to see whether the transfer to them of the responsibility is one which is likely to be equitable to all sides, and whether in fact it is not possible to arrive at this basis of adjustment which the Banking Commission have put forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks about national bankruptcy, and suggests that the idea behind the amendment is one which foretells national bankruptcy.  Does the Minister say that the present liabilities on these loans must be met in full, otherwise it is national bankruptcy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposition is that there should be some general agreement between the farmers and the banks who have lent this money before the transfer is made over to the Corporation, and the Minister seems to say that once there is any talk about making a composition in respect of those loans it is a confession of national bankruptcy.  I think the statement of the Minister is very widely drawn, and not by any means consequent upon the proposition of Deputy Magennis.  I think it is desirable that the Corporation should be in a position, before the making of any loans of this kind to an individual in respect of land purchase, to bring pressure on the banks, to effect a composition, <Col N="2417" /> a basis of adjustment between the original borrower and the original lender, before they come to the aid of the banks in the manner suggested in the Bill.  I see clearly enough that the assumption behind the amendment, and behind what I am now saying, is the possibility that the Corporation will be interested primarily in relieving the banks, and it is because I believe that that is a possibility I think there should be some kind of moderate check which would bring pressure upon the existing banks to enter into accommodation with their present debtors.  I do not know whether the amendment, taken right through, will meet the case, but I think it will go some way towards it, and, at least, ensure that the Corporation has had a full account of the whole transaction and is satisfied as to the applicant's indebtedness to the bank.</P>

      <P>It is because I do not conceive this Corporation as an institution for relieving banks that I object to the amendment.  Incidentally, it may suit the banks to have a corporation of this sort that could afford to take long term credit by means of properly secured loans from them.  It would give them liquid assets at once.  On the other hand, the position of the Corporation would be quite sound, as it is financed to give long term credits.  You would have a transaction which would suit the banks on one side and which would be quite normal, so far as the Corporation is concerned, on the other side.  I do not conceive for a moment that one of the functions of the Corporation would be to act as a sort of relieving agent for the banks.  That is not, and should not be, its function. When it takes over a loan from the banks its first consideration is to see how it is secured.  It is not for the Corporation <Col N="2418" /> to see how the amount is arrived at, as that is a matter between the bank and the original creditor.  The Deputy's amendment is one thing and the Deputy's speech is another thing. In speaking to the amendment he referred to the general position of the country as a result of deflation since 1920, and pointed out that certain things should be done.</P>

      <P>I could quite understand, and to a certain extent appreciate, the position of Deputy Magennis in moving his amendment if I were sure that the assumption of liabilities of a very doubtful character would not take place, and that State funds would not be placed in jeopardy to meet doubtful debts.  The Deputy's speech was directed to another point of view, and that was, the deflation with its consequences since 1920.  Unfortunately, however, we must take things as we find them.  It is no use at this time of day trying to fix responsibility for those advances to purchase lands which were made in 1920, 1921, and even in earlier years.  We find a very difficult situation confronting us. and our object must be to aim at finding how best to relieve it.  The banks have the whip hand.  They cannot be forced, and we cannot coerce them, to effect a composition.  If we did that, the first result would be to restrict credit, not alone for the moment, but <Col N="2419" /> to make that kind of credit not available in future.  That is a serious responsibility which we would have to assume if we accepted this amendment. I do not think that that is desirable.</P>
      <P>Let us understand what the legal powers of the banks are.  They can refuse a composition.  They can sell out a defaulting creditor and turn him adrift in the world.  That is not a very desirable state of affairs, but I have no doubt that it is the actual position. They have complete machinery for executing decrees of the courts.  They can sell out any person who is a defaulting creditor, and they can also come down on his sureties.  I believe that while we must do justice to the banks, we must also be as sympathetic as possible with unfortunate people who bought land at inflated values.  I believe that we have got to stabilise loans by means of long term credit at a fixed rate of interest which would not be dependent on the fluctuation of the money market.  In my opinion something in the nature of the Board of Works' system would best meet the situation, namely, a fixed rate of interest for a number of years, plus a certain sum estimated by actuarial methods to determine at what period a loan would be extinguished.</P>
      <P>I do not see that under the amendment any lasting benefit would be conferred on unfortunate farmers who are in difficulties with the banks which are equipped with full machinery to sell out both themselves and their sureties. It is a hard thing at this stage to think that State money may be involved in liquidating the position, but it is the only reasonable solution.  One cannot, on the one hand, scrap all credit, and, on the other hand, allow a position to be created by which these men would be sold out.  If the banks do sell them out, I am afraid that there would be very few instances in which the capital advances would be realised.  A system of long term loan is the only solution of the problem, and I do not see why unreasonable difficulties should be placed in the way, as would undoubtedly be the case if this amendment were accepted.</P>

      <P>Section 3, sub-section (1).  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; deleted in line 50.</P>
      <P>Some of these amendments, when taken together, constitute the change in the Bill, respecting the liability of women for jury service, that has been made in the Seanad.  Deputies will remember that when the Bill left the Dáil the position in the matter was that, under Section 3, only male citizens were liable for jury service, but under another section, Section 16, any woman who wished to volunteer for jury service, and who was eligible as regards age and rateable qualifications, could so volunteer and, if she did, her name would be entered in the jury book.  The amendments that have been made in the Seanad do not radically alter that position, but, as the Bill stands now, instead of defining a juror as a male citizen with certain qualifications and allowing women to volunteer, we are now saying, in effect, that men and women, if they have the necessary qualifications, are equally liable to jury service.  That is the effect of amendment. No. 1.  We then proceed to add to the Schedule of Exemptions the word &ldquo;women.&rdquo;  Deputies will find that word in Part II. of the Schedule in amendment 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with regard to women <Col N="2422" /> and jury service now is that they are exempted in the part of the Schedule that contains classes that we are prepared to exempt, prima facie, leaving it open to any individuals within those classes, who desire to offer themselves for jury service and who consider that they could undertake that burden without undue hardship to themselves or others, to notify the appropriate official.  The Schedule has been changed. Formerly it was one single item.  It is now a schedule containing two parts. Part I. contains the names of persons or classes whom, for one reason or another, we would not be prepared to allow to act as jurors.  Part II. contains classes which, as classes, we are prepared to exempt, leaving it open to any individuals who feel they are available for jury service and could undertake that particular duty to apply.  The change that has been effected, therefore, is rather one of form than of substance. But from the point of view of form it is considered an improvement on the Bill.  It has been passed by the Seanad and it represents an offer that I made in the Seanad to meet certain objections voiced here.  I ask the Committee to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what is the principle at work in the exemption.  There are persons exempted but entitled to serve on application&mdash;that is to say, so far as the normal procedure is concerned.  A Peace Commissioner is exempted as well as &ldquo;persons actually engaged as professors, schoolmasters, or teachers in any university, college, school or academy unless paid out of public funds,&rdquo; members of the Institute of Civil Engineers engaged in the actual practice of their profession, and others. It seems to me that there has not been any clear principle at work in these exemptions.  I can understand the exemptions of a Peace Commissioner. He is exercising a judicial office and on that ground might be exempted. But having been exempted, to say that he may go on the register on application, seems to me to be quite anomalous, If it is possible for such a person to go on the register of jurors, on application, then he should not be exempted at all.  It must be because he is a judicial person of a minor kind that he is exempted.  But if that person remains a Peace Commissioner and seeks to go on the register of jurors he is to be allowed to go on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly, the test that we apply in the matter of exemption is not so much individual hardship as public interest.  But the question of individual hardship does come in in some cases.  For instance, one did advert to it a good deal when the question arose as to whether or not women should be exempt.  There you had a composite thing.  You had the public interest to some considerable extent, and also the question of personal inconvenience and hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to Peace Commissioners, there is no objection that I see to Peace Commissioners acting as jurors.  Consequently, we did not include them in Part I.  A Peace Commissioner who had been concerned in the early stages of a particular case might ask for exemption in connection with that case, and in connection with that case only. I am sure his application would be readily granted.  But Peace Commissioners do a great deal of entirely honorary work for the State, and it seems not unreasonable to dispense them as a class and leave it to individuals within the class who feel that they would undertake quite willingly the additional burden of jury service to make application.  Generally, my attitude towards the classes contained in Part II. is that we can afford to exempt them as classes, leaving to the individual within the classes to judge as to his or her own circumstances and decide whether or not he or she would wish to undertake the duty.  Clearly there is a public-interest case for exempting medical practitioners, but the circumstances of an individual doctor might be such that there would be no public risk, no serious public inconvenience even, in his absenting himself for a day, or two or three days, in connection with jury service.  It might be that he was on such terms with a fellow-practitioner in the district that it would be a very simple matter to arrange that he would take his calls and his duties during the period of his absence.  Similarly with veterinary surgeons, dentists and others.  There is <Col N="2426" /> a case for exempting them as classes, but the public-interest case is not so strong that you would say to those classes or persons: &ldquo;We are not prepared to allow you to serve on juries.&rdquo; So we have this new conception of breaking the Schedule into two parts and putting in the second part classes that prima facie are entitled to exemption, leaving it open to individuals, if they feel they do not want that exemption, to notify the appropriate official.</P>

      <P>When the Bill left the Dáil it provided that the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the judge concerned, might in certain cases, direct that jurors should be summoned by post instead of through the Gárda Síochána, which is the usual method.  A majority in the Seanad considered that if summonses were ever served by post they should be served by registered post.  Personally, I do not consider that the amendment is a very important improvement of the Bill, and I can conceive the registered post sometimes being, perhaps, less effective than the ordinary post, but I do not consider the matter is of sufficient importance to warrant our differing with the Seanad, and I think the amendment ought to be accepted.</P>

      <P>I do not think the amendment is of any value at all, because of the practice that we have in this country of dealing with registered letters, which we have inherited.  In some Continental countries, in France in particular, a registered letter is only delivered to the person to whom it is addressed, and the postman takes it away until he can find the person to whom it is addressed.  But in this country anybody can sign for a registered letter and it is quite as liable to be mislaid, not perhaps in the post, but in the house of the recipient, as any ordinary letter.  I do not think it is of <Col N="2429" /> any value, but I agree with the Minister that there is no particular harm in it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is not right for me to criticise another House, but I think some of these amendments were put in for the purpose of showing that the Seanad existed.  I do not think they were serious about them.  This will mean a national expense, and the work could be far more effectively carried out by the Gárda.  The fact of the Gárda coming to a house to serve a summons on a juror is impressive and it takes effect, whereas this sort of thing can be evaded in twenty different ways.  A registered letter can be signed for by any person, and the person to whom it is addressed can say he never got it.  How are fines on jurors to be made?</P>

      <P>The Deputy, I think, is making a mistake.  This is not in substitution of service by the Gárda. The Bill says in certain cases service may be by post instead of through the Gárda Síochána, and the amendment says that whenever there is recourse to the post for this purpose then it shall be by way of registered letter.  I thought it unnecessary, and perhaps even unwise, to lay down the condition that when the post was used for this purpose it must be registered post.  The Seanad thought otherwise, and, as I say, I did not consider the matter of sufficient importance to warrant making it an issue between the two Houses.  I suggest that the Dáil might accept the amendment, and I solemnly undertake, if it gives rise to any evil consequences, I will bring in an amending Bill.</P>

      <P>Amendments 10, 11 and 12 fall into a group, naturally. They are amendments of very little public interest.  They are of an administrative nature.  The effect is to transfer certain duties from one official to another.  It is merely a question of whether certain duties should be performed by the under-sheriff as long as there is an under-sheriff in any county or whether they should be performed by the County Registrar.  After some consultation with the officers themselves, we have adopted the principle that so long as an under-sheriff does exist he shall continue to perform his old duty. That principle was in fact adopted in the original text of the Bill and these three amendments are necessary only because in these three particular cases the principle was not effectively translated into legal language.  That is the sole purport of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Minister agree to an amendment of this Schedule and risk the Seanad's assent.  To delete these words &ldquo;unless paid out of public funds,&rdquo; which would ensure that teachers' names would not be liable to be inserted in the jury list. Some of the other categories are not less important to be kept at their work than teachers.  We know of many schools in the country that are one-teacher or two-teacher schools, and if you take the principal away for jury service there might be considerable dislocation of the work of the school.  That is a distinct reason for exemption.  I see on this list &ldquo;Corporate members of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland engaged in the active service of their profession.&rdquo;  I cannot see why that section should be exempted when we are not exempting, say, electrical engineers.  I take it within the next few years electrical engineers will be in more demand for public service in their own way than civil engineers.</P>

I think the reference &ldquo;unless paid out of public funds&rdquo; means the ordinary lay teachers in secondary schools and all teachers in primary schools will be entitled to be put on the register whether they wish or not.  It is apparent from the Minister's own statement that his desire would be that teachers should be exempted.  Therefore, to effect that desire it would be necessary to delete these words &ldquo;unless paid out of public funds.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will accept the deletion of these words, and the Bill can go back to the Seanad.  I think myself that the words &ldquo;unless paid out of public funds&rdquo; went in there on the basis that teachers paid out of public funds came in under Part I. of the Schedule.  It is possible that they did not; in fact, I think it is likely that they did not, because they would if you had in Part I. of the Schedule: &ldquo;Persons holding any public office, or paid out of public funds.&rdquo;  I do not think that under the wording, &ldquo;Persons holding any public office, and paid out of public funds,&rdquo; national teachers, for instance, are covered.

      <P>That was a thing that was pressed on me.  There are, perhaps, 200 persons in the country coming under that exemption.  I did not encourage the Seanad to pass that <Col N="2434" /> exemption.  But they did pass it, and I do not think it is worth fighting about.  About 200 persons are covered by the exemption, and by far the greater proportion of these are covered by the condition in Part I. of the Schedule: &ldquo;Persons holding any public office and paid out of public moneys, or holding office under a local authority and paid out of local rates.&rdquo;  I discouraged the addition of these exemptions, but they were passed in spite of my discouragement.

    <P>The Bill, as passed by the Dáil, provided that St. Patrick's Day should be treated as Sunday, which was the recommendation of the Liquor Commission. The majority of Senators favoured a complete closing on St. Patrick's Day, that is, that licensed premises should be closed everywhere, and that the so-called bona fide traffic should not be permitted.  In the Act of 1924 I had a provision to that effect, which the Dáil rejected.  The Seanad, subsequently, re-inserted it.  They made provision for a complete closing on St. Patrick's Day, that is, that no house would be technically and legally open, but they did not provide against the bona fide traffic, so that the position you have had since 1924 was that you had not the 2-5 opening in the four cities that is allowed on Sundays.  You had a general closing with the bona fide writ running, so to speak.  We have not had under statute, at any rate, therefore, the completely dry St. Patrick's Day which is aimed at by this amendment.  We have had something fairly near to it.  We have had complete closing, with the bona fide traffic running.  The case that was put up in the Seanad was the case that I put up in 1924 to the Dáil, that not very many years ago the efforts of young men and public opinion, generally, in a great many towns through the country, almost all the towns through the country, were directed to practically compelling licensed traders to keep strictly closed on St. Patrick's Day. At that time we had not the power to legislate that we have now, and I have very little doubt that if Dublin Castle and British administration were still prevailing here, and if we were relying on Westminster for our legislation, that you would still have a considerable volume of public opinion in the country crying out that traders should close on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>Well, the situation has changed.  If we feel that they should close on St. Patrick's Day, it is now in our power to legislate to that effect, and the irony of it is that no sooner had we the power to provide for that by legislation than <Col N="2437" /> public opinion seemed to fade away on the matter.  We heard a great deal about individual rights, the right to get drunk on St. Patrick's Day just as well as on any other day, and so on. One got a little cynical on the whole thing.  If it meant anything it meant a gesture.  It meant that the country wished to signify in that way that it was turning its back on intemperance, the intemperance which, deservedly or otherwise, was thrown at us as something of a national characteristic in the past.  It had a good deal to recommend it, that the country should, on each recurring St. Patrick's Day, so to speak, remind itself of the necessity for the virtue of temperance by ordaining the complete closing of the licensed houses.  But if it is something that has to be done by a narrow majority or at the expense of a tussle between the two Houses of the Oireachtas, then, personally, I see very little value in doing it, even if one could count on pulling it off by the process of counting heads and a small number of heads at that.  I do not really care very much whether the Dáil accepts or rejects this amendment.  I cannot assist the Dáil in the matter of forecasting what the attitude of the Seanad will be if this amendment is rejected.  The Seanad may conceivably hold very firm on the matter and hold up this Bill for nine months, or it may give way and decide not to press its desire for this provision in face of the fact that the less idealistic Assembly has rejected it.  But my personal position is that I recommended a provision of the kind to the Dáil in 1924, and I recommend this now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister for Justice might refer this matter back to the Seanad, and mention to them that in 1924 it was decided by the Dáil that St. Patrick's Day should be the same as Sunday.  We passed at that time the structural alteration amendment.  There was a suggestion at the time to hold up the Bill for 270 days on these two amendments.  Deputy Johnson, in his wisdom, suggested that a Committee of the Dáil should meet a Committee of the Seanad and decide what would be the best thing to do, so we swopped the St. Patrick's Day <Col N="2438" /> amendment for the structural alterations one.  The Minister for Justice did not think that the 1924 Bill was either satisfactory or final, and he set up a Commission which was going to be infallible&mdash;one that would bring forth a Bill that would satisfy all parties in the country.  That being so, full powers were vested in the Commission, which recommended that St. Patrick's Day should be the same as Sunday.  We adopted that recommendation here.  I respect the admiration which the Seanad has for St. Patrick's Day, but a great many of the Senators, I should say the big majority of them, are not in the same position as members of the Dáil.  They do not know the habits and customs of the Irish people as well as Deputies do.  The majority of them, I think, are not either hurlers or footballers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad and all of us have a great respect for Good Friday.  I think there is a great difference between Good Friday and St. Patrick's Day. One, to my mind, is a day of sorrow, but St. Patrick's Day should be observed, I think, as a day of joy in this country.  We are not going to have real joy, I think, if we cannot have football matches on that day, and if all our footballers are to spend the day on their knees.  Some of them, perhaps, may go twenty miles away to play matches, as Deputy Gorey and myself used to do.  We are, I say, more in touch perhaps with what would be occurring on St. Patrick's Day than the Seanad.  Of course, we all respect the members of the Seanad.  They are all good men, and we respect the desire they have to keep St. Patrick's Day holy, but we do not like to go the whole hog with them and keep it too holy. After all, I think, the Minister for Justice should go back to the Seanad, and point out to them that we are of opinion that there is a difference between St. Patrick's Day and Good Friday, and that if they would allow the Bill to go through without holding it up for 270 days, it might help to cure a lot of the evils in the Act of 1924. We were told at the time that that Act was the best that could be done for the publicans and the country, but it created a lot of evils that this Bill&mdash;<Col N="2439" /> I do not think it is altogether too bad&mdash; may cure.</P>

      <P>The Act of 1924 caused a lot of wounds that festered, and perhaps this Bill is going to cure them.  I would not like to see this Bill placed in any danger, but perhaps the Minister would take a message from this House to the Seanad to the effect that we are of opinion that St. Patrick's Day should not be observed in the same manner as Good Friday, and that the young people of the country to-day do not come home as Deputy Gorey and myself used to, with our friends long ago.  The Minister might tell the Seanad that there is a wave of temperance spreading amongst the young people of the country to-day, and that what they are going in for now are healthy exercises such as hurling and football.</P>
      <P>Then there are celebrations.  There are celebrations all over the world on St. Patrick's Day.  At night time dances are held and other social functions are carried out.  In every country in the world our patron saint is going to be honoured except in Ireland where he died and where he sanctified us all, or at least tried to do so.  In addition, there are fairs and markets held in some parts of the country on St. Patrick's Day.  I do not know if the Seanad desire they should be put a stop to.  There would be holy war then.  When there are fairs and markets held in the country the majority of farmers will tell you that they cannot make a bargain until they have a drink over it.  I know a leading farmer in the country and his greatest fad is to do away with luck-pennies. That is when he is selling.  If he was buying he might not like to do away with the luck-pennies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister for Justice is proud of this Bill and we will take it because it cures the other bad one that he gave us.  Perhaps the Minister will tell the Seanad that on St. Patrick's Day the people could not be so mournful as they would be on a Good Friday.  I am sure that might meet <Col N="2440" /> the situation.  If the Minister saw the Seanad were out against us he could say &ldquo;Thy will be done,&rdquo; and that would not endanger the Bill.  I think the Bill is in safe hands if we leave it to the Minister.  I am satisfied with it and I think the Minister should try to convert the Senators the same as St. Patrick tried to convert others.</P>

      <P>Deputy Daly is afraid that he may lose the Bill.  Of course, it is a very great risk.  If this amendment is not accepted and it goes back to the Seanad, the probability is that Deputy Daly will not have the protection that the Bill gives him, that is, for nine months; he will have to go along suffering the pains and penalties of the existing law for another nine months.  I am sure Deputy Daly and those who think with him in this matter will regret that very much indeed. The Deputy suggested the Minister is proud of his Bill.  I do not think he is so proud of the Bill as he would have been had it been passed in the way in which it was introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the House will agree with the Seanad in this amendment.  On this matter, for some good cause, or perhaps the absence of cause to the contrary, I am not quite so cynical as the Minister finds himself. I think that it would still be a very good thing to notify all whom it may concern throughout the world that at any rate Ireland is deciding that St. Patrick's Day habits shall be changed and that not only on Good Friday and Christmas Day will Ireland be dry, but that even on the day dedicated to the patron saint of the <Col N="2441" /> country we deliberately choose to celebrate it as a temperance day, or, if you like, a total abstinence day&mdash;one day of the year dedicated to the idea of total abstinence, and that day St. Patrick's Day.  I think that would be a very fine gesture, to use the word of the Minister, and I think we would be doing something really valuable to the cause of temperance if we reaffirm the decision come to some time ago, that St. Patrick's Day was to be a dry day. After all, there are three hundred and sixty-three other days in the year on which intoxicating liquor may be taken ad lib.  There seems to be no objection to Christmas Day and Good Friday being dry.  St. Patrick's Day, in my opinion, might well be deliberately chosen by the people as a day when it can be shown that they can rejoice, have the joy of open-air games and all the rest of it, and still remain without intoxicating liquor.  I do not believe that the joy of open-air games that Deputy Daly speaks of depends upon the exhilaration due to intoxicants.  I have not the slightest doubt that the people of the country can celebrate St. Patrick's Day in the most beneficial way conceivable and yet remain without intoxicating liquor on that day. On three days in the year the people will be required by law to refrain from the purchase of intoxicating liquor.  I do not think that is a tremendous handicap upon a nation.  On the contrary, I think it is a very great help, and it is desirable that we should maintain the position taken up in years of moral enthusiasm and not have it to be said that with freedom to determine our own course we have decided to turn our backs on the moral enthusiasms of the years of agitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter and that is that St. Patrick's Day is a day on which the assistants have, by concurring in the public agitation, demanded that there shall be a closing in the city of Dublin and other areas, too.  I think that ought to be taken into account.  The larger houses that employ assistants will remain closed and if this amendment is not allowed to pass it will mean that the smaller houses where there are no assistants employed will be open.  The consequences, <Col N="2442" /> of course, will be a good deal more friction and irritation than are necessary.  That is a comparatively small matter as compared with the larger one, but it has to be taken into account.  The men engaged in the business in cities have demanded a complete closing on St. Patrick's Day and have exercised their influence in that direction for some years back.  I hope the House will agree with this amendment and not put Deputy Daly to the inconvenience of having to explain to his friends that he has, by his action, left the law in its present state round the necks of the licensed vintners of the country.</P>

      <P>Very well, I will not draw it.  Deputy Daly thinks a great slight has been offered St. Patrick by the suggestion that the day should be a dry one.  It is held, on the other hand, that a slight would be offered St. Patrick by having the day wet.  It is a question of who is right.  The spectacle so noticeable on St. Patrick's Day in years gone by has, in modern times, become less objectionable.  In those days it is not half so objectionable. There was a time when the practices on St. Patrick's Day were exceedingly objectionable.  I think we might go the other step, as Deputy Johnson suggests, and make it a day of national&mdash;I forget the word he used.</P>

Reference has been made to football matches and other games on St. Patrick's Day.  Very seldom are these games played on holidays, or even on St. Patrick's Day.  Sundays are the only recognised days for that sort of thing.  The practice of having fairs and markets on St. Patrick's Day has also disappeared.  I know of no place at the moment where a market or fair is held on St. Patrick's Day.  I am open to correction, of course.  I think the Dáil ought to agree with the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather tempted to intervene in the debate by a remark of the Minister for Justice.  He made a reference to the irony of the situation &mdash;that the Irish people, when they got <Col N="2444" /> control of their own destinies, had reversed their attitude towards the observance of St. Patrick's Day, as distinct from the period when we were under Dublin Castle rule.  But does the Minister not realise that at this stage there is a bit of irony in the celebration of St. Patrick's Day at all? Let me ask the Minister and Deputies generally to cast their minds back to less than one and a half years ago.  At that time we hailed as a victory a certain agreement which constrained us to cede St. Patrick's gave to another State, to people who, without pushing the issue very far, really do not care a tinker's dam about St. Patrick.  Of course, there is a reason for everything, and by taking this action about St. Patrick's Day it may be that we are expressing atonement; it may be a symbol.  I am not in a position to judge.  But I do say that this puritanical observance of St. Patrick's Day will really serve no useful purpose.</P>
      <P>None of us wants drunkenness; we do not want the horrid spectacle of intoxicated persons on the streets.  But I do think that we are trying to fall in with with the views of a group who are clamorous, not alone for making St. Patrick's Day try, but every other day in the year dry as well, and who, even if they did reach that stage, would still remain unsatisfied, would not be content with the closing of the public houses alone, but would actually require that their sites be ploughted up. Personally, I am indifferent as to whether St. Patrick's day is dry or wet, but it seems to me that too much attention is paid to the clamour of these people.  If we are leaning on the side of absolute prohibition we are taking a step which may have the same fatal consequences here as it had in America.  We all want a decent and well-regulated drink trade; but I am not altogether disposed to give those people their innings on a dry St. Patrick's Day.  I have an objection in my bones to meeting them.  While I would not challenge a division on this question, if Deputy Daly challenges one to revert to the position of the Bill when it left this House I will certainly vote for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 11.  A new sub-section added at the end of the section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  A person who is at the one time the holder of an early-closing licence and the holder of an on-licence which is neither a six-day licence nor an early-closing licence (in this sub-section called an ordinary seven-day licence) shall, if the premises to which the said licences are respectively attached are situate in the same licensing area, be entitled to have the ordinary seven-day licence transferred at the annual licensing District Court to the premises to which the early-closing licence is attached, but subject to the condition that on such transfer being made the early-closing licence shall not be renewed and that the premises to which the ordinary seven-day licence was attached before such transfer shall for the purposes of the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, be deemed never to have been licensed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill left the Dáil it had a section enabling the owner of a six-day licensed premises to obtain a full licence on the condition that he extinguished a seven-day licence in the same licensing area.  I do not know whether it will be very fruitful, but it is in the Bill.  This amendment was inserted in the Seanad to enable the owners of premises with an early closing licence to obtain a full licence in a similar way. I recommend its acceptance, for this reason, that to whatever extent either <Col N="2446" /> of these two provisions is availed of they assist towards what is, after all, the main object of the Bill, the elimination of redundant licences in the country.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 13.  A new sub-section added at the end of the section, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Nothing in this Act shall operate to prohibit the holder of an on-licence in respect of premises situate in a county borough which are for the time being a hotel or restaurant permitting intoxicating liquor to be consumed on such premises on any week day between the hours of half-past two o'clock and half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, provided such intoxicating liquor is</P>
      <P>(a)  supplied to such person before the hour of half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, and</P>
      <P>(b)  is consumed at the same time as and with a substantial meal begun before the said hour of half-past two o'clock, and</P>
      <P>(c)  is supplied and consumed in the portion of such premises usually set apart for the supply of meals.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has to do with the question of the break in the day in the county boroughs.  Hotels and restaurants are enable to remain open to supply meals during the split hour in the afternoon in the county boroughs.  They are not, however, entitled to supply intoxicating liquor during that hour.  As the Bill stood, intoxicating liquor could not be consumed with meals between 2.30 and 3.30, and if Deputies reflect for a moment on that they will realise that it would be vexatious to insist that people who had ordered a substantial meal with a drink before 2.30 should not be allowed to consume the drink after that hour.  The alternative to the amendment would be that waiters in restaurants and hotels would be obliged to go along on the stroke of 2.30 and clear off the table all intoxicating <Col N="2447" /> liquor that might have been ordered before 2.30.  I think this is a very desirable amendment.</P>

    <P>Under the Act of 1902 a new licence might be granted for premises which had been licensed on the date of the passing of the Act.  The general purpose of the Act of 1902 was to say that no new licence might be granted as from that date.  The exception to that <Col N="2448" /> is that a new licence might be granted in respect of premises that were licensed prior to that date.  In the absence of a provision to the contrary, when a licence is forfeited on three recorded convictions there would be nothing to prevent the Circuit Court from granting a new licence in respect of the same premises, assuming the premises to have been licensed prior to 1902.  That would defeat the intention of the enactments relating to forfeiture, and the amendment remedies what was a latent defect in the Bill.</P>

      <P>A new section inserted before section 58 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>58.&mdash;(1)  If any excisable liquor is supplied for consumption on the premises of a club registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904 or is consumed on the premises of any such club by any person in contravention of the rules of such club relating to the supplying and consumption of excisable liquor on the premises of such club, such club shall be guilty of an offence under this section, and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof, in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, or, in the case of a second or any subsequent <Col N="2450" /> offence, to a fine not exceeding forty pounds.</P>
    <P>(2)  Proceedings under this section may be brought against a club in the name under which it is registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904, and any summons or other document required to be served on a club for the purpose or in the course of such proceedings may be served on the secretary of the club and any warrant for the recovery of the amount of a fine imposed on a club under this section may be executed against the goods and chattels of the club.</P>
    <P>This deals with clubs.  The position with regard to clubs under the law as it now exists is that there is no other or lesser form of penalty for breaches in a club than the revocation of the registration.  The law provided for no penalty on the club or on its committee or officers in respect of breaches.  Revocation of the registration is, of course, the ultimate resort, but if a magistrate decided that the abuse was not sufficiently grave to warrant that, there would be the other penalty open to the court to impose.  The amendment provides for an intermediate penalty between revocation of the certificate and allowing the club to go scot-free.  The new section renders the club funds liable to a fine of £20 for the first offence, and £40 for the second or any subsequent offence.  The provisions in regard to the Registration of Clubs Act, 1904, regarding the revocation, still holds good, and can be used in appropriate cases, but in addition to that we provide for a fine of the club funds in respect of any breaches on which there may be a conviction.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>28.  A new section inserted before Section 61 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>61.&mdash;(1)  The holder of an on-licence (in this section referred to as the on-licence) in respect of premises situate in a county borough may apply at the annual licensing District Court next after the passing of this Act that in lieu of a certificate for the renewal of the on-licence there be granted to him in respect of the said premises a certificate for a new spirit retailer's off-licence or a certificate for a new beer retailer's off-licence or certificates for both such new licences.</P>
      <P>(2)  When an application under the foregoing sub-section is made the Justice of the District Court, if he is satisfied that a certificate for the renewal of the on-licence might have been granted and that the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption on the premises is not the principal business carried on in the premises to which the on-licence is attached, may, if he so thinks fit, grant to such applicant the certificate or certificates so applied for by him.</P>
      <P>(3)  When an application under sub-section (1) of this section is granted, a new licence or new licences shall notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other Act be granted to the applicant in accordance with the certificate or certificates granted to him in pursuance of such application.</P>
      <P>(4)  When a new licence or licences is or are granted under the foregoing sub-section no new on-licence shall at any time thereafter be granted in respect of the premises to which such new licence or licences is or are attached.</P>
      <P>(5)  When an application under sub-section (1) of this section is refused such application shall be treated as an application for a certificate for the renewal of the on-licence and dealt with accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6)  In this section the expressions <Col N="2452" />&ldquo;spirit retailer's off-licence&rdquo; and &ldquo;beer retailer's off-licence&rdquo; have the same meanings as such expressions respectively have in the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment that I do not anticipate will be widely availed of. It is limited in its application to county boroughs, and the time within which the decision must be made is also limited.  It provides that at the first licensing session after the passing of this Bill the holder of a licence for consumption on the premises in any of the county boroughs may apply to the Court for an off-licence, and the court may grant such off-licence, if it is satisfied that the main business which is carried on is not the sale of liquor for consumption on the premises. The position is that it is just possible that some holders of licences for consumption on the premises who do a very limited business in that way might, having regard to the provision which is now made for a split in the day in county boroughs, prefer to apply to the court for an off-licence, off-licensed holders not being compelled to close between 2.30 and 3.30. It is considered reasonable to give them one opportunity of making up their minds on that matter, and at the first licensing session after the passing of this Bill any holders of on-licences in county boroughs who wish to apply to have their licences converted into off-licences can do so and in certain conditions the court may grant that application.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment of importance The addition of these words is also made in another sub-section by amendment 6.  The aim of the amendments is that a patent should not be granted if such invention were described in any British specification made up to the passing of the Act and published before the date of the application for the patent.  The amendments are to put the matter more in accordance with sub-section (3) of Section 19.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The following amendments were agreed to:&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is to give a longer period of time for the contingency that is looked to in the sub-section.  The applicant might not know until after the grant of the existence of the patent which he desires to have revoked, and it is necessary to enlarge the time.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>This is also an enlargement of time. Seven days was put down, and it was suggested that three weeks should be allowed as the proper time for the completion of the acceptance of the specification. On the part of the Controller-designate of the Patents Office, it is recommended that this should be accepted, as the time was too short.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment 9 has to be taken with amendment 14.  This is to meet the point that patent agents' clerks should be employed as well as patent agents, and the effect of the two amendments is to allow searches by patent agents' clerks as well as by the patent agents themselves.  It has been pointed out that a search by a patent agent might cost three times as much as one by his <Col N="2455" /> clerk.  Amendment 14 allows the establishment of a register of approved clerks.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>This is a desirable amendment owing to a change which has taken place. Records which had previously been in the National Library of Ireland have been and are in course of being transferred to the library in the Office.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 11:&mdash;Section 29, sub-section (1).  All from the word &ldquo;accordingly&rdquo; in line 51 deleted down to and including the word &ldquo;subject&rdquo; in line 58, and the following words substituted therefor: &ldquo;shall have immediately on the commencement of this Part of this Act the same force and effect in Saorstát Eireann as such patent had in Great Britain immediately before such commencement and shall thenceforth have and be subject.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 11.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is one of those technical matters that is at the same time of considerable importance to the Bill. It is to make it clear that if British patents are extended to this country, as it is proposed they shall be, they will be extended subject to any modification&mdash;for instance, judgments of British courts, where the judgments have been made prior to the date of the Act&mdash;but, of course, after extension they will be subject to our courts. It has this meaning&mdash;that if a patent is being brought to trial in England that is going to be extended here, and has some change or limitation imposed upon it, that we will take over the patent subject to the limitation.</P>

    <P>Amendment 13:&mdash;Section 29.  At the end of the section a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(7)  The holder of a patent which by virtue of this section is deemed to be a patent granted under this Act shall not be entitled to apply for or be granted under this Act any other patent for the invention for which such first-mentioned patent was granted.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It was pointed out that in the absence of this amendment there might exist two patents for the same invention&mdash;a British patent which by virtue of another section was extended to the Free State, and a new patent with enlarged time taken out in the Free State under the Act.  This is to prevent the possibility of that happening.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The following amendments were agreed to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>14.  Section 62.  Before sub-section (2) a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  If and when the Minister so directs there shall be kept at the Office a book called the register of clerks in which shall be entered the names of approved clerks of registered patent agents.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>15.  Section 63.  Before sub-section (4) a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  If a register of clerks is established under this Act the Minister may by order make rules for the management of such register and may by such rules prescribe the qualifications and conditions for eligibility for and the fees to be paid on registration in such register.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>Amendment 17:&mdash;Section 66, sub-section (2).

      <P>When the Bill was before the Dáil an earlier clause had this same preamble as sub-section (2) of Section 66, &ldquo;that for the purposes of the duration and extension&rdquo;&mdash;in other words for a limited number of purposes.  That was changed in the Dáil, &ldquo;for all purposes,&rdquo; and, consequential upon that, it is necessary to extend also the application of this section for all purposes instead of for the limited purposes set out.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 18:&mdash;Section 89, sub-section (1).  After the words &ldquo;Act&rdquo; in line 49 the words &ldquo;(including a mark registered under Section 62 of the Trade Marks Act, 1905)&rdquo; inserted in brackets.</P>
      <P>Amendment 19:&mdash;Section 123.  A new sub-section added at the end of the section, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The proprietor of a mark registered under this section or of a mark originally registered in the Patent Office in London under Section 62 of the Trade Marks Act, 1905 and subsequently registered under Section 89 (which relates to the registration of trade marks registered in the Patent Office in London) of this Act in the register of trade marks in the Office, may assign such mark to the Minister and the Minister may take an assignment thereof, and on such assignment being made Section 121 (which relates to the registration of trade marks by Ministers) of this Act shall apply to such mark as fully as if the Minister had procured the registration <Col N="2458" /> thereof under the said Section 121.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>These amendments go together.  They have reference to what is known as the Irish Trade Mark.  The first one is in order that the Irish Trade Mark, registered in London as it is at present, might be extended to the Free State. The second one gives the Minister power to take over, if he is advised that it is a desirable course, the Irish Trade Mark.  It is not made compulsory.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 20:&mdash;Section 126.  All from and including the figures &ldquo;17&rdquo; in line 38 deleted down to and including the word &ldquo;specifications&rdquo; in line 39, and the following figures and words substituted therefor: &ldquo;19 (which relates to documents to accompany specifications) or Section 20 (which relates to investigation of specifications published previous to application)&rdquo;&mdash;agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 21:&mdash;Section 152, sub-section (4).  After the word &ldquo;state&rdquo; in line 25 the words &ldquo;or the commencement of Part II. of this Act as the case may require)&rdquo; inserted.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Of course we have definitions of &ldquo;self-governing British Dominions,&rdquo; and we have definitions of &ldquo;British dominions.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, this was a matter on which we asked advice from the Colonial Office, and were informed by them that the addition of &ldquo;protectorate or territory&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;dominion&rdquo; covered all the places which we intended to cover, and we distinctly did intend to cover India.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the matter is clear in this way: That if India does not come under this clause then India has to be dealt with as a foreign country.  It only means that instead of having the extension, at one stroke so to speak, of this reciprocal arrangement under this Act to a group, it will have to be extended to places individually, and India might have to be regarded for the purposes of this Act as a foreign country.  But the application can be made one way or another.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 24:&mdash;Section 154. sub-section (1).  The words &ldquo;or a part of the British dominions to which the benefit of this Part of this Act extends&rdquo; deleted in lines 36-38.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 24.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment falls into a large group of amendments&mdash;24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 33, 34, 36 to 45 inclusive, 51 to 64 and 65&mdash;which all have reference to the same point.  The point occurs best upon amendment 51, which deals with Section 175.  If attention is paid to the form of Part 6 of this Bill it will be discovered that a distinction has been made between the application of Part 6 of the Bill to Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and the British dominions and protectorates, etc., and thereafter foreign countries were clearly mentioned as a group apart from Great Britain, Northern Ireland, etc.  As long as we were members of the British Commonwealth Union, we could immediately, by an agreement made with Great Britain, have got the advantages of the English Copyright Act, of 1911, and have applied by the application of that Act, mutual arrangements with all the groups within the Commonwealth Union.  Two amendments which have been passed with regard to translations into Irish, and an amendment regarding compilation for educational purposes, have made it imperative that we should leave the Commonwealth Union. Having left the Commonwealth Union &mdash;and it is considered desirable for the purposes of these amendments that we should leave that Union&mdash;it is necessary to re-adjust the whole of Part 6, so as to make the application merely to Saorstát Eireann, and thereafter to all those other places as if they were foreign countries.  So that the net result of these amendments comes to this: That they delete Section 175, which refers to the extension of this part of the Act to Great Britain, Northern Ireland and other places automatically, and throw everything forward to the procedure under Section 176&mdash;that is to say, that by an Order made on the advice of the Executive Council the Governor-General may direct that this part shall apply, and then foreign countries for the purposes of Part 6 must be taken to include Great Britain, Northern Ireland and all the places mentioned.  All the amendments I <Col N="2461" /> have spoken of are simply clearing out from the section with regard to automatic extension Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the dominions, and putting them into Section 176.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:</P>
      <P>Section 154, sub-section (1).  The following words added at the end of the sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that the Governor-General may by Order made on the advice of the Executive Council direct that copyright subsisting in Saorstát Eireann under the provisions of this sub-section, in works the authors of which were at the date of the making of the work citizens of a country named in the Order with which no convention relating <Col N="2462" /> to copyright and binding on Saorstát Eireann exists and in respect of which no Order has been made under the provisions of Section 176 (which relates to power to extend the benefit of this Part of this Act to foreign works) of this Act, shall be subject to such conditions or formalities (if any) as may be prescribed by the Order and to such modifications as regards the ownership of the copyright or otherwise as may appear necessary owing to the law of that country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is to meet a point raised by authors in this country with regard to the treatment of their copyright works in the United States.  A provision is inserted by which arrangements can be made that when the Governor-General directs an extension of the copyright section to, say, the United States, it should be subject to such modifications and restrictions as seem desirable.  It was discovered that there was a loophole, and that non-convention countries like the United States would get copyright in the Free State by having first, or simultaneous, publication here and, consequently, would be exempt from the formalities put upon them under the terms of the order.  It would not be right to give copyright here unless certain arrangements for copyright matter, in America, were obtained.  The order imposing limitations might be avoided by first or simultaneous publication here.  The amendment enables formalities to be imposed, even in the case of first or simultaneous publication here.  It enables a bargain to be struck with a country like the United States for fair treatment as regards copyright of Irish authors.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 154, sub-section (2). After the word &lsquo;work&rsquo; in line 56 the following words inserted: &ldquo;Provided that such right shall as regards translations into the Irish language cease to exist unless the <Col N="2463" /> author of the work or his legal representative shall have within a period of ten years from the date of the first publication of the work published or caused to be published in Saorstát Eireann a translation of the work into the Irish language.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the amendment really by which we are abandoning the Commonwealth Union.  It speaks for itself. It means an adherence to the Berne Convention with the reservation that, if an author has not availed of the right to make translation within ten years from the date of the first publication of his work, translation can be made into Irish, without a breach of copyright.</P>

    <P>Section 174. At the end of the section a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  Section 4 (which relates to repeals) of this Act shall, in so far as it relates to the repeal of the Copyright Act, 1911, be deemed to have had force and effect as from the 6th day of December, 1921, and this Part of this Act shall be deemed to have had force and effect as from that date: Provided that&mdash;</P>

    <P>(ii)  The provisions of Section 172 (which relates to the application of this Part of this Act to registered designs) of this Act shall not have force and effect until the commencement of this Part of this Act.</P>
    <P>These amendments are rather declaratory. Certain doubt has been raised as to whether the Copyright Act of 1911 has not applied to the Free State in the same way as it did apply to the United Kingdom.  It is made clear that it will apply to books published before the 6th December, 1921, and will apply to all books published since.  It is fairly clear that is the application, but these amendments are merely declaratory, making the position quite clear.  There might be uncertainty in law, as regards books published before the Treaty, if these two amendments were not accepted.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  A new edition is counted as a new publication.  I would not say that that is expressly defined here.  The matter is defined in the Berne Convention. It has always been definitely recognised that a new edition counts as a new publication.  At any rate, if the flaw is there, and I do not think it is, it has always been there.  I know that complaint has been raised to that very point, that under the section publishers have imposed on them the obligation of not merely giving the first edition of a book but every subsequent edition.</P>
