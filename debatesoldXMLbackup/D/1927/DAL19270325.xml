      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the statement made by him on the 21st April, 1926, in the Dáil to the effect that if the experiment of tobacco-growing could be wound up the Executive Council would be prepared to consider any losses that may have been incurred by growers or others, he will receive a deputation from the Meath Tobacco Growers' Association to discuss with him the question of compensation on the winding-up of the experiment of tobacco-growing.</P>

      <P>I have been in consultation with the Minister for Lands and Agriculture in this matter, and it is clear that as the scheme of experiments in tobacco-growing was arranged in 1914 between the Government and the re-handlers alone, and no agreement was concluded by the Government with individual growers, no claim for losses alleged to have been incurred by the latter can be admitted.</P>
      <P>A claim by the experimenter who re-handled the Meath tobacco grown under the experiment is at present under consideration in fulfilment of the promise given by me in April last. In the circumstances, I cannot see that there would be any advantage in my receiving the deputation from the Meath Tobacco Growers' Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable it has been thought necessary to insert a sub-section <Col N="345" /> like this.  When this particular matter was first brought into legislation in this country the Farmers' Party, as it was temporary legislation, agreed to it, but subsequently, when it was being made permanent, the Farmers' Party objected to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to rebut the statement made by Deputy O'Connell. It is regrettable that it has been found necessary to include it in the Bill.  I believe it is necessary if we are to collect the rents.  There may be hardship because an innocent third party may be put to loss.  While we believe the grazier's cattle ought to be seized if the rent is not paid, we find it very difficult to agree that an innocent third party's cattle or property should be taken by the sheriff.  I do not know whether the draughtsman would be capable of drafting a section to cover that particular aspect.  It is the Minister's duty to formulate laws that will ensure the collection of the rent.  We believe that the rent must be paid, and as this sub-section is already in force in connection with rates I cannot see any very serious objection to it here, although I believe that it is regrettable it should be in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal to be said for giving the Land Commission extraordinary powers to deal with this question of the non-payment of annuities.  There is no doubt that there are large numbers of farmers who are deliberately evading their responsibilities in that respect.  So far as my constituency is concerned.  I suppose ninety per cent. of the defaulting annuitants are farmers who could be classed as large farmers; some of them could be classed as very large farmers. It is true, as the Minister very often stated, that nearly all of the smaller farmers, the ordinary tillage farmers, pay their annuities.  It is unfair that they should be called upon to pay for large farmers who, for one reason or another, will not pay their annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am prepared to agree it should not be sufficient for a man to say he is not able to pay his annuities and <Col N="346" /> be let off with that, there may be a certain number&mdash;but I believe the number is not at all as large as it is represented to be&mdash;who are not in a position to pay. At the same time, anybody who knows anything of the existing conditions must be aware that by far the greater number of those who are not paying could pay if they had the desire to do so.  I do not think that in order to make them pay we have any right to put into this Bill a sub-section which possibly will bring hardship upon certain innocent people.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening the Minister for Justice gave us the other side of the case, touching on the uncle, the brother, the brother-in-law, and so on. I admit there is a great deal in what he said, and to a large extent it is true. But there is also another side.  There are men who take grazing, who put their cattle on land and who do not go to the trouble, because they do not think it necessary and because it has never been done in the country, to ask the man from whom they take the grazing, before they conclude their arrangements with him, whether or not he has paid his annuity.  It would be very unfair to take the stock belonging to such persons, particularly when we take into consideration that many of those who take grazing from farmers are poor, thrifty men who may not be farmers themselves and are very often working men who by their thrift are enabled to buy a few head of cattle. They have no land of their own and they are obliged to take grazing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice made one statement yesterday which led me to believe he had not read the Bill very carefully.  He said all the man had to do was to set his land and he need never pay his annuities.  If the Minister read the Bill carefully he would know the Land Commission have ample powers to deal with a man of that sort.  They can sell his farm if they so desire.  I am objecting to the principle that you should give unlimited powers to the sheriff, and no matter what damage he may do or what hardship he may cause on an innocent third party, he should be let go scot-free. It is putting him in the position that he need not take any trouble whatever <Col N="347" /> to find out whether the property he is taking belongs to the person who owns the land.  I believe that people who have been placed on the land should be made pay their annuities, and other people should not be called upon to pay for them by way of rates.</P>
    <P>I am not going to be carried away by the statement that there are very large numbers of farmers who are so badly off that they cannot make any effort to pay their annuities.  A good deal has been said about the Land Commission to the effect that they are not giving any opportunities to people to pay their annuities.  In the few cases with which I had to deal&mdash;real cases of hardship, and they were few in number&mdash;I must say, in fairness to the Land Commission, that they gave these people time in which to pay.  I am sorry to say that in some cases small or large farmers who gave certain undertakings to the Land Commission if they got time, did not live up to those undertakings.  We ought to make up our minds that one of the first charges on land should be the payment of annuities to the Land Commission. Small hard-working farmers who make it a point of honouring their debts should not be called upon to pay in rates the annuities due by large farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with this amendment moved by Deputy Connor Hogan.  I agree that very large numbers of farmers who can afford to pay are at present avoiding the payment of their land annuities, but I would like to point out that there is a certain class of farmer who is not in a position to meet his land annuities primarily because of the bad seasons we have gone through since 1924.  It is all very well for Deputies to say that large numbers of farmers can afford to pay if they desire to do so, and particularly large farmers.  I have no sympathy with the large farmer who has a valuation of £80 or £90 and who will not pay his annuities.  I have sympathy with the small farmer who may have ten or twelve acres of land.  According to the Minister's statement, those small farmers are not neglecting their duty so <Col N="348" /> far as paying land annuities is concerned.</P>
      <P>In Westmeath and Longford large numbers of small farmers are not in a position to meet the demands of the Land Commission.  By giving those powers to the sheriff you will be causing real hardship because you will be allowing the sheriff to seize all property belonging to those small farmers; for that matter, it might be the property of their sons, daughters, uncles or aunts.  I would like the Minister to take particular stock of the three estates in Westmeath dealt with by the Land Bank in 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>All those tenants are at present in the black books so far as paying their annuities is concerned. It is not the fault of the tenants. When it was a case of borrowing there was £10,000 paid.  These lands are at present a complete plain.  The land has not been distributed amongst the tenants.  Each tenant has not been registered as the owner of his own portion. The result is that the land is useless to them.  Assuming the Land Commission will register each of these men as owner of his own portion, the men are prepared to pay the amount of annuities they owe to the Land Commission.  I could understand this measure if it was brought forward by an enemy Government of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Sure it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>If an enemy Government, or the Government that evacuated the country, brought forward this measure I would say it was in the real interests of the ranchers, the big landowners.  When one realises that a Government of the people's own comes forward with a measure like this giving such powers to a sheriff, one must certainly confess that that Government is more drastic than ever the foreign Government was when it was governing this country.  Such measures as this were introduced by the landlords in 1847 when all the tenant farmers were evicted and their homes battered down.  But when you come to 1927 you find the people have <Col N="349" /> changed completely.  From the Irish-Ireland point of view in 1922 the people of Ireland elected their own Government.  Now, we find that Government is adopting the very same attitude as landlords adopted in 1847. If this measure is allowed to go through the majority of the small farmers who are not in a position to meet demands owing to the high prices that the Land Commission have placed on the land, and also owing to the high taxation primarily due to the extravagance of the Government, will have to leave their homes and probably seek shelter in some foreign land.</P>
      <P>This is giving the sheriffs the same power as rate collectors.  I know that a very large number of county councils, including that of which I am a member, namely, the Westmeath County Council, have published a list of names of people who are defaulters, and since then a certain amount of money has been got in.  In Westmeath, in 1924, the amount of land annuities outstanding was £13,000, whereas to-day it is between £5,000 and £6,000.  In cases where the county councils adopted such action it would not be necessary for the Government to apply a measure of this kind.  I think the Minister is asking for something which he certainly will get from the small farmers.  He will certainly get his answer from these people.  When the lands are valued, with a view to reducing annuities, and when he succeeds in reducing his portion of the estimate for the purpose of reducing taxation generally, it would be time enough to introduce such a measure as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will vote in favour of the amendment simply in the interests of the Land Bank tenants and tenants on trustee lands, and also in the interests of the small farmer, who is not in a position to meet his debts.  The least we could expect of a Government, which was selected primarily by the small farmers and their sons and daughters, would be that such a Government would say: &ldquo;As you were advised during the Anglo-Irish war not to pay rent because the landlords were part and parcel of England, we are now prepared, as your own Government, to give you a privilege by which we will wipe out all <Col N="350" /> arrears.&rdquo;  I would not take it as a great compliment if the arrears of small farmers, say, under £20 valuation, were wiped out.  Although some Deputies advised the people from 1916 to 1921 not to pay their annuities to landlords who did not reside in the country, they are coming forward now and saying that the sheriff should be given sufficient power to put people who do not pay into the workhouse.</P>
    <P>That is not consistent.  The least we could expect from the Minister, who knows so much about the needs of the agricultural population, would be that he would introduce some decent measure which would enable these people to earn their livelihood instead of introducing a Bill such as this which will crush them out of existence.  In my opinion this measure is not necessary at present.  When the amount of outstanding land annuities was treble what it is now no such measure as this was introduced, but now, when the young people of the country, to the extent of 72,000, have emigrated from the land to foreign countries, a measure like this is introduced.  The Minister knows very well that if these people were at home on the land they would be able to provide for the old people who remained.  These old people have no protection, and, therefore, the sheriff is being sent in on them to take any property they may have.  Those 72,000 young people have gone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that the Minister would not have introduced this particular section only he knew that the sons and daughters of small farmers have left the country and consequently, the old people who are left are being victimised.  The Minister knows that if these 72,000 young people were in the country now they would vote against the Government. In my opinion a measure like this will put a greater burden on the ratepayers than they have to bear at present.  When the Government succeed, as the landlords did in the old days, in putting small farmers and their families on the roadside the next <Col N="351" /> step will he to put them in prison at the cost of the rates.  I ask the Minister to agree to the amendment and withdraw Section 28.  He could then draft a new section which would meet his desires.  I feel sure that it is not his personal intention to penalise the small man who cannot earn even a livelihood, to say nothing of paying four or five years' arrears.  If the Minister fixed a certain valuation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In some cases a man with a £50 valuation is worse off than a man with a valuation of £14.  It all depends on the land.  I think that the Minister with his knowledge of lands should be able to fix a valuation at which a man would be able to meet his demands.  The man with a valuation of £50 who has a large family is in a worse position to meet his demands than an unmarried man with a £14 valuation.  The Minister probably has no love for married men, but he should take into account the farmer who is going to be hit by this section if it is allowed to stand.  Do not let it be written down in history that the present Minister for Lands and Agriculture was responsible for more evictions and crucifixions in this country than the landlords of old.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion so far has centred entirely around the man who is unable, or alleged to be unable, to pay his land annuities, and no consideration has been given to the honest ratepayer, a man who has to shoulder not only his own burden but that of his defaulting neighbour.  For the past two or three years the county councils have been confronted with the very abnormal problem of how to make up the money deferred out of the Central Fund on account of the non-payment of land annuities.  That has been a very serious problem for some county councils.  In some cases the county councils decided to put portion of the money on to the rate estimate for that particular year.  In other cases they decided to raise an overdraft on the bank sufficient to cover the deficiency. <Col N="352" /> In any event, however, it meant a burden on the honest ratepayer and a huge increase in the rates.  I remember reading a report of a meeting of a county council at which the secretary stated that on account of the non-payment of land annuities the rates had to be increased between 1/- and 1/6. Deputies on the Farmers' Benches and those on the Labour Benches when speaking throughout the country have complained of the very high rates and have blamed the Government for them. I have never yet read a statement in which any one of these Deputies put his finger on the real reason, which is that there is such a big proportion of land annuities outstanding.</P>
      <P>The county councils themselves and all decent ratepayers have asked the Government to take strong action to recover land annuities.  Every Deputy knows that some twelve months or two years ago there was an agitation against the payment of land annuities. That agitation was gradually gaining ground until finally some of the people who were responsible for starting the campaign realised the seriousness of the problem, and that if the agitation were to be effective there would be serious consequences for the country. Fortunately, the people are now coming to a more normal state of mind and recognise that they must bear their responsibilities, and that it is the duty of the State to see that they must pay their just debts.  There is nothing new in this section.  Under the Poor Law Relief Act of 1843 the rate collectors were given the power which it is now proposed in this section to give to the sheriffs.  The rate collectors are a more numerous body than the sheriffs, and I have never heard a Farmer Deputy, or a Labour Deputy, or any leader of public opinion, complain that the rate collectors have abused the power given them under the Poor Law Relief Act.  Sheriffs are hedged around with more legislative restrictions than the rate collectors.  I think it is very unlikely that they would abuse the power given to them by this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt since it was first mooted that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture proposed to introduce <Col N="353" /> a section of this kind in the Land Bill the county councils have benefited considerably, and land annuities have been paid at a much greater rate than hitherto.  A short time ago I had occasion to go into one of the departments of Government responsible to a certain extent for the collection of land annuities, and I was informed by one of the officials there&mdash;I do not know is it right to state this to the Dáil&mdash;who is in a position to know, that the county councils during the past nine months, have benefited to the extent of between £70,000 and £100,000 owing to the fact that the Minister proposed to introduce a section of this kind.  I consider that the moral tone of the people in respect of the payment of debts is not quite right in this country. Desperate diseases require desperate remedies, and for that reason I am prepared to support the Minister in including this section in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to give serious consideration to the possibility of accepting this amendment, or, possibly, substituting another amendment at a later stage. There is, I believe, a general feeling in the House that the Bill in its present form is not acceptable, and that this particular sub-section is objectionable. I do not suggest that the Minister should draft an amendment on the lines proposed by Deputy Lyons, making a distinction between married men and single men, having regard to the number of children a man may have, and as to whether his valuation was £10 or £100.  The difficulties of drafting an amendment ought not to be insuperable, as the Minister for Justice suggested last night.  There has been a good deal of talk about the encouragement given to people not to pay their land annuities. I am not, for a moment, suggesting people should not pay their land annuities, and I have never suggested anything of the kind.  I have constantly emphasised the fact that I regard the payment of the land annuities as a charge on the land which the people must honour.  I have no hesitation in expressing that view, but we must be very careful about the powers which we are giving to officials.  Undoubtedly, there has been a tendency <Col N="354" /> in recent years, particularly in the Dáil, to give what I consider excessive powers to officials.</P>
      <P>I remember when the sheriffs, bailiffs and bumbailiffs were regarded as a very despicable class of people, but now, apparently, we are to regard them as people who should be received with great honour.  Taking into account recent statements made, if this Government at any time decide to grant honours to citizens who have done useful work for the State, I should not be surprised if we see sheriffs heading that list.  I am trying to protect innocent citizens.  We have no right to pass a law which may have the effect of inflicting grave injustice on an innocent citizen.  As the section stands it leaves it quite open to the sheriff to seize cattle he may find on land without taking any precautions to find out whether the cattle belonged to the owner of the land or whether it was a case of letting or grazing.  I am not in favour of the idea that the sheriff should not seize cattle which are on land which has been let on the eleven months' system, but there are possibilities that live stock may be accidentally on the land and that the sheriff will not be obliged to take reasonable precautions to ensure himself that the stock do not belong to the owner of the land before he seizes them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the threat of the passing of this Bill has led to a considerably increased percentage in the matter of the payment of annuities. In my opinion, if the section is passed in its present form, it is quite possible that in the course of time it may have the effect of causing a decrease in the amount collected, because in the case of people in arrears it will be impossible for them to let their land at all. A good deal of emphasis has been laid by certain Deputies on the fact that the failure of people to pay land purchase annuities has had a bad effect on the county rates.  I think that matter has been greatly exaggerated in so far as it applies to the rates.  Deputy Roddy said that the high rates were due, in large part, to the non-payment of the annuities.  In my opinion that is not in accordance with the facts.  The Deputy knows well <Col N="355" /> that from time to time annuities come in corresponding approximately to the amount of the outstanding annuities. The permanent arrears from one year to another remain very much the same with the exception, perhaps, of the few years during the troubled times. Therefore, I hold that the non-payment of the annuities does not tend to make the rates higher than they would be if the annuities were paid up to date. I realise that if all the annuities outstanding were paid up at once that that would have the effect of decreasing the rates for a year or two, but it would not have a permanent effect.</P>
    <P>I, and the Party to which I belong, stand for the payment of these annuities. I submit, however, that the statement made that the majority of the defaulters are people who can pay and will not, is not true. It might have been true in the past. What I believe is, that we have reached an economic position in this country whereby a great many defaulters are not able to pay.  I do not agree with the statement that the moral tone of the people is so low that they will not pay their debts.  We hear sermons here and from platforms, from Ministers and others, telling the people that they ought to pay their debts.  On the other side I think there should be a recognition of the fact that the Government has a duty to the people.  If it does not fulfil its duty and try to make the economic position of the country such that the people will be in a position to meet their obligations, then Ministers have no right to tell the people what they ought to do or what they ought not to do.  I maintain that the Government has a duty to perform as well as the people.  If the people are to be asked to perform their duty and to pay their debts&mdash;I stand for the payment of debts&mdash;then the bargain must not be a one-sided one, and the Government ought to face up to its obligations and make some attempt to relieve the people of the burdens which are making it extremely difficult for them to carry on at all.  I say that this section ought to receive further consideration.  There is a big body of <Col N="356" /> feeling in the Dáil against it in its present form.  I believe that if the Parliamentary draftsman were to look into the matter he could devise an amendment which would give the Government the power to collect annuities from the owners of the land or genuine grazers of the land, and at the same time safeguard the innocent citizen who will be mulcted if the section is allowed to stand in its present form.</P>

      <P>That is what I am trying to do.  Deputy Roddy entertained us with a song of sorrow about the position of the honest ratepayer. In that he only followed the leadership of his Minister.  The Minister's position seems to be that two wrongs constitute a right.  I never took the point of view that it was a fit and proper thing that the ratepayers should be assessed for any deficiency arising out of the guarantee fund, owing to the fact that the guarantee fund had been retained in the Department of Finance to meet a shortage in the payment of land purchase annuities. Because such an unfortunate situation exists, we are supposed in order to counter it to commit another wrong.  Deputy Roddy will not impress any intelligent person with that argument.  He might, it is true, influence the herd.  As Deputy Heffernan has pointed out, the non-payment of the annuities does not increase the rates so much.  It is the shortage in the guarantee fund that is responsible for that increase.  The amounts collected from the annuitants are afterwards restored to the county councils.</P>

      <P>At five per cent. it would be £3,000, and I ask Deputy Roddy whether he is capable of mathematically figuring that out for himself.  I submit that there is no need for the proposal in the Bill, and that the case can be met in another way. What I suggest is, that at certain periods a list of defaulters should be published in each county.  It should be made compulsory on the county councils to publish the list of defaulters in their counties.  Before any legal proceedings are entered into, this list ought to be published and a warning given to the public that the defaulters are on the list and that proceedings are pending against them.  I believe that the mere threat of publication in that way would have an excellent effect in the collection of the annuities. No man of any credit or standing would desire to have his name appearing on a list like that.  The publication of his name in such a connection would have a disastrous effect on his credit.  He could not let his land, and would not be able to get credit any place.  I think that the case could be met by the publication of such a list. I see no reason why, say, on 1st March and on 1st August in each year, when the ledgers of the Land Commission are closed down and when the names of the defaulters become known, that their names should not be publicly advertised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, last night, did not argue like his usual self; he was not as clear as usual, and wanted to make out that when the sheriff would come on land the debtor would tell him &mdash;&ldquo;Such a beast belongs to my uncle, and another belongs to my grandmother.&rdquo; After all, the sheriff is not obliged to take that point of view.  An <Col N="358" /> affidavit by the person interested, made before a magistrate, is required.  He is not obliged to take the debtor's statement that such an animal or such property belongs to a third party.  The Minister for Justice, when in London, went aloft in an aeroplane, doubtless to correct his perspective.  I know he has had an opinion of the moral shortcomings of the people in this country for a number of years, but is it correct? There may be instances, but we must legislate on the general principle.  Will a third party perjure himself even for the sake of another person?  I question it.  What has Christianity been doing in the country for the last fourteen or fifteen hundred years?</P>
    <P>I saw a statement in yesterday's paper where a person, whom I thought had withdrawn into religion, emerged again to tell another lie.  I believe if the Minister were to adopt my suggestion as to publicly advertising defaulting annuitants it would go a long way to meet my hostility; otherwise I will press it to a division.  The third party is adversely affected by this.</P>

      <P>The object with which this section was inserted in the Bill meets with the approval of Deputies from different Parties.  Two good points were made that ought to be met in connection with the section.  One is the case of a man who enters into an agreement and takes grazing from the purchaser who is in arrears with his annuity.  His stock may be seized. That is deliberately intended, and that is the position with regard to rates. I suggest that can be easily met.  That will, in fact, be met as the same difficulty with regard to rates is met.  Before a prospective grazier takes the grazing lands now from a farmer who holds his lands subject to a land purchase annuity he will make sure that he is not in arrears with his land purchase annuity.  And if he is, and is unable to pay, he will make arrangements that he himself will pay the arrears out of the grazing lands; that meets that case.</P>

      <P>In that case&mdash;I think Deputy Morrissey referred to a similar one&mdash;the Land Commission never actually pinned a man to a day.  As a rule when a man makes a reasonable proposition the Land Commission agrees, and all the effect the section will have in the case of a man who is in arrears for three or four years is that the purchaser will make a proposal to the Land Commission which the Land Commission will accept.  To my knowledge that is being done.  In the county I come from land is being sold almost exclusively on the lines I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>He takes it from spring to November.  There are fourteen days for paying up two months before the list of defaulters is returned to the county council, generally nearly two months before it reaches the State Solicitor.  He cannot be prosecuted for the June gale until the October or November session; he is absolutely safe.  In practice there is no difficulty.  I do not think it would be possible in the circumstances that you could take proceedings against the defaulter in respect to the June gale, get your decree, lodge it with the sheriff and have your execution before the September gale.  It is a most unlikely contingency, and if there is any danger of it the man who takes the land is in the position that he is covered before he pays the second half-year.  As a rule he does not pay the full rent until the end of the year.  That always covers the case of one gale.  That man is absolutely guaranteed, and in nine out of ten cases it is impossible to get a decree executed within six months after the annuity falls due.  He is further <Col N="360" /> guaranteed.  In the rare cases where that happens there is the custom that the whole of the rent is not paid until the end of the term, and he can easily arrange to recoup himself out of the rent he holds in respect of the gale for which he has paid the sheriff.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the case of a man who takes land is well covered, and we deliberately aim at making it necessary for the man who takes land to see that the annuity is paid in the same way that he sees the rates are paid.  It will give rise to certain minor difficulties in cases in the same way as it gives rise to certain difficulties where rates are concerned, but they can be easily solved in practice.  I know that there are lettings of land made and a condition is inserted in which the annuity is cleared off to the previous gale day, and in the event of the annuity falling into arrear the person who takes the land shall pay the annuity and stop it out of the grazing rent. That will cover that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, put it that way. It is not a question of the State doing it; it is a question of method.  After all this Parliament is passing the Bill; the Land Commission will administer it.  We are merely changing the method.  That is common form and not confined to this legislation.  In any normal country things are so ordered that everyone has a vested interest in collecting and paying his debts.  The State sees to that; that is the state of affairs we are trying to get back to here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will not have normality, in my opinion, until people see that the debts due to them are collected, and realise as well that they must pay their own. I said that case is absolutely covered. I admit that we inserted this section <Col N="361" /> deliberately in order to obviate abuses arising from people setting their land by arrangement and not paying their annuities.  As you can at present set your land quite readily, surely it is realised that if a defaulter has such an easy way out of the difficulty as merely to set his land, he will take it.  There are plenty of people who will oblige that man by taking the land, perhaps at just a little less rent.  That has happened in various counties.  I know examples of it in my own county, and I know of examples in other counties.  It is to obviate this and to put the case of land purchase annuities in the same position as rates, that we have introduced this section.</P>
    <P>The other difficulty is that raised by Deputy Redmond yesterday and which was raised again to-day.  That is the case of stock trespassing on land from a neighbour's field innocently.  That is a very rare case, indeed.  It is a very rare combination of circumstances that the stock should come in casually and that that should coincide with the actual day and hour of the sheriff's arrival.  It is not going to happen often&mdash;it might happen once in a blue moon&mdash;and there is no use speaking of it as being common.  All it means is that the fences are not made up.  Again, people know the state of the law.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is trying to impress the House with his knowledge <Col N="362" /> of agriculture, because he is speaking to some people who perhaps are not sheep farmers.  There is no difficulty in keeping in sheep on a farm.  There are certain breeds of sheep which it is rather difficult to keep in.  Take Tipperary with Border Leicesters and Galway ewes&mdash;there is no difficulty in keeping them in.  In County Galway farmers have gone in for horny ewes and Cheviots and there is no difficulty ever in keeping them in, if you take reasonable precautions. There is no use in the Deputy trying to impress other Deputies, who are not farmers, with that particular difficulty, which does not exist.</P>

There are times of the year when nobody can keep sheep from trespassing&mdash;one little gap will let a flock of 40 or 50 go through in a few minutes.  The Minister knows it well.  You cannot keep cattle in at certain times of the year.  I have seen them climb an eight-feet high fence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what Deputy Heffernan is asking.  There is no difficulty whatever, with reasonable precautions, in keeping your stock on your land.  A gap may fall at any time and sheep go out, but if they are looked after every day and put back and the gap raised that will prevent trespass.  A gate may be left open and sheep may trespass, but it is most unlikely that that will coincide with the actual minute that the sheriff arrives. If sheep and cattle are reasonably looked after and the fences kept properly, there is no difficulty whatever. That applies not only to the sort of sheep they have in Tipperary and in the South, but to those in Wicklow and Connemara where mountainy ewes or Cheviots, which are very difficult to keep in, are kept.  There is nothing in that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am asked to do is to provide <Col N="363" /> for the case where the gate is left open between one man's field and his neighbour's, where the sheep ramble in, and the sheriff arrives soon after to execute a decree for arrears of annuities.  The case hardly ever arises&mdash;very seldom. If we were to deal with it we would have to insert a provision that stock which are on the land casually, innocently, trespassing without any deliberation on the part of their owners, cannot be seized.  What would the effect of that be?  It would mean that any two neighbours could drive a coach-and-four through the section.  They could always make an arrangement.  You can always arrange to set your land to a neighbour, and if the sheriff turns up it would make it almost impossible for him to seize in a case where the land has been set to a neighbour.  People are very quick to find out the state of <Col N="364" /> the law, and very quick to adapt their actions to the new state of affairs.</P>
    <P>If the section is passed as it stands it will mean (1) that an arrangement will be made when letting land to see that the annuities are paid up, or that an arrangement is come to to pay up that will meet that; (2) if there are farmers who keep their fences so badly that their stock are constantly trespassing on their neighbour's, they will realise that it is not a safe thing, and they will keep the fences properly.  The net result will be good from every point of view, and the section will do no harm.  It is the logical consequence of the present rates position.  It would be absurd to have one law for the collection of rates, and another for the collection of arrears of annuities, which, in fact, become rates.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to give us a statement as to the anomalous position created <Col N="365" /> under this section.  The Land Commission is the creditor, and at the present time they have authority to sell up the debtor, not by public auction, but by private contract, and they can give a certificate stating that the price realised is to be taken as the fair value of the land.  That is a revolutionary proposal, I submit.  I would be at a loss to find a parallel anywhere for a proposal that the creditor shall sell up the debtor and be at liberty to receive the bids, and shall certify that these bids represent the fair price.  Is there any justification for such a proposal?  It is a revolutionary idea, I submit, in jurisprudence. It is certainly not known to the law at the present time.  It is not the certificate of the judicial commissioner or of any court that shall be accepted, but that of the Land Commission themselves acting as officers of the State.</P>

      <P>I am putting the Land Commission, here, in the same position as the ordinary mortgagee; this is not a revolutionary idea in jurisprudence. There is just this difference.  The certificate of the Land Commission justifies the price here.  It is really a question only of convenience.  If the Land Commission gives a certificate that it is the best price to be had that justifies the price.  In the case of an ordinary mortgagee there is another method adopted; he has to justify the price in a slightly different way.</P>

The Deputy wishes to have the words &ldquo;and have become vested in the Land Commission under the provisions of Section 32 of this Act&rdquo; inserted. That is to say, the land must vest in the Land Commission before they transfer it to a county council which wants to take it.  That would not affect the legal position.

      <P>I will.  You are giving the powers which may be exercised and which, I presume, are incorporated <Col N="372" /> in the Bill with the intention that they shall be exercised.  The expenses and management of those farms are to be borne as a county-at-large charge.  That is bound to have the effect of making the burden greater in proportion as the county is poorer.  We may expect that a considerable number of farms will be put up for sale and inasmuch as every man has enough to do at present to hold the land he possesses, it is very questionable if there will be a ready sale for such lands.  Economic conditions in agriculture are not very bright. They have not been bright for a number of years, and there is no prospect of brighter conditions for a considerable time.  All these things are bound to have the effect of placing a considerable amount of land in the hands of the Land Commission.

      <P>The county councils can do this with the consent of the Minister for Local Government if they so desire.  If the Minister wants it done he can have it done.  If some of his own Sinn Fein councils had possessed such extraordinary powers as are given here, some years ago, I wonder what the conditions would be to-day.  I believe we would have been brought by now a considerable distance nearer to the realisation of the Communist State. They could put up the rates as high as they desired, and, as men gradually broke down, the Land Commission could take over their lands under these powers.  They could continue to tax and tax in an ever-increasing degree the remaining people who occupied land, and they could create a welter of ruin. <Col N="373" /> There are dangerous potentialities in this section which we ought not, for a moment, to let go unchallenged.

Its object is to place the Minister and the Land Commission in a position to say to the county councils when they cannot collect the annuities: &ldquo;Here is land; you collect the annuities or sell the land.&rdquo;  It is simply a means of throwing the onus of collecting on the county councils.  It is a gesture for that purpose.  The Minister knows quite well that no land will, in fact, be taken over and worked by a county council.  I do not know anybody less capable of handling and working land than a county council.  Why incorporate in a Bill a section which we know will not be carried out?  I submit that this is a section which ought not to be put to the House.</P>

      <P>There has been more nonsense talked on this section than on the whole Land Bill and the 1923 Act. It is not only nonsense that has been talked, but the worst kind of nonsense &mdash;deliberate nonsense.  Deputies know that I am not forcing the county councils to take any land.  We are merely putting ourselves in the position that we can offer them land in the rare cases where land will be useful to them. We are not trying to shelter behind the county councils.  With the help of the sections included in this Bill, we will collect the annuities.  But the county councils have forestry schemes, tillage schemes, and grazing schemes, and two days after the Deputy had made a foolish speech on this question on last stage I was put questions by Deputy Johnson, and the answers showed that the county councils had certain lands subject to land purchase annuities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not speaking of the Select Committee.  Here in this House I heard all this nonsense and, immediately after Second Reading, I had three or four questions put me here.  The answers to those questions showed, clearly, that county councils had certain lands subject to land purchase annuities for forestry schemes, for tillage schemes and for grazing schemes.  We deliberately inserted in the Land Act, 1923, a section giving county councils power to act as trustees in certain cases in respect to land which might be used for tillage, grazing, forestry and so on.  County councils occasionally want land for these purposes or for building if it is near a town.  All that is contemplated in this section is that in the rare cases where-there is land suitable for the purposes of a county council and we desire to offer it to a county council, they shall be in a position to take it.  The county councils are perfectly free to refuse the offer.  They have an option.  They may take it or they may refuse it.  There is no suggestion that county councils should be asked to farm land.  Nobody outside a lunatic asylum would ask county councils to farm land.  But they do want land for certain purposes.  We provide that if we have land suitable for their purposes and if there are arrears of Land Commission annuity on it, we may offer it to the county council and the county council will be in a position&mdash;which unfortunately, they are not now&mdash;of accepting it if they so desire.  Of course, I do not mind Deputy Connor Hogan.  He has a standing grievance against all county councils.</P>

He was anxious to get into the Clare County Council, but he was rejected, and hence his opinion about all county councils is decidedly low, and hence all this nonsense about this simple and desirable section.  The rolling phrases about the immense principles that are involved and the enunciation of these platitudes about the impossibility of a county council farming land are absolutely beside the point, and really Deputy Connor Hogan should not allow his grievance against the Clare County Council to influence what on some occasions is a fairly reliable judgment.</P>

      <P>I think that is a dangerous thing, and all that the Minister has said might not be carried out by a commissioner.  Even though there would be the protection of the Minister for Local Government, if a commissioner had this discretion he might plunge a county into a very critical state by taking up a number of derelict farms.  I think that is a question that the Minister should look into.  In any case I do not see any reason at all for this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy fails to see is that even at present a commissioner has big responsibilities, and if he is not a competent man he can ruin a county.  These are difficulties that we cannot get over in any other way than by endeavouring to appoint a competent commissioner, and if you appoint a commissioner who is capable of handling £100,000 of rates and of running roads and asylums and administering poor relief, you ought to <Col N="376" /> assume that he has sufficient discretion to know when to accept this offer and when to refuse it.  If he has not, you ought to give the Land Commission credit for sufficient judgment as not to offer derelict farms to such a commissioner.  It is out of the question.</P>
