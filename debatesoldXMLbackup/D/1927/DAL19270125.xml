      <P>asked the President whether he is aware that statements have been made in the Press that it is the intention of the Government to constitute a Commission to inquire into the position of town tenants in the Saorstát; and, if so, what are the terms of reference of the proposed Commission, the names of the Commissioners and the proposed date for its first sitting.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Executive Council on the 19th instant appointed a Commission</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to inquire into and examine the existing law governing the relationship of landlord and tenant in respect of holdings in urban districts, towns or villages occupied either for residential or for business purposes or partly for residential and partly for business purposes with a view to ascertaining what hardships or anomalies, if any, arise under the law, and to recommend to the Executive Council what changes in the law are practicable and desirable to alleviate or remove such hardships and anomalies and, further, to inquire into and examine the working of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, 1899, with a view to ascertaining to what extent the purpose aimed at by that Act was achieved and in what respect, if any, an amendment of that Act or an extension of its principle is desirable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Commission consists of:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Creed Meredith (Chairman):</P>
      <P>John J. Horgan, Esq., Solicitor, Cork:</P>

      <P>Mr. John B. Hughes, of the Office of the Registry of Deeds, as Secretary.</P>

      <P>(for Mr. Connor Hogan) asked the President if he will state whether the text of the agreement known as &ldquo;Heads of working arrangements for implementing the Treaty,&rdquo; signed at London between Irish Ministers and His Majesty's Ministers on the 24th January, 1922, will be printed and circulated to members of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The document in question was published as a Command Paper in London in July, 1923, and has, of course, been available to the public since that date.</P>
      <P>It was not considered necessary to publish it separately here as the matters to which it related consisted largely of departmental arrangements for a transfer of functions to the Provisional Government and for the setting up of machinery for the assessment of compensation for damages to person and property, and for the release of prisoners and similar matters, and as these arrangements had been in operation for a considerable time the facts were already well known to the public.</P>
      <P>If any Member of the House desires to have a copy and notifies me to that effect during the course of the next few days I will have him provided with a typed copy.  It is not considered, in view of the publication which the document has already received, that the expense of printing it as a Parliamentary Paper should be necessary.</P>

      <P>Are we to take it from the President's answer that it is part of Governmental policy that papers affecting Irish interests and printed in London by the British Government need not be printed in Ireland for the benefit of Irish readers and citizens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Ordinarily I would say that they would be published simultaneously in both places but, I think, if the Deputy throws his mind back to the period in question he will understand that many things might have been overlooked. We were just approaching the end of the Session, the matters were not really <Col N="5" /> of great public importance, while the facts in the publication were well known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON (for Tomás O Conaill)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the late Mr. John Hastings (Peter), of Derryherbert, Westport, Co. Mayo, died as a result of the treatment which, it is alleged, he had received from British Forces after the Carrow-kennedy ambush in March, 1921; whether he is also aware that Mr. Hastings has left a widow and four orphans who were solely dependent on him; whether his widow has made application for compensation; whether any inquiries were made as a result of the receipt of this application, and, if so, what is the result of those inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No application has been received in respect of the death of the person named by the Deputy. An application was made by Mr. Hastings on the 9th July, 1923, for compensation in respect of personal injuries stated to have been sustained by him on the 24th March, 1921, and this application was investigated by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee in accordance with their <Col N="6" /> terms of reference.  After careful consideration of the facts of the case, as contained in the application form and medical certificate submitted and as otherwise presented to them, the Committee found that the injuries sustained were not serious or such as would affect the applicant's health to any great extent.  They accordingly recommended that no compensation should be paid.  This decision was conveyed to the applicant's solicitor on the 14th November, 1924.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is doubtless aware, the Committee has long since ceased to function and there is now no machinery for dealing with applications of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>MICHEAL O hIFEARNAIN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the general public interest which is taken in the financing of the Land Acts of 1903 and 1909, and in particular of the effect of the rate of interest on the current market value of Land Stock on the period of redemption, he will issue to the Dáil a statement showing (1) the total amount collected to date from tenant purchasers under those Acts and treated as sinking fund; (2) the use to which this money has been put; (3) the annual return per cent. on the investment of the sinking fund during the past three years; further, if he will state whether the sinking fund payments are used for the purchase of Land Stock in the open market, and if so, what effect such purchase will have on the period within which it is calculated the sinking fund payments will redeem the outstanding Land Stock in full; further, whether, in the event of the present high rate of interest allowing for redemption before the stipulated time, legislation would be introduced to extend such time to that originally stated as being necessary for redemption, and thereby to give annuitants a reduction in their present annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The information asked for by the Deputy is not available in any Department here, as the Irish Land Purchase Fund is managed by the National Debt Commissioners. <Col N="7" /> It would appear, however, from the published accounts of the Irish Land Purchase Fund for 1923-24, that the total receipts for the sinking funds under the Irish Land Acts of 1903 and 1909 amounted to £8,707,375 2s. 7d. on 31st March, 1924.  These receipts include, in addition to the amounts collected from tenant purchasers in respect of sinking fund, accumulated interest on sinking fund securities and sinking fund payments in respect of excess and bonus stock.  Out of the total receipts a sum of £7,191,200 was on loan on the date mentioned to the capital account for the purpose of making further advances for land purchase under the authority of Section 36 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, the sum of £1,515,972 7s. 1d. had been applied to the purchase of Guaranteed 2¾ and 3 per cent.  Stock in cases where tenant purchasers had redeemed their annuities, and £202 15s. 6d. remained uninvested.</P>
      <P>The amounts applied for further advances would be earning interest according to the interest rate of the annuity set up in each case&mdash;i.e., 2¾ or 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>So far as I am aware, the bulk of the sinking fund receipts have been used for making further advances until quite recently, and consequently the necessity for the introduction of legislation on the lines suggested by the Deputy does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the period of redemption was calculated on the varying rates of interest at the time when the Land Acts, 1903 and 1909, were passed and that if the Sinking Fund is used at the present rate of interest it must necessarily result in the redemption of the land stock at an earlier date.  Would the Minister, in view of that possibility, get in touch with the British authorities with the object of having the new period, which must necessarily be shorter, extended at least to the original calculated period and, thereby, reduce the present annuities of the tenants?</P>

      <P>Legislation is being prepared to give effect generally to the recommendations contained in the Committee's Report. Action has already been taken on one of its recommendations by the making of an Order under Section 12 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1906, for the collection of statistics relating to compensation.  The question of the ratification of the International Labour Convention relating to reciprocity in the matter of workmen's compensation, which was deferred pending the Committee's report, is again being examined, but it is doubtful whether until new legislation has been adopted effective reciprocity with Great Britain could be established on a satisfactory basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy understands the position quite well.  The mere presentation of the Bill would not ensure reciprocal arrangements; it would only make way for them.  The matter would still depend on good-will being shown in regard to the treatment of seamen. The question of the Bill will be dealt with just as other legislation of this type is dealt with.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the Great Southern Railway Company is contemplating the purchase of about 1,000 wagon wheels from the Continent of Europe; that about 400 of these wheels have already arrived from Belgium; whether he is also aware that the Inchicore Works are well equipped for turning out wagon wheels, and that the men in this shop at Inchicore are on short time, working only four days per week, and whether, in these circumstances, he will make representations to the Railway Company with a view to having the work in question carried out at Inchicore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Great Southern Railways Company that it has placed an order for wagon wheels with a Continental firm, the reason given being that in its present financial position the Company is forced to adopt all reasonable economies. It is stated that the price to be paid for these wheels is about one-half of what it would cost to make them at Inchicore.  The Company further states that by a decision of the Industrial Courts (No. 728), dated 8th July, 1922, the wages of railway shopmen in Great Britain were substantially reduced, while no corresponding reduction has been made in the Saorstát and represents that this militates against work of this nature being performed in the Company's own shops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The cows in question are for export to England and it is not for the Irish but for the English Department to say under what conditions cows shall be allowed to enter England.  The present British regulations <Col N="19" /> are stringent.  No animal suffering from an indurated under is permitted to land in Great Britain. An animal however is not rejected because of a thickening of the teat unless there is a discharge from it. Representations on this matter have been made by the British Department to this Department.  If the Irish veterinary inspectors at this side allowed the shipment of animals that came within the regulations they would be returned from the other side at the expense of the Irish shipper.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, will he say whether numerous cows have been returned from the Irish ports, from one port in particular, which have been examined by the local veterinary surgeons, and, in most cases, have been found to be quite sound?  Is he further aware of the fact that, apparently, any cow which has any defect in the under is being rejected on the assumption that it is a tubercular udder?  Is the Minister aware that cows whose udders are affected but not tubercular have been rejected, and if that is due to his officers and not to the officers of the English Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that cows are rejected for the reasons which I have specified in the answer.  Quite recently representations have been made by the British authorities in the most direct terms that unless we carried out the regulations on this side stringently they would have to take other means to see them carried out.  In other words, they would have to return these animals.  We would not be doing a good turn to Irish shippers if we allowed cows to go on board and put them to the expense of taking them to the other side, and then found that they would have to re-ship them back at their own expense.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's answer, where cows are rejected at the port by the Irish veterinary surgeons and where they are returned and found to be sound, will the Department compensate the owners of the cows for the losses incurred because of their return?  I might explain <Col N="20" /> that cows have been rejected at one port and sent away from another port. I could give the Minister specific cases of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, cows have been rejected at the North Wall, and in spite of that they have gone through some other Irish port and have been let through on the other side.  I say that is impossible.  What the Deputy is asking me to do is this: that if the British Government refuses to allow certain Irish cattle into England we should pay for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the British at all.  I am talking about the Irish veterinary surgeons.  If they reject a cow, and the cow is sent back to the owner and found to be perfectly sound and perfectly free from tuberculosis, the owner is put to considerable loss owing to the fact that he has had to pay transit charges and other charges.  In cases like that will the Department compensate the owners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is begging the question, because cows with indurated udders are not allowed through under the British regulations, and, after all, the British are paying for them.  I cannot alter the British regulations. I have pointed out that quite recently the British considered that our inspection was not strict enough, and made strong representations to our officers.</P>

I should say that in ninety per cent. of the cases the lumps in the cows udders are not due at all to tuberculosis, and that the cows are perfectly sound.

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's answer, is he aware that numbers of cattle, sheep and pigs have in recent years been confiscated in England as suffering from tuberculosis and that there is a big agitation in England to get the State to compensate the owners for loss of same, because they hold that anything destroyed for the public good should be compensated for by the State?  A number of Irish owners have suffered considerably owing to the seizures made of their animals.  The animals have actually been burned in England and the owner gets no compensation.  It is at the whim of the vets, to do this.  I ask the Minister whether any support will be given from this side to Irish owners who send live stock to Great Britain. Will the Minister endeavour to induce the British Government to compensate these owners for the loss sustained for the seizures made?</P>

      <P>With regard to the last question, when a beast is sold to an Englishman the beast is killed on the other side and if it is condemned for tuberculosis the owner is compensated. When a beast on this side is condemned and is killed under the regulations the owner is compensated. With regard to the other points I do not agree that the English know nothing about their business.  They know the sort of cattle that they want and that they are prepared to pay for. If Deputy Heffernan knew anything about the matter he would have made The suggestion is that we should The suggestion is this that we should make representations to the British to allow dry fat cows that are intended for immediate slaughter at the ports to be allowed through even though their udders are indurated.  It does not matter whether it is tuberculosis or not, the question is are their udders indurated.  These representations, which have not been suggested by the Deputy, we are making.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether his attention has been called to a report <Col N="22" /> published in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; of the 18th January, 1927, to the effect that a Copenhagen message says the National &ldquo;Tidende&rdquo; publishes a telegram from its London correspondent asserting that inquiries made by a Danish slaughterhouse proprietor, M. Noergaard, has indicated that large quantities of Russian, Swedish, Dutch and Polish bacon imported into Great Britain had never been sold retail as such, but had been sold either as Irish or Danish; and whether his Department has taken any steps to ascertain the accuracy of the statement, with a view to prosecuting those fraudulent retailers who are doing such injury to the Irish bacon trade, and if the Minister will state the number of prosecutions instituted against traders in Great Britain through the instrumentality of the Department's Inspectors during the three years ended 1st November, 1926, in respect of the fraudulent sale in England of foreign butter, bacon and eggs as Irish produce, the number of convictions obtained, and the amount of fines imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department have observed the statement referred to, and have made an inquiry into the matter through the Trade Commissioner, High Commissioner's Office.

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's answer, I desire to ask him whether it is the intention in the near future of this Government to introduce in this country a Merchandise Marks Act, in order to safeguard Irish producers and to see that foreign produce coming into the country will be labelled and sold as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The allegation here is that Irish produce has been sold in England as, say, Danish.  That is another question.  As a rule I do not think that Irish people are very anxious to sell Irish produce as Danish in England.  I do not think that has happened very often.  With regard to the Deputy's last question as to what <Col N="23" /> we are to do with regard to foreign produce sold here as Irish, that is another question, and does not arise out of this.  I think we have sufficient powers&mdash;we have exercised them in a few cases&mdash;in regard to bacon.  It is not so much that we have not remedies when we do discover cases, but rather the difficulty is to discover cases.  I understand that a Merchandise Marks Act will be introduced for this country.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that previous to the setting up of the Saorstát, inspectors belonging to the Department used to visit Great Britain?  I can show him that within twelve months forty-one prosecutions took place as a result of these inspections, and that heavy fines were inflicted in Great Britain.  It is a well known fact that a lot of foreign bacon, as has been stated in the Danish journal, is being sold at the present time as Irish in Great Britain.  There is also a great danger&mdash;in fact there are a lot of rumours to this effect&mdash;of its being sold here in Dublin.  Of course I know it is very hard to detect that.  I know that previous to the Treaty inspectors from the Department here used to visit England with a view to making inspections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The High Commissioner's Office deals with these matters. A Trade Commissioner has recently been appointed and there are some inspectors. We thought it right to appoint a trade inspector and let him say what establishment is necessary.  That is all that is occurring.  Although it is only an opinion, I do not believe that foreign bacon is being sold to any extent in Great Britain as Irish.  A firm like Denny's, or any of the big firms operating in England, would not allow that, and they would bring such a matter to our notice immediately.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for these Estimates arises first in connection with the setting up and working of the Local Appointments Commission, and secondly, because an arrangement has been made for further provision for Galway College that was not made when the <Col N="27" /> original Estimates were introduced. The estimate is necessary for the beet sugar industry, because the area of beet planted was greater than was anticipated, and the yield of sugar greater. The estimate for the Department of Lands and Agriculture is necessary, particularly in view of the Dairy Produce Act, as it is necessary that creameries should be erected in various districts where there are now none.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture must be in a position to make advances to enable these creameries to be erected.</P>

      <P>That a return be presented in respect of the period from August, 1923, to 31st December, 1926, for County Tipperary, showing&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the number of estates acquired by the Land Commission for the purpose of division;</P>
      <P>(b)  the total number of acres acquired;</P>
      <P>(c)  the names of the owners of such estates, with any other information necessary for identification, together with the number of acres in each estate;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  estates in regard to which a price has been offered and where the owner has appealed and the price has been raised by the Judicial Commissioner, with the price <Col N="30" /> offered and the price finally fixed by the Judicial Commissioner in each case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Dáil will agree that this is an unreasonable request. I will just read the motion, which I think speaks for itself. (Motion read.)  The first observation I have to make is, that while Deputies are entitled to all reasonable information it must be obvious to the Deputy that if he presses for this return and gets it, every other Deputy is entitled to similar information for every county in Ireland.  It must be obvious to him what that means.  There is a lot of land division going on at present, and the indoor staff of the Land Commission are required for that work just as much as the outdoor staff, as they have to check the work.  For the indoor staff to be switched off its proper work to deal with extremely complicated detailed returns for every county in Ireland, as to every estate either in process of division or acquisition in their hands, would be quite impossible.  We cannot have land purchase and that work proceeding at the same time without employing a very large number of extra officials, and of course the Deputy will be willing to take all the kudos to be had out of condemning the Department for having big staffs.  Equally, if this return is given for Tipperary, Deputies are entitled to get returns for every county in Ireland and these returns will vary over each month of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take (g): &ldquo;Estates in regard to which the Land Commission have offered a price to the owner, but which have not yet been acquired&rdquo;; that might be (a) in two months.  Take (h): &ldquo;Estates in regard to which a price has been offered, but which the owners have refused to accept, and where an appeal has been made in regard to price to the Judicial Commissioner&rdquo;; that might be up to (g) in a month or two.  The position would be that in any month of any year any Deputy or every Deputy could ask the Land Commission for detailed information which would take about half the Land Commission staff to prepare, say, in about a fortnight.  If it is to be prepared accurately, that would be out of the <Col N="31" /> question, and I could not possibly agree to it.  Moreover, I think the point of view that is enshrined in (h), that is to say, to give full information as to the price and other particulars of a suit that is pending before the Judicial Commissioner and that is being argued before him, is unsound.  So far as possible that information should not be given.</P>
    <P>The Judicial Commissioner is a High Court judge.  The Commissioners themselves are a Court.  A case is heard before them the same as a contract case or any other case in the Four Courts. While that case is going on, it is not desirable that it should be canvassed in the Dáil or outside.  There is exactly the same argument as to discussion of that kind in regard to a case before the Judicial Commissioner as there is in regard to any other case. The only distinction really is this, that one of those cases is very much more important from the point of view of the owner and the people to be benefited. One of those cases would involve a sum of £10,000 or £15,000, much more than any contract case before the High Court judge, and it is not desirable that they should be canvassed here in the House, and, of course, if here in the House, down the country.  A decision in these matters should be given in the same atmosphere as any other legal decision, so that even if the question of time of the staff did not enter into it I would object and I would ask the House to support me in objecting to give out detailed information as to the merits of a case which is sub judice and which actually is being argued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My point of view about this return is that I feel it is the right of a Deputy from any county to have made available for him all the information which he may require in regard to the working of any Government Department in reference to his county with the exception of any portion which may be undesirable from certain points of view.  I find in regard to this matter of getting information, as to estates in my county, that I have the greatest possible difficulty in getting information <Col N="32" /> of any kind from the Land Commission. As a last resort I have to come to the House here and ask a question of the Minister, and then I can get information of some kind.  There is a very definite disinclination on the part of the Land Commission to give information to me as a Deputy.  I do not know whether the same thing applies to every Deputy, but I have the greatest difficulty in getting any information. I find my letters are not answered.  I get an acknowledgment of my letter, but no reply.  I wait for weeks and weeks to get an answer.</P>
      <P>Considering all the controversy that is arising down the country in regard to certain matters in connection with the working of the Land Act, controversy in regard to the price paid for the land, and controversy as to whether the incoming tenants would be able to pay the annuities placed on them because of the price fixed, there is a great lack of knowledge about the whole matter.  I confess myself to a lack of complete knowledge as to what money is spent and how the money is spent, what rents are fixed and how far the Government is contributing towards a settlement of these different estates.  I say definitely there is a clear indication on the part of the Land Commission, and perhaps on the part of the Minister, not to give that information. I say that we have that right, and that I have the right to claim that we should get such information.  In any democratic institution, in any democratic country, it is the right of a Deputy to get that information if the information is available.  I think the Minister could depend on my honour not to make use of any information of that kind that I get for propaganda purposes or for election purposes or for any purposes of that kind.  It is not for these purposes I am seeking it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the time that would be taken up by the Land Commission in preparing the return I ask for, I say that in my opinion, and from any knowledge I have of preparing returns&mdash;and I have some&mdash;there would not be a great deal of time taken up in the compilation of the return.  Most of the items are comparatively simple items, items which any junior clerk in the Land <Col N="33" /> Commission, if the books are placed at his disposal, could supply.  If any clerk, not necessarily a junior clerk, had one clear day and had the books available he could get all the information I ask for.  In regard to the items, I see there are difficulties as to the item mentioned by the Minister, that is item H.  I considered myself, at the time I put it down, whether it was advisable or not to ask for the information.  Perhaps it might be a matter for this House to consider whether it is advisable in the public interest that that should be given, but in my opinion it would not do any harm. These things are matters of current public knowledge.  When a price is <Col N="34" /> offered to a man and the man rejects it, it usually becomes public knowledge in the locality what price had been offered.  I again assert that I have the right to get the return which I am asking for.  If the Minister is prepared to meet me in part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to oppose this motion.  The figures, so far as they are available at all, have already been published. The figures, for instance, for parts 1, 3, and 5 of the motion have been published by the British Government. In regard to parts 2 and 4, the figures are not really available.  A certain attempt was made by the British Government to attribute the proportion available to Saorstát Eireann.  The White Paper was published in connection with the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  The basis on which that attempt was made was complicated and could only be seen in the White Paper. The Deputy could examine that White Paper for himself.  With regard to parts 6 and 7 of the motion, the details are available in the financial returns for the various years.  In regard to part 8, a sum in division, which the Deputy might be able to do for himself, is <Col N="36" /> necessary.  I think really if the Deputy wants his speeches made, he should make them himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether, with a view to facilitating Deputies in the matter of finance returns and statistics generally, it has yet been decided to publish something in the nature of a statistical abstract, so that all matters of statistical information could be gathered together and made readily available.  At present the position is that we have to go from one book to another, from one library to another, and sometimes from one Government department to another to seek out information, whereas, if there were a general volume of statistics gathered all that trouble might be saved and the advantage to Deputies and the public generally would be very considerable.  I press that point of view on the Government&mdash;the necessity of having gathered into one volume the bulk of this statistical information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter has been discussed with the Department of Industry and Commerce, and it is intended that such a publication should be issued.  It is somewhat difficult to get ahead with it yet, because the Statistical Department is burdened with the census of population, on which it is at present engaged, and it is taking a census of production.  When these two big works have been disposed of what Deputy Johnson requires will be attended to.  Whether anything could be done in the way of bringing statistics together, short of a complete abstract, is a matter that would require some consideration.</P>

      <P>My point of view is very much similar to that of Deputy Johnson.  A great deal, if not all, of this information is available to Deputies if they know where to get it. It is all very well for Ministers to direct Deputies like me to a White Paper published by the British Government in 1922, as was done to-day in answer to a question.  I say that it is the duty of <Col N="37" /> the Government, with their officials and staffs, to facilitate us in getting information which will be readily understandable. With regard to this particular information which I am asking for, the Minister, as usual, attributes my reasons for asking for it to certain causes which are not the causes.  The Minister has a very ready way of arriving at conclusions as to what is at the back of Deputies' minds, but perhaps he is sometimes wrong.  It may be understandable that Deputies desire to get information for information's sake.  I want to get on record certain statements in regard to taxation, because we have had conflicting statements made in public by Ministers themselves, and I want to be able to get information that can be regarded as absolutely reliable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not dealing with particulars; I am dealing with the general question that statements have been made, for instance, by the President, with regard to reductions of taxation since the period of the British occupation, and these statements have been contradicted by other people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I may, perhaps, be wrong in saying that conflicting statements were made by Ministers.  If that is so I will withdraw that part of it.  But I will say this, that statements <Col N="38" /> have been made by Ministers which they have not been able to back up afterwards.  The President made a statement with regard to Irish finances about two years ago which he contradicted later; he changed the figures given, and changed them very materially. I want to get figures which will be authentic and which will not be changed by the President to suit the particular political requirements of his Party.  The same answer cannot be given to this question as was given to the other, that the preparation of these figures would involve a great deal of trouble in the case of officials.  I have been refused information to-day which I believe I am entitled to, information I am asking for in good faith, and I maintain a Deputy is entitled to get the information which is placed at the disposal of the members of the Government Party by the officials when they require it but which is not available to members of other Parties.  I say, with regard to information which has been given in connection with the administration of departments of State, that members of any Party have as much right to get such information as members of the Government Party, and I resent considerably the attitude that has been taken up by Ministers in regard to my two motions to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to correct the Deputy's recollection of a statement made by me some time ago. He said that I had to correct my figures.  I had not.  I think if the Deputy will look up the matter he will find that I explained in the communication which I sent to the Press afterwards that three or four words were left out of the statement.  No figures were altered.  The Deputy might take a little more care to make sure that his facts are correct before he makes statements.  The information that has been given by me in reviewing the very incorrect figures which were given by a member of his Party were acquired from the speech of the Minister for Finance in the Dáil in connection with the Budget, and if the Deputy would pay some attention to that speech he would probably find as many figures in it as he requires.</P>

      <P>I object.  I think we should have a little more time between the stages.  I hope the practice is not going to be resumed of rushing measures from stage to stage without giving due notice.  This Bill does not require a lot of consideration, but I want to put in a protest against the resumption of the practice of taking stage immediately after stage without giving opportunity to Deputies who may not be in the House at the moment of knowing when a particular stage is coming forward.  I think there should be notice given and opportunities afforded to Deputies so that they may come forward if they have an interest in a particular measure.

      <P>The Bill must be law by the 21st February.  Assuming a <Col N="42" /> week must clapse from the date on which it has passed both Houses, it must pass the Seanad before the 14th February.  We have now reached the 25th January.  It is a non-contentious measure.  The Second Reading has been agreed to.  It is simply a continuation of an existing Act, no amendment other than the defeat of the measure being possible.  I think the protest made by Deputy Johnson, unless it is for the purpose of making a protest against the practice, does not affect the issue so far as this measure is concerned.</P>
      <P>There is one point which might be considered.  That is as to whether we should not take four months instead of three months.  Agreement has been given to the principle of the measure, which aims at keeping existing arrangements alive for the life of this Session.  That is all that is wanted, and it is not intended to make a practice of taking stage immediately after stage.  I quite agree Deputy Johnson is perfectly entitled to make the protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes)</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving the Second Reading of this Bill, I should like to say at the outset that the delay in bringing the Bill forward has mainly arisen from the exceptional difficulties encountered in determining the manner in which the pension proposals relating to disease should be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> Apart from certain specific amendments of the Army Pensions Act of 1923, the main proposals of this Bill are for the grant of pensions in respect of disabilities arising from disease in the period up to the 1st October, 1924; pensions and gratuities for wounds in the period from the date on which active service conditions were held to cease, until the date of the constitution of the Forces, viz., from the 1st October, 1923, to 1st October, 1924; pensions and gratuities in respect of wounds received in the period from the constitution of the Defence Forces on 1st October, 1924, onwards; and allowances or gratuities for dependants.</P>
    <P>The question of granting pensions in respect of disease attributable to service was considered when the Army Pensions Act of 1923 was being drafted, and it was then held that the difficulties to be encountered in associating a disability arising from disease with service were so great that it was decided not to pursue that aspect of pension legislation at that time.</P>
    <P>Since then there has been pressure for pension legislation in respect of disease, and a Committee was appointed to make recommendations in that regard and on other pension suggestions. In that Committee's report, it was stated that no abstract reason could be seen why the grant of pensions, allowances and gratuities should be confined to cases where death or disability is the direct result of wounds and injuries, but the Committee went on to say that the difficulties in determining that the disease was in fact contracted during, and attributable to, service would in many cases be insurmountable.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper stated what he believed to be the parliamentary practice.  He said the practice was that when a Minister quotes from a departmental report, the report in full should be furnished to the House.  It is, I think, a sound practice when a Minister quotes from a document that a request may be made for the document and the document should, normally, be furnished to the House.  When Deputy Cooper says that if a Minister quotes a departmental report it necessarily follows that the departmental report should be given to the House, I do not entirely agree.  The Minister does appear to be quoting from a document.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks; we will leave the rest of the sentence unsaid. It is known that there are cases where it can be established that the disease disability did in fact arise from service in the Volunteers, the Citizen Army, or in the Forces, and it was decided to bring in legislation to cover <Col N="46" /> such of these cases as disclosed extreme hardship.</P>
      <P>In this matter of disease disability it must be remembered that a pension can only be granted in respect of a disability clearly due to service.  It does not follow that every disability arising in service was due to that service, and an applicant for disablement pension must be able to show not only that he is suffering from a disability which he had not before entering the service, but also that the disability is due to that service.  It must also be borne in mind that the conditions of subsequent civil life may have produced ailments akin to those set up by service, or may have materially worsened disabilities which owe their origin to that service.</P>
      <P>In considering this whole matter the Government were faced on the one hand with the fact that in the struggle for national independence and in the subsequent effort which had to be made to vindicate the people's authority, many sacrifices were called for and made, and on the other, that it would be acting beyond the country's financial resources to provide financial compensation for the vast majority of these sacrifices.  We recognise that loss of health is the greatest sacrifice, but even here we have to cut our cloth according to our measure, and much as we should like to be able to deal with all cases of loss of health, we cannot do so.  The most we can do is to alleviate, in some manner, the sufferings of those who have lost health to such an extent as to be almost totally incapable to provide for themselves.  Moreover, it was felt that a wound was a definitely ascertainable fact which could be established beyond any doubt. The origin and originating cause of disease, particularly the chronic forms of disease, are always doubtful and nearly impossible to establish definitely. In all these circumstances it is felt that a minimum degree of disability in respect of disease should be fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next important feature in the Bill is that it in effect carries on the Army Pensions Act of 1923 from the date on which Active Service conditions were held to have ceased, that date being 30/9/1923, until <Col N="47" /> the date of the constitution of the Forces on the 1/10/1924.  The Army Pensions Act of 1923 covered only cases of wounds, etc., arising in the Active Service period.  Many woundings and injuries, however, occurred in the year following the cessation of the Active Service period, and it was decided to cover these cases by extending the provisions of the Army Pensions Act of 1923 to cover that period.  It thus results that wounds and injuries, and deaths arising therefrom, occurring in the year from the 1/10/1923 to the 30/9/1924, will be dealt with under the provisions of the Act of 1923.</P>
    <P>Disease disabilities having their origin from service in the Defence Forces as constituted on 1st October, 1924, are not provided for.  The Defence Forces have existed since 1st October, 1924, on a peace basis, and the State could not be called upon to accept any pension responsibility in respect of disease actually arising in the period from 1st October, 1924, amongst a body of men who are medically fit, and under constant medical supervision, and whose conditions of life in the Army are less likely to create disease than in civil life. Wounds and injuries and deaths arising therefrom are, however, provided for, but on a different basis to that laid down in the Army Pensions Act of 1923.  The difference lies in the fact that it was only from the 1/10/1924 that ranks amongst officers and men became clearly defined, and pensions and gratuities in respect of wounds and injuries and deaths arising in the Defence Forces, as constituted on that date, are dealt with on a graduated scale according to the rank of the person concerned.</P>
    <P>There are some general powers provided for in the Bill which will, I am sure, be acceptable.  In case of failure of a pensioner to maintain his wife and children, payment of the pension may be made to the wife, or the pension may be supplied for the maintenance of the children.</P>
    <P>Medical treatment of pensioners is an essential feature of pension administration. The Act of 1923 did not specifically provide for such treatment. <Col N="48" /> We have now covered the treatment hitherto given, and provided for treatment to be given in the future.</P>
    <P>When a pensioner is called into hospital for treatment, powers are given in the Bill for the increase of the pension for the period in hospital.</P>
    <P>Another new provision is that covering the payment of funeral expenses of pensioners dying in hospital.  The Bill goes as far as the finances of the State will permit.  I think it solves, in a reasonable way, the problems that had to be faced, and I move the Second Reading with confidence that the House will agree in that view.</P>

      <P>If one could be astounded at anything the Minister could say and do one would be astounded at the inadequacy of his explanation of this Bill.  This is a Bill that has been promised from time to time for the last two years and six months or three years.  It is three years, practically, since we had the first promise that this Bill was in preparation, and the last statement in regard to it was that it would be necessary to withdraw the Bill and introduce two Bills in its place.</P>
      <P>I am curious to know what is the position of this Bill.  Is this Bill the one that was to be withdrawn or is it the first Bill of two Bills which were to be introduced in the place of the one that was to be withdrawn; is it the second Bill of these two or is it the Bill itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is labouring under a misapprehension. What I stated at the time was that it might be necessary to introduce two Bills instead of the one that was withdrawn, but it was found on examination that it could be provided for in the one Bill, and everything is provided for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we are to understand that this is the Bill: that this is not to be withdrawn and that there is not to be another Bill supplementing this.</P>

      <P>Quite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is the first item of definiteness that we have had in regard to the Bill for three <Col N="49" /> years.  In the first place we have not had any word from the Minister as to what he thinks might be the cost of this Bill.  I admit at once that it is impossible to make anything like an accurate estimate, but I have no doubt that during the long cogitations between the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Finance there has been some kind of a tentative estimate made as to what is likely to be the cost.  That, I think, is due to the House, and I have no doubt it will come from one or other Minister between now and the entry upon the Committee Stage.  There are a number of explanations due in regard to the Bill which I had hoped would have come from the Minister.  I think, for instance, that it should have been made clear by the Minister that there is a declining scale according to the date of service or the date of discharge or the date of death, and that the later the discharge from the Army, due to disease or wounds, the smaller the amount of gratuity and the smaller the rate of pension.  That, I think, should be justified.  It is desirable that some explanation should be given as to the reasons for that declining scale of pensions and gratuities.  I think, too, that we might have had some justification for the retention of as high a figure as 80 per cent. disablement due to disease attributable to military service before any pension is payable.  I am quite unable to understand why we should demand that a man should be 80 per cent. disabled, which is almost certainly whole disablement so far as earning a livelihood is concerned, and why no lesser amount of disablement should be admitted.  There may be a good case for it, but the Minister has not made it.  I think it is necessary to ask him to give us some explanation of that particular provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I think it is reasonable to ask the Minister whether the provision in, say, Section 13 in the Bill is intended to ensure that men who were members of the Irish Volunteers and remained members of the Irish Volunteer Force but who did not become members of the National Army and who have suffered from disablement caused by disease attributable to military service <Col N="50" /> even after the establishment of the National Army, are eligible for pensions. As I read it, this Bill is intended to make that possible.  I take it that that is deliberate; that men who were members of the Irish Volunteer Forces and remained members of the Irish Volunteers on service after April, 1922, and suffered disabilities owing to wounds or disease while on service, attributable to service, are to be eligible for pensions.  I think that it is desirable that we should have that made clear and that it is intended-Again, I find a lapse in the Bill which I thought would have been corrected. It was a lapse in the original Bill, and I think deliberate in that case, but it appears clearly to my mind to have resulted in unfair treatment and I thought would have been corrected.  I mean to say, where it can be shown that military service during the pre-Truce period, during the period from 1916 onwards, was in a women's organisation&mdash;a women's military organisation&mdash;and that similar disablement due to disease attributable to that service was entailed, that they should be treated similarly to men.  As a matter of fact, I am not sure whether we would not be doing an unconstitutional act by passing a Bill making that discrimination. I think it desirable that there should be a clear provision in the Bill which would remove all doubt on that matter.</P>
    <P>Now, there are a few details that perhaps deserve some comment, and it is desirable that they should be brought to the notice of the Minister with a view to his agreeing to introduce amendments on the Committee Stage. I find for instance, that it will pay&mdash; to treat the subject on the very lowest plane&mdash;a woman that her husband should be killed instead of being merely disabled.  For instance, a private who is wounded and is suffering one hundred per cent. disability, having a wife and four children, would have to live upon a pension of 25/- per week. If he had been killed outright the wife and children would receive 28/6 per week.  Now, that is putting a premium on suicide.  If a man was aware of that provision in the Bill, which is penalising his wife and children, he would attempt <Col N="51" /> to finish the job unless his presence of mind failed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it is putting a premium on suicide, and we are now concerned with the sphere of action of the legislature.  I hope the Minister's interjection does not mean that because he has no fear of the hereafter he puts a provision of this character in the Bill! Again, I draw attention to the difference between the rate in the 1923 Act and the rate in the proposed Bill, in respect to non-commissioned officers and men.  In the 1923 Act a single private would receive 42/- under certain circumstances, but, in identical circumstances, under the new Bill, he would receive 20/-.  That is a very great discrimination, and it appears difficult to justify.  I do not know what the principle at work is, whether it is intended as a suitable reward for men who gave service in special circumstances, and whether those, special circumstances pre-Truce were regarded as something more deserving of monetary reward than service post-Truce, or whether there is some kind of special sentimental preference given.  I do not know. I think it is necessary for the Minister to explain what principle is in operation, and what is determining this gradually descending scale, according to the service, quite apart from what he describes as the peace period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new scale in the Bill a private who has been totally disabled will receive a pension of 20/- weekly, or, if he is married, 25/-.  With young children that is an inadequate sum.  It will involve, in towns, the necessity of the mother of the children going out to work.  Consequently, it means detriment to the children, and in the case of a totally disabled husband, it will probably be detrimental to him also.  I think that quite apart from the question of the rate there should be provision made, if we are to accept the principle of pension for total disablement, for continuing it in respect of children. <Col N="52" /> The dropping out of that provision is, I think, not defensible.  If it is defensible it is due to the House that a defence should be made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I find a provision regarding the maximum gratuity, fixing a lump sum payable in case of death and disease, or death while in receipt of a pension on account of disease or wounds.  It seems to me that an analogy has been made with the workmen's compensation provisions, and that this £300 lump sum provision has been possibly suggested by that analogy.  It may not have come to the knowledge of the Minister and his advisers in this matter, but it is correct to say that the whole tendency in respect of workmen's compensation provisions and legislation, both in Great Britain and according to the report of the recent Commission, is against the provision of lump sums for the very clear and valid reason that people who are not in the habit of handling large sums of money seldom &mdash;I was going to say very infrequently &mdash;make the best use of it.</P>
    <P>One has come across many cases during the last few years where provision has been made by lump sum grants from one fund or another where the parties entered a little business.  They opened a shop, entirely inexperienced, unfitted either on the buying or the selling side, and after two or three years the whole of the provision is gone and they are again looking for help.  I think that provision should be substituted by one to continue payments in respect of children.  It is an undesirable principle, except you have exceptional circumstances and a valid reason, to pay a lump sum instead of a yearly, monthly or weekly payment.  I think the normal procedure should be a provision continuing payments, particularly where children are concerned.  I know that involves a continuing organisation, but there is no reason to expect that something in the nature of an Army organisation will not continue. I think it is not a difficult thing to adjust the scheme to cover continuing pensions or allowances for women and children.  I hope that particular provision will be reconsidered because, as it is, it is liable to do much less good than a continuing payment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> I have spoken about the question of the 80 per cent. disability.  Let it be borne in mind that the onus of proof that disability was contracted owing to service is upon the soldier.  That imposes a very great strain upon the power of the soldier to produce evidence. You are imposing all kinds of obligations on the soldier.  You are making it difficult for him to get a pension under that provision, and it seems to me that where such difficulties are placed in the way there is really no good reason why you should not reduce the degree of disability, so that pensions may be payable on a lower scale where the lower degree of disability is due to disease contracted owing to service.  I find, too, some difficulty regarding the Army Pensions Board. The Army Pensions Board was not specifically mentioned in the 1923 Act, but I think I am right in saying that it was set up under regulation.</P>

I gathered from the Minister's interjection that the intention now is to give that Board statutory authority&mdash;that it was only made under regulation as an Advisory Board, but that this Bill is giving it statutory authority in respect to the last Act.  Is that the position?</P>

      <P>I see.  There are what seem to be omissions in the Bill to which I hope the Minister will give some attention.  The terms are: &ldquo; disease attributable to service &rdquo;; &ldquo;death due to wounds.&rdquo;  But there are a number of cases that one has come across which to my mind are clearly cases which should come under one or other of these Acts, and yet are not clearly provided for in the Bill.  I <Col N="54" /> have come across cases, for instant of men driving an army lorry who were in a collision and suffered disability, and I think in one case death.  But disability due to accident has not been covered by the Act, and is not covered by this Bill.  Cases of the death of soldiers owing to accidental shooting by their comrades who were unqualified to handle guns do not seem to be covered by this Bill and surely should be if any are to be covered.</P>

      <P>I know of a case where a man who had been in regular employment for years, never in difficulty, and, so far as I know, having no family tendency towards insanity, owing to certain ambushes and bomb explosions during his service had been driven insane and died.  Whether that could be classed as a disease owing to army service is not clear.  Any ordinary layman might think that it would be, but it has been held not to have been attributable to service, and therefore no pension has been granted. Other cases that one might quote do not seem to be covered by this Bill, and yet one would imagine they were intended to be covered by any amending Bill.  Therefore, it seems to me that the Bill will require to be very closely examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the whole scheme of the Bill and its drafting.  I want to know whether it is the intention of the Minister to produce anything in the way of an explanatory statement for the information of soldiers.  I do not know how many Deputies have tried to read and understand this Bill.  I have, and I have tried to get expert assistance. The expert assistance has enabled me to get a certain &ldquo;line&rdquo; on the Bill, as one might say, to understand something of the results of the Bill, but it is impossible to understand what principle is at work in the building up of the Bill.  A very small matter that would not affect the law, but certainly would affect the reader, is the whole manner of explanation&mdash;these side-headings do not explain at all. &ldquo;Wound pensions and gratuities in certain other cases&rdquo;; &ldquo;Gratuities to dependents <Col N="55" /> in certain cases.&rdquo;  There is no guidance in these indices at all, and I would ask the Minister if he would endeavour to produce a revised version of this Bill for the easier understanding of Deputies and the public.</P>
    <P>I turn, for instance, to Section 11, sub-section (5), and I read: &ldquo;In the case of a person who at the date of his discharge from the Forces is suffering from any of the disablements mentioned in the first column of the Fourth Schedule to this Act, the degree of such person's disablement for the purposes of this section shall be the degree set out in the second column.&rdquo; Although attention has been called to this defect, no notice has been taken of it.  The first column referred to has the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and these are supposed to be the list of disablements.  It is quite impossible to understand in that form.  In the same Schedule one sees opposite, &ldquo;degree of disablement&mdash;3,&rdquo;&ldquo;amputation of leg at hip, or below hip, etc.&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; What is meant by the blank?  Is there no proportion corresponding to the degree of disablement where it is a case of the amputation of a leg or hip?  Apparently not.  Then there is a very curious provision in this Schedule: &ldquo;Loss of one eye, result of G.S.W.&rdquo;  I wonder does that mean loss of one eye due to a Great Swill of Whiskey?</P>

I want to put to the Minister two or three questions <Col N="56" /> which are typical and will, perhaps, help us to understand, if answered correctly or lucidly, what is meant by certain sections of the Bill.  The first is: What gratuity would be payable to a soldier wounded before the 1st October, 1923, but suffering from a 15 per cent. disability only, and retained in the Army until after 1st October, 1924? If he were discharged before October, 1924, he would get up to about £40, but supposing he were not discharged until after October, 1924, would he get anything and what would he get?</P>
      <P>The second question is: When would the payment of pensions commence in the case of a widow and children of a man killed while in the Army, between October, 1923, and October, 1924?  Perhaps if the Minister will refer to Section 15 (1a) he might be able to answer and to tell whether it is intended that from the date of the death of the soldier the pensions would be payable.  The third question is what pension is payable to the dependents of a man wounded, say, in January, 1924, but who did not die until June, 1926? It appears, as I read the Bill, that if he were discharged before 1st October, 1924, his widow would receive 17/6 per week, but if he were wounded on the same day, but were not discharged until November 1st, or even 1st October, 1924, and died in June, 1926, his widow would only receive 12/6; that is to say, the difference between schedule 6 and schedule 7.  There you have an apparent anomaly.  The two soldiers are wounded in the same action on the same day. They live for nearly four years, and they die in the same month, but for one reason or another they were not discharged on the same date from the Army.  If a man were discharged on 30th September, 1924, it appears to me his widow would receive 17/6 per week pension, but if his friend and comrade, wounded on the same date, were not discharged until 1st October, there would be a difference of 5/- per week in the pension.  That is hardly understandable, if it were intended, and if it were not intended it surely requires correction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does tend, I think, and successfully in many cases, to meet what are legitimate claims for pensions or gratuities due to service in the Army. <Col N="57" /> I think it will require a good deal of examination and a good deal more explanation than has even been hinted at by the Minister.  It is a Bill that is very difficult to read and I hope that the introductory statement of the Minister was only intended to lead on Deputies to make queries, and that he really intended to do what other Ministers have done in the past&mdash;make the Second Reading speech at the close of the discussion.  I anticipate that the Minister will make a really exhaustive explanation and examination of the Bill for the benefit of Deputies and the public outside.  If he does not intend to make that exhaustive explanation at this stage of the Bill I want to know whether it is his intention to introduce a guide to the Bill, to publish it and to make clear for the inquirer what is intended to be done by the Government in introducing this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, if he has an hour or two to spare, to call up fifty men who have served in the Army and, with the aid of some of his Army tutors, to go through this Bill and examine them, clause after clause, page after page, and to see how many months it would take them to pass even an elementary examination in the meaning of the Bill.  I think it would be a very difficult thing for the ordinary soldier to understand the Bill and what is being provided for him.  I suggest to the Minister that he should tell us whether it is his intention to publish something in the nature of a clear explanation of the Bill for the ordinary man in the street, so that he shall know what is intended to be done on his behalf.  I hope that I am right in my surmise that the Minister has the intention of really explaining the Bill before the close of the discussion, and that he will touch on some of the points I have raised and give explanations as to why certain elements continue to be omitted and why certain others have been included.</P>
    <P>I am going to support the Second Reading because I believe that the principle of pensions for diseases or wounds, clearly attributable to Army service, entails upon us a responsibility for the soldier and his dependents.  I am not one who believes that because a man <Col N="58" /> gives service in the national forces at any time, he must have a permanent call upon the nation's finances, but where men, through their services, have become incapable of earning a livelihood, I think they have a right to call upon the national bounty.  Therefore, on these grounds I support the Second Reading, and I hope the Minister will let the public understand what he intends by the Bill.</P>

      <P>I also desire to point out that in the matter of disability due to disease, in so far as it is dealt with under the Bill, the Bill only makes provision for the grant of a pension to a person who is disabled to the extent of 80 per cent. I think that the Minister has not made any case as to why there should be a stoppage at 80 per cent., and he would want to make a very strong case for it.  Take the case of a Commandant, whose pay is £365 a year, who is disabled to the extent of 80 per cent.  Under the present terms of the Bill he would be entitled to a pension of £175 14s. 0d., and, in the case of a married man, to £20 additional. A man disabled to the extent of 80 per cent. would be entitled to a pension of £195 14s. 0d. a year, but if he was disabled to any fraction less than 80 per cent., not only does he get no pension, but there is no provision for granting a gratuity.  As between a pension of almost £200 a year and nothing, there is certainly no reasonable tailing-off as the Bill is drafted. So far as the percentage of disability entitling a person to pension is concerned, a case requires to be made for 80 per cent., and, in my opinion, the percentage should be very much lower. There is this particular difference between disability due to disease and disability due to a wound, namely, that in many cases the wound is quite a clear cut thing and does not react on general health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person, for instance, who has lost a left arm below the elbow will be regarded as 50 per cent. disabled under the Act of 1923, and will be entitled to a pension, but a person who is disabled to the extent of 50 per cent. as a result of disease is in a much worse position than a person who is 50 per cent. disabled <Col N="59" /> because of a clean wound which will not necessarily react on his general health.  50 per cent. of disability due to disease may easily become aggravated. Whereas a man who is wounded is given a pension under the Army Pensions Act of 1923, there is no provision at all in the case of such a man under the present Bill.  Like Deputy Johnson, I have had some difficulty in regard to the general aspect of the Bill, but, taking a rule and set-square attitude, it does not seem that the Bill could be much improved in the matter of drafting.  What seems to be wrong is that there is a certain amount of overlapping.  When I came to the point where it is laid down that a person could not get anything if he had less than 80 per cent. disability, I thought that there was a page left out of the Bill, and my reading of it was much disturbed as a consequence.</P>
    <P>There are certain clauses in the Bill by which a person who was wounded or disabled as a result of disease before the 1st of October, 1924, will get different compensation according as he was discharged before or after that date. I do not think it reasonable that a person who suffers from disability contracted before the formation of the forces should be discriminated against because he was discharged subsequent to the formation of the forces.  A case may be made for reducing&mdash;as a matter of fact, reduction only comes about in the lower ranks&mdash;but a case may be made out for reducing pensions in the case of disability occurring to persons after the establishment of the forces, but, even if that case could be made out, it ought not to be used to discriminate against persons disabled before the establishment of the forces. For instance, a lieutenant, whose pay is ten shillings a day, as a result of the change in this matter, may, under one arrangement, be entitled to a pension of £87 12s. 0d. plus £12 marriage allowance, whereas, if he was paid on what he would be entitled to for being discharged before the 1st of October, 1924, he would be entitled to a pension of £160 0s. 0d. plus £20 0s. 0d. marriage allowance.  The difference in the case <Col N="60" /> of a captain would be as between £122 12s. 0d. and £160 0s. 0d.</P>
    <P>I think an examination of that position by the Minister would result in that particular type of injustice not being done, because I consider it an injustice.  Another matter to which I would like to draw attention is that under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, it is provided in Section 8, sub-section (1):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If a person to whom a military service pension is payable under this Act shall at any time during the continuance of such pension be in receipt of any remuneration, pension or allowance payable out of public monies provided by the Oireachtas, the military service pension payable to such person under this Act shall be suspended to an extent calculated according to the provisions contained in the Third Schedule to this Act while he is in receipt of such remuneration, pension, or allowance as aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It means that if a person entitled to a military service pension is employed in the Civil Service, the amount of money coming to him as military service pension is reduced on a sliding scale according to the salary he receives from the Civil Service.  In the same manner, if a person was entitled to a wound pension under the Act of 1923, and was in receipt of that pension out of public monies, his military service pension is reduced in the same way.  I feel that it was never intended when the Military Service Pensions Act was being passed that monies paid to wounded officers or men would be regarded in the same way as monies paid as a result of being given employment in the Civil Service or any other way.  I would like to have it considered whether a change should not now be made so that a deduction shall not be made from the military service pension because a man also draws a wound pension.  I know there will be a difficulty in dealing with that particular matter in the present Bill, because it would amount to an amendment of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924.</P>
    <P>I think in dealing with cases such as we are dealing with now, where we <Col N="61" /> propose under the Bill to give a man a pension because of disability due to disease, the granting of that pension should not be regarded as payment out of public monies for the purposes of Section 8 (1) of the Military Service Act, 1924.  In Part II., Schedule 3, in the matter of rates for soldiers, it is suggested that if a sergeant, corporal, or private is promoted to a higher rank and meets with an injury in that higher rank, less than six months after his promotion, his pension will be according to the rank from which he was promoted.  If a man meets with an accident on higher duties, even within six months after his promotion, his pension ought to be at the rate of the higher duties which involved him in that accident.  There is another very important point in the Bill in Clause 9 (3).  As at present drafted, pensions in respect of disability due to disease will not be payable in any case until after the date of the passing of the Bill.  It contemplates that there are cases arising out of the years 1922, 1923 and 1924, and, perhaps, some cases going back before that.  In view of the delay in bringing forward this Bill, whatever may be the reasons for it, it seems to me very unfair that a person who can prove that he was disabled so long ago as 1923 and has suffered serious disablement since, as a result of military service, should be deprived of the compensation that will be regarded as due to him under this Bill for a period of three or four years, simply because there has been a delay in dealing with the matter here, because of the difficulties which arose.  That is another point in connection with the Bill which requires to be very carefully considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Johnson has said, this Bill has been under Ministerial consideration for a very prolonged period.  Whenever I see a hen sitting for two years on an egg I know that the egg is addled, and whenever I see a Minister sitting for two years on a Bill I have a very strong suspicion that the same will be the case. I am not quite sure that the reception that this Bill has met with does not bear me out.  I do not know if the Minister expected to have shouts of <Col N="62" /> gratitude for his generosity, but he certainly has not received them.  What is the purpose of this Bill?  I think the Minister defined it in these words: &ldquo;To ameliorate in some manner the sufferings of those who are not able to provide for themselves,&rdquo; and he very wisely put in three words&mdash;&ldquo;in some manner.&rdquo;  It all depends upon our views as to what manner this Bill will alleviate the sufferings of those who are not able to provide for themselves how we shall form our judgment on it and vote on it.  But that generally does not carry us far enough; we must go a little deeper.  What is the purpose of the Bill?  Is it only to get the Government out of an awkward corner?  Is it only to occupy our time in a discussion so that the ex-National Army man may think that something is being done for him, or is it a real effort to help him, is it a real effort to satisfy him?  If it is the latter I cannot feel that it will fulfil its object.  I am not going into the criticisms, forcible and cogent as they were, which Deputy Risteard O Maolchatha and Deputy Johnson put before the House.  I want to approach the Bill from another angle and to look at the machinery by means of which a man suffering from disability would obtain his pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must bear in mind in the first instance that these men are suffering from a sense of grievance, rightly or wrongly, because they think this matter has been postponed too long.  Many of them have been through very considerable hardships owing to the disabilities they contracted in the National Army. They do not approach the machinery of the Bill in a spirit of gratitude; they approach it in the spirit of men who expect something will be done for them. What do they find that this Bill will do for them?  Their claims come before an Army Pensions Board, and that Board is appointed by the Minister for Defence, in two cases, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  The Board is removable at will, without any reason being given, by the Minister for Defence.  It is a tribunal&mdash;I do not want to put it too strongly&mdash;entirely dependent on the Minister for Defence, who chooses the members and who can remove them and substitute others at <Col N="63" /> any moment that he thinks fit.  From this tribunal, dependent entirely on the Minister for Defence, there is no appeal of any kind whatever.  I have a little knowledge&mdash;not as much as I would like to have&mdash;of the British War Pensions Acts.  They are very numerous, and they do provide for an independent appeal from the first Pension Board.</P>
    <P>This has been of very substantial benefit to claimants for pensions, because it is an appeal to an independent tribunal, and in from twenty-five to forty per cent. of cases&mdash;it varies in different localities&mdash;the finding of the first Board has been overruled to the advantage of the applicant and claimant for the pension.  There is no possibility of that happening here.  But the situation is even worse.  Even though there is no appeal and though the members of the Board are dependent on the Minister, I have sufficient knowledge of and respect for the medical profession to know that they will do their duty in an impartial spirit. But they will not be allowed to do their duty according to their own spirit. They are tied down, in the case of disability owing to illness, by the 80 per cent. stipulation; they are tied down in the case of disability owing to wounds by a most complete and drastic schedule.  They are tied tighter by this schedule than a woman was when laced in by her stays in the days when they were worn.  It is impossible to test disability from that point of view, simply laying down the injury and pointing out the amount of disability that it causes, because it does not take into account the circumstances of the individual.</P>
    <P>It is a great misfortune to any man to lose a leg, but it is a much greater misfortune for a ploughman or a postman than it is for a clerk.  A ploughman or a postman, a man with little education, finds it far harder to find employment, far harder to earn any sort of substitute living, than a man of education, a man with a knowledge of clerical work, a man with a profession, does.  The same applies to rheumatism. The man who contracts rheumatism can carry on pretty well with it if he is working in an office, but if <Col N="64" /> he is a farm worker, exposed to the weather at all seasons, he cannot carry on business.  Yet the Schedules of this Bill make no difference between the outdoor worker and the indoor worker; they bind the man down to the precise degree of disability.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that in its present form this Bill raises false hopes, that it is a Bill which will raise in many people's minds the hope that they will obtain pensions, because the public outside do not read Bills in detail.  They certainly could not understand this Bill if they did.  I have not been able to understand all the aspects of it, and, like Deputy Johnson, I sought expert advice, but I have heard nothing from that source yet.  Certainly the ordinary discharged soldier will not understand this Bill.  He will only have the hope: &ldquo;They are going to give us a pension at last&rdquo;; he will go around spending time and money in getting certificates from his officers, medical certificates, and so on, and at the end he will find the Medical Board saying to him: &ldquo;We are very sorry; you do not come within the four corners of the Act.&rdquo; Honestly, if this is the best the Minister can do, I believe it would be almost better for him to say, as he said in his speech, that it is beyond the country's natural resources to compensate for all sacrifices.  That would at least prevent the raising of false hopes.  But I do not believe this is the best that the Minister can do, and I am certain it is not the best that the Dáil can do.  I am certain that the Bill is capable of very drastic amendment, and if I give my vote for the Second Reading it will only be a vote in favour of amending the Act of 1923 to provide for disability due to illness, and that it does not commit me in any degree to the machinery proposed in this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every Deputy has been looking forward for a long time, with considerable anxiety, to this amending Bill.  It has been delayed from time to time and one began to think it would not appear at all.  It has come at last and it is welcomed by no Deputies more than by those who live in what used to be a great military centre.  There, more or less every day, <Col N="65" /> cases of hardship are brought to notice, cases that were turned down by the Board, and cases that, to the ordinary mind, seemed cases of cruel hardship. In many instances it was evident that the disabilities did not come within Acts that were then in force.  Now we are all looking forward to this amending Bill.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Johnson and Deputy Cooper have said, it is a very complicated measure and requires a very astute mind to understand all the things connected with it.  All one can do is to hope for the best; to hope that before the measure leaves the Dáil it will be put in a form so that we will be able to understand it, and so that people outside who have to apply for pensions will be able to understand it. In fact, it is to be hoped that a sort of explanatory book will be issued in regard to certain particulars that are too deep for the ordinary mind to fathom.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see the measure is wide in some respects; that there are certain terms used that give one to hope that cases hitherto excluded from the Pensions Acts will be brought in.  I have come across cases, cruel, hard cases, that do not come within the present measure.  I have come across cases, not of wounds, but worse than wounds&mdash;cases of insanity and complete loss of mental power.  These cases have been turned down.  I have also come across cases of creeping paralysis, cases that have been developing for a long time, and yet these cases have been turned down.  I have seen cases of tuberculosis, too.  I remember the case of a man during my last election campaign, four years ago.  He was then dying of tuberculosis, and to the ordinary mind it seemed absolutely clear that the disease was contracted on military service.  This man had a very large family, and he had nothing to support them with.  His case was turned down and I never could understand why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These things have given rise&mdash;and rightly&mdash;to a great deal of dissatisfaction. People do not see why they should risk their lives giving service to the country if their claims are turned down in this way.  There has not been sufficient attention given to these <Col N="66" /> cases.  There has not been sufficient liberality shown in the manipulation of the awards.</P>
    <P>The British, with all their faults, have not acted in that way.  The other day, in an article I read, I noticed that out of 67,000 cases of pensions that were awarded by the British 13,000 were cases that had not developed while the men were on active service. They were cases of shell-shock and mental disturbance.  I have known a lot of those cases&mdash;men who have gone through four years of warfare without a scratch and who have suddenly broken down mentally.  Can there be anything more cruel than that? Wounds are very bad, no doubt, but to be mentally disabled, hopelessly laid aside for the rest of your life, is very much worse.  I think nothing could be more cruel than that.</P>
    <P>I think in the previous Act too much stress has been laid upon wounds. There are other things quite as bad both for the suffering person and the dependents of that person.  In many cases people have to look for a living from men so disabled.  I hope that this measure will take these cases into account; that it will take cases such as I have referred to within its ambit.  If it does not, I am quite certain that a great many people who are waiting patiently for justice to be done them under this new measure will be frightfully dissatisfied.  Quite properly will they be dissatisfied, because when a man risks his life in the service of his country he has a right to expect that he shall not have, at any rate, to spend the remainder of his life in beggary or shall not have to be supported by his relatives who, in many cases, can hardly support themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson alluded to gratuities and he argued that they were unwise. I agree and I think more care should be exercised in giving them.  I have known a great many cases in which gratuities were given, and they simply meant the destruction of the man because he spent the money all at once and was left stranded.  It would have been far better to give him a small pension.  That would have been a help. If the man were unable to work it would have helped him considerably <Col N="67" /> and he would have had something to fall back on.  Except in exceptional cases gratuities are a great mistake.</P>
    <P>As regards the financial aspect of the measure, I think the percentages ought to be altered in many cases.  Considering the liabilities of the country, I think it is a fair attempt to give as good a pension as the country can afford.  There are many things to be done and it is necessary for every Government to be just before it is generous and to make the money go as far as possible.  I think that amounts allowed should be such that they will afford a decent living or be a substantial help towards a decent living.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I would like to make clear.  There were several cases of young people who got pensions for life and I have grave doubts as to the wisdom of giving these pensions.  Two or three young men to whom life pensions were granted have come to me and asked me whether if they worked they would lose the pension.  They got the pensions for life and they have not been doing any work because they were afraid of losing the pension.  That seems to be a very wrong state of affairs.  In contrast with those cases you have the mental cases I have alluded to&mdash;cases of acute paralysis&mdash; in which nothing has been given.  In these other cases men have been granted pensions for life.  Many of them are young men who could get employment.  That is a state of affairs that ought to be remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you quite sure these young men were able to get work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of a certain kind. I do not mean hard work, but they would be able to do a certain amount of work suitable to the condition they were in.  I do not mean labouring work.  That is a thing that ought to be made clear&mdash;that they should not be liable to lose their pensions.  If they get life pensions it should be definitely indicated they are life pensions.  I think it would have been better in a good many cases to have awarded pensions for a certain time.  Instead of <Col N="68" /> that pensions were given to men who, to my mind, were much too young to be given life pensions.  Other cases of a much worse kind have been omitted altogether.</P>
      <P>I hope the Bill before it leaves the Dáil will be improved.  The financial points will be dealt with by others who speak with more authority than I do, and I have no doubt they will be gone into very thoroughly, so that I hope the Bill will be made a good one.  It is looked forward to, and if it is not up to expectation there will be great disappointment.</P>
      <P>I hope in this matter we will not follow the example of the British, of years past, when it was said they allowed their soldiers to die in the workhouses. I hope that will never be said in the Free State, and that men who have given their services and their lives for the country will not be compelled to end their days, as happened in former years, under poor law relief, and that, at any rate, we shall set a better example in that respect than the country across the water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>It was as a result of the action in this House of Deputies in all quarters bringing forward the grievances of ex-army men that this Bill was introduced.  I brought forward a number of cases, as did other Deputies, but so far as I can judge of this Bill, many of the cases that I brought forward are not dealt with.  The last case I mentioned in this House was that of a soldier of a cycling battalion who, when cycling to the memorial service for the Griffith and Collins anniversary, fell and was killed on the roadside.  His dependents were informed that they were not entitled to any compensation, and I do not see that such a case is provided for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also brought forward a case in which a young man lost his leg, and when he applied for compensation he was informed that as he used firearms contrary to the Regulations he was not entitled to any compensation. He was in uniform and was told a raid was expected in the Department of which he was one of the guards.  He took up a loaded rifle, and it went off.  As a result this young man lost his leg and <Col N="69" /> has not received a penny compensation from that day to this.  Another case I brought to the notice of the Minister was that of a young man engaged in cleaning operations in barracks.  It had been the custom in the barrack to destroy all ordinary refuse in a big iron bin attached to the wall.  It became overfull on this occasion and some young man apparently splinkled it with petrol, threw a match into it, so that the refuse was burned away.  But before the sheet iron lid which covered this bin had time to cool, this particular young man, who was about to empty a bucket into it, made an effort to lift the lid which was red hot.  The result was that it fell upon his ankle, causing such injury that the young man lost the limb.  That young man has not got a penny piece from that day to this. He was provided with an artificial limb by the White Cross Society after he was refused compensation by the authorities.</P>
    <P>Then there was the case of a young man who was badly injured while driving a motor car.  In this particular instance I believe an attack was made on the motor car, and the glass of the wind-screen of the car was damaged and a piece of it struck the young man on the head.  Shortly afterwards he was transferred to a mental home, and he is in that mental home at the present moment.  At the time I am speaking of, about twelve months ago&mdash;I cannot say what has occurred since&mdash;his wife came to me to ask me to recommend herself and her family to the relieving officer for poor law relief.  The State ought to see to this case, and if there is no provision in the new Bill to deal with it, some provision ought to be made for this class of case.  Great numbers of people are anxiously looking forward to this Bill.  Only three months ago the mother of a young ex-Army man came to me and presented a card, which was familiar to many Deputies in the days gone by, asking for my support in order to make representations to the Hospital for Incurables. She wanted to get her son into that hospital.  Her soldier son was an absolute wreck.  It was a case of neurasthenia, caused, I think, by service in the Wireless Department of the Army.  The unfortunate mother had the invalid on <Col N="70" /> her hands for two years, and no department or Government board would give that poor woman one penny towards the upkeep of the son who was made a wreck as the result of his service in the Army.  I do not see that type of case provided for in the Bill, and there were many other cases of young men going up and down the country, sleeping in hay barns and wet blankets, and compelled to go for days together without any change of clothing, and they claim that tuberculosis has resulted.  Such cases as those when they come before the Pension Board should be sympathetically considered.</P>
    <P>Now I find fault with the Department of Defence generally in not giving representation on these boards to the men affected.  You have an ex-National Army Officers' Association, as well as various other associations, looking after ex-soldiers.  These organisations have no representation whatever on these boards to enable them to put forward the cases of men who had been injured or wounded.  The Board is appointed by the Minister and can be removed by him.  I have heard of a case myself of a board that sat on one occasion.  The board consisted of only one doctor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">

      <P>This was a case that was brought to my notice six or eight months ago.  I was informed by the young man that there was only one doctor present at the time.  I think that no board ought to be composed of less than three persons.  I hold, too, that the organisations of the ex-National Army men, and other soldiers' organisations, should have representation on these boards for the purpose of being able to state cases on behalf of their members.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Wolfe has a true conception of the basis of this Bill.  He said that it was a case of hoping for the best.  A good many people have been hoping for the best for the past three years, and the best that the Government has been able to present them with now, after all the criticism that this matter has been subjected to, is the present very bedraggled <Col N="71" /> Bill.  My approach to the Bill will not be on the line of general criticism.  I propose to address myself to a few definite and particular cases that will require a very clear and explicit definition of some of the terms in the Bill.  Many people have been hoping for a long time that their cases would get consideration&mdash;the consideration that every party in the nation agree that they deserve to get. I intend now to put forward one of these cases.  I intend to give the cold facts of this case, as I cannot satisfy myself that there are any provisions in the Bill to deal with it, and it resolves itself more or less into a matter of definitions.  It is the case of a young man who was a County Inspector's clerk in the R.I.C. and who was an agent for the I.R.A. within the R.I.C. As matters became too hot for him in the R.I.C. he went and joined the flying column of a brigade that was active in a particular county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will read the particulars as given by a high officer in the Army, who knows the merits of the particular case that I refer to, and who, as a very well qualified and capable soldier himself, can say what a capable soldier the man that I refer to was.  He says in this statement that the man I refer to served for some time with so and so column, having been previously appointed Brigade Police Officer.  Some time in June, 1921, he was one of a party of ten Volunteers who were surprised by a party of R.I.C.  This little column that the man I refer to belonged to had already, that day, another fight with a party of R.I.C.  At the time of the second encounter the men composing it were absolutely worn out from marching and fighting.  Only this man and the column commander, now the O.C. of a certain battalion, were able to offer any effective resistance, and they covered the retreat of the others, falling back and fighting every inch of the way.  The day was terribly warm, and this man was for some time showing signs of distress, but even when instructed to get away, refused to do so.  He kept on fighting until his pursuers were beaten off, and immediately after he collapsed at his post <Col N="72" /> and died from exhaustion.  He died with a rifle in his hand and with almost his last cartridge fired.</P>
    <P>That man's dependants applied for compensation under the Army Pension Act of 1923.  They were told that within the four corners of that Act there was no power to grant them compensation because the man did not die from wounds.  I am endeavouring to find out how this Bill, if it becomes an Act, will apply to that particular case. I find in the Bill that &ldquo;the word &lsquo;killed&rsquo; when used in the principal Act, or in this Act, shall include, and when used in the principal Act, shall be deemed always to have included death by drowning.&rdquo;  I find that the word &ldquo;disablement&rdquo; means &ldquo;any injury of a permanent nature resulting in impairment of function caused by wounds or disease.&rdquo;  I do not think it can be questioned that such a man as I have referred to did die actually in the service of his country, as much as if a bullet had been put through his heart or brain.  The testimony that I have offered proves that clearly.  I should like to hear from the Minister what provision is made for such a case as this if it is only in the case of death from wounds it is proposed to give a pension or gratuity.  Is that a proper way to treat that case?  If he had remained in the R.I.C. he would probably be alive to-day and receiving a pension.  Is this country going to treat less fairly the men who made sacrifices to place it in the position of having a Government of its own than a foreign Government treated the members of the army of occupation which it had in this country?  I would like if the Minister would tell us something on the matter.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I am surprised no Deputy has touched on so far with reference to this Bill.  There was a section of men who, to my mind, gave the greatest exhibition of courage that has been given by any section of men in the fight for the national independence of this country.  I refer to the Connaught Rangers in India.  There is not one word about looking after these men in this Bill.  These are the only two cases that I would ask the Minister to give us some information <Col N="73" /> on.  With the other examinations of the Bill I am in thorough agreement, particularly with the point made by Deputy Mulcahy against the operation of sub-section (3), Section 9.  These are matters I think the Minister did not make a case for, and I should like that he would do so.  I should like him to tell us whether within the definitions and terms of this Bill the cases that I have quoted can be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his opening remarks, stated that it was necessary to cut our cloth according to our measure.  While that may be so to a certain extent, I think the Minister has been particularly penurious in the amount of the financial contribution which he proposes the State should make to those people who made sacrifices of life or of health on behalf of the State.  In the case of a private soldier totally disabled who has a wife and four young children the maximum pension that he will obtain under the Bill will be 25/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is 25/- a week for a man who is totally disabled and unable to follow his normal occupation, who has a wife and four children dependent on him? Let us assume that that man was in good circumstances before he joined the Army, and paid 10/- or 12/- a week for a house which he occupied for a considerable time.  He comes back from the Army totally disabled, and is still under the liability of 10/- or 12/- weekly for the house.  Out of the pension which the Minister puts at 25/-, that man has from 13/- to 15/- a week left to maintain himself, his wife and four children.  Might I address this question to the Minister: How does he think that man can feed himself, his wife and children and discharge his responsibilities as a citizen on an allowance of from 13/- to 15/- a week.  How could he do so in the City of Dublin to-day? I venture to say that it is a physical impossibility.  Remember, the man is totally disabled, and very likely will never get beyond that stage, so that the future before him is one of endeavouring to maintain himself, his wife and children on a miserable pension of 25/- a week.  The very fact of having to endeavour to subsist on that inadequate weekly pension is enough to prevent a <Col N="74" /> man making the slightest recovery from his disability.</P>
    <P>In the case of death from disease, it is provided that a lump sum of £300 shall be given.  Deputy Johnson has pointed out that it is very easy for people who are unaccustomed to dealing with large sums of money, and who are not very provident, to dissipate £300 very quickly.  Then, without any weekly pension and without any means of maintaining the children, in the course of time they become candidates for admission to a county home.  As the Workmen's Compensation Departmental Committee recommended the idea of a final lump sum payment should be got away from.  The tendency should be to pay a weekly contribution in respect of young children, so as to ensure that the children of a deceased soldier shall not have to enter a county home.  There should be a weekly income so as to keep the children in the state of comfort that they would enjoy if their breadwinner was alive.</P>
    <P>In the case of pensions for disease it is necessary, as Deputies have pointed out, to be 80 per cent. disabled in order to get any pension.  In other words, it is necessary to be four-fifths disabled from the normal capacity to earn a livelihood before any pension is granted.  I put it to the Minister that that is an unreasonably high percentage. I put it to him that 80 per cent. is altogether too high a standard to set in the case of such a pension.  The minimum standard ought to be very much lower than 80 per cent.  From time to time Deputies have brought cases such as have been outlined by Deputy Byrne and Deputy Hogan before Ministers.  Deputies of all parties believed that the new Pensions Bill would cover these cases.  Apparently it will not.  I would suggest to the Minister, in view of the general demands made in the House and the cases mentioned, that they should be covered on the Committee Stage.  He should arrange by then to extend the scope of the Bill so as to include them.  It has been very fashionable lately for Ministers to tell electors that the country is progressing and that everything is going well with the State.  That <Col N="75" /> does not fit in with the miserable pensions it is proposed to pay under this Bill.  If Ministers are going to be consistent let us have some evidence of the prosperity and of the brightness and improved conditions they talk about.  I must confess that the attitude taken up in this Bill is not such as should be taken to provide pensions for those who have served the State, and who, in an endeavour to do so, sacrificed life and limb.</P>

      <P>I am not going to recite the detailed particulars of cases that have come under my notice.  They have been submitted to the Department of Defence and turned down.  In the ordinary course it was expected that they would be dealt with under an amending Bill.  I want to endeavour to ascertain from the Minister some definite statement as to the method in which the Bill is going to be administered. I think most of us know that the administration of the Army Pensions Act has been very slow.  I am not sure if I am correct in stating that only about half the applications have yet gone through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>When replying the Minister can deal with that.  I take the view that if this House in its wisdom&mdash;as it did some time ago&mdash;thought fit to bring in a measure to give pensions to men who gave good service to the State in pre-Truce days, and subsequently in the National Army, but who suffered no physical disability, there is a far greated obligation on the taxpayers and the Government in office at present to make reasonable and generous provision for the dependents of those who died in the service of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will cite one case of a man about whom I receive communications monthly.  Similar communications were addressed to the Minister for Defence, without effect.  This man joined the Irish Republican Army in 1915, and subsequently joined the National Army in 1922.  He contracted rheumatism as a result of which he died in the service on 5th January, 1924.  He leaves a wife <Col N="76" /> and two children, one of whom was born five months after his death.  I brought this case under the notice of the President when he was Minister for Defence, informing him that, subsequent to the death of the breadwinner, the wife and children were actually dependent on assistance that they got from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. At the time the President forwarded a grant of £30 from the Dáil's special fund.  In the letter dated 29th August, 1924, it was stated that it was intended to introduce legislation the next year amending the Army Pensions Act in certain respects, and that it might be possible under the amended Act to give the claim further consideration.  That is two years and five months ago, but, as far as I know, the widow and children are still dependent on the assistance of the Society of the St. Vincent de Paul.  I can give the Minister the name and reference number.  The particulars are already in his Department.</P>
    <P>Assuming that this Bill passes in the course of the next couple of months, how long does the Minister intend to wait before the Board is set up?  How long will it be before a case of that kind is dealt with?  I take it this is not an exceptional case.  It might not be by any means the worst kind of case that the Minister ever came across.  But I do say that if the administration of this Act, when passed, is as slow as that of the Army Pensions Act, it will be some considerable time before this woman may hope to get anything out of it.  I could go on citing cases in the same way as Deputy Byrne has done, but I will not take up the time of the Dáil. I would, however, urge on the Minister that when this Bill becomes law&mdash;and I hope it will be amended in many ways before it does&mdash;he should regard it as his duty to get the Board working immediately in order to deal with these cases without delay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson referred to the cases of soldiers who were accidentially shot while on service, for which no provision has previously been made, and for which, apparently, no provision is being made in this Bill.  I hope the Minister will amend the Bill in such a way as will enable cases of that kind to be dealt with and provision made for the dependents of young men who lost <Col N="77" /> their lives by an accident of that kind while in the Army.  I came across the case of a young fellow in my own constituency who was shot in a barracks. The remains were brought home to his mother's place, but she was not informed whether any military inquiry had been held.  No inquest had been held, and nothing has been done for that woman since.  When I raised the case with the Minister for Defence, and asked if anything could be done for her, an Army inquiry was ordered and apparently held, and information given to me, which I subsequently sent on to the dependents, that the shot which killed the young soldier was fired without authority, or against the regulations, as Deputy Byrne said, which were then supposed to be in existence. I never heard of regulations that had any binding force during the earlier stages of the formation of the National Army, and I think the Minister should not fall back upon the alleged regulations that were then supposed to be in existence for the purpose of evading liability in a case of this kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy probably has a far greater knowledge of the kind of cases that should be dealt with under this Bill, and I hope that the Minister will take serious notice of the criticism offered by the Deputy this evening.  I am concerned more than anything else with the method of administering the measure.  I want to know if the Minister intends to set up the Board right away and to give definite instructions to go ahead as quickly as possible and deal with the very bad cases of the type I have quoted and do something as soon as possible for the dependants of people who have lost their lives while giving service in the Army, some of whom gave long service previously in the I.R.A.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will also say whether it will be necessary for all persons who consider their cases come under the Bill to make fresh applications. I believe that most of the cases which Deputies are concerned with are already on the files of the Department. I wonder will the files be available for the Board which is to be set up, or will it be necessary for the parties concerned to make fresh applications and <Col N="78" /> give details when the Bill becomes an Act.  There are some valuable documents in the Department which, probably, could not be secured without trouble if fresh applications have to be submitted.  Perhaps the Minister will let us know whether all the information that should be on the files in his office will be at the disposal of the Board, in dealing with the applications when they come before them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the fact that the Minister has at last brought in this Bill.  I am always very slow to support any new Act that means the expenditure of considerable public money, but I feel that no Deputy could oppose this Bill, in view of the circumstances which surround the cases with which it deals.  The Government has made very generous provision&mdash; some people would say too ample provision, and I would agree with them&mdash; for those who had service in the old Republican Armies and in the National Army under the Military Service Pensions Act.  A very considerable amount of public money has been disbursed under that Act to men who are perfectly fit, and who are capable of earning a livelihood, and who in many cases are earning a very good livelihood, in addition to what they receive under the Act.  But we have a great many hard cases which have not been dealt with so far.  My attention has been directed to some cases in my own county, and I agree that they are extremely hard cases and that it is time that they should be dealt with.  I quite recognise that the Minister had a very difficult job in getting this Bill drafted owing to the peculiar conditions under which the National Army was formed.  I also agree that it is absolutely necessary that the examination of the cases should be very stringent in view of the difficulty in finding out the particulars in connection with the claims which have been made.  I am perfectly sure that a great many bogus claims will be made, and I would not support anything that would mean that bogus claims should be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise one or two suggestions that have already been made, particularly as regards the cases of soldiers injured or killed through an <Col N="79" /> accident of some kind, not due to ordinary service, since October, 1923.  For instance, I know of a young man who was very severely injured by an explosion which took place in a military garage.  A flying portion of the engine of a motor car hit him on the head and practically destroyed the sight of one eye.  That young man got no pension of any kind on his discharge from the Army and has been out of work since, and is to a large extent incapable of working owing to his disability.  As far as I know, no provision is made in the present Bill for meeting cases of that kind.</P>
    <P>I would disagree with the statement of Deputy Mulcahy in regard to the connection between pensions under this Bill and under the Military Service Pensions Act.  I understood the Deputy to say that it was his desire that a certain section of the Military Service Pensions Act should be amended in such a way that, even though a man in receipt of a disability pension is also in receipt of a military service pension, he should still continue to draw the full military service pension, and that it should not be affected by the disability pension.  I do not agree with that suggestion. When it comes to the expenditure of public money, we should not be lavish and throw around unnecessarily the money of the taxpayers. While it is absolutely necessary to meet hard cases as reasonably as we can, there is no reason why certain people should be placed in a specially selected position by this Bill or any other Pensions Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="GENERAL MULCAHY GENERAL MULCAHY">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understood the Deputy's statement, it was that men should draw at the same time a disability pension and a full military service pension.  Is that not a specially selected position?  I may have misunderstood the Deputy's statement, but that is my interpretation of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>My point was that a man who is entitled to a disability pension on discharge from the <Col N="80" /> Army should not be reduced in his disability pension if he is also entitled to a service pension.  It is not every person discharged from the Army who is entitled to a service pension.  The service pension would be given purely for service, and a wounds pension purely for wounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that does not change the point of view.  It means in effect that some men in certain cases would be entitled to the full amount of the two pensions, each pension having no reference to the other.  I say again that I disagree with that suggestion.  I have nothing further to say beyond that I hope that the Bill will be passed in the shortest possible time.  I quite agree with the Deputies who have spoken that it is extremely difficult, having regard to the structure of the Bill, to understand it, but I feel pretty certain that we should be able to hammer out a reasonably good Bill with the help of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill before the Dáil.  We have been promised it for years, and now that it has arrived I hope that it is really meant to do good to the dependents of the men who laid down their lives for the freedom of this country.  I agree that the Minister has done everything in his power to bring forward a Bill that, in his opinion, would do justice to the dependents of the men who died, but I regret very much that I do not see anything in the Bill that will enable the Minister to give some little compensation to men who died in 1923 and 1924 from disease contracted while serving both in the I.R.A. and the National Army.  Several of these sad cases have been brought to my notice in Westmeath and Longford, even where the dependents of these men were not able to obtain £10 for the burial expenses.  We had, unfortunately, in that constituency four or five very sad instances where young men were accidentally shot.  These young men were the sole support of their parents, and since their death these poor people are placed in the awful position that they are absolutely destitute and have had to apply to the county board of health for some relief. <Col N="81" /> On the other hand, if their sons had not joined the National Army or responded to the call they would be in a position to give some little help towards the maintenance of their parents.  I sincerely hope the Minister will take into account such cases as these in which absolute destitution prevails as a direct result of the death of these young men.</P>
      <P>I cannot for a moment imagine how the Minister can maintain that a man who has only forty per cent. of his earning capacity and who will be entitled to a sum of 10s. 9d. per week, with 4s. marriage allowance, can live on that allowance.  If a man loses an arm, that represents fifty per cent. of his earning capacity, and as a private soldier he will be entitled to £1 1s. per week, and if he has a wife, 5s. extra. If that man was a carpenter, mason, or some other class of artisan, surely his pay before he joined the Army would be more than £2 2s. per week. On the other hand, if the man's earning capacity is reduced by fifty per cent., as set out by the Minister in this Bill, how can he as a carpenter ever occupy the position he occupied prior to joining the Army?  The same thing applies to a painter, a slater, or any other tradesman.  It is all very well for Deputy Mulcahy to state here that when a man loses his arm it is a clean wound.  It is a clean wound and it may not probably affect his health in other ways, but it does affect his earning capacity to the extent that he cannot earn anything.  It is not fifty per cent. of his earning capacity that is gone; his entire capacity as a tradesman is gone.  Even as an agricultural labourer no farmer will employ a man who has only one arm or hand to go out and bind his corn, dig potatoes or do any other agricultural work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that some better provision should be made for men who have lost the use of an arm or leg.  A fifty per cent. pension at the rate of £1 1s. per week is not sufficient, and I sincerely hope that the Minister will take these facts into account.  I brought before the Dáil here on one occasion the case of a man who resided in Co. Longford. That man was earning £4 10s. per week before he joined the National Army. Now he is in receipt of 16s. 9d. per <Col N="82" /> week and 5s. for his wife and six children.  Surely that is not adequate compensation for a man who offered his services to the State for the purpose of seeing that law and order were maintained and that the property of the citizens of the State was safeguarded. I have no criticism to offer to the Minister on the drafting of the Bill.  I do say he has gone a good way when you take into account the men who went out in 1916, who have suffered and who have contracted disease from the sufferings they endured at the time.  Section 13 of this Bill provides for the Irish Volunteers and Citizen Army and other men who had the courage at the time to take their lives in their hands to obtain for this country some class of freedom from a foreign Power.</P>
    <P>I certainly congratulate the Minister on that section, and I disagree with Deputy Johnson.  To the best of my recollection he said that men who were Irish Volunteers or members of the Citizen Army and who might have been out against this Government in 1922 would be entitled to a pension under this section, or that it contained no provision to disqualify them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has entirely misunderstood what I said on that matter.  I asked the Minister if he would make it clear that it was the intention of the Bill&mdash;what I believed was the consequence of the Bill&mdash;that men who had served in the I.R.A. and did not serve in the National Army, but continued in the I.R.A. after the setting up of the National Army, and were wounded because of that service, will come under the provisions of the Bill.  I was not thinking at all of any service in the I.R.A. against the National Army.  That is not the question involved, so that the Deputy is mistaken in his interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is talking about, but if he thinks that I am asking that pensions <Col N="83" /> should be given to men because of their service against the National Army he is wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that any man who is unable to obtain a means of livelihood because he is compelled to be in a hospital or dependent on some relative, and that that state is primarily due to activities since 1916, should certainly be entitled to serious consideration. But I would not suggest that men who were in good health at the time of the Treaty, and who have contracted bad health since by having been out against the National Army should get pensions.  Widows of private soldiers are allowed 17/6 per week during widowhood, and a gratuity of £45 10s. if they re-marry.  That is, of course, an encouragement for them to marry again.  Whilst 17/6 is given to the mother, only 5/- is given for the first child and 3/6 for each other child. Could the Minister possibly support a child on 5/- a week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>He knows well that he could not.  Why not make some suitable provision for rearing and maintaining the children of these men in some degree of comfort and not in slavery?  Because he is the child of a private soldier, must he go ragged through the streets?  That soldier has been killed to maintain this Government and to safeguard life and property, and should we not offer more adequate provision than 5/- a week for his child?  I hold that it is an absolute impossibility for any widow to maintain, clothe, and educate her children on these allowances.  The Government will be degraded and looked upon as slave-drivers by the public boards, where these women must apply for some help to maintain their families. If such a woman is delicate she cannot go out to work, and if the children are too young she cannot leave them with anyone to look after them while she is away.  Something should be done to enable such women to maintain their children in decency and not have them running through the streets asking people for a penny because their father <Col N="84" /> was a soldier and was killed fighting for the Irish Free State.  It is up to the Minister to make some better provision for the upkeep of these children, particularly for the children of the poorer men.  If an officer or a man had some property or income of his own to leave to his widow, the 5/- would be some help, but where a woman was absolutely dependent on her husband's earnings she is surely entitled to something more than 5/- a week for her child.</P>
      <P>No Deputy has mentioned the Fourth Schedule, where 30 per cent. is mentioned.  Where a man loses three fingers of his right hand or all the toes of both feet he is entitled to 30 per cent., or 12/7 per week, with 3/- marriage allowance.  The Minister can not believe that a man who has lost all the toes of both feet will be able to earn 70 per cent. of his previous wages.  Such a man would be a cripple and would not be employed by anybody.  If there are any such cases I think something more should be done for them.  I have not met such a case.  I met a case where a man lost his foot, and he is in receipt of 12/6 a week.  I know another case where a man lost an arm.  He was in receipt of £1 1s. a week and has been paid off with a gratuity of £50, though his earning capacity is finished.  I welcome and appreciate the efforts of the Minister to do something for the widows and orphans of the men who have died, particularly for the widows of those men who have died through contracting disease.</P>

      <P>I have not studied the Bill sufficiently to know if the small matters in which I am interested are included in it.  A man who was serving in Athlone barracks was killed when a mine accidentally exploded, but his mother has not received any pension or gratuity whatever.  This matter was raised when the President was in Athlone recently, and he mentioned that this particular case and the cases of the officers who were killed in the flying accident, and perhaps two or three others, would be specifically dealt with in this Bill.  I would like the Minister to state if those cases are to be dealt with.</P>

      <P>It seems that the principal objection to this Bill, as in the case of every other Bill of its class, is that it does not go far enough.  I can understand that; it is quite natural that Deputies should say that this or that pension or amount should be given, that the amount is not sufficient that something more should be done. That, as I say, is quite natural, and in a way I am surprised that I did not hear more of it.  But the criticism of the Bill on the whole has been directed particularly against that one phase of it.  As far as I can judge, with regard to the resources of the country to pay pensions, I think we have gone as far in this Bill as it is possible to go in the circumstances, taking into account our financial difficulties, and further, taking into account the number of people who are at present drawing pensions. It is impossible to state at the moment how many people will draw pensions under the Bill if it becomes an Act, but it is anticipated that we will have 20,000 applications.  How many of these will be successful I am not in the position to say, and therefore I can give no estimate of the charge on the taxpayers that the Bill will involve. But there is one thing that I do know, and that is that the amount will be pretty considerable and that it will take some time to deal with the cases owing to their peculiar circumstances. As has been pointed out, a wound is something that you can see; it is there, and it is easy for anybody to see whether that wound has impaired the earning capacity of the individual or not. But it is a different question altogether when you come to the case of disease. You must first find out whether the man had the disease when he came into the National Army, the Volunteers, or the Citizen Army, or whether his disease is attributable to service in any of these forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not correct to state that most of these particulars have already been placed in the hands of the Department, and could not the Minister get that preliminary information by looking up the files that contain it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no cases <Col N="86" /> of disease under the 1923 Act and therefore there should be no information with regard to disease in my Department. There should be information about wounds, and wounds have been dealt with under that Act.  But as far as wounds are concerned, what this Bill does is to bring in the period between the 30th September, 1923, and 1st October, 1924.  That period of a year was not covered in the 1923 Act, and what this Bill purports to do is to bring in that year as far as wounds are concerned, and to put these people on the self-same footing as the people who got wound pensions under the 1923 Act.  Disease is on quite a different plane, and what the board that will be set up under the Bill will have to find out is whether or not disease was attributable to service.  In that their particular difficulty will lie.</P>
      <P>The 80 per cent. degree of disability set down in the Bill has been criticised from more than one side of the House.  No matter what percentage was set down&mdash;70 per cent. or 60 per cent.&mdash;the same cry would have come: &ldquo; Why should a man who has 5 per cent. less disability not get a pension?&rdquo; But when we were trying to arrange what would be fair and just to the country and to the people we arrived at the figure of 80 per cent. as a reasonable and just figure.  If we had said 75 per cent. or 70 per cent. the same cause of complaint would remain.  You must arrive at some figure, and 80 per cent., in my opinion, is a figure which, while it may not reach every individual who has contracted disease in the times we have passed through, will certainly bring in many cases of serious incapacity and will remedy an injustice which I admit has existed up to the present.  Deputy Johnson raised a good may questions&mdash; the estimate of the cost, the scale of pensions, the 80 per cent. disability, and, I think, Section 13.  Section 13 deals with the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, and it also makes it clear that a person who served in either of these forces and who did not serve in the National Army is entitled to a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>For either wounds or disablement.  If he had 80 per cent. disability, and in order to attain that disability, if it is a progressive one, he has four years in which to arrive at it. Under the 1923 Act gratuities in certain cases were £100 and £60.  Under this Bill gratuities up to £300 may be given.  That is a considerable advance on the 1923 Act.  I think I should go over the Bill, section by section, or at least over the principal sections in the Bill, and just give a short explanation of what they contain.  I do not propose to give an exhaustive explanation.  I think I might start with Section 9. The other sections up to Section 9 are, more or less, definition sections.  Section 9 deals altogether with disablement caused by disease, where are persons were discharged from the forces before the 1st October, 1924, and where the disease was incurred in the period between the 1st April, 1922, and the 30th September, 1924.  That section has also a provision that if the disease reached 80 per cent. within four years from the date of the discharge the soldier may be granted a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 provides that where a person was discharged from the forces on or after the 1st October, 1924, and incurred disease in the period commencing on the 1st April, 1922, and ending on the 30th day of September, 1924, the position will be as in Section 9.  Section 11 brings in persons who were not brought in under the 1923 Act &mdash;from the period between the 30th September, 1923, up to the 1st October, 1924.  That is the year that intervened, and Section 11 brings in those people. Section 12 deals with the people who were discharged after the 1st of October, 1924, and those people come under, for the first time, the graduated or rank scale.  I think that is only quite fair. Up to that date, there were not properly defined ranks in the army.  When the Defence Forces Act came into operation on the 1st October, 1924, commissions and ranks were properly settled for the first time, so that we started on the graduated scale from that date.  Deputy Johnson, I think, asked a question as to what would happen to the soldier who was wounded before the 24th October but not discharged <Col N="88" /> until after the 1st October, 1924, provided he was suffering from a disability of 20 per cent. or over.  The gratuity in that case would not exceed £40 altogether, with a further gratuity of £2 10s. Od. for each year of service in the forces.  I think the Deputy complained that the soldier is worse off under the present Bill than he would be under the old Act of 1923.  But under the old Act of 1923 he did not get £2 10s. for every year of service that he had given.  He simply got the lump sum laid down.  The rank element comes in there but, in my opinion, it will not make much difference.  It will probably work out much in the same way.</P>
    <P>The first sub-section of Section 14 deals with the dependents of persons who died before the 1st October, 1924, while serving in the forces, or died within four years from the date of discharge, from disease attributable to service in the forces.  In the case of persons who served in the Volunteers or who served in the Irish Citizen Army and died before the 7th December, 1922, and whose death was due solely to disease attributable to his military service, a gratuity will be payable to the dependents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Sub-section (2) of Section 14 deals with the dependents of a person who dies after the 1st October, 1924, from disease attributable to service in the period April, 1922&mdash;September, 1924, and with dependents of persons discharged after 1st October, 1924, and dying within four years thereafter.  It also deals with persons who belonged to the Volunteers or the Irish Citizen Army in the same way. Section 15 deals with people who were killed on or after the 1st October, 1923, and before the 1st October, 1924, in the course of their duty as members of the forces, or who died from wounds received in that period or within four years afterwards.  The effect of the section would be the same as that of the third schedule of the Army Pensions Act, 1923.  That deals with the dependents of persons killed or <Col N="89" /> wounded.  It extends the Act of 1923 to cover the period up to the 30th September, 1924.</P>

      <P>Section 22 makes it possible for the Minister to direct payment of the pension for the purpose of the maintenance of the pensioner's wife or child, if he thinks that the pensioner is not doing his duty by his family.  I think that is a very good provision.  Section 23 provides that where a person has a 20 per cent. disability from wounds and a 60 per cent. disability from disease, the two may be added together for the purpose of arriving at the full amount of disability&mdash; 80 per cent.  Section 24 provides for medical treatment.  It also provides for the payment of funeral expenses. Section 25 provides for payment of pensions monthly in advance.</P>
      <P>As regards the Schedules, the only point that arises, I think, is that made by Deputy Johnson on the Fourth Schedule.  That had been seen, and it will be amended.  All that is necessary is to delete the words &ldquo; degree of disablement&rdquo; at the top of what is known as the first column.  We will then have no first column under that heading.

There is no provision in the Bill by which that man's dependents can be compensated.  The Bill definitely refers to persons who are &ldquo; killed.&rdquo;  This man died in action, as is clearly proved by a high officer who knows what &ldquo; action&rdquo; means.

If it can be proved that the man was in normal health on the particular occasion that he went out and that he died in action, he would then come under the provisions of the Bill.

This may be a case of that kind, or it may not.  It is quite possible that that man went into the R.I.C. fit and well.

There is a certain justification for it because, as Deputy Johnson points out, there is a certain type of amendment which cannot be moved by ordinary Deputies, that is, Deputies <Col N="97" /> who are not members of the Executive Council, on the Committee Stage.  A certain amount of what has taken place could be introduced in an amendment say, on a definition, and so on, and would more properly take place on a Committee Stage and would be more properly committee work.  It is a kind of Bill, if I may venture to prophesy, that will have two Committee Stages; probably there will be plenty of opportunity later on, but we will never reach any finality now by going into cases which cannot be discussed unless all the facts are made clear.  If, in the interval between now and the Committee Stage, certain cases were examined and agreement reached, there would be no difficulty in finding a definition.

      <P>If we <Col N="99" /> say Tuesday for the Committee Stage the last day for receiving amendments would clearly be Saturday, because apart from the fact that Deputies want to have some time to draft amendments there is also the necessity for the Minister to have time to examine them.  They will be largely amendments, as Deputy Johnson pointed out, which, if not adopted by the Minister in some form or other, would fail for reasons of order. If the Committee Stage is taken on Wednesday amendments would have to be in on Monday, and if taken on Thursday the amendments would have to be in on Tuesday.  With regard to Deputy Johnson's point about the Money Resolution, if the Money Resolution is fixed for a particular day and the Minister is convinced by reference to particular amendments put in that certain things ought to be done in the Bill it will be always open to discharge the order for Committee.</P>
      <P>It would take a longer time, perhaps, to bring in a new Money Resolution, if such a thing is probable, but there is no harm in fixing the Money Resolution and the Committee Stage on the same day without both necessarily having to be taken on that day.</P>

      <P>There were two points made on the amendment. One was to have Trinity College, in regard to books published in Ireland, and the National Library and the British Museum put on a level with the University Colleges of the National University. I wanted to have these English, Scotch and Welsh Libraries deleted and that the libraries of the colleges of the National University be substituted. As far as I can see, Deputy Thrift's amendment meets the point.  I have no interest in having English libraries excluded from receiving copies of books published in Ireland.  I am prepared to agree with Deputy Thrift in that. The other point, I think, could be met in one of two ways, either by putting the University Colleges on the same footing as Trinity College is in under the Bill as it stands, that is to say, that they would get a copy of every book published in Ireland without having to make a request for it, or else it should be met by putting Trinity College in the position of having to make a request for books.  That is the only point that remains to be discussed.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go over the grounds we went over in December.  I have no objection to the suggestion that the three University Colleges should be added to sub-section (1), but I would press, in the interest of a complete collection of Irish books, that we should not have the necessity for a request for books imposed upon the Trinity College Library.  I do not want to argue the point at full length. I would be quite satisfied to accept the suggestion if some words on the lines proposed could be added to sub-section (1) of Section 2.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Thrift.  I do not want to raise any difficulty.  I only want to see that the libraries of all the Colleges are put on a level.  It is immaterial in what way they are put on a level.  Deputy Thrift's new amendment, as on the Order Paper, would create a certain amount of difficulty for the authorities of the National University of Ireland.  The National University has <Col N="102" /> nothing whatever to do with the libraries of the three Colleges.  The most practical thing would be, instead of putting down the authorities of the National University of Ireland, to leave out the line &ldquo;The authorities in control of the National University of Ireland,&rdquo; and put, instead, &ldquo;the libraries of the University Colleges in Dublin, Cork and Galway.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that point, but I did not like to put down something which would interfere with the control of the University.  Has the Minister any objection to our coming to this arrangement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter entirely for the House.  I think it is quite right that the Universities should be put on the same level.  Whether Trinity College, Dublin, was removed from sub-section (1) and put into the other sub-section, or the three University College libraries are put into sub-section (1) is material as between the two Universities.  I think it is material, too, so far as the publishers are concerned.  On the one hand it means delivery of every book published, and on the other hand it means delivery on demand.  In the one case responsibility is placed on the publishers to supply to the places mentioned a copy of everything published.  That responsibility is a continuing one, and the publisher may be brought to book years after; whereas, in the case of supplying a book on demand, there would be other laws coming into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difference so far as the liability of the publisher is concerned. There is also a smaller difference.  I understand that where the publisher has to deliver a copy of everything published&mdash;what is called an automatic delivery&mdash;the practice has been that it should be a copy of the book bound with the best binding in which the book is produced.  When it is delivered on demand there may be a secondary binding, a cheaper type of binding, in which the book may be transferred. Taking it from the publisher's point of view, it is an important question whether the obligation placed on the publisher is to deliver every book published or merely to supply on demand. <Col N="103" /> If it is an obligation to supply every book published, that will mean the book will have to be in the best form published. That will be an additional obligation on the publisher.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thrift's amendment is, of course, effective.  His amendment sets out: &ldquo;Three copies of the book for the authorities in control of the National University of Ireland for the libraries of the three constituent colleges.&rdquo;  Up to date the deliveries of these books have been given to Universities, not to University Colleges, and we might keep that up by having the amendment framed in this way: &ldquo;Three copies of the book for or in accordance with the direction of the authorities having the control of the National University of Ireland for the use of their respective libraries and the three constituent colleges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I can give that amendment in a particular form if it is thought desirable. That will then get over the difficulty as between Trinity College, Dublin, and its position in relation to the National University of Ireland and the position of the three constituent colleges.  I would like to know is it any addition to what is proposed in sub-section (2)?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that the Dáil should understand, from the point of view of the publishers, what is the new demand.  Apparently it is now a copy to the British Museum, the National Library of Ireland, a copy to Trinity College, Dublin, and a copy to each of the three colleges of the National University of Ireland&mdash;all these automatically&mdash;and then on demand a copy to each of the four foreign Universities.  The publisher's liability will then be ten copies.  Previously the publisher was faced with the obligation of supplying six copies.  It may seem good or ill to the House that they should be asked to do that, but I think the position should be known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the desire to put the National University on a level with Trinity College, as colleges or as universities, I think it is necessary to take into account the <Col N="104" /> fact that it is a library we are talking about rather than a college.  It seems to me that to make the sending of three copies of every book published in the Saorstát to the National University obligatory upon the publishers because it is also obligatory to continue the practice of the past in respect to Trinity College, is unnecessary, because I do not think that each of the colleges is likely, in its present situation, at any rate, to house all the books published. They may be in a position and may be willing to do so, but if there is going to be any obligation on the publishers in this matter, I think we ought to ensure that there will be an obligation upon the libraries to house the books, to have them always for reference.</P>
      <P>I would not at all object to the library if there is a library anything like, or even moving in the direction of the proportions of the Trinity College library attached to the National University, so as to put them on a level; but whether each of the colleges could be put upon that level in that obligatory sense I am very doubtful.  I think the proposition that on demand&mdash; which presupposes a desire to have the books, or a specific book&mdash;each of the libraries should have one is reasonable, and, I think, therefore, it is in sub-section (2)  that the obligation should be imposed upon the publishers in respect to three copies for the disposal of the National University.  I do not think there is a sufficient case made for imposing upon the publishers the obligation to send three copies to the National University libraries because one has necessarily to be sent to the Trinity College library.  I think the proposition to send three copies on demand is a fair one, but I think a stronger case would need to be made if it is intended to put this obligation in sub-section (1).</P>

      <P>I ask Deputy Prof. Tierney not to press his point.  I think it is necessary to say a little more on this subject.  Deputy Johnson has put his finger on the vital point.  We are not making any comparison between the two universities.  If you do you can only insist on one copy for the National University as compared with one copy for Trinity College.  If Deputy <Col N="105" /> Tierney presses his point that there should be three colleges brought into sub-section (1), it means that. There are really two vital points.  We are not going to cut out the universities from getting their copies on demand. There is another vital point. We want to get a complete collection in what is, as a matter of fact, the big university library at present.</P>
      <P>The point I had in mind before, and that I did not refer to, is that it is comparatively simple to make demand for books in England, Scotland and Wales, because there is a complete published list available of all books published within those boundaries; but it is not possible to make a demand for the books published within the limits of the Free State because there is no such authorised list issued of the books published, and the only possible way to find out about published books is when they are advertised.  There is a great difficulty in getting a knowledge of the books that are being published within the limits of the Free State.  It is a very important thing that the big library should have as full a collection as possible, so that years afterwards the books may be available.</P>

      <P>Would it not be possible for some arrangement to be come to between the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Thrift, Deputy Alton, Deputy Tierney and Deputy Johnson on this matter, and let the Minister, who has skilled assistance at his disposal, get the agreement arrived at drafted?  We do not seem to be getting any further in the matter in the House.  Let them agree on something and let the Minister bring it forward.  Even if we come to an agreement now we have not got it drafted.  It is not contained either in the original amendment or in the new amendment or in amendment 11 (a), or in any combination of them.

      <P>I do not think there is going to be any agreement got between those mentioned.  It is a matter that we ought to leave to a vote here and have it settled one way or another.  I do not think the drafting <Col N="106" /> point will cause any difficulty.  If the vote of the House is that sub-section (2) is to be left as it is, and that sub-section (1) is to be amended by putting in the three colleges of the National University, I believe I can supply a draft that will stand criticism on that matter, but I do think that the matter is quite simple.  Are we going to give the books to the foreign libraries? There appears to be general agreement on that.  We are prepared to sacrifice the publisher or the author.</P>

      <P>Or the advertisement that he tries to get nowadays, by giving multitudinous copies for review purposes.  The real sacrifice appears to be on the part of the publishers, but they are sufficiently good business men to face the new situation the statute will create and to make their new arrangements with the author, so that the author will be the man who is to make sacrifices.  We appear to agree that copies should be given on demand as they were before to Oxford, Cambridge, Scotland and Wales.  The other point is, are the three colleges of the National University also to get copies of books published in Ireland?  Incidental to that are the two other difficulties.  Are they to get these books on demand or should they get them as a publisher's liability to supply them as soon as published?  If we say that they are to be on demand it means that we insert an amendment in sub-section (2).  If it means we are in agreement about the other matter, we can insert an amendment in sub-section (1), and there is little difficulty about that.  I do not know exactly what order the amendments should be in, but it seems to me that there is only one decision required, and that is, should the three colleges of the National University be added, and, if added, are they to be added in sub-section (1)  or sub-section (2)  of Section 179?  In order to clarify the matter, I will move this amendment&mdash;the insertion of these words: &ldquo;Three copies of the book for or in accordance with the direction of the <Col N="107" /> authority having control of the National University of Ireland for the use of the respective libraries of the three constituent colleges of that university.&rdquo; and that these words be inserted in sub-section (1).

      <P>May I say a word on the point raised by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Thrift as to whether this amendment should come in sub-section (1) or (2)? Deputy Johnson pointed out that we are not comparing the four colleges in this particular case, but libraries.  Trinity College Library is much bigger than any of the constituent college libraries, but he forgot one important point.  One of the libraries of the three colleges is in Cork, and Cork is a very important place.  From the point of view of the Corkman, whatever may be the difference in the size of the libraries, the library of University College, Cork, is considerably more important than the library of Trinity College, Dublin. The same thing applies to Galway.  It is important, therefore, that these libraries get copies of these books.  I do not say the case is at all similar in the case of University College, Dublin, but there is no reason why exception should be made in the case of that college.</P>

      <P>There will have to be consequential amendments in connection with sub-sections (3) and (4), because (3) and (4) make the distinction I spoke of previously in regard to the type of binding, and the sort of copy that is to be given.  Sub-section (3) as it stands would mean that a copy of the whole book, with maps, illustrations, finished and coloured in the same manner as the best copy of the book, should be delivered to the National Library, Trinity College Library, and to the Trustees of the British Museum.</P>

      <P>Before passing from this I would like to get a little light. The Minister has told us that the libraries in Ireland&mdash;I take it he means Trinity College Library&mdash;receives a copy of every book published in Great Britain.  Does the definition of a book which appears here apply equally to the books published in Great Britain? For instance, are we to take it that a copy of every pamphlet and sheet of letterpress that is published in Great Britain is sent on to Trinity College Library?</P>

      <P>The proposition here is that every pamphlet and sheet of letterpress published in Ireland shall be sent to the constituent colleges, and we are assured that they are going to be housed.  I wonder are they going to be read and indexed.  There are people who have a very considerable collection of pamphlets and sheets of letterpress, but there are so many pamphlets and sheets of letterpress printed that I am very doubtful whether we should make that a definition of what is a book.  Just imagine all the flimsy literature that has been published for electioneering purposes within the last few years for revolutionary propaganda.  If that ever comes again, as some Ministers would expect judging by their propaganda, &ldquo;in view of the forces of anarchy still at work&rdquo;&mdash;Ministers appear to expect that there will be revolutionary propaganda continuing and continuous&mdash;and yet we are to expect that these pamphlets and sheets of letterpress are to be sent to those libraries.  I think that some change in the definition is called for.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  Its purpose is to put beyond doubt the legal validity of the procedure which we have followed heretofore.  Deputies may be aware that the procedure we have followed was the procedure for a very long time in Great Britain, and no difficulties arose until 1913.  In 1913, Mr. Gibson Bowles challenged the collection of income tax before the passage of the Finance Act, and he was upheld in the courts there.  As a result of the judgement that was given, a Provisional Collection of Taxes Act was <Col N="111" /> passed in Great Britain, and the only matter that was argued before the courts was income tax.  In regard to customs duties, there were certain passages in legislation which left it much in doubt as to whether the court would have given the same judgement in regard to customs duties as it did in regard to income tax.  As a matter of fact, afterwards, in 1915, the new import duties were imposed by resolution of the House of Commons and were collected before the passage of the Finance Act.  There is no doubt that while the court might have given a different decision in a customs case from the decision it gave in the income tax case, on the other hand it might have given the same decision; and the position in England appears to be now that it is not thought safe to collect customs duties before the passage of the Finance Act.  In recent years, for instance, when the McKenna duties were reimposed they were not collected until the Finance Act was passed.  Apparently there was a doubt as to whether an action in the courts might not produce a decision that the collection was illegal.  We have certain other difficulties.  A difficulty arose in this way, that under the existing Provisional Collection of Taxes Act we might renew an existing duty by resolution and collect, or we might renew it with modifications, or we might modify the existing duty and, for instance, increase and quadruple it and collect, but we cannot, under the existing Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, collect a new duty or abolish a duty.  In so far as we have done that heretofore, we have been relying on certain odd provisions in the Customs Act of 1876, and we are advised that it is doubtful whether a challenge to our collection might not be successful.  As I have said, from the procedure that has been adopted the opinion appears to prevail in England that such a challenge would be successful.  We desire, therefore, to give legal sanction that cannot be doubted to the procedure that has been followed heretofore.  There is another difficulty even with regard to taxes that are covered by the existing Provisional <Col N="112" /> Collection of Taxes Act.  There is a provision as to using the powers given in that particular Act only once in a session.  In Great Britain, they have sessions that do not run for several years, as ours do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, it is quite probable that last year if anybody had challenged the collection of income tax, after the expiration of the previous period and before the Finance Act had been passed, they might have successfully done so.  It seems to me the procedure provided in the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act is one that cannot be subject to any serious criticism.  It continued the procedure that always existed in England up to 1913.  Deputies, I think, are familiar with it.  What happens is that Budget Resolutions are introduced in Committee on Finance. After they are passed by the House they given authority for the collection of tax on whatever basis may be embodied in the resolution.  Within the next ten sitting days of the Dáil, after the passage of that resolution in Committee, the Dáil must adopt the resolution with or without amendment.  If the Dáil does not adopt the resolution in that way within ten sitting days the power to collect the tax lapses.  Within twenty sitting days after the passage of the confirming resolution in the Dáil the Second Stage of a Bill embodying the resolution must be passed by the Dáil, and if not so passed within twenty sitting days, then the power to collect lapses.  Finally, legislation enacting the provisions of the original Budget Resolution, with or without amendment, must be passed within four months of the introduction of the resolution or the power to collect lapses.  If any money is collected under the resolution which would not be collectable under the Bill by reason of an amendment having been adopted, repayment must be made.  For instance, if we had in our resolutions fixed the apparel duty at 20 per cent. and if afterwards the House reduced the duty to 15 per cent., anyone who might have paid the 20 per cent. under the resolution would be entitled to a refund, as being only liable to the 15 per cent.  It seems to me that it is absolutely necessary to put our legal powers beyond <Col N="113" /> doubt in case we were successfully challenged in regard to any tax which was being collected.</P>

Death duties are a permanent tax and are not altered from year to year.  They would not be affected by this Bill.  But if any annual tax was successfully challenged no collection could be made for three or four months while the Finance Bill was being passed, and a great deal of confusion and inconvenience would be caused to people, including those who might refuse to pay during the period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take this opportunity of asking some questions about death duties.  There are two or three cases concerned in my constituency. One case came under my notice this week where the death took place in 1918. Probate was taken out and accepted by the Revenue Commissioners. The whole business was disposed of and the duty paid.  When this Government came along in 1922-23 they sent out valuers who made a re-valuation.  An additional claim for hundreds of pounds was then sent to the people concerned.  The original valuation was increased 100 per cent.  I can bring papers and figures to prove that.  Unfortunately for the farmers concerned, the Commissioners were sent down when the value of land was at its peak. The result was that the previous valuation was increased by 100 per cent. and new demands made.  These poor people had not great educational advantages and would have to employ agents to see after their business.  The amount was so small that they were afraid to go to the Law Courts and challenge the claims of the Commissioners.  As a result they have been mulcted.  They were crows to pluck and, so far as I know, they have been plucked unmercifully. I would like to know if there is any law to enforce such a claim.  Is it only a question of frightening the unfortunate <Col N="114" /> victims because they are afraid to go to the Law Courts and challenge the Commissioners' right to make these claims, eight or nine years after the death took place, especially as the matter had been disposed of by another Government?</P>
      <P>There is another case where a cheque was handed to a solicitor three years ago to meet a claim.  It was not paid by that particular solicitor.  He kept it, and has given no account of it.  His explanation, probably, is that it is for his own fees.  Here we have an additional claim made on the unfortunate man concerned for interest on money that should have been paid three years ago, or that should not have been paid at all, as the matter was one of doubt. I have two or three of these cases.  It is a scandal.</P>

      <P>Death duties are a permanent tax and are not renewable from year to year.  I have not the particulars before me in order to satisfactorily answer the Deputy now.  If the death occurred in 1918 the land would be valued as at the death, and it would not be valued on the higher price that prevailed a year or two later.  I am not sure if the price rose between 1921 and 1922.</P>

      <P>I cannot claim to have examined this Bill or its implications, but I would ask the Minister whether he has consulted the officers of the Dáil, for instance, and whether he has considered consulting the Committee on Procedure in regard to the Time Table in Resolution 4.  It is, perhaps, worthy of consideration from the point of view of general procedure.  I can imagine, for instance, a Budget resolution being submitted containing many knotty and difficult points that would require long discussion and that would not be agreed to within the ten days between the date of introduction and the date of decision, and I am not quite sure what is going to happen.  I should like to ask the Minister what is meant by the phrase, &ldquo;whichever of the following events first occur,&rdquo; that is to say, an event which does not happen. One of the events named here is, &ldquo;if the resolution is not agreed to.&rdquo; I cannot conceive that as an event.  If it is still in process of discussion, the fact that it is not agreed to does not make it an event.  However, that is a point in drafting.  On the general point I think it is desirable that on the question of time&mdash;ten days after the resolution has been submitted and so on&mdash;the various tables in Section 4 ought to be, if they have not already been, discussed with the Ceann Comhairle and his staff, the Clerk of the Dáil, etc., and perhaps the Committee on Procedure, merely on the technical point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter which I am raising on the Adjournment arises out of a question put by me to the Minister for Agriculture to-day. The question and answer and the supplementary question did not give us a sufficient opportunity of discussing the matter as fully as I think it ought to be discussed.  The facts are pretty well known to the Minister, but they may not be so well known to Deputies. The matter has to do with the exportation of cows to Great Britain from Irish ports.  I want to say that my inquiry was as to cows which are being exported for the purpose of fattening or being slaughtered, and not for milking purposes.  Great complaint has been made to Deputies in different parts of the country with regard to the number of cows which are being rejected at the ports and returned to the owners as being unfit for exportation. The reason given for the rejection of most of the cows is that they are tubercular.  I have seen one of the forms sent back to one of the owners of such cows and it contained a paragraph with three items dealing with different grades of tubercular disease in cattle.  What happens is that when the cows are sent to the ports they are examined there by the veterinary officers of the Department of Agriculture, and if a cow is found to have what is called an indurated udder, which I understand means a hardening of one of the quarters of the udder, it is invariably sent back with a notification that it is suffering from tuberculosis. My information is that an indurated udder does not always indicate a tubercular condition of the cow <Col N="117" /> or of the udder.  In fact, I have heard from reliable veterinary surgeons that practically 90 per cent. of indurated udders are not due to tuberculosis. The important point, in my opinion, is that if this is continued very much longer it will have a very serious effect on the dairying business in Ireland, because, as the Minister knows, every milch cow ends by being slaughtered for consumption, and the owner has to take into account the saleable value of the cow after a certain number of years in the dairy.</P>
      <P>At present such cows are almost unsaleable.  Their price at fairs is much below the pre-war price.  I am informed that this does not by any means apply to old and decrepit cows. In some cases it happens that good young cows, which have been milked for a year or two, develop a bad quarter and cease to be useful for milking purposes.  They are fattened off with the intention of selling them.  When such a cow reaches the port it is rejected by the veterinary surgeon as being tubercular.  The information I have received in connection with my county is that the majority of cows rejected within the past three months, and which have been examined by the local veterinary officer, have been found to have no clinical sign of tuberculosis.  The veterinary officer told me he had not made the tuberculin test, but that he believed, as far as all ordinary signs of tuberculosis are concerned, that practically none of the cows had tuberculosis.  I was informed that, where 30 cows had been returned to a district, in only one case was it found to be necessary to have the cow slaughtered by direction of the local veterinary officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been found that the veterinary officers at the different ports differ in their ideas as to when a cow is fit or unfit for exportation.  Many cows that have been returned from one port have been sent to other ports and have got through all right.  I have particulars of a case of six cows which failed to get through at Waterford and which got through when sent to the port of Dublin.  There is a feeling that this is doing the dairying industry a great deal of harm, that the restrictions <Col N="118" /> are unnecessarily severe and that something ought to be done.  It is recognised that the demand for careful examination comes from the English authorities.  It is also felt that these authorities are unnecessarily strict, that they might be approached in this matter and shown that cows with an indurated udder are quite fit for food in most cases.</P>
    <P>It is also a hardship on the owners of such cows that when rejected they are sent back at the owner's expense, which might amount to a couple of pounds.  Apart from the question of saleable value, there is this question of expense which will not be defrayed by the Department.  Where such a cow is found by the local veterinary officer to be quite sound on its return to the owner, it is quite unfair that the owner should be mulcted.  As matters stand, it seems to me that no man feels himself free to but any cow that has any hardening of the udder, because it is pretty certain that such a cow will be rejected at the ports.  I feel that there is a genuine grievance in connection with this matter and that something ought to be done to remedy it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DWYER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that Deputy Heffernan has raised this question. I have had some experience of the export trade in cattle, and within the past year or more several of these cases have been brought before me and I have been asked to bring the matter before the Dáil.  The replies we heard from the Minister for Agriculture this afternoon bring to our mind the fact that we are exporters and that we ought to remember that any beast that may be passed here but which is found unsound on the other side, can be sent back again to us by the inspectors.  Instead, therefore, of trying to impress upon the Minister or the Veterinary Inspectors here the desirability of passing these cattle we ought to ask him to try to make some arrangement with the authorities on the other side as regards these cattle which are found to be defective in their udder.  At nearly every fair I go to&mdash;and I have been attending all the fairs in the South of Ireland although I do not export cattle myself&mdash;such cases as these are brought under my notice.  There is a defect in <Col N="119" /> the udders of the cattle, and because of that the veterinary surgeon at any port may turn them down.</P>
      <P>What I would like to have impressed upon the Minister here is that some arrangement should be made between the Veterinary Department on this side and on the other side in regard to the export of these cattle.  But I think it would be very unfair to ask that officials on this side should pass cows which might be rejected on the other side.  It would be a source of great loss and great inconvenience to exporters if these cattle were sent back again. There is another aspect of the matter. If these cattle are sent over, are rejected on the far side and are returned, we do not know what disease they may bring back, such as foot-and-mouth disease.  You want to be very careful in this matter.  We want fair play and I think the Minister for Agriculture has put the case pretty clearly before us.  I think he will do his part with the Veterinary Department on the other side if we ask him.  We cannot expect him to get inferior cattle passed out of this country and to have them rejected on the other side.  I am glad Deputy Heffernan raised this question because I intended to raise it myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The fringe of the question only has been touched.  Reference has been only made to the few cows that happened to be bought and which happened to be sent to the ports by people who know their business very well or perhaps by people who do not.  It is only a very small percentage of this class of cattle which are sent to the ports at all, not five per cent. of the total.  The real suferers are the farmers, and not the dealers.  There are none of us who have a farm, especially those of us who farm milch cows, who will not have four or five of these cows that must be turned out to grass to fatten.  I have often myself five or six cows, perfectly sound cows, which spring, in the months of July and August, one or two teats, certainly one.  It is quite a usual occurrence among cows which have been good or average milkers.  You will never find that among bad milkers. If you have good cows with a strain <Col N="120" /> of milk, you will find these are the very cows which will spring, in the month of July or August.  It is almost impossible to find a market for cows of that description, but if you do find a market it is a local market, and for a beast that under ordinary conditions, without these restrictions, would fetch anything from £20 to £22, the price you will get from the local butcher&mdash;you are lucky if you can sell them at all&mdash;is from £8 to £11.</P>
      <P>When this matter was being discussed here before.  I made the assertion that the veterinary surgeons on the other side did not know their business, and I repeat that.  They seem to have an exaggerated opinion of what their duties are.</P>
      <P>I made the assertion that these perfectly good, healthy cows are no more suffering from tuberculosis than are the best of our bullocks and heifers which leave the country.  If there is any kind of blemish at all on the udder, they are all put in the one category.  I say that very few of these cows find their way to the ports at all.  They will not be bought at the fairs in the country.  The only people who suffer are the unfortunate owners of this class of stock.  I do say that representation should be made through the proper channels to the authorities on the other side, but I agree with Deputy Dwyer that no useful purpose could be served by a relaxation of the restrictions on this side, because then we should be only sending them over, to be returned. I think that is a foolish suggestion. What I do suggest is, that representations should be made by our Department to the English Veterinary Department. There are numerous cases of this kind, and 90 per cent. of our good cows, which bear these blemishes, are absolutely sound.  I say representations should be made to the authorities on the other side.  Otherwise they will have to be slaughtered here and sold at their full value.  I suppose they could be dealt with in Waterford. There is no other outlet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, it is the good milker, the milker that is over the average, which always has a stroke of this description in July or August, and the bad cows never have it at all.  I say that the English Veterinary Department do not <Col N="121" /> know everything about tuberculosis and about sound cows, and cows with indurated udders are often perfectly sound and healthy cows without any trace of tuberculosis whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this subject I think we must bear in mind that the veterinary surgeon's position is that in the case of any cow suffering from an indurated udder the presumption is that it has tuberculosis.  These cases are not necessarily tubercular, but a very considerable number of them are, and a healthy cow, having infalmmation, as described by Deputy Gorey, may commence as mastitis and become tubercular.  The only way to prove such a cow innocent is to submit her to the tuberculin test, and if she gives no reaction she will be accepted as non-tubercular. If you approach the Veterinary Department on the other side I am inclined to think that they would agree to that, but it is the very most they would agree to.  But to send a cow over haphazard with an indurated udder on the chance that she will pass on the other side, as Deputy Dwyer put it, would be very foolish.</P>

I imagine it would cost about two guineas a cow to have that done, and I wonder if Deputy Hennessy is aware of that.  He knows quite well that the procedure is very elaborate and cannot be done with one visit by the veterinary officer; it requires two visits.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The real issue, I think, is: What are the British regulations and what kind of animals will they allow into the country?  Deputy Heffernan says that that is not the issue; he says that what really happens is that we stop cows which they would allow in.  I will deal with that point in a moment, but I want to say <Col N="122" /> first that the real issue is: What are the British regulations, what way do they administer them, and what class of animals do they allow into the country? Because you will agree that it would be and policy for us to let a cow reach Birkenhead if we believe that she would be sent back.  Therefore, let us first see what the British regulations are.  I think we are at cross purposes to some extent in this matter.  I have before me the Order made by the British Ministry for the British people, and it is adapted to apply to animals on board ships at Birkenhead.  Remember that this is an Order made by the English Ministry for the English people and applying to any cows in England:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every person having in his possession or under his charge&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) any cow which is, or appears to be, suffering from tuberculosis of the udder, indurated udder, or other chronic disease of the udder.</P>
      <P>Then it goes on to give a list of the diseases&mdash;</P>
      <P>shall without avoidable delay give information of the fact to a constable of the police force&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and so on.  That means that the law in England at the moment is that any owner of a cow which has a tubercular udder, or appears to have a tubercular udder, or has an indurated udder, must give notice to the local authority. How do they administer that Order when it applies to our cattle?  They say that any cow appearing on board ship in Birkenhead that has obviously a tubercular udder, or appears to have a tubercular udder, or has an indurated udder, shall be sent back.  Obviously there is no point in giving notice of such an animal to the English local authorities.  That is the way they administer the Order.  In the case of the Englishman with cattle on the other side they specify three things&mdash;a tubercular udder, what appears to be a tubercular udder, or an udder that is indurated.  They beg the question, if you like, and it is for the reason that Deputy Hennessy mentioned with regard to the giving of notice to the local authority.  They apply that in the way I have mentioned to cattle from Ireland that are on board ship.  They take <Col N="123" /> up the line that any animal that has a tubercular udder, that appears to have a tubercular udder, or that has an indurated udder shall be sent back.</P>
    <P>The second question is: Who is to blame?  Are we stopping animals that would not be stopped by the English veterinary surgeons?  That Order has been in force for some time, and during all the time representations have been made to the Department by the cattle trade and the shippers.  I should say that for the last two years the administration of that Order on this side has been gradually tightened up.  But if it has, it has been in deference to the most urgent requests from the other side.  At the beginning of last year constant complaints came from the other side to the effect that our veterinary officers were allowing animals through that should not be allowed through.  We endeavoured to tighten up the administration a little, to stop more cattle, to be just a little stricter, but it was not sufficient; we were behind them the whole time, and finally they wrote us a letter, a most unusual letter for one Department to write to another.  It is not exactly the kind of letter that we receive in the usual way from an English Ministry. It is dated the 17th May, 1926, from the British Ministry of Agriculture to the Secretary of the Department:&mdash;</P>
    <P>SIR.</P>
    <P>I am directed to inform you that the Ministry views with much concern the continuance of the shipment from Ireland to this country of animals coming within the scope of Article 14 of the Tuberculosis Order of 1925, which expressly prohibits the landing in Great Britain of an imported animal which is or appears to be suffering from any of the forms of disease specified in that Article.</P>
    <P>From the date of operation of the Order on the 1st September last, to the 28th April last, the Ministry's Inspectors at the various ports have detained 110 animals which, in their opinion, came within the scope of the Article, namely, 73 before the 31st December, 1925, and 37 from the latter date to 28th April.  Of these <Col N="124" /> 88 were slaughtered at the landing places and 20 were found to be suffering from tuberculosis of the udder and 62 with tuberculous emaciation or other forms of the disease viewed by the Order.  Six were found not affected.</P>
    <P>That is, of the number which they slaughtered.  They obviously slaughtered the worst cases.</P>
    <P>The Ministry recognises that some time would necessarily elapse before the shippers in Ireland and the Inspectors of the Irish Departments concerned would become thoroughly acquainted with the provisions of the Ministry's Order.</P>
    <P>The Ministry is of the opinion that the time has now arrived when action must be taken to ensure the rigid observance of the prohibition contained in Article 14 of the Ministry's Order.</P>
    <P>The Ministry has accordingly instructed its Veterinary Inspectors at ports to board steamers arriving at British ports from Ireland in order that animals may be examined before unloading commences, with a view to detect any animal whose condition appears to bring it within the scope of the Article.  In the event of any such animal being detected on the vessel, the Inspector has been directed to take all the necessary steps to prevent the landing of the animal and to inform the owner or agent of the vessel and the Irish Department concerned as to the action taken by him.</P>
    <P>In other words, to send it back.</P>
    <P>The Ministry would be glad if your Department would be good enough to issue instructions to its Inspectors with a view to all possible steps being taken to prevent animals coming within the provisions of Article 14 from being shipped.  The Ministry observes that a similar prohibition is embodied in Article 13 of the Bovine Tuberculosis Order of 1926, a strict enforcement of which by the Inspectors of your Department will speedily bring to a conclusion the shipment to this country of animals suffering from the forms of disease referred to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> As I say, that is a most unusual letter, and what it amounts to is this: &ldquo;We are tired writing you letters to say that you must stop any animal that has a tubercular udder, that appears to have a tubercular udder, or that has an indurated udder, and if you do not stop them promptly we are going to send back all such animals in future.&rdquo;  That is quite an unusual letter for a British Ministry to write to any other Government. Even when they are going to take definite steps they are generally polite, and this letter is little more than polite.  The reason we administered the Order so leniently was because we realised that in view of the trade that existed it would take shippers and owners some time to adapt themselves to the new conditions, but we have no alternative.  We have simply to stop any cow with a tubercular udder, with any sign of a tubercular udder, or any cow with an indurated udder, regardless of whether it is tuberculosis or not, because the English Ministry will presume that it is.  In any event they will say that if such an animal is English the owner will have to report it to the local authority; if it is an Irish animal let it go back and be reported there.  We know that there are cows with indurated udders that are not tubercular, and we have made representations that we should allow cows of that sort to pass in spite of the induration when we consider the induration is not due to tuberculosis, and that if we allowed animals to go over they should be taken for immediate slaughter at the ports.  That is the only possible concession that they are likely to make.  But I do not know whether they will or not.  They would be quite safe in making it.  We would give an undertaking that we would see that no animals except young fat cows with slight induration, obviously not tubercular, that we send over, are slaughtered at the ports.  If they agree to that it is the most that they will agree to.  In the meantime I am afraid the moral of the whole thing is that there will be losses in any event. The big majority of indurated udders and udder troubles occurs in cows of from nine to fourteen years of age, and farmers will have to begin to sell their <Col N="126" /> cows at nine years of age.  In my opinion, apart altogether from this Order, that would be good business, but it will take some time.</P>
