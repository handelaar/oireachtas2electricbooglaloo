      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that an English newspaper has offered to supply, from a fund at its disposal, wireless receiving sets for each lighthouse and lightship on the coast; whether the Revenue Commissioners have any power to admit such wireless receiving sets free of duty, in view of the fact that the newspaper cannot pay the duty owing to the fact that the fund was raised specifically for the purchase of wireless sets and for no other purpose; and whether it is possible for permission to be given to the Irish Lights Board to admit wireless receiving sets free of duty, or whether he could make any further suggestion as to how the difficulty can be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The Revenue Commissioners have no power to allow wireless apparatus to be imported without payment of duty in the circumstances indicated in the question; and there is no provision in the law under which the Irish Lights Board could be permitted to import wireless receiving sets without payment of duty.  I am unable to suggest any solution of the matter.</P>

    <P>
      <i>(a)</i>A specific standard was not laid down beforehand in these three examinations.  The Civil Service Commissioners were to determine on the results whether candidates had shown a sufficiently high degree of proficiency in order to be accepted for appointment.  The numbers of candidates actually accepted for appointment were 74 for the Writing Assistantships and 7 in each of the other two examinations.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works having considered the reports of their engineer and valuer on the proposals contained in the petitions transmitted to them by the County Councils of Meath and Kildare under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, in respect of the drainage of the Ryewater River, decided that the circumstances were not such as to justify the preparation of a detailed drainage scheme or the constitution of a separate drainage district in respect of the area concerned. The reason on which their decision is based is that the necessary works could not, owing to their cost, be carried out without imposing an undue burden on the occupiers of the lands that would be benefited.  The County Councils of Kildare and Meath were informed of the Commissioners' decision on the 30th December, 1926.</P>

      <P>No scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, is at present proceeding in County Meath, nor have the Commissioners of Public Works so far decided to proceed with any scheme.  Of the twenty-eight proposals transmitted to them they have, after consideration of their engineer's and valuer's reports, rejected six, viz.: (1) Dromone, (2) Rataine, Shambo, etc., (3) Fraine, (4) Stocks, Clonmore, etc., (5) Rathmore, and (6) Ryewater River.  The Commissioners have their engineer's preliminary report on the Nanny River Lower proposal under consideration and have deferred consideration of the report on the Mattock River scheme pending the receipt of a petition from the Louth County Council in the matter.  In addition, their engineers are at present engaged on inspections of seven proposals.  It cannot be stated definitely at present whether work can be begun on any of the schemes in the County Meath this year.</P>

      <P>The petition in this case was received only in December last.  The programme of the Commissioners of Public Works for inspections of proposals under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, is full for some time to come and the preliminary inspection of this district cannot, therefore, be made at present.  Considerable time must clapse before any actual work can be begun in the district because, even if the result of the preliminary inspection goes to show that the scheme is a promising one, it will then be necessary for a valuer to inspect each holding affected and to estimate the extent of the benefit and also for a more minute engineering inspection and survey to be carried out in order to determine exactly the works to be executed and to estimate their cost before a scheme can be prepared for submission to the occupiers of the lands benefited to vote upon.</P>

No. 7705) has been refused a pension, although whilst on military duty he lost the sight of one eye as the result of an injury received at the destruction of a bridge at Kilcock on the 16th January, 1921; that he received medical treatment at St. Bricin's Military Hospital during the period June 26th to August 15th, 1926, and is at present unable to find employment owing to loss of eyesight, and whether he will have the case reconsidered with a view to the immediate award of either a military service or disability pension.</P>

      <P>Mr. Maher made two applications for pensions, one under the Army Pensions Act, 1923, in respect of the injury referred to by the Deputy, and one under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924.  As regards the former, he received treatment in St. Bricin's Hospital from the 28th June, 1926, to the 14th August, 1926.  His claim to pension was disallowed on the grounds that the evidence adduced in support of the claim was not such as would justify the award of a pension. If Mr. Maher submits definite evidence as to the nature of the injury to his eye on the occasion referred to, I will' have the case reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His application under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, was disallowed on the grounds that he did not establish to the satisfaction of the Board of Assessors that he rendered the minimum amount of military service required by sub-section 4 of Section 2 of the Act.  He appealed against the findings of the Board, but as his <Col N="9" /> appeal was not made within the time specified by regulations then in force, it could not be entertained.  Under revised regulations it is now possible to entertain an appeal from him, and I am communicating with Mr. Maher in the matter.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. No additional roads can be added to the National Road Scheme, to which it is presumed the Deputy refers. The road in question is already a main road and as the grant of £12,725 notified to the County Surveyor on the 10th instant is available for the improvement of main roads it is open to the County Council to devote portion of the grant to the improvement of this, road.  The County Council have also been notified of a grant amounting to 50 per cent. and 30 per cent. of the cost of the upkeep as distinct from the improvement of the main roads for the coming year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health how many local authorities have adopted the resolution of the Galway Board of Health and Public Assistance calling on the Government to take immediate steps for the repeal of Section 6 of the Local Government Act, 1902, and to make provision in the forthcoming Finance Bill for recoupment to local authorities for one-half of the actual expenditure upon salaries of medical officers, trained nurses, compounders, sanitary officers, and upon the purchase of medicines and medical and surgical appliances, and what action he purposes to take thereon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to the present eight Boards of Health and Public Assistance have adopted the resolution.  Section 6 of the Local Government Act, 1902, enacted that the grants provided under the Local Government Act, 1898, for the recoupment of one-half the expenditure <Col N="11" /> upon medical and educational expenditure in Poor Law Unions and of salaries of Sanitary Officers should not exceed in any subsequent financial year the amount paid in the financial year ended 31st March, 1902.  Increases in these services which have taken place since 1902 fall to be met by the local authority, but in considering the incidence of such expenditure it is necessary to bear in mind the contributions made by the Government to the cost of poor law services as a whole.  Chief of these is the agricultural grant in relief of rates on agricultural land.  This grant was doubled two years ago and now amounts to £1,198,022.  Of this amount a sum of £563,621 is applicable to poor relief charges.  Thus, apart from grants made specially in aid of medical and educational expenditure and of sanitary salaries, a considerable proportion of the entire cost of poor law services in every county is being met by the agricultural grant.  For example, in Galway County, the total net estimate for poor relief charges in the rural portion of the county in the present financial year is £82,575, of which a sum of £31,503 is being met from the agricultural grant.  A somewhat similar position exists in every other county. It is not therefore proposed to effect any legislative changes on the lines suggested in the Galway resolution. No recommendation for an increase in a percentage grant for particular services could be considered without an examination of the position as a whole.</P>

      <P>Before Section 3 (2), page 4, to insert a new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every male citizen of the age of 21 years or upwards and under the age of 65 years, who is otherwise qualified for serving as a juror may have his name placed on the panel of <Col N="20" /> jurors of the jury districts for which he is qualified by expressing in writing to the registration office of the district his willingness to serve as a juror.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This proposal is made on the assumption that the amendment brought forward by Deputy Sir James Craig and approved by the Minister would be embodied in the Bill.  There is very little to be said on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;except to this effect that it substitutes, or rather introduces, the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;she&rdquo; in the amendment of Sir James Craig, so that if the Minister were to adopt this amendment also we should have co-equality of men and women before the law in regard to jury service.  As the Minister for External Affairs would say, it would implement co-equality of citizenship. Everything to be said in favour of the proposal in my amendment has been already argued by the Minister for Justice.  That is why I said, and he applauded, that there was very little to be added.  The reasons given for going back upon the Act of 1924 and also abolishing the Act of 1919, the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, were that it was inconvenient to the officials and that it was costly.  It must be very inconvenient to the officials and very costly to prepare a list of male jurors and have these called, and it must be very inconvenient to the judges to find absent jurors. When I asked the Minister, supposing that such an amendment as this were in the Bill, how many did he think would serve, he answered &ldquo;About sixty per cent.&rdquo;&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;there was a similar Act allowing men to ask for exemption (that is, of course, in reference to the Act of 1924, which he now rescinds), suppose we had merely to apply in court for exemption and exemption was accorded, what percentage of men does he calculate would be willing to serve on juries?&rdquo;  Mr. O'Higgins replied: &ldquo;About sixty per cent.&rdquo; So that a great deal of expense and trouble would be saved by this reform.  Everybody <Col N="21" /> knows that what the Minister alleged in regard to women holds equally in regard to men.  This duty of citizenship, serving on a jury, is very unpleasant.  Some idealists hold that all duties are pleasant in their discharge, but, unfortunately, the practice of life shows that many duties, even those recognised as noble, are very unpleasant.  Service on a jury is like much study, a weariness to the flesh.  If men were allowed to express their views they would, undoubtedly, add considerably to the list of exemptions set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  In order to save all the trouble of having exemption lists and inquiries, inquisitions, as to who is, and who is not, entitled to exemption, we simplify the procedure according to the Minister's argument&mdash;and I am sure to him his own argument is an excellent argument&mdash;by allowing the men who have the public spirit to desire to take part in, and assist, the administration of justice to apply to have their names registered as jurors.</P>

      <P>The Deputy bases his amendment on the assumption that because we are unwilling to impose compulsory jury service on women we should be willing to leave jury service for male citizens a purely optional matter.  That, of course, is not the position and the Deputy knows it. The amendment, if it is not derisive and, consequently, out of order, is, at any rate, very close to the line of being purely derisive in intent.  The Deputy throughout this Bill has taken the line that there should be recognised, administratively, complete parity between the position of men and that of women with regard to jury service. I do not recognise anything of the kind. I think that women themselves do not recognise anything of the kind, and this whole issue which was raised with regard to women on juries is, in fact, a minority demand and, admittedly, a minority demand.  When I say a &ldquo;minority,&rdquo; I mean it is a minority demand so far as the women themselves are concerned.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In page 4 to delete Section 3 (2), lines 11-26.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>In lines 20 to 26 of page 4 of the Bill Deputies will notice the proposal is that where the property is in the wife's name the husband shall be liable for jury service unless he is for the time being disqualified or exempt from service as a juror or proves to the satisfaction of the registration officer that he never had any interest in such land and did not directly or indirectly provide the purchase money thereof.  The purpose of that is to provide for the case where specifically in order to evade jury service a transfer of property is made from husband to wife.  Roughly speaking, this means that a well-to-do man must serve as a juror if his wife has the necessary rateable valuation, and in that way we propose to put an end to the practice of putting property in the wife's name so that the husband <Col N="23" /> may be relieved from jury service.  The idea of the Deputy's amendment is that the woman should serve and the husband go free.  In our proposal, in the first place, the woman need not serve at all unless she wants to, and I do not propose to depart from that position. Secondly, if a woman were obliged to serve in law she would not serve in practice; she would say that she was ill, or had children to mind, or that her husband's dinner would not be cooked, and the judge would either exempt her altogether or remit the fine in whole or in part.  I am not accepting the amendment.</P>

    <P>Any woman who is in every respect except sex qualified and liable to serve as a juror may apply at any time during the month of April in any year to the county registrar for the area coterminous with or including (as the case may be) the jury district in respect of which she is so qualified and liable that her name be inserted in the general lists of jurors or the draft jurors lists (as the case may require) then being revised under this Act by such county registrar, and such county registrar, if satisfied that such woman is in every respect except sex qualified and liable to serve as a juror in respect of a jury district coterminous with or included in his area, shall insert in such general lists of jurors or draft jurors lists (as the case may be) the name of such woman, her place of abode, her trade, her profession, calling, or description, and the situation, description and rateable value of the land in respect of which she is so qualified and liable, and thereupon such woman shall become and be qualified and liable to serve as a juror in respect of such jury district when and so long as the jurors list <Col N="24" /> derived from such general lists of jurors or draft jurors lists is in force.</P>

      <P>This amendment was put down to carry out the undertaking which I gave to Deputy Sir James Craig on the Committee Stage. The Deputy had an amendment down, the effect of which was that women who are otherwise qualified could be entered on the jury panel if they expressed a wish to be so entered.  The present amendment, together with amendments 4 and 5, are consequential, and are merely the official draughtsman's version of Deputy Sir James Craig's amendment, and the purpose which is sought to be effected by that amendment.  I am letting this amendment go to the Dáil without enthusiasm and simply in fulfilment of my undertaking to Deputy Sir James Craig.  It is a matter that I would like to leave entirely free to the Dáil to vote upon. I should say that it is not approved by such organisations of women citizens as exist in the city and that have had any communication with me on the question of this Bill; neither is it approved by the Attorney-General or those who are responsible for prosecutions on behalf of the State.  Probably, on the whole, I would be better satisfied if the amendment were rejected, and I wish the Dáil to vote quite freely on the matter.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said, the women's organisations containing a membership of women of very pronounced views as regards the rights to participate in the duties of citizenship declared against this amendment.  If you will allow me, sir, I will read a resolution passed at a special conference called on Monday, February 28th, to discuss the Juries Bill.  Senator Mrs. Wyse Power presided at the conference, and the following resolution was passed:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This conference, representative of women voters, is strongly opposed to the principle of a voluntary panel for women jurors, as proposed by Deputy Sir James Craig's amendment and about to be incorporated in the Juries Bill, and urges all Deputies <Col N="25" /> to vote against it.  The societies represented at the conference are the National Council of the Women of Ireland; the Irish Women Workers' Union; the Women's Cooperative Guild; Irish Women's Citizen Association; Irish Women's Equality League; Irish Women's International Peace and Freedom League.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be seen from the character of the societies represented at this conference that every social class of workers and people of leisure, and every variety of political opinion, was represented at the conference which decided against any such proposal as is suggested in the amendment being embodied in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendment is thoroughly reactionary, like the Minister's original proposal.  It sets at naught the experience of other countries.  There are over twenty States in the American Union in which women serve on juries, and judges have frequently pronounced encomiums on the value of their services.  This is the first time in history, so far as I am aware, that the reason given for exempting citizens from an unpleasant duty was that they did not like the duty, and to propose, consequently, to impose a further and more onerous duty upon those women who are willing to undertake it.  It would be utterly unfair to the women of public spirit to call upon them to do duty for all the women in this matter.  I think the Minister has argued so effectively and appealed so strongly to have this amendment defeated that there is really no necessity for anyone to labour the point further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Mr. ALTON Mr. ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister if there is any alternative between this devil of an amendment and the deep sea of the original draft Bill?  Is there any chance of getting back to the state of affairs established by the Act of 1924?  Last week, like many other Deputies, I had representations from women's associations urging me not to support this amendment.  On the other hand, I went to some trouble to find out what the opinions of some average women were on the whole <Col N="26" /> question of serving on juries.  I was fortunate enough to meet a number who had served on juries, and they were unanimous in their desire to be relieved of the task.  But if we could go back, perhaps, to the condition of affairs of the 1924 Act it might remove what is apparently regarded as a slight on the more zealous women citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG">
      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the position of the old man and his ass who tried to please everybody; I have succeeded in pleasing nobody.  There was a great complaint by certain women when in the Bill the Minister suggested that they should no longer have any right to serve as jurors.  In my innocence I thought that these women would be pleased to get an opportunity of doing this work.  I do not agree with Deputy Magennis that the reason that was put forward for introducing this amendment was that the women did not like it.  That was not the reason why I put it forward. I said that between the ages of twenty and forty the majority of women had a much more important duty to perform to the State than serving on juries, that their functions were motherhood and looking after their families, and they objected to these other women, who have missed these functions, and who wanted to drive to serve on juries those who have something else to do.  That is the position of affairs.  It is a dog in the manger attitude.  These women will not accept this amendment now when they have got a chance of serving, and they want to drag in the thousands of women who have not only an objection but have something else far more important to do.  That is the point I insist on making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has also been a great deal of talk as to whether women are capable of serving on juries or not.  I made it clear that I considered there are plenty of women just as capable of serving on juries as there are men.  I also said that I thought it would be advisable to have women on certain juries, and here we have these very women objecting to the chance they get, and they have passed resolutions stating that it is <Col N="27" /> absolutely necessary in certain circumstances that women should be on juries. I do not think anything would please them, but at all events I have not the slightest desire to try to please them. I proposed an amendment that I thought was an extremely fair-minded solution, and one that would be acceptable to everyone, because, as I pointed out&mdash;and I want to lay stress upon this again&mdash;there is a very great difference between giving women the franchise and compelling them to serve on juries. When a woman has the franchise she may or may not vote, as she pleases, but if she is put on a jury compulsorily she has to go unless she is able to find some valid excuse.  There is the greatest possible difference between these two conditions.  Then people speak about having gone behind the Constitution and having taken away from women with one hand what we have given with the other.  I have no desire in the world to press this amendment, and I have the greatest possible pleasure in withdrawing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Sir James Craig is in order in withdrawing an amendment of the Minister for Justice.  I should object to his doing so.  He spoke in parables.  I would not like to call him an old man, but he is an older man than I am, so that I presume that he must perform the function of the old man, and I the other part, in the case of the old man and his ass.  I think a very important question arises on this.  The chief argument we heard from Deputy Magennis was that it was an injustice to women that they should be tried without a woman on a jury.  Now, Deputy Magennis is going to make it impossible to have a woman on a jury, because if this amendment is not carried the result will be to go back to the status quo in the Bill, to leave no loophole by which any woman, however well qualified, however desirous, can serve on a jury.  I think that is a reactionary step.  I was opposed to compelling women who had not a wish to serve to do so at the desire of a certain small but active minority among women.  Deputy Magennis read us a long list of societies which passed a <Col N="28" /> resolution.  Can he tell us the strength of the membership of these societies? I do not want to reflect on them in any way.</P>
      <P>I know that some members of them are very useful, active and valuable citizens, but putting aside the Irish Women Workers' Union, the strength of which I do not know, I should be very much surprised if the remaining societies have a membership of one thousand.  And how many women are there in the Saorstát?  Over a million. I cannot take these societies as representative of their sex as a whole.  I will take them as representative of those of their sex who take the greatest interest in public affairs.  They do not represent the whole of the women of the Saorstát, and Deputy Magennis knows that they do not.  I do not want to see the principle of sex discrimination introduced.  I do not want to see it laid down in this Bill, with the assent and cordial support of Deputy Magennis, that no woman should ever sit on a jury in any circumstances. Therefore I hope that this amendment will not be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  I entirely agree with Deputy Sir James Craig's idea. I think it is desirable that women should be available in certain cases to serve on juries, but I think also that it should not be compulsory on them. It should be left to themselves, to their honour and to their sense of duty.  I do not think so badly of women as to think that when it is left to them in that way, those who are able and who are not bound down by certain conditions will not consider it their duty to put their names on the jury list.  I do not agree with the remark made by Deputy Johnson when this matter was previously considered.  I understood him to say that he was afraid that if women were left a voluntary choice in this matter the lists would be filled up by the class of women who rush to the courts to hear certain spicy cases.  I do not think that for one moment; I think he is mistaken in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the class of women that fill the courts when there is a sensational <Col N="29" /> case on&mdash;I do not know what they go there for; it may be to admire the clothes of one another or to criticise the prisoner in the dock&mdash;are not the women who will take any trouble about a case.  They would not put themselves out to be shut up in a box trying a case, perhaps for days.  To my mind you would not find women of that kind taking any trouble to serve on juries. The women who will go to serve on juries are those who consider it their duty to do so.  I hope and believe that there is a very large number of women actuated by principles of duty, who will consider it their duty to put their names on the jury list&mdash;those who have the time, ability and nerve for that kind of thing.  I do not think there will be any lack of suitable women coming forward to do what is their obvious duty when they have the power and the ability to carry it out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister for Justice praised this amendment with faint damns, and is supported by Deputy Magennis in open hostility to it, I believe that this proposed section should be incorporated in the Bill.  The apparent agreement of the Minister for Justice and Deputy Magennis is merely a meeting of the extremes.  The Minister for Justice evidently does not like women in any circumstances serving on a jury.  Deputy Magennis is dissatisfied. He, the exponent of the feminist claim, wants all women <Col N="30" /> brought in and compelled to serve on juries, and as such he is dissatisfied with the proposed section.  Yet, is it not a very reasonable proposal that any woman who so desires and who is qualified, may have her name placed on the register for jury service?  But evidently that does not give satisfaction. It is not suitable and it is not pre-eminently desirable for some of the leaders; they want not so much the right to serve on juries as to conscript their sisters for jury service whether the latter desire it or not, whether they can very well afford the time, or whether they have even to neglect their homes or business.</P>
      <P>I submit it is an impossible proposition for us to entertain.  It is the movement of a truculent minority, and this proposed section gives us a means out.  Just contemplate what will happen if this section is defeated.  You will have the old agitation renewed over again.  Sex disqualification, we will be told.  A wail of lamentation will go over the country.  I submit this section is a pre-eminently suitable one, and inasmuch as we want to avoid this cry of a reactionary movement of sex disqualification, we ought to support it.  I do not know how many Deputies will follow the lead of the Minister for Justice, but I certainly will press this amendment to a division and vote for it.</P>

It is inserted at the request of the officials who are responsible for preparing the panel, and is designed to relieve those officials of some unnecessary trouble.  The point of the amendment is that in the cases now in question there are two or three officials who combine to form a joint panel, each official contributing a list of <Col N="34" /> jurors from his book, the list being in alphabetical order.  Under the existing conditions these separate lists have to be re-arranged so that the combined panel is in alphabetical order.  The three smaller panels have to be reshuffled so as to produce one large alphabetical panel.  This is unnecessary trouble, and everybody will be quite as well satisfied if the combined panel is prepared without the reshuffling by merely showing the smaller panels as Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the larger panel.</P>

What is now proposed is that there shall be a standard automatic fine of £3 for a juror who does not turn up in court, but that every person who is so fined shall have an opportunity of appealing to the judge to have the fine remitted in whole or in part.  The notice informing the juror that he has been fined will enable him to put forward any excuse that he may have for the consideration of the judge. This is, I think, a fair system.  Amongst other advantages it means that the judge can consider the case which is put up to him for revision at his leisure, and may call for police reports or medical certificates to whatever extent he thinks necessary.  It is an automatic fine of £3, and there is ample opportunity for appeal to the judge subsequently, and for remission by the judge of the penalty that he imposed in the first instance.</P>

      <P>In page 20, before Section 45, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In every criminal case where the case to be tried is of an offence against a woman or child, and in any other case concerned with or affecting the property, reputation or civil rights of a woman, a mixed jury shall be empanelled to try the issue.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two distinct cases, the criminal and the civil.  It is obvious, I think, to everyone, how desirable it is as regards the criminal case that there should be some women, at least one woman, on the jury.  It may not be quite so obvious in the case of a civil suit as to why there should be a mixed jury, but a moment's reflection will show that if we are to preserve equality of citizenship, if we are to impress the public that even-handed justice is dispensed in our courts, the suspicion of prejudice or a pre-possession in the minds of a jury totally of men should be removed, say, in a case where a woman is a plaintiff in a libel action or something affecting her reputation. This amendment is put down on the assumption that there would be women jurors available, and as the amendment, in spite of the Minister's opposition, has been carried by his own vote, there will be women available for service on juries.  Presumably there will be unless, of course, the resentment of <Col N="38" /> women to the injustice perpetrated by this Bill should lead them to refrain from having their names down, but I do think that Deputy Sir James Craig's prophecy will not be fulfilled.  The women who have exerted themselves for the enfranchisement of their sex, and who have taken a lead in all social movements affecting the interests of women and children in the community, are not likely to be actuated by small motives of that type.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of this amendment seems to be that a woman or child cannot depend on a fair trial when the jury is composed only of male citizens.  That is something I am not prepared to admit.  From the beginnings of a legal system in this country juries have, in fact, been composed exclusively of males up to the year 1920, and it would be a rather serious line to take to suggest that over that long period women and children did not, in fact, get a reasonably fair trial, because of the composition of the jury.  Up to 1920 that was the position.  Juries were drawn exclusively from male citizens; theoretically or since 1920 that is not the position, but we know that in actual fact and practice it continued to be the position.  The Deputy suggests some essential antagonism between man and woman, and presumably, also, between man and child, that would prevent the administration of full justice and consequently he presses for mixed juries in any case in which a woman or child is the defendant.  He does not make any suggestion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As to the mixed jury, there is no suggestion as to the strength of the mixture, whether <Col N="39" /> it would be one in twelve or a more even proportion.

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>It might very well be.  The Minister should remember that a jury is a deliberative body which listens to evidence, criticises it, and arrives, through deliberation, at a verdict.  The requirement is to have a woman representative on that jury.  The desire is not to have a packed jury.  The Minister seems to have a packed jury in his mind.</P>

That is the mixed jury which he desires to secure under his amendment, in any case, broadly stated, in which a woman is involved.  If Deputies believe that a woman or a child cannot depend on <Col N="40" /> justice from a jury composed exclusively of males, they should vote for the Deputy's amendment.

      <P>I have considerable sympathy with the point of view expressed by Deputy Magennis, but I do not feel that I would be justified in voting for the amendment, because I think in practice it might turn out to be unworkable and prevent the administration of justice.  I can imagine that in a given district not one woman would be on the register of jurors, and if the amendment were inserted in the Bill then no criminal case in which a woman would be involved could be tried in that particular district.  From that point of view I think the amendment is impracticable, or would work out in that way, in any case.  Taking that point of view, I do not think I would be justified in supporting the amendment, although I have considerable sympathy with the point of view expressed by Deputy Magennis.</P>

      <P>I, too, would support the amendment if there was a reasonable hope that there would be a sufficient number of women from which panels could be easily formed, but I think it is obvious from what the Minister said on a previous occasion, when he told us that about 3 per cent. of women would be the most that would be willing to serve, that Deputy O'Connell's point of view is the reasonable one&mdash;that in many districts there would be no women on the register, and it would be impossible to carry on the process of justice if you must have women on juries and there are no women to serve on them.  When Deputy Magennis was speaking a few moments ago I suggested that very possibility&mdash; that possibly the women who may claim now to direct affairs for their weaker sisters may be annoyed at being given a chance to serve on juries and will not send in their names as a protest against what they think is an inequality for their sex.  At all events, I think Deputy O'Connell has hit the nail on the head when he said that in many districts it would probably be impossible <Col N="41" /> to form a jury at all if the amendment were carried.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the first part of this amendment, the idea underlying it is that if jury panels are called a considerable time before the court sits the opportunity for canvassing jurors is too great and is too much availed of. The only reason for providing panels at all is to ensure that a prisoner will have time to recognise the name of any juror to whom he believes he has a reasonable objection which would justify his challenging that juror when the panel is called in court.  He can do that readily in three days.  Of course, he will usually have far more than three days, because his particular case may not come on until after the court has been sitting for perhaps weeks, and he will have the panel in <Col N="42" /> his hands three days before the court begins to sit.</P>
    <P>As regards the latter part of the amendment, the fee of 1/- mentioned in the existing text is copied from an old Act.  The present fee is usually 2/6, and in any case it is not desirable to specify fees in Acts.  The modern practice is to provide for a prescribed fee which may be varied from time to time to meet variations in the value of money.  All court fees are now settled in fact by Order, and consequently it is proposed to change the provision in the Bill in that respect.</P>
    <P>On the question of jury panels, I want to say in further justification of the portion of the amendment dealing with that, that it is within my knowledge, and has very frequently come under my notice, that litigants from the country, defendants remanded on bail, and their relatives, come up here to Dublin a considerable time before their case comes on for trial for no other purpose than that of doing a systematic canvass of the jury panel with regard to their case.  That is a serious matter.  It is within my knowledge that it is the beaten track for litigants from the country to come up to Dublin some fortnight or three weeks before their case comes on to embark upon a systematic canvass of the panel in the hope of coming across people who will in the ultimate turn out to be jurors in their particular case.</P>

      <P>(2)  Whenever a fine is imposed on a juror under this Act the summoning officer shall forthwith send by post to such juror at his address stated in the panel in which his name appeared when such fine was imposed a notice in the prescribed form informing him of the imposition of such fine and the opportunity afforded him by this section of obtaining remission thereof, and such juror may within five days after the imposition of such fine apply in person or by letter to the county registrar for a remission of such fine on such grounds as he thinks fit to put forward.</P>
      <P>(3)  The summoning officer shall bring every application for remission of a fine made to him under this section to the notice of the judge by whom such fine was imposed or, if such judge is not then in office, to his successor and such judge or his successor (as the case may be) may, if in his opinion justice so requires, remit or reduce such fine either absolutely or subject to such conditions as he thinks proper.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 28:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 22, Section 52, to insert immediately before sub-section (2) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Whenever it is intended that more than one such issue as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section shall be tried by the jury, the oath to be administered to the jurors shall be in the form set out in the foregoing sub-section with the addition thereto of the following words, that is to say: <Col N="44" />&ldquo;and will in every respect so act in relation to all such other accused persons as may be given to me in charge for trial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The idea of this amendment is that the same juror need not be re-sworn in each separate case.  He takes the oath in a form that will cover all the cases in which he may be called upon to act as a juror at that sitting of the court. It is a device simply to save the time of the court.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Amendment 29.&mdash;In page 23, Section 55 (2), line 27, to delete all from the words &ldquo;a number of jurors&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; in line 29, and substitute the following:&mdash;&ldquo;if such persons are accused of murder or treason, ten jurors and no more and, in any other case, six jurors and no more.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of the text of the Bill as it stands have been objected to somewhat on the ground that they increased unnecessarily the challenge rights of accused persons in misdemeanour cases.  Under the existing law the accused persons in a misdemeanour must join in their challenges and cannot challenge in all more than six persons.  It is considered that that is quite sufficient, and we simply propose to re-enact it.  We recognise, however, that in cases of murder or treason where there is a possibility of the death sentence, greater latitude should be given, and it is, therefore, proposed to allow in those cases challenges up to the number of ten.  But all that, of course, refers to peremptory challenges without cause, but challenges for cause shown or stated may be made in cases without any limit of number.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 30.&mdash;In page 23, Section 55 (2), to delete line 32 and substitute the words &ldquo;jurors without causes shown but the total number of jurors so challenged by such accused persons if they are accused of murder or treason shall not exceed ten and in any other case shall not exceed six.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment 31:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 24, Section 57, after paragraph (f), line 39, to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But no challenge unless for cause shown shall be permitted in the case of women jurors who by reason of having expressed their willingness to serve as jurors have been summoned for jury service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the previous debate on this Bill I mentioned the fact that very frequently women jurors were ordered peremptorily to stand by and that in that way they were as effectively excluded from the jury service as if by statute they were ineligible.  Now, in view of the alteration in the law which requires that a woman, in order to be a juror, must voluntarily have her name set down upon the list of jurors, it is most desirable that her public spirit should not be countered by a continuance of this practice of &ldquo;stand by.&rdquo; It is quite easy to see how their attendance in court could be so penalised that in the next ensuing period for writing down or entering their names none would come forward, so that with the very easy and cheap expedient of challenge without cause, the peremptory stand-by, the whole effect of this amendment of Deputy Sir James Craig would be nullified.  It seems to me that the case for this does not require to be argued, and consequently I merely move the amendment.</P>

      <P>I could not agree to this amendment or to the principle that the challenge should apply to the entire panel with the exception of a certain class on that panel.  If it is right to allow a challenge without cause at all, and there seems to be some case for the retention of it, then it must be allowed without limitation in its application. The idea underlying the challenge without cause is that for a reason which, perhaps, it is not convenient or not desirable to state, it is considered that the presence of a particular person on a jury would prejudice the prospects of a fair hearing and a just verdict. Now, if you agree that there is any case for the peremptory challenge at all it is not reasonable to say that it should <Col N="46" /> apply to everyone except this limited class within the panel, the class of women who have no objection to jury service, and who intimate that to the officers preparing the panel, so that their names should be entered on the panel.  I could not agree, for a moment, to accept the principle of the Deputy's amendment that this challenge, limited in the extent to which it is to survive, shall be further limited in its application to certain persons who are on the panel of jurors.</P>

      <P>I am rather afraid the Minister is approaching this amendment in a spirit of formalism which is almost verging on nominalistic formalism.  His reasons are entirely abstract, without any consideration as to how this amendment will work.  In practice I believe it would work fairly well.  I am not entirely in love with the peremptory &ldquo;stand by&rdquo; without cause shown, and I think it might be very well to try an experiment, over a limited area, as to whether it would be possible to get on without it.  The best limited area I can see is the area of women jurors created by this Bill; that is, the area of qualified educated women who have sufficient public spirit and sufficient sense of public duty to be willing to attend and serve as jurors. It is not proposed by Deputy Magennis, and I would not support him if he proposed it, to abolish challenge for cause shown.  If the Government ever intended to charge Deputy Magennis with high treason or some such charge they would be justified in challenging every woman called upon that jury, because they would be naturally prejudiced in favour of so valiant a champion of their cause.  But Deputy Magennis does not propose to destroy the right of challenge of jurors from any cause shown in any issue in which it may appear detrimental to the impartial administration of justice, and those views can be plainly expounded and expressed in court on challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is merely an objection to the challenge of &ldquo;stand by.&rdquo;  I have had no evidence, unless repeated assertions are evidence, that women jurors have been constantly ordered to stand by. It has been repeatedly asserted, and it <Col N="47" /> is possible that there is some substance in it.  I think the recognition by women of their responsibilities in regard to jury service under this Bill, as now amended, merits some recognition in return on the part of the State that they shall not be dragged to court, remain there for hours, and then find, when their names are called, that they <Col N="48" /> are ordered to stand by without cause or reason.  I am sorry the Minister is opposing this amendment.  But as he was not really in favour of the amendment carried only a short time ago perhaps it is only natural.  But this amendment is the logical corollary to the amendment which the Dáil already carried by a substantial majority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is intended to deal with the case of the commercial traveller whose business takes him from his place of residence during a great part of the week.  It is an inconvenience to any business man to have to serve on a jury, but that inconvenience is very much accentuated in the case of a commercial traveller who has to carry on business throughout the country.  The ordinary business man can attend to his business for a few hours in the morning and then attend for jury service.  He may not be called for service on the jury, and then he can return to his business for the remainder of the day.  In any event, he can get back to his business in the evening, but the commercial traveller, if he is summoned to serve on a jury, loses his time, although he may not be called.  He cannot do any business on that day, and there is a possibility that he may be called upon to attend the following day.  The merits of the case are apparent, and there seems to be no necessity for argument.  The only difficulty I apprehend will be with regard to the definition of &ldquo;commercial traveller.&rdquo;  I tried to meet that difficulty when I was drawing up my amendment.  I tried to draw it up in such a way that it would be confined to those who are bona fide commercial travellers.  But, notwithstanding that, I realise that some commercial <Col N="53" /> travellers may do all their business in the city of Dublin, and that it is not altogether desirable that they should be exempted.  The only parties to whom I would desire the amendment to apply would be commercial travellers who are obliged to do business throughout the country and to whom it is a serious inconvenience and a serious loss to be obliged to remain in their residential area for jury service.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the views of the Minister on the subject are, but, since drawing up this amendment, I thought it could be improved upon, so that it would be confined definitely to those to whom it is intended to apply.  If the Minister would accept a better definition and include it in the Bill in another place, I would be satisfied.  I would be satisfied if the exemption were to apply to &ldquo;persons employed in representing any manufacturer, merchant or wholesale house for the purpose of securing orders or promoting business, whose avocation necessitates their absence from their permanent place of residence on at least four nights per week throughout the year, periods of illness and annual holidays excepted.&rdquo; If the Minister were prepared to accept that definition, I would be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The criterion for exemption from jury service has been, I suggest, not so much the question of hardship to the individual as the question of whether or not, in the balance, it was in the public interest that a particular class of men should be exempt from this necessity of serving on juries.  It is not on the grounds of hardship to the person himself&mdash;hardship to the individual&mdash;that doctors or chemists or civil servants or&mdash;as we have agreed just now&mdash;the employees of local authorities are dispensed from jury service.  It is on the grounds of the interests of the community.  It is agreed that where there is a question of human life it might be a very serious thing if the doctor were absent from his area because of the duty of serving on a jury, or if the chemist were not there to compound prescriptions, and so on.  The test has not been the amount of hardship to the individual. <Col N="54" /> In this question of commercial travellers, that is really what is sought to be made the test.  It is argued that it is a serious matter to ask a commercial traveller to attend for jury service and that he might be at a loss by having to attend.  I cannot weigh his loss as against the loss of the waiter or the tram man who loses his wages as a result of his turn coming&mdash;as it does come once every three years or three and a half years&mdash;to serve, or to be available for service, as a juror.  In Northern Ireland a committee considered this question of jury exemptions and other matters pertinent to the question of juries very carefully.  They considered this claim for exemption on behalf of commercial travellers, and one can understand that to the community up there the question of commercial travellers would be one of considerable importance.  The exemption was refused after the arguments had been very fully urged before the committee.</P>
      <P>I do not think that it could be contended that from the point of view of public interest there is a case for the exemption of commercial travellers; and that, after all, ought to remain the criterion. They are, of course, a class of men who are useful and competent jurymen with a knowledge of life and the ways of the people, and with, of course, a particular equipment for deciding, say, issues that arise from the commercial life of the country, and they are men who would have a special interest in seeing that contracts&mdash;business contracts&mdash;were upheld, and so on. Sizing up the public interest, I see nothing to offset the loss from the jury panel of capable men, men very specially equipped almost for that particular service, and I see no public interest that clamours for their exemption.  I am not prepared really to accept the criterion of individual hardship because that applies pretty well all round, to the waiter, the tramway man, and all those people who have little houses of their own and are rated in a sufficient amount to be liable for jury service. Their loss is as important to them as is the loss of profits to the commercial traveller or to his firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not inclined to accept this amendment at all for that reason.  If, <Col N="55" /> in fact, a commercial traveller is absent in the West, or, let us say, down in Minister on the day when it falls to his lot to be available for jury service, then I submit that once the facts are put before him, any judge, once he is satisfied as to the accuracy of the statement, will use the power that is vested in him by amendment 27, which was passed to-day, and he will cancel or mitigate the fine.  That is, of course, the strongest case, the case of a man who is down the country on business on a particular day, and there is a case for putting the facts before the judge post-factum and asking for cancellation or mitigation of the fine imposed on him for absence.  I know that special cases of that kind will arise, but I do not see any compelling argument for the exemption of entire classes of commercial travellers.  Incidentally, it is a difficult thing to define a commercial traveller. It is rather like the elephant&mdash;you know him when you meet him, but it is rather a more difficult thing to define him.</P>
    <P>There is pressure from practically every organised body for exemption. Every association sees a strong case for the exemption of its members, and the association of commercial travellers is actively looking for this exemption on behalf of its members.  Incidentally, they all wish to have a reference in the statute to an association, so that people who are outside the association, and who perhaps, it is felt ought to be inside, will be driven in if they want exemption.  If I were to accept, as I do not accept, the principle of the amendment, I would not accept, either in regard to this or any other class, the idea of specifically mentioning an association, but I am against the amendment in its substance quite apart from any question of form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not quite so plausible in this matter as he sometimes contrives to be.  The parallel which he draws between the waiter or the tramway man and a recognised commercial traveller will not stand criticism.  The commercial traveller by the very nature of his occupation, is away from home a large part of the season.  He begins a tour which is mapped out for him as a rule by his <Col N="56" /> employer.  If he is not able to complete the rounds within a given time and get his orders, his value to the firm is considerably lessened.  So it is not merely that he is inconvenienced by being obliged to take a journey back and make a case in the court for exemption. He is hit in other ways; the employer of the traveller is hit; the shopkeeper to whom he should submit his samples and from whom he should procure orders is likewise inconvenienced.</P>
      <P>There is no parity between the class the Minister mentions and the class formed by the commercial traveller. The Minister likewise sees no hardship because there is a remedy, he says, in the amendment we passed just now. What is that?  That while the judge may condemn with a fine the absent juror, when the case is put up to him he will commute the fine or he will pardon the technical offence.  That involves two things alternatively; either the conscientious and, perhaps, nervous traveller leaves his work and makes an attempt to attend in court or, if he does not, he has to rely on the gamble that the judge will be of a pleasant mind and merciful.  But suppose the judge will not, then he is suffering the double penalty of leaving his day's work&mdash;his week's work, practically&mdash;unaccomplished, and likewise being fined.  The Minister strives also to lay down a principle.  On what principle are barristers exempted?</P>

      <P>Barristers are notoriously men on the hazard. They attend in court in the hope of being feed by solicitors, and many of them, I grieve to say, go for years even at a time without that pleasant stimulus to activity.  Yet because the barrister from the very nature of his occupation should not be called away from court, he is exempted.  I do not comprehend why the Minister makes exemption of that type and sees reasons for being adamant in the case of a class of occupation which is far better entitled, from the very nature of it, to exemption.  The Minister says the commercial traveller is a man of the world; he is acquainted with life; he understands <Col N="57" /> contracts and the rest of it; a fortiori so does a barrister, and yet he is exempt.  I suggest the Minister has no case in this matter except simply that he has made up his mind beforehand and is therefore not to be won over even by a member of his own party.</P>

    <Title>BILLS FROM THE SEANAD. - ARMY PENSIONS (No. 2) BILL, 1927&mdash;FOURTH STAGE.</Title>
    <P>Amendment 1.&mdash;In page 2, Section 1, line 28, to delete the word &ldquo;eighty&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;thirty&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Tomás de Nogla)&mdash;not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, Section 1, line 28, to delete the word &ldquo;eighty&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;fifty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the Committee Stage of this Bill I moved an amendment to substitute the word &ldquo;twenty&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;eighty.&rdquo;  The effect of this amendment is to reduce the percentage of the degree of disablement due to illness. As the Bill stands, a person would want to be eighty per cent. disabled as a result of disease contracted during service before he would be entitled to any pension.  The minimum percentage of disablement in respect of wounds is only twenty per cent.  Now, the Minister refused to accept the amendment which I moved on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> I do not think that the Minister was able to meet the case put up for the amendment.  A man who would be 80 per cent. disabled would, I submit, be almost a dead man&mdash;he would, at all events, be eight-tenths dead&mdash;and that any deliberative assembly would put into an Act that the minimum of disablement should be 80 per cent. is something unthinkable.  It was suggested to me that there was too great a gap between what was in the Bill and what was in my amendment during the Committee Stage, namely, that between 80 per cent. and 20 per cent., and, in order to give the Dáil an opportunity of doing something fair in the matter, I have put down this amendment.  I submit that it is a very fair one.  I am not at all satisfied that 20 per cent. disablement due to disease is not even a more serious matter for the man who is trying to get employment than 20 per cent. disablement due to a wound.</P>
    <P>A wound is a definite thing, and you know how it has affected a man and how it is likely to affect him.  Disease, however, is a different matter.  A man may be fairly well to-day but may be very bad to-morrow.  It would be more difficult, I submit, for a man who has been disabled, to any extent you like, by disease contracted during service to get work and retain it than it would be for a man similarly disabled by a wound.  I have not heard the Minister make any case as to why there should be such a great difference between the disability percentage for wounds and that for disease.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment; if he does not, I hope the Dáil will have something to say on the matter.  If the Minister insists on the word &ldquo;eighty&rdquo; remaining in the Bill he might as well wipe the Bill out altogether because, unless a man can prove to the satisfaction of the court to be set up under the Act that he is disabled to the extent of 50 per cent as a result of disease actually contracted on service, his case will not be considered.  It seems to me that a man who gave service to his country, who contracted disease while on such service, and who, as a result, is 50 per cent. disabled, is entitled to some consideration from the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. During the Committee Stage of the Bill the Minister was half in agreement with those Deputies who asked to have the disablement percentage reduced from 80 per cent.  If a member of the I.R.A. in 1916 joined the National Army in 1922 and contracted tuberculosis, or some other disease, and if his earning capacity is reduced by 50 per cent., he is not capable of earning a wage sufficient to maintain himself and his family.  According to this section, if the 80 per cent. is allowed to remain, he would not be entitled to get any assistance, notwithstanding the fact that he acquired disease through service to the State.  It will be very hard on a soldier to prove that he did actually contract disease while on service. Considering the number of men who will get pensions under this Bill it would not be worth while for the Minister to reject the amendment.  If a man loses an arm or a leg he is not entitled to anything.  If he fell off a lorry, and as a result of the accident one of his legs had to be removed, he would not be entitled to anything, notwithstanding the fact that his whole earning capacity is gone.</P>
      <P>If a man contracted disease through hardships while suffering as a member of the Volunteers or of the National Army he would have to go to a great deal of trouble to prove that he contracted disease while on service.  Even if 70 per cent. of his capacity is gone he would not be entitled to one penny under the Act.  That is very hard treatment to give to men who served their country.  If this Act is allowed to remain as it is, it will deprive them of their rights to a pension.  If a man loses 80 per cent. of his capacity, what use is the remaining 20 per cent. to him?  What is he able to do for himself or his family?  If he lost an arm or a leg or if one of his lungs is affected he is really useless as a wage-earner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been proved by medical men that a man with one lung might live for years, but on the other hand, he might drop off at any time.  Nevertheless, such a man would get nothing under this Bill.  Surely the Minister will see that some little justice is done to men who answered the call of their <Col N="61" /> country.  I would have preferred to support Deputy Nagle's amendment if he moved it, as I think that even 50 per cent. disablement is too high.  I believe it should be 20 per cent.  If a man is disabled to the extent of 20 or 30 per cent. he will get no compensation, but will have to be an incumbrance on the rates or the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  Will the Government, or any member of the Government Party, take into their service a man who is 70 per cent disabled and pay him £2 10s. a week?  Given the choice of two men who would they take&mdash;the man who is fit physically and able to do his work, or a man who is really unable to work owing to losing 70 per cent. of his capacity? I know it is the intention of the Minister and of the Government to try and do what they can to give gratuities or pensions to men who have sacrificed a great deal in order that this Government might function, and I ask the Minister, in the interests of justice, to accept the amendment and to fix the extent of disablement at 50 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments that were used in regard to this question on the Committee Stage could again be used now.  The question as to whether the percentage of disablement should be 50 or 80 could be argued for a long time.  Deputy Morrissey laid great stress on the case of the man who got a gratuity with 20 per cent. disablement due to a wound.  There is a great difference between disablement due to wounds and disablement due to disease. You know how a man got the wound and you know that the wound is there, and what disablement is attached to it, but in the case of disease&mdash;we are now only dealing with cases of disease&mdash;it is impossible to say how a man contracted it.  If it could be proved beyond doubt that a man was healthy when he joined either the Volunteers or the National Army it might be easy to adjust matters, but no one at this stage can say whether or not he was, and in framing this Bill it was never intended that every case should be dealt with.  It was intended that cases of hardship would be brought in, and it is the opinion of my advisers and myself that 80 per cent. <Col N="62" /> disablement is a fair minimum to set down.</P>
      <P>If you put down 50 per cent., 40 per cent., or any other percentage, the same argument would apply&mdash;why not make it 10 or 20 per cent. less.  Deputy Lyons said that if Deputy Nagle had moved his 30 per cent. amendment he would rather support it than the one moved by Deputy Morrissey.  Be that as it may, you have the Bill as it stands.  This is not a case of where you have a wound, where you know what happened, and what the actual disability was.  Here is a case of disease, and we are catering only for cases where hardship exists and are not catering for everyone who has suffered some inconvenience by his activities. We have to take the taxpayers into account. We anticipate, as I said on previous stages of the Bill, that a great number of cases, probably 20,000, will come up for consideration, and if these were to be dealt with on the basis set out in the amendment, it would not be possible to calculate what the result would be to the country.  Taking everything into account, I think the minimum in the Bill is a reasonable one, and I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tells us we have the Bill as it stands&mdash;we have a well-considered, carefully-drafted, elaborately-thought-out piece of legislation, and yet out of 24 amendments on the Report Stage 21 stand in the name of the Minister for Defence. We have not the Bill as it stands.  We have the Bill as the Minister is going to alter it.  It is indisputable that a man with 50 per cent. disability can work only three days a week instead of six.  That is the basis on which disability is fixed.  Is not a man with 50 per cent. disability entitled to some compensation?  I know there are difficulties in fixing a disability percentage, but these difficulties have been overcome in other places.  If the disability percentage is fixed at 80 per cent it means that only a hopeless cripple can hope to benefit under this Bill.  A man may be laid up with rheumatism or tuberculosis, not bad enough to be sent to a sanatorium and not able to do any work, and he could not hope to get any <Col N="63" /> benefit from this Bill.  The amendment is a reasonable one and will meet many cases of serious hardship&mdash;possibly 500 cases&mdash;and it is one which I think ought to be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister takes up the same attitude he took up on the Committee Stage.  He says: &ldquo;This is the Bill agreed on, and this is the minimum percentage of disability we agreed on,&rdquo; and from that position he is not prepared to move. He put up no real arguments on previous occasions or to-day in support of his attitude.  The Minister made one point that has the semblance of an argument but yet which does not bear examination.  He said that there was a difference between a wound and a case of disease, that in the case of a wound we know how it happened and that there was no doubt about it.  Now is it not the case that before a pension is granted under this Bill it must be proved absolutely and conclusively that the disease was contracted in the course of service?  If that is not proved then there is no case for a pension, and the onus of proof is on the claimant.  It cannot be taken as an argument in opposition to the amendment that doubt exists as to how the sickness occurred.  There is no room for doubt in the provisions of the Bill. It must be proved definitely that the disease was contracted while on military service.  The Minister spoke about the effort the Government has made to meet cases of hardship.  Does he contend that a man who is 50 per cent. disabled is not an instance of very great hardship if his earning capacity is reduced to that extent?  He is not in a position to support himself properly, and medical expenses would be a big drag on whatever he would be able to earn, and that would be very little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What, in effect, the Minister says is that what is proposed would be too much of a load to put on the country. Has he calculated what it would be? He talks of 20,000 applicants.  There may be that number, but there will not be 20,000 entitled to pensions, even if they were granted on the basis of Deputy Morrissey's amendment, which is <Col N="64" /> a reasonable one.  If Deputy Nagle was here to move his amendment I would support it and vote for it, but I did not take the responsibility of moving it on his behalf in his absence, as I prefer to stand with Deputy Morrissey on this amendment, which, if anything, fixes the disability of percentage too high.  The country has carried greater burdens than would be occasioned by accepting Deputy Morrissey's amendment.  Many people have got pensions who are not as well entitled to them as the men for whom we plead here.  We think it would be a lasting disgrace to the State to pass this Bill, and that it would be far decenter to withdraw it rather than be giving many people the idea that they were going to get pensions and then to find out that they would only get them not merely if they had one foot in the grave but unless they were up to their neck in the grave.  I hope the Minister will change his mind and accept the amendment; if not, we will press the matter to a division, and we will see then what the opinion of the Deputies is regarding such a reasonable proposal.</P>

      <P>It is a fact that we are four years from the date when most of these disabilities were incurred, and it is no contribution to the debate to say that young men are walking around with pensions.  If they are walking around with pensions they gave service to the State, a considerable portion of it at no remuneration whatever, when other citizens were employed in remunerative undertakings and their lives safe.  Under this measure a man with six months service in the Army will be entitled, if he has an eighty per cent. disability now, to a pension, and, as I said before, a twenty per cent. disability four years ago would, in the majority of cases, be an eighty per cent. disability now.  The real period of active service began in July, 1922, and to all intents and purposes it ended twelve months later.  In many cases men gave six months service at that time.  Some of them may not have been on active service at all.  I will admit that they bore arms; I will admit that it is possible they contracted a great many diseases, but there are other walks in life in which it is also possible to contract diseases, and if Deputies opposite had men in their service who contracted rheumatism, or something of that sort, they might not be so anxious to give them pensions.  We happen to be at the moment the custodians of the taxpayers' money in this and other matters.</P>

      <P>There would be a difference between fifty per cent. and eighty per cent.  I notice that while there is a great deal of support for fifty per cent. nobody told us what it was.  Deputy Cooper was the only one who attempted to do so, and he gave us a sort of lame explanation&mdash;a man who could work only three days in the week.  I have a fairly varied experience of men, but I have not come across a man who was able to do only three days work in the week.  If he was able to do three he would probably be able to do four.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not conduct a medical examination, or have one conducted, in respect of any man I employ, and I do not think people usually do.  But I have come across cases of men who, within a month of their deaths from disease, were working a full week, men who worked up to the very last.  I am putting to Deputies on the other side the difficulty of deciding what is a fifty per cent. disability. You do not get a three days a week example, and an eighty per cent. disability is really a case in which a man is unable to work.  That was all that was intended when this clause was put into the Bill.  We do not believe that it would be possible to administer the measure and give most generous consideration to all the cases by putting in any other percentage.</P>

      <P>The President has accused me of making a lame explanation. I will now try to mend my gait and amplify my definition, which was a very rough definition, I admit.  A fifty per cent. disability means that a man's earning capacity has been reduced by half.  Possibly he may work only three days a week.  More probably he can only work a fortnight in the month, because of some recurrent disease, malaria, or some such thing, or even more probably, owing to the fact that he is partly disabled by disease, his power of doing work is such that his employer can only put him on to light work and cannot pay him the same wages he would be capable of earning if he was in full enjoyment of his health.  That is the full definition. Now, when the President said that the amendment might have been accepted four years ago&mdash;and it was not Deputy Morrissey's fault that the amendment was not accepted four years ago&mdash;but that now all these cases have been so aggravated by the passage of time that it is impossible to deal with them on that basis, he is flying in the face of <Col N="68" /> all the pensions experience of the British Army.</P>

      <P>The President told us of his own experience in regard to employment. I do not know whether it refers to large numbers of people or not, but if the President will for his own information ask for a return of the sickness list of any firm which employs any appreciable number of ex-National <Col N="69" /> Army men, he might be surprised to see the extent they absent themselves from duty owing to sickness contracted during service in the National Army.  I have seen returns which have to be made out in regard to men who are employed by railway companies and who served in the British Army.  They have to be made out in the case of men who are drawing pensions from the British Army.  The President would be amazed if he asked for a return from such a firm as, say, Guinness's or the railway company, to see the number of days and wages lost as a result of sickness, to some extent or perhaps solely, contracted while serving in the British or the National Army.  I do not know what his experience is in regard to the number of men employed in the firms he has in mind.  If he asks for a return from some reputable firm&mdash;there are many firms who have given a preference to ex-National Army men&mdash;he would probably have a better appreciation of the extent to which these people suffer from sickness contracted in the National or the British Army.  Perhaps the Minister for Defence will at some greater length enlighten us regarding his definition of what is eighty per cent. disability.  If he does not do it for the purpose of giving some enlightenment to Deputies, perhaps he will do it for the purpose of giving some guidance to the members of the Board who will be appointed to administer the Act.</P>

I would ask the Minister favourably to consider the points I made in connection with one case in which an iron sheet fell on a man's foot.  As a result his foot had to be taken off.  Another case was a case in which a rifle went off by accident, and as a result a man lost his leg.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 21, to add at the end of Section 4 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In the case of those persons who signed the proclamation published on Easter Monday in the year 1916 in connection with the rising of April and May of that year and in respect of whom the Minister may give or shall have given certificates under Section 8 of the Principal Act, the Second Schedule to the Principal Act shall as from the passing of this Act apply and have effect as if the respective amounts of the several allowances and gratuities specified in that Schedule were double the amounts actually specified therein.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 8, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Whenever the Minister shall consider the amount of pension, allowance, or gratuity reported by the Army Pensions Board to be excessive or wherever the applicant shall be dissatisfied with either the amount of pension allowance or gratuity reported or the degree of disability assessed an appeal shall lie to a Pensions Appeal Board established under this section, whose decision shall be final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Pensions Appeal Board <Col N="73" /> shall consist of a Chairman and four ordinary members, all of whom shall be appointed by the President of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>(3)  The ordinary members of the Pensions Appeal Board shall be duly qualified medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister may with the consent of the Minister for Finance make rules regulating the functions and procedure of the Pensions Appeal Board.</P>
    <P>(5)  The powers given to the Army Pensions Board under sub-section. (7)  of Section 5 of this Act shall likewise apply to the Pensions Appeal Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment differs entirely from my previous amendment defeated on the Committee Stage.  I say that to put myself in order.  My previous amendment contemplated the establishment of an Army Pensions Appeal Tribunal to which the disappointed applicant could appeal.  My present amendment contemplates the establishment of an Appeal Board to which either the Minister or the applicant can appeal.  My previous arrangement was one-sided, but my present proposal is impartial, and is rendered all the more necessary because of an amendment which the Minister carried on the Committee Stage deleting the words that the decision of the ordinary Army Pensions Board should be final.  I also had an amendment down to that effect, but mine was coupled with the establishment of an appeal tribunal.  The Minister has abolished the finality of the decision of the Board, and at the same time has set up no form of appeal.  In other words, the Minister will be able to overrule any decision of the Army Pensions Board.  Its decisions will no longer be final, and presumably the Minister will be able to overrule them. The only remedy against the Minister would be an action in the law courts, and most of the applicants for pensions would not have the means to bring a lawsuit.  The President, speaking on the last amendment, said that the Minister does not do that.  In the Bill as it now comes before us the Minister can overrule the Board because he has removed the finality of decision from the <Col N="74" /> Board.  Accordingly, I suggest to the Minister and to the Dáil that it is absolutely necessary that there should be an appeal.</P>
    <P>As regards the form of the Appeal Tribunal, I have followed Deputy Bolger and Deputy Martin Conlon in the amendments that they put down on the Committee Stage, and which were then held to have been disposed of.  The Appeal Board will consist of a chairman and four medical members, all appointed by the President.  I believe that the President would appoint a fair-minded Board, and I am quite sure that the fact that four members are medical men will ensure that their decisions are dictated by knowledge and impartiality.  My proposed Appeal Board would have all the powers of the original Board.  As this is the only chance I will have of putting the matter before the Minister, I shall try and place myself in the state of mind of the man who has been waiting for a pension for more than four years and then is deprived of it, as he thinks, on a technicality.  That man is naturally resentful.  He is not a very well educated man and is not familiar with the details of legislation.  If a case comes before the Board and that the Board rejects the appeal and reduces the applicant's disability to lower than eighty per cent., or if the Minister refuses the decision of the Board, he will feel hurt and injured that he has no further course to take.  I know very well what he will do.  He will write to Deputies, probably to Deputy Byrne. The Deputy will have to tell him that the only thing that can be done is to put down a question.</P>
    <P>I want to see something more valid and effectual than putting down questions, and I want to have some reasonable chance of revision in such cases. I am quite sure that the Board appointed by the Minister will do their best to secure fair play.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the Minister, or anybody connected with the administration of the Act, will do anything to try to bias the Board or to influence the scales of justice, but the best of us make mistakes, and in the administration of an Act like this mistakes are bound to arise.  The only <Col N="75" /> conceivable means of correcting them is to provide for a reasonable court of appeal.  The Minister's idea of a court of appeal is that provided in the Bill, but I want to take the appeal away from the administrative side on to the judicial side.  I believe that the amendment which I propose will do so, and that it will create a court of appeal that will be satisfactory alike to the Minister and to the applicant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  I agree with Deputy Cooper that if the President had the making of appointments, such as he suggests, he would certainly appoint people who would be above suspicion.  The Deputy and the House must at the same time recognise that the machinery proposed for dealing with applicants who think they have grievances is such as will work well in the interests of applicants and the State.  In the first instance, an applicant is examined by the Board.  Naturally, he puts his case in the best way possible in order that he may get a pension.  The case is fully thrashed out, and if the man is not satisfied with the decision of the Medical Board he has the right of appeal to the Minister. The Minister will not decide the case himself.  If he thinks that a case is made, he will send it back to the Board for further consideration.  Then there is the provision enabling the Board to call in a consultant from outside&mdash;a surgeon or physician of repute in the City of Dublin.  He will be asked to come in and assist the Pensions Board in coming to a decision.  That is a safeguard on behalf of the applicant.  I think it goes a long way to meet any difficulty that Deputy Cooper or any other Deputy might have in the matter of giving due regard to cases put forward by applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Appeal Board were set up I can say that it would be probably two years before any of the deserving cases or the hard cases that are going to be dealt with now would be finally settled.  You would be bound to have appeals, perhaps, on both sides.  I do not want to put any Board in a position that they will have to refuse every case.  I would like to set up a <Col N="76" /> Board in which I can have absolute confidence and the pensioner can have absolute confidence and which will see that fair play is done between the State and the applicant for a pension.  That is the view I take of the matter.  There is no use in setting up a Board in which you have not absolute confidence. It would be a wrong idea, to my mind, to have a Board who would have two sets of appeals thrown on them.  They would not come to as reasonable or just a decision fearing that appeals would be coming up every day and going against them.  When they know that they are to be final arbiters and that the Minister would accept their finding, they would be a much better Board.  In the case of the Army Pensions Board at present appeals come along to me from people and if any kind of a good case is made I send them back for further consideration. That is the position I have taken up all along and I think it is a reasonable one.  This Board now, as Deputy Cooper pointed out, is not conclusive. There is an appeal to the Minister.  That appeal to the Minister is to have the case re-opened and to let the applicant produce whatever additional evidence he can.  Further, you have the opinion of an eminent surgeon or physician of the City of Dublin brought to bear on the case. Taking everything into account the Bill as it stands gives a pretty good safeguard to the pensioner and no pensioner will have his case worsened by having it finally disposed of as laid down in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ALFRED BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's statement that an outside medical man will be brought in to assist the Board can the same privilege be given to a claimant for a pension and will he be allowed to bring in a medical man to state his case for him? Is it right that an Appeal Board should give a decision against a man when other medical officers are satisfied that this man's case is a good and genuine one, worthy of compensation? In the law courts to-day you see very eminent medical men differing in their opinions.  One may be engaged for the Tramways Company and the other for <Col N="77" /> someone who met with an accident. You have conflicting opinions there and the matter is left in the hands of a judge.  I can well believe that the decision of the judge, if it were only based on the view of one medical officer, would very often go against the claimant, whereas if the claimant is allowed to put his case properly and submit evidence by his own doctor it might change the views of the tribunal.</P>

      <P>I shall reply to Deputy Byrne, although the matter is not in order.  He is thinking of the expert witness who is brought in to give evidence in a certain direction.  The man going to be brought in here, the surgeon or physician from outside, is not brought in on the side of the Government or of the taxpayer, but simply to do justice between both of them. He is not an expert in the sense in which Deputy Byrne refers to the medical witness of the Tramways Company. He is a man who is impartial and whose evidence no one could impeach.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my disappointment that two specific cases which I have brought before the Minister on many occasions have not apparently been covered by this Bill. They were cases due to accidents which occurred.  In one case a man lost his foot and in the other a man lost his leg.  In these cases the men were told that their injuries were due to carelessness on their part.  If these men were in the employment of anybody else but the State they would be entitled to compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  Is it right or proper that because these men are accused of handling firearms contrary to regulations they should not be compensated by the State?  In one case the young man was cleaning up in one of the barracks and lifted a sheet of iron, but he found that the handles were almost red-hot, with the result that he dropped the iron on his instep.  After twelve months his foot had to be taken off.  It was said that this was necessary owing to the presence of a tubercular bone in the instep, and that under the existing Act he could not be compensated. The other case I have brought before the House on many occasions, and I think it aroused the sympathies of every Deputy, including the Minister, if he could deal with it under the Act. It occurred in connection with the raid on Amiens Street Post Office.  This young man happened to be washing up when the raid took place, and was not in uniform.  He rushed upstairs to defend the premises and took up the rifle in such a way that it went off, wounding him, and he lost his leg as a consequence.  Both these young men are now going around on crutches, are not able to secure any employment, and, apparently, are not entitled to any compensation. If they were in outside employment they would have got some compensation, no matter how small.  I do not wish to blame the Government in this matter, but I would ask them to give sympathetic consideration to the cases of these young men.  They are the only cases that do not appear to be dealt with under this Bill, because it is said that their injuries took place as a result of their own carelessness.</P>

      <P>I know the two cases, and they are probably hard cases, as the Deputy has pointed out, but I do not know the facts.  Courts of Inquiry were set up, and these cases were investigated. These courts had all the facts before them and heard all the evidence, both that of the persons who met with these accidents and other persons who witnessed them, and everybody who could throw any light on the matter.  These Courts of Inquiry came to certain conclusions.  The allegations were that there was carelessness, and the Court found accordingly.  If these cases had come under the Workmen's Compensation Acts I do not think the applicants would fare any better, if carelessness was proved, before the Court.  No man can get any benefit under the Workmen's Compensation Act unless it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that he used due care in the execution of his duty and in the doing of the work for his employer.</P>

      <P>In moving the Second Stage of this Bill, I think I may congratulate the Dáil and the Government on having got so far towards the solution of a problem which has troubled this country for many years past.  But if the scheme is brought into successful operation, the credit will be due, not only to the Dáil and the Government, but also to the counties concerned for contributing substantial financial assistance, and not least, perhaps, to the skilful engineers who have succeeded in producing a practical scheme at a practicable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be reasonable for me to detain the House with the history of all the projects for improving the Barrow which succeeded one another during the nineteenth century; the outstanding fact is that until we started work last August no man had ever put a spade or a pick into the ground, so far as I can learn, for the purpose of arterial drainage on that river.  Extensive works were carried out in the eighteenth century for the purpose of navigation in the lower part of the course&mdash;from Athy; but the part of the river above Athy, where the lands suffer most from floods, was absolutely untouched.  An attempt was made by the British Government, 40 years ago, to deal with this problem, but it fell <Col N="84" /> through owing to lack of popular support.</P>
    <P>The modern history of this subject begins in March, 1924, with a very representative deputation from the districts affected by the Barrow floods to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. That deputation urged the Government to carry out the scheme proposed by the British Government in 1889.  They estimated the present cost at £800,000, and said that the locality would pay half if the Government would pay the other half.  That is a promise of £400,000.  Of course the locality includes the improved lands&mdash; it was not intended that the whole £400,000, or even the greater part of it, should be paid out of the county rates. Nevertheless, I think the Dáil will agree that that offer represented a very considerable advance in the public spirit of the localities concerned.  The Government took that view; and after taking time to think it over, decided to accept the offer.  That is to say, that they would inquire into the engineering question, and if they could get a practicable engineering scheme they would carry it out and pay half the cost out of public funds, with the assent of the Dáil, provided the other half was paid by the improved lands and by the counties concerned.  And as there has been a certain amount either of misunderstanding or of misrepresentation about this matter, particularly at election times, I wish to assert here quite plainly that at no time and in no place did the Government promise any more than that, and at no time since they gave the promise have they withdrawn from it.</P>
    <P>But it was by no means as simple as it looked to find a practicable engineering scheme.  The first step, naturally, was to investigate the records of the scheme of 1889, that mentioned by the deputation&mdash;a scheme associated with the name of Mr. Gamble.</P>
    <P>The result of the investigation was, in the first place, to raise grave doubts whether the scheme was a good one, and in the second place to establish that, good or bad, it was not in a condition in which it could be carried out or published immediately.  The Government, thereupon, decided that they could not <Col N="85" /> take the risk of proceeding with that scheme without further advice; and they asked Professor Meyer-Peter of Zurich to advise.  His report, dated March, 1925, has been published and is, no doubt, familiar to the minds of the Teachtaí, but as the matter is complicated it will be useful for me to summarise the leading facts and figures. Professor Meyer-Peter did not think the scheme of 1889, Mr. Gamble's scheme, was conceived on the right lines; in particular he thought that scheme contained too much embankment and too little excavation.  He therefore proposed a fresh scheme, for which he gave an estimate of £1,130,000.  But he pointed out that all previous estimates of cost, and also his own, rested upon a very poor basis of ascertained fact, because at no time had there been any actual measurement of the flow of the river.  Now, in designing a new channel for a river an engineer must necessarily begin by deciding what amount of water he will provide for; on that his whole scheme depends.  But no one had ever attempted to ascertain by direct measurements what amount of water comes down the Barrow in a flood; all the engineering schemes, including Professor Meyer-Peter's own, were founded on estimates of flow, and these estimates differed widely.  Professor Meyer-Peter, therefore, advised that the actual flow should be ascertained by measurement before the Government committed itself to any scheme.  This was done; it was a matter of some time, because, of course, it is necessary to measure the flow on many days in varying conditions of high and low water, before you can get trustworthy results.</P>
    <P>The result of the flow measurements was, very fortunately, to show that all the engineers had over-estimated the amount of water brought down by the Barrow.  I say very fortunately, because if it were really necessary to spend £1,100,000 on this scheme I do not think it would be done at all.  The Government was ready to ask the Dáil to pay one half, that is £550,000, but I do not think the localities could well have borne the other half.  I do not wish to weary the Dáil with too many <Col N="86" /> figures, but I will just mention the various estimates of the flow.  Mr. Manning, an eminent engineer who made a scheme in 1885, provided for 400,000 cubic feet of water per minute passing Athy at maximum flood.  Mr. Gamble, who made the scheme for the Bill of 1889, provided for 320,000. Professor Meyer-Peter's estimate for maximum flood was 486,000.  The actual measurements of the flood of February, 1926, which appears to have been one of the largest ever known on the Barrow, gave 268,000 cubic feet per minute.</P>
    <P>Acting therefore on the measurements of flow which we owe to Professor Meyer-Peter's advice, the Government decided to have a modified and reduced scheme prepared. This has been done by Mr. Chaloner Smith, an engineer in the service of the office of Public Works, whose name is known among hydraulic engineers by his work on the flow of the Shannon. If the scheme for the Barrow is carried out successfully, that success should be associated with the names of Professor Meyer-Peter and Mr. Chaloner Smith.</P>
    <P>The estimate for the modified and reduced scheme is £425,000 and we are advised that it will be practicable to obtain, for that sum, immunity from ordinary high floods for the lands on the Barrow, and, what is more important for the farmers, to secure that any abnormal floods which come upon the lands will not lie there long, and that the ordinary water level under the soil throughout the year will be reduced rendering thorough drainage practicable.</P>
    <P>Coming to the specific provisions of the Bill, I think it is not necessary to go into detail at this stage except on one point&mdash;finance.  The other provisions, apart from finance, are much the same as those with which the Dáil is familiar in the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925 and the Owenmore Drainage Act of 1926.  But the financial provisions are new.</P>
    <P>The maximum expenditure for which the Bill provides is £425,000. If it turns out to be necessary to spend more, we shall have to bring in another Bill, but we think it will not <Col N="87" /> be necessary.  Clause 9 says that the Government is to pay half the cost, within that limit, as a free grant.  The other half will be advanced by the Government and repaid on the ordinary terms for Arterial Drainage loans by the improved lands and the counties concerned.  In addition to the repayment of the capital cost, there will be an annual charge for maintaining the works.  We cannot tell what that will be, but we estimate it, one year with another, at £4,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Now the Government proposes, with the assent of the Dáil, to grant not only half the capital cost but also, during the period of repayment of capital, to grant half the cost of maintenance, provided the works are properly maintained.  That is, of course, a very exceptional provision, but we think it justified in this case.  Now let us see how the finance works out for the localities.  The localities are to repay one half of the capital cost not exceeding £212,500.  They are also to pay £2,000 a year for maintenance. The repayment of £212,500 means an annual charge of nearly £14,000 for 35 years, £14,000 plus £2,000 makes £16,000.  The maximum charge on the localities, therefore, under this Bill is £16,000 a year for 35 years, and after 35 years the charge for repayment of capital ceases and the localities have to bear the whole cost of maintenance, whether that proves to be £4,000 a year or more or less.</P>
    <P>Now, how are these charges to be divided between the improved lands and the county funds of the counties concerned?  We have adopted what seems to us the simplest and most equitable method; we impose on the improved lands a charge equal to the assessed improvement, whatever is left over is to be paid from the county funds in the proportion of the assessed improvement in each county. I can, perhaps, make this clearer by an imaginary simplified example.  Suppose there were only two counties concerned, County A and County B; suppose the total annual payment to be made is £21, and the assessed improvement of lands in County A is £6 and in County B £8&mdash;total £14, then these <Col N="88" /> lands will have to pay those amounts, and in addition County A must pay £3 out of the county fund and County B £4 to make up the total of £21.</P>
    <P>As all the payments depend on the assessed improvement, nothing is laid down beforehand except the maximum total, and it is not possible to say what any particular county will have to pay. But we have, of course, some notion, based upon previous valuations and upon what we learn from our valuers now at work; and if things work out as we expect, it is probable that the payments to be made from county funds, apart from payments by the improved lands, will be something between £2,500 and £3,000 a year from each of the counties of Leix, Offaly and Kildare, with very much smaller sums from Wicklow, Carlow and Kilkenny. But of course these are only conjectural estimates.  I think the Bill may be commended to the Dáil as a very generous attempt to solve the vexed and century-old question of the Barrow drainage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. JOHN CONLAN Mr. JOHN CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHN CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the representatives of a county which I may say is primarily concerned with this question, I am glad that the Government has brought forward, even on the eve of a dissolution, this Bill for the drainage of the Barrow.  As the Parliamentary Secretary told the House, this is an age-old question.  As far back as the early years of the eighteenth century a scheme was brought forward for the drainage of the Barrow, and implements that, I suppose, would be called crude implements at the present time, were bought.  The Napoleonic wars broke out, and the whole scheme was knocked on the head because it was impossible to get any assistance from the Government.  Later, when a Conservative Government was in office in England and was adopting the policy of killing Home Rule with kindness, a large grant, amounting, I think, to a quarter of a million, was offered for the drainage of the Barrow.  That also fell through on account of some dissatisfaction that was expressed by the then Irish Party with some provisions of the Bill.  Of course, the House knows that Mr. Birrell attempted to deal with the question, but his scheme fell through <Col N="89" /> because of the outbreak of the Great War.  I express the hope that happier times await the Parliamentary Secretary and his advisers in connection with the present scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the provisions of the Bill, I am pleased to see that the Government has come to realise that the original proposals outlined by Professor Meyer-Peter were far too costly; in fact, that it was not within the competence of the counties concerned to bear an impost of over half a million pounds.  The Parliamentary Secretary has alluded to the circumstances in which the offer of £1 for £1 was made. I do not like to touch upon it because the gentleman who made the offer without consultation with any other member of the deputation is no longer with us.  As I have said, that would be an impossibility with regard to a sum amounting to £575,000.  Other members of the House and I have said more than once that if the Government insisted in proceeding on the basis of Professor Meyer-Peter's scheme, requiring half the cost to be met from local sources, it would be going on altogether wrong lines.  It is satisfactory that the Government now realise that the original proposal was an impossible one.  The reduction in the estimate from £1,130,000 to £425,000 is certainly a drastic one.  I suppose that I may presume that was done after due deliberation and consultation with engineers of standing.  I accept the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that the measurement of the flow of the river has a good deal to do with the modification of the proposal.  I am sorry that even under the modified scheme the Government are insisting on a £1 for £1 contribution.  I always regarded the drainage of the Barrow, the second largest river in Ireland, as a great national work, the cost of which should to a great extent be borne by the National Treasury.  I do not say that the owners and occupiers of land who are benefiting by the drainage should not pay a fair proportion of the cost or a contribution in proportion to the benefit received.  But we must take into account that in the contributory counties there are dozens of ratepayers deriving no more benefit from the <Col N="90" /> drainage than ratepayers in Donegal or Cork.  It would be a great mistake to fix the contributions for benefited land at too high a rate.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputies are acquainted with the flooded areas. Those who are will agree with me when I say that these areas are vast open expanses without hedges, fences or trees.  Even if the land is relieved from flooding a great deal of labour and expense will be necessary to bring it into cultivation.  Field drainage would be necessary, and also the erection of fences.  The only boundaries at present, as far as I know, are some open drains and small rivers.  For that reason I think it would be a great mistake to fix too high an improvement rate on the land benefiting.  Of course, the difference between what will be the contribution payable because of the benefit to the land and the amount necessary to repay the loan will have to be borne by the rates.  The county councils will have to fill up the gap.  We all know that local ratepayers are at present overburdened, and that the county councils are finding great difficulty in collecting the rates.  If any considerable addition is made it will be extremely hard to get the ratepayers to respond.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask a question as to Section 6.  Section 6 endows the Commissioners with very wide powers.  As I read it, it gives them authority to bring in a substituted plan and to make whatever alterations are necessary, whether involving an increase or not of the cost.  I should like to know, if it should prove necessary to bring in a substituted scheme at additional cost, whether it would come within the purview of the Dáil, or whether the Commissioners could go on with an altogether new scheme without any check whatsoever.  As regards the term of the loan&mdash;thirty-five years&mdash;I thought that these short-term loans applied only to minor drainage works, and that a loan for a scheme like this, which involves a large sum to the local authorities, would be on the same terms as loans under the Land Purchase Acts. If the loan were arranged on that basis, it would lighten the burden to be borne by the ratepayers.  I should like to ask <Col N="91" /> the Parliamentary Secretary whether it would not be possible to make this a long-term loan instead of a loan for a term of thirty-five years.</P>
    <P>As regards the Barrow Drainage Board, I take it that the members of that Board will have very important duties to perform.  I think that Board should be set up immediately on the passing of the Bill, because they would be in touch with the Commissioners, and I am sure would give very valuable assistance in carrying out the scheme. As one who has taken part in the agitation for the drainage of the Barrow for a great many years, I desire to express the hope that this Bill, amended, perhaps, in some respects, will be the means of remedying a crying evil, and one which was most discreditable to any Government which allowed it to exist.  With these observations, I support the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of this measure on the understanding that it represents a genuine and sincere attempt on the part of the Government to effect the drainage of this river.  The Parliamentary Secretary said a good deal about the Bill, but he said nothing that would give any Deputy any indication as to the rough-and-ready details of the scheme upon which the Bill was based.  We are asked in the Bill to give very extensive powers to the Commissioners to proceed with a partial scheme&mdash;I think that is how the Parliamentary Secretary referred to it&mdash;subject to a maximum expenditure of £425,000.  One section of the Bill makes provision for proceeding on those lines subject to that maximum expenditure, but another clause&mdash; that referred to by Deputy Conlan&mdash; gives powers to the Commissioners to prepare a substituted or additional scheme.  The Parliamentary Secretary has said that if a substituted or amended or new scheme has to be prepared which would involve expenditure exceeding £425,000, the Government would have to come to the House for authority for the expenditure involved over and above the £425,000.  I take it that that is quite definitely the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, <Col N="92" /> whether this Bill, providing for a maximum expenditure of £425,000, is based upon a skeleton scheme already in existence&mdash;a scheme which can be produced and acted upon, in accordance with the procedure outlined in the Bill, immediately this measure becomes law. If the maximum laid down in the Bill is not based upon a skeleton or some considered scheme, how did the Government arrive at that figure of £425,000? It is quite true that a representative deputation waited upon the late Minister for Industry and Commerce in March, 1924.  I dare say that a shorthand note is available of the proceedings at that interview.  As far as I remember, a shorthand notetaker was present, and an official report was subsequently circulated by the Government to the Press.  It is a fact that the late Senator MacEvoy made an offer on behalf of large ratepayers in the area&mdash;whether after consultation with them or not, I am not going to say&mdash;that if the Government would proceed with the work of draining the River Barrow, the people in the locality, as between the flooded lands and the counties concerned, would find £1 for £1.  It is, I think, a fact also that Deputy Colohan, on that occasion, suggested that the Government should provide two-thirds of the actual cost of carrying out the work.  I think if the shorthand note is available it will show that those two suggestions or proposals were put forward at that interview.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of carrying out a scheme on the lines suggested in the Bill within the maximum limits of expenditure proposed, one has got to examine the possibility of that being done on the lines proposed by the various experts who previously inquired into the matter and made recommendations in respect of it.  We have the scheme of the famous Professor Meyer-Peter, involving an expenditure of £1,130,000.  We have then the Batchen proposal, based upon the Gamble scheme, at an estimated expenditure of £900,000.  We have now, without any explanation or justification as to where the difference exists in detail, a scheme put forward at an <Col N="93" /> estimated maximum expenditure of £425,000.  The Government in the past was very much disposed to rely on the advice of foreign experts, and I suggest now that the present scheme, providing for a maximum expenditure of £425,000, is either unsound or that the advice of the foreign experts was not so good as the Government previously thought it was.  If the scheme can be carried out at a cost of £425,000, it is to the credit of Mr. Chaloner Smith and others concerned.  It is certainly not a tribute to the advice of the foreign expert who was asked to go into the whole matter, and who estimated the expenditure at £1,130,000. If it can be done I say it is a tip to the Government not to rely so much in future on the advice of foreign experts as they have been doing up to the present.</P>
    <P>At the interview referred to it was suggested by the Secretary of the Barrow Drainage Board that the scheme the Government should adopt was the scheme based on the Barrow Drainage Bill of 1889.  What was that scheme? It involved an expenditure then estimated at £360,000, and of that amount £215,000, or three-fifths, was to be borne by the British Government by way of grant, and £20,000 was to be borne by the people in the catchment area.  This Bill is not on the lines of the suggestions put forward by the deputation referred to.  It is quite true there was a difference of opinion as amongst the members of the deputation and the offer made of pound for pound was not, I contend, an offer unanimously suggested by the representative deputation of which Deputy Conlan, myself, and others were members; I think Deputy Wolfe was also present.</P>
    <P>So far as I can gather from reading into the matter, there is one explanation for Professor Meyer-Peter's scheme as against Mr. Batchen's scheme; there was a greater deepening of the bed of the River Barrow in the scheme of Professor Meyer-Peter than in the scheme for which the estimate was £900,000&mdash;that is, the Gamble scheme. I want to know from the Minister whether the estimated cost of £425,000 includes the £20,000 and the £75,000 which were provided in the estimates of <Col N="94" /> 1926-27 and 1927-28, for carrying out the preliminary work in connection with this undertaking.  Is the amount of £95,000 already voted by this House for preliminary work included in the estimated cost for the carrying out of the drainage work?  Section 2 (3) of this Bill says:</P>
    <P>The expenses incurred by the Commissioners in preparing the draft scheme shall be part of the general expenses of carrying the scheme into execution and shall be paid accordingly.</P>
    <P>Does the £425,000 also include the amounts of £3,059 contained in the 1926-27 estimates and the £4,090 contained in the 1927-28 estimates for the payment of engineers and other officials engaged in the work of preparing the scheme, if they have been engaged on that work, or in supervising the preliminary work at present being carried out?</P>
    <P>In the scheme suggested by Professor Meyer-Peter he made provision for the regulation of the river, including the protection of banks, back drains, and pumps, and the removal of old weirs, at a cost of £750,300; for new weirs he estimated £97,500; for navigation canals with locks, £106,000; for tributaries, £128,700, and for bridges and mills, £47,500.  What provision, if any, is made for the carrying out of these works in the scheme now propounded in this Bill and included in the maximum expenditure of £425,000?</P>
    <P>To what extent is there likely to be an improvement in the Barrow navigation? If there is going to be an improvement in the Barrow navigation, why is there not provision made for some payment by boat owners or the people who use the canals?  Why are they not asked to contribute towards the improvement that will come about in the navigation of the river?  Professor Meyer-Peter evidently had that in mind, and all the previous experts, including those connected with the All-port Commission, who reported on this, dealt with this particular matter.</P>
    <P>Some three years ago I was down the River Barrow with a couple of engineers and others.  We travelled down the river from Monasterevan to St. <Col N="95" /> Mullins in boats in bad weather.  Seeing the canalised portion, it was apparent to us that the carrying capacity of boats suffered as a result of the silt in the river.  The carrying capacity of boats with a normal carrying capacity of 45 tons was reduced in some cases to 30 tons.  If the carrying capacity of boats taking advantage of the Barrow navigation is going to be increased to 45 tons, the people whose position will be improved as carriers should pay something towards the carrying out of this work.  Will any provision be made for payment from that source, and, if not, why not?  It is only natural to expect that there will be some improvement in the Barrow navigation.  I do not see why maintenance work on the canal should be provided for at the expense of the Government, leaving those who benefit by the carrying out of the maintenance work to pay nothing, although the improvement is in their own interest.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of this Bill refers to the provision for the repayment of advances by the Commissioners.  Sub-section (1) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The advance by the Commissioners with interest thereon at the rate to be fixed by the Minister for Finance shall be repaid by the payment by the county councils in accordance with this section to the Commissioners of an annual sum of such amount as shall be fixed by the Minister for Finance and such annual sum shall be so payable for the thirty-five local financial years next after the 31st day of March following the date of the final award.</P>
    <P>Can we have any indication from the Parliamentary Secretary as to the rate of interest?  Some information ought to be available, and if the Minister has it&mdash;he must have if the scheme is a considered one&mdash;it ought to be given to the House.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary used very vague language in his rather brief explanation of this very important measure.  He said that the general scheme in the Bill was to provide immunity from ordinary high floods.  Is that the only kind of language that <Col N="96" /> he can use with regard to the whole scheme?  Can he tell us whether he is proceeding on the lines laid down by Professor Meyer-Peter regarding the improvement of the navigation, the removal and provision of bridges, and the necessary attention to tributaries? What is omitted from the scheme as detailed by Professor Meyer-Peter and other experts?</P>
    <P>On the general question of Government policy regarding payment for the carrying out of this work, I certainly do congratulate the Government in having agreed, at the last moment, to place the responsibility upon the people in the flooded areas, firstly, the people whose land will benefit, and, secondly, the people in the catchment area and the counties concerned, for the repayment of what is known as the local charge.</P>
    <P>I and other Deputies here are aware that in the earlier interviews we had with the Minister the general proposal was to place the local cost of the carrying out of the work on Leix, Offaly and Kildare.  I congratulate the Minister on having agreed in the long run to adopt the lines now laid down in this Bill and to have this work in the long run carried out at the cost provided for in the Bill.  That cost can be apportioned in the manner laid down in the Bill.  I say that the Bill is a good one and will be a benefit to the area of the flooded lands, to the catchment area and to the counties named in the Bill.  If the Minister has the scheme ready I hope he will proceed to follow the lines laid down in the Bill and get on to the actual work of draining this river at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>There is one other point that I want to refer to and that is the wages paid to the men carrying out this preliminary work in the drainage of the river. I think the wages paid to the workmen engaged in the preliminary work is not a living wage.  I agree that the Government have taken advantage of the large amount of unemployment in the country for the purpose of getting men, as they will get them, at a low rate of wages to do work of this kind. I think that the Government might consider the proposal to pay these men <Col N="97" /> who are doing this dirty and dangerous form of work, the same wage as men are paid in connection with the Shannon scheme which is not an over-rated figure.  Generally speaking, I welcome the Bill and I say that if this work is eventually carried out at the cost provided for in the Bill it will be a lasting tribute to the people responsible for drawing up the scheme and for carrying it into effect afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDwyer" hpid="Mr. DWYER Mr. DWYER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DWYER</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great pleasure that I welcome this Bill.  We have heard very much about the drainage of the Barrow for generations and, at the recent by-election in Leix-Offaly, as Deputy Davin said on several occasions, it was our front plank.  However the promise had been given, as Deputy Davin said, that if I were elected the Barrow would be drained.  Well, I was elected and the Barrow is now definitely going to be drained.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Davin next comes down to Leix-Offaly he will no longer have his little joke about the drainage of the Barrow.  Now, at all events, the people will see that the Government means business and the Barrow will be drained.  As regards the recent deputation that I have been on, and the promise given by the County Council of Leix of contributing £ for £, at that time the Leix-Offaly people were the principal people in it.  The late Senator MacEvoy said that an undertaking had been given by the previous county council that if the Barrow had been drained the people were prepared to pay £ for £.  However, the people at that time turned it down, and I myself, as representative of the people, could not stand by that.  I am glad that I am a member of the Government who are tackling the drainage of the Barrow, and who are going to see that it will be drained.  It is a great tribute to the Government to undertake this work.  A great many governments considered this problem of the drainage of the Barrow in the past, and they failed to carry it out, but now the Saorstát Government is at last going to do what so many governments were unable or unwilling to do.</P>

      <P>There is an old saying that the man who can wait long enough generally gets what he wants and this is exemplified in the case of the Barrow drainage.  A great many people have been wanting to get the Barrow drained for more than a century. At last the matter has become a reality.  At least, I think it has.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I feel certain that it will.  It is as certain as any human thing can be.  When we come to think of it we recall that Chief Secretary after Chief Secretary who came to Ireland received deputations about the drainage of the Barrow and the Bann. After a hurried visit to the West, which was always made by every Chief Secretary, where they went to make acquaintance with the conditions there, they were, generally speaking, on their arrival back, waited upon by deputations dealing with the drainage of the Barrow and the Bann.  A great many promises, no doubt, were made as to the drainage of these rivers, and one or two of the Chief Secretaries actually came to figures, but that was all.  There was always something to prevent the work being carried out&mdash;either the people would not contribute enough, or what the Government considered was enough, or the Government themselves would not give enough to put through the work and the thing never came to a head.  Although very celebrated engineers have put their names to several schemes, they never made the schemes sufficiently attractive to get them taken up and thoroughly entered upon. It will be a feather in the cap of Mr. Chaloner Smith that he alone, after all the other engineers have failed, is in the position of being the engineer who is carrying this matter to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope he will carry it to a satisfactory conclusion.  Deputies Davin and Conlan entered into a great many particulars about the drainage of the Barrow. There is no use in recapitulating further the history of all that.  Considering the extent of what is going to be done and the value of money to-day, the amount mentioned, £425,000, if it <Col N="99" /> carries out the whole expense of the Barrow drainage, does not appear to be a very excessive figure, considering what we have been accustomed to hear up to this&mdash;figures of one-and-a-quarter millions and sums of £900,000 and little items like that.  The figure in this Bill is really quite a modest estimate.  Indeed my breath was taken away when I first saw this Bill and found that the figure was only £425,000.  A good many other people, too, were surprised at the smallness of this figure.  It says a great deal for the engineer if he can carry through the work at the figure in the Estimate when we consider that the other estimates were round about a million.  I have come to the conclusion that the difference between this Estimate and the others has had a good deal to do with the estimation as to the flow of the water.  I take it that this engineer estimates the flow at a very much smaller figure than any of the others.  No doubt as he is the latest in the field he will probably be the most accurate, having had the advantage of the experience of all the other estimates to go on.</P>
    <P>Considering everything, I think that the arrangement about the money part of the scheme is not unfair.  Kildare, of course, is very much burdened with heavy rates and we naturally do not like a further burden thrown on us. The money, however, could be spent in a much worse way.  The work itself will help a vast number of people in the way of obtaining better health and conditions in the districts and will also improve a vast area of land in time to come.  Better still, it will give a vast amount of employment to people who are at present doing nothing.  Money could not, in fact, be better spent than in giving employment to people who are idle.  I do not believe that the people, when they come to consider it, will grudge paying a certain proportion of the cost.  We must not be entirely selfish and still expect benefits to accrue to our own particular neighbourhood. I do not think that the people will view it in that light.</P>
    <P>People all over the country will be delighted to know that the scheme is at last about to fructify.  A rate of one <Col N="100" /> penny in the pound represents about £1,300, so that the sum of £2,500, which the Minister gives us, represents about twopence in the pound.  There is one point about which I am not sure.  There is a maintenance charge of £2,000, which, I fancy, is to be a permanent charge.  The Minister mentioned, I think, £4,000.  Deputy Davin and other Deputies have alluded to most of the matters which I would have gone into, and at this stage I may say that I, for one, welcome the fact that the Government are fulfilling the promise which they made that the drainage of the Barrow would be tackled before they went out of office.  The fact will, I think, always stand to their credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. COLOHAN Mr. COLOHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill, but I think he should get his Department to prepare a general statement giving approximate costs of each important section of the river and any unforeseen works or expenses, such as compensation for mills to which Deputy Davin referred.  That would give Deputies representing those districts an idea of the cost of the various sections.  I have no doubt that as the work proceeds on many sections there will be criticism as to the amount of benefit each section derives from the sinking of the main stream, or river, to a certain depth.  It may not be sunk deep enough to take off the water from certain sections of the river.  I think it would be fair to Deputies and to landholders in the area to have such a statement. When I say that, I do not mean to pass criticism on the ability of our engineer, Mr. Chaloner Smith.  I am proud to say that it is my honest belief that we could not get a better man to carry out drainage works on the River Barrow, and I hope that the Government will avail themselves of his services until the scheme is complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to taxation and the £ for £ basis which was proposed by the late Senator MacEvoy, I may say that I was present when the deputation was received, and I am perfectly sure that, although there were some twenty-five members on the deputation, there was not one, except Senator MacEvoy, who was satisfied with that basis which he <Col N="101" /> himself proposed.  I would ask that in the distribution of the cost of the scheme the ratepayers on the land affected should be let down as lightly as possible.  I think the Government should pay, at least, three-fifths of the cost of the scheme.  By limiting the period of payment to thirty-five years, I think all the expense will be thrown on the present generation.  Why not extend that period to fifty or sixty years and thus lessen the burden of the people who are in possession?  Goodness knows, they had enough to bear for the last five or six years.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about giving employment on the Barrow.  I am glad to find a large number of men working about Athy and Monasterevan.  I would like to see them getting a fair wage.  They are getting thirty shillings for standing up to their knees in mud and water.  They have no shelter, and they are out in the rain all day. When they are not working they do not come under the Unemployment Insurance Act.  That, of course, was done to cheapen the cost of the scheme.  I do not think it is fair to be taking it out of the unfortunate labourers all the time simply to cheapen the cost.  Deputy Wolfe spoke about the improvement that would accrue in the health of the people of the neighbourhood.  I agree, but I do not want to see it taken out of the men working on the Barrow. I am sure that their health will be impaired after working there for a short time.  I would like to see the Minister making provision to give them medical treatment for disease, whether it be rheumatism or tuberculosis, which they might contract while working under slavish conditions on the river.</P>
    <P>It is not too much to ask.  They are our own countrymen, and we are in honour bound to protect them when carrying out this scheme.  Deputy Davin said that they should be paid, at least, the same wage as the workers on the Shannon scheme.  I mentioned that matter to the Parliamentary Secretary last October, but I could not get him to agree to it.  Would there be any possibility now of softening the heart of the Minister or the hearts of the Executive Council, and getting them to make that gesture now on the <Col N="102" /> eve of the general election, and raise the wages of these men?  I do not think that it is too much for Irishmen to ask of the Executive Council of their national Parliament, and if they do that they will inspire confidence in a great many people, especially amongst the workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>One would hesitate to throw an apple of discord into this discussion, or say anything that would detract from the congratulations showered on the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government in connection with this Bill.  At times I regret that I do not live near the Barrow or near the Carlow beet factory&mdash;that area upon which the blessings of posterity are to be showered at the expense of the taxpayers of the country as a whole. I just want to ask one or two questions in connection with this scheme.  It strikes me that all the people in the areas concerned will not congratulate the Ministry on this Bill.  I have no doubt whatever that Deputy Wolfe and other Deputies will find, when the ratepayers in those counties come to understand that whether their lands are to be benefited or not they will have to pay twopence or threepence in the pound for the construction of these drainage works, they will not be very pleased.</P>
      <P>I would like to put it to the Parliamentary Secretary, were the local councils in the different counties consulted before it was decided to impose this obligation, and expect that they would be responsible for collecting a rate for the construction of the drainage work from farmers who are not going to benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that provision is made for the holding of an inquiry, and those who have any objections can make them at that inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know whether the councils were consulted.  One would think before any council would be put in the position of having to collect a rate for any purpose whatever that it would be consulted.  Deputy Conlan made a point which I think he did not sufficiently stress.  He suggested that a Drainage Board should be set up <Col N="103" /> at the earliest possible date.  I would urge that course.  The work, no doubt, is to be carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works, but from the point of view of the ratepayers in the affected areas it has to be remembered that they are going to contribute half the cost of the construction of these works.  I am not suggesting that the Commissioners of Public Works and their engineers are not competent to do the work, but I think in the interests of the people who are going to pay half of the total cost of construction of these works that they should have in existence some authority, and under that body competent engineers who would at least look after the interests of the ratepayers in the areas concerned.  That would seem to me to be most important.  It is true that the Board of Works and their engineers, working in their official way on the scheme, must be expected to do the work in a satisfactory manner, but there may be local considerations that should be taken into account.  One would like to know whether this Board will only be set up after the work of construction is carried out, and whether the local authority will have to depend entirely on that Board and have no officers of their own to look after their interests and with whom they can consult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If all responsibility is to be placed entirely on the Commissioners of Public Works I think in the interests of local authorities that the Board should be set up at a very early date, and that there should be engineers who would supervise on behalf of the ratepayers, so that local interests would be safeguarded. I think that is necessary for the satisfactory carrying out of the work if such benefits are to come from the scheme as proposed, and as one would wish for it now that it is to be undertaken.  Precautions should also be taken that the work would be done in such a way as to give satisfaction to the people most intimately concerned. If they have merely to look on at the construction and contribute their quota to the amount necessary for carrying out the work, then, perhaps, there will be grounds for dissatisfaction.  I think <Col N="104" /> the Ministry and the Board of Works should safeguard themselves against that.  Perhaps the good work the Ministry see it necessary to undertake on behalf of the farmers in the five or six counties concerned will have such beneficial results that they may do something similar for other parts of the country, and it may come to be recognised that the Erne is as worthy of consideration from the national point of view as is the Barrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DUGGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my appreciation of the manner in which the Bill has been received by Deputies in every part of the House. I naturally expected that there would be some criticism of details.  I do not know if some Deputies are quite clear in their minds on this matter.  Deputy Davin referred to the scheme.  Under the Bill we are getting power to prepare a scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Have you a skeleton scheme in the pigeon holes in the Board of Works on which you justify the Bill now before the House, based on a maximum expenditure of £425,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundJDuggan" hpid="Mr. DUGGAN Mr. DUGGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DUGGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by a skeleton scheme. We make sufficient investigations and have got sufficient information at our disposal to enable us to say that we can drain the Barrow satisfactorily at the figure in the Bill&mdash;that is, we can prevent damage by flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to press the Minister on the point.  Has he a considered scheme already approved of by the Executive Council which would justify him in coming to the House and asking for the acceptance of the proposals in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundJDuggan" hpid="Mr. DUGGAN Mr. DUGGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DUGGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by a considered scheme.  We have not a draft scheme, but I say the matter has been investigated by our engineers, and the result is such that we are justified in coming to the House and asking it to pass this Bill in which the figure mentioned is £425,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, you are asking the House to give approval for the preparation of a scheme based <Col N="105" /> on a maximum expenditure of £425,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundJDuggan" hpid="Mr. DUGGAN Mr. DUGGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DUGGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite clear in the Bill.  Deputy Conlan seemed to suggest that there was unnecessary delay in the introduction of the Bill, and he made reference to the eve of a dissolution.  Any delay in the introduction of the Bill is due entirely to two causes.  One is that Professor Meyer-Peter in his report directed that the Board of Works engineer should make certain measurements. That work occupied a considerable period of time, and it is as a result of these measurements we have got the first actual figure in existence on which one could base estimates for doing this work; and the other cause of delay is one which arises in connection with nearly every Bill, and that is pressure of work in the draughtsman's office. Deputy Conlan expressed the fear that perhaps the rate levied on the landowners affected might be on the high side.  I can say from my experience of land valuers of the Board of Works that that is very unlikely to occur. Their leaning always seems to be in the other direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the power taken under Section 6 to bring in a substituted scheme.  That is merely precautionary, and if Deputies refer to the wording they will see that it merely provides that if it appears that alterations are necessary in the works proposed under the scheme a substituted scheme can be prepared.  The scheme having been approved, if we find it necessary to make perhaps a trivial alteration in it, it will not then be necessary to come to the House for another Bill.  I do not think that is likely to arise, and, as I say, it is merely precautionary.  I do not think I can hold out any hope that the period of repayment of the loan will be extended and, as a matter of fact, an extension would make very little difference in the annual charge, very much less than Deputies imagine.  Deputy Davin asked whether the moneys already expended <Col N="106" /> on the preliminary works form part of the money provided for in the Bill. They do.  He also asked whether certain engineers' fees are included in the expenses for which the Bill provides. The specific items to which he referred are not.  They are regarded as office expenses of the Board of Works, and not as part of the cost of the scheme. Deputy Davin also mentioned the possibility of some improvement in the navigation of the Barrow as a result of the drainage works.  I must say that I had not considered that matter.  If, incidentally, there is an improvement in the navigation I will have the matter considered and dealt with.</P>

      <P>I suggest if the scheme is based upon the deepening of the river that there is bound to be an improvement to the navigation, to the advantage of the people making use of the navigation.</P>

      <P>That is so.  I will have the matter considered.  The rate of interest is, of course, the ordinary 5½ per cent.  Deputy Baxter suggested that there might be some form of cooperation between the Board of Works engineer and the members of the Drainage Board.  I think that in a matter of this kind you must have some person responsible.  You cannot divide responsibility. I think that that would be the very worst thing that could happen. The members of the Drainage Board will have their own duties to carry out, and the Board of Works engineer in charge of the scheme will have his reputation at stake, and I think it is better to let him do his work and the Drainage Board do theirs.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Bill accordingly read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Ordered: That the Bill be considered in Committee of the whole Dáil on Wednesday, March 30th.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.55 p.m. until Wednesday, 23rd March, at 3 p.m.</P>
