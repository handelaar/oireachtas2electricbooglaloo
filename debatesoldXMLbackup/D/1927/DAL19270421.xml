      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has received a claim for recoupment in respect of witnesses and prosecutors' expenses for the period 1st October, 1923, to 31st March, 1926, amounting to £897 19s. 9d. from the County Council of Donegal; whether repeated requests for payment of this amount have not received acknowledgment, and whether the Minister is aware that interest on this amount is being paid by the County Council.</P>

      <P>The claim in question was received by the Department of Finance on the 16th September last, and is now being audited by the Department of Local Government and Public Health. Two requests for payment of the claim were received subsequent to the 16th September, but were not acknowledged, as it was hoped at the time of their receipt that recoupment would be effected at a very early date.  Delay in audit of the claim has occurred owing to the auditor having been engaged on very urgent and important work, but it is understood that the audit will be completed before the end of the month. There has been no delay in dealing with the claim in the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE (for Minister for Lands and Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 5th instant an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed near Galgate, in Lancashire, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries thereupon declared an area of, roughly, 15 miles from that place to be an infected area, into, out of, or within which the movement of animals became prohibited.  The area included the landing-places for Irish animals at Fleetwood and Heysham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time there were no Free State stock in either landing-place a shipment from Dublin to Heysham having been released earlier in the day.  Information as to the outbreak and its consequences was telegraphed to the Department in the usual course, but several hours before its receipt a further shipment of 297 animals had taken <Col N="1337" /> place from Dublin to Heysham.  These animals, when landed became subject to the British restrictions applying in the infected area&mdash;that is to say, they could be moved out of the landing-place only for slaughter within the infected area.</P>
    <P>The Department at once made representations to the British authorities with a view to the animals being allowed out to farms or private premises, but owing to a further outbreak in the vicinity, and the uncertainty as to the foot-and-mouth disease position of the district, this concession could not be granted until last Tuesday.  By an Order issued yesterday, the infected area is reduced as from Monday next so as to exclude both landing-places, and thus to set free the animals still occupying them.</P>
    <P>Once a cattle-carrying vessel has been cleared, the Department have no power to recall her, or to direct the landing of her cargo, but in any case the Department had no opportunity of ascertaining whether the owners of the Heysham cattle would be willing to have their animals landed elsewhere, or whether they could be received at another landing-place.</P>

      <P>Saorstát Eireann has now for four years had complete control of its own finances and during the period much has been accomplished.  The financial credit of the State has been securely established.  The bill for the Civil War and the damage arising out of it has, for the most part, been paid. Reforms have been carried out in almost every branch of public administration. Great constructive schemes have been initiated and are being hastened forward.  New help has been given to agriculture and industry. The burden of taxation has been appreciably reduced while the public debt remains low.</P>
      <P>The Revenue figures for the year 1926-27 have in various respects been more satisfactory than those for any previous year.  The price of National Loan has again risen and has during the whole of the twelve months remained at a high figure.  In fact, difficulty has been experienced in purchasing loan for redemption and on 31st March last there was a sum of £119,400 uninvested to the credit of the sinking fund.  Deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank rose during the period from £2,402,000 to £2,700,000.  As in the previous year the sum invested in Savings Certificates rose by £600,000 odd.</P>
      <P>Leaving out of account our liabilities under the Agreement of December, 1925, to repay to British Government the amounts disbursed by it in respect of compensation after the signing of the Treaty, our National Debt on 31st March stood at the figure of £16,854,400 made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>From the total thus obtained must be deducted, however, £564,591, the balance remaining in Exchequer at the close of the financial year.  The net figure therefore is £16,290,000.  The corresponding amount at the end of the previous year was £13,420,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> There are certain assets which may be set against the total of the outstanding debt.  They comprise advances from the Exchequer to the Unemployment Fund amounting to £1,284,700, the ultimate repayment of which may, I think, fairly be relied upon; advances to the Shannon Electricity Scheme Fund amounting to about £1,312,000 and other smaller advances which bring the total up to the neighbourhood of £4,500,000.  Our net capital liabilities, excluding the compensation liability already mentioned, are therefore just about £12,400,000.</P>
    <P>The original estimate of tax revenue for the past year after deducting the sum expected to be realised from the motor vehicles duties was £20,078,000. As a result of Budget changes the figure became £20,063,000.  The sum actually collected was £20,609,000. Death duties yielded £955,288 which was some £25,000 short of the estimate. Stamp duties likewise produced £35,000 less than was anticipated.  The yield of the beer and spirit duties was substantially better than was expected.</P>
    <P>In my last Budget statement I estimated, not without some misgiving, that the excise duties on alcoholic liquor would produce in 1926-27 approximately the same revenue they had yielded in the previous year.  In fact, however, the produce of the excise duty on spirits was £2,401,375, or £46,029 more than was anticipated.  Last year, as Deputies may remember, I pointed out that the yield of spirit duty for 1925-26 had been abnormally low because withdrawals from bond had in the three months before the Budget been restricted to an unprecedented extent, and that, therefore, if there were no decline in the consumption of spirits in the year 1926-27 there would be an increase in revenue of £130,000.  But though the increase realised was only £46,000, it should not be taken that the annual consumption of Saorstát whiskey declined by an amount equivalent to a tax yield of £84,000.  The sum which came into the Exchequer in the past year in respect of excise duty on spirits was something less than the normal yield of the period.  During the first <Col N="1340" /> three weeks of the financial year which had passed before the introduction of the Budget, payments of duty were at their lowest.</P>
    <P>Excessive reduction of stocks of whiskey by publicans at this time resulted in a certain definite loss of trade and revenue which was not balanced by exceptional consumption later in the year.  For two months after the Budget statement, pending the passage of the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, the withdrawal of spirits from bond was restricted by the Revenue Commissioners. In consequence, some traders did not get normal stocks until the end of June, and it is possible that some further loss of trade resulted.  On the whole it may safely be said that the consumption of home-made spirits (not including poteen) in the year 1926-27 was only very little less than the consumption in the previous year.  It is not anticipated that there will be any decline during the current financial year.  It is interesting to note that while there was an increase in the yield of the excise duty on spirits amounting to £46,029, the revenue obtained from the customs duty on imported spirits is down by £26,000.</P>
    <P>In the case of beer, as in the case of spirits, I estimated in my last Budget statement that the revenue from the excise duty would be the same in 1926-27 as it had been in 1925-26.  I am glad to be able to say that the estimate was exceeded and that the yield was up by no less than £124,000.  In 1925-26 the excise revenue obtained from beer was abnormally low, because certain brewers decided during that year to reduce substantially their export reserves, with the result that while drawback was paid at the normal rate, there was a period during which less beer than usual was brewed and less duty paid. The resultant loss to the Exchequer was £250,000.  A consumption in 1926-27 equal to the consumption in 1925-26 should accordingly have given an increase of £250,000 in revenue, provided there had been no further decrease in brewers' stocks.  The figures, therefore, indicate that there has been a decrease in consumption of 25,000 standard barrels as compared with the previous year, and certain other indications <Col N="1341" /> tend to show that the decrease was actually somewhat greater, say, 30,000 standard barrels.  Since the decrease in the year 1925-26, as compared with the preceding year, was 100,000 barrels, it is evident that the rate of decrease has been growing less and that the home consumption of beer is approaching stabilisation.  Viewing the situation in regard to the consumption of intoxicating liquor as a whole, pessimists who are not also prohibitionists, might take heart from the fact that the people of the Saorstát are still not only willing but able to spend about 17 million pounds per annum on stimulating drinks.</P>
    <P>The customs duty on motor cars and motor bicycles yielded £251,000, or about £54,000 less than last year.  The decline was partly due to the fall in the value of cars and the slump in the French and Italian currencies.  It was also due in part to the discrimination in favour of the home-made car shown in the new basis of road tax, and to the easing off of the brisk demand for cars which arose on the restoration of settled conditions.  Recent returns indicate, however, that there will be a substantial recovery in the current year. The duty on wearing apparel yielded £79,000 more than in the previous year, in spite of the fact that since the imposition of the tariff the number of persons employed in the industry has risen by something like 4,200 and is still increasing. There are clear indications that increasing home production will lead to a reduced return from this tax in the present year.</P>
    <P>Two new customs duties were imposed by last year's Finance Act. That on oatmeal yielded £15,900 against an estimate of £12,000.  Outside millers in some cases have secured mills in the Saorstát and in others are making an effort by extensive advertising to hold their market here in spite of the tariff.  On the whole, a decided fillip has been given to the oatmeal milling industry.  The tax on wireless apparatus was calculated to produce £20,000.  The actual yield to the Exchequer was just over £19,000.  The policy of the Government is to expend on additional stations and better programmes all the revenue got <Col N="1342" /> out of broadcasting, whether in the way of customs duties, licence fees or fines recovered from defaulters.  Proposals will shortly be submitted to the Dáil for the erection of further stations, including a high-power station which will probably be situated at Athlone.  The contemplated developments would not be possible if the income from the tax on imported apparatus were not forthcoming to supplement the revenue obtained from fees payable by owners of receiving sets.  It is not considered that the general taxpayer should be required to pay for the improvement and extension of the broadcasting service and it is not intended that hope of development should be abandoned.  Accordingly the excellent customs duty on wireless apparatus, at present in force, will be continued.</P>
    <P>The various duties in connection with betting yielded £59,028.  These taxes did not become operative until 1st November and the succeeding period up to the end of the financial year was that in which least return to the Exchequer was to be expected. We are still without the evidence on which any reliable estimate of the yield of these taxes can be based, but it is considered probable that the sum obtained in the present financial year will be more than quadruple the amount we got last year.</P>
    <P>The original estimate for income tax for last year was £4,650,000, but in consequence of the change in the method of giving relief from double income tax, I reduced the estimate by £200,000 to allow for the throwing forward of the payment of certain tax into the next year.  The tax collected exceeded the original estimate by £30,000 and the revised estimate by £230,000.  In the case of super-tax the revised estimate was exceeded by £91,000.  The excess in both cases was due to the fact that arrears have been collected more rapidly than was expected. The past year's work has appreciably reduced the pool of arrears which has so unfailingly replenished our Exchequer for the past four years, but it has not exhausted it.  It was expected that the great bulk of the collectible abnormal arrears would by <Col N="1343" /> now have been recovered.  The position, however, is that while our zealous and efficient revenue officials have already got from those who refrained from paying income tax to the British and even to ourselves, so long as the State was still, unsteady on its legs, a sum greater than was ever expected, there is still the prospect of getting between £500,000 and £700,000 during the next two or three years before we reach the point when nothing but normal arrears will remain outstanding.  It is not anticipated that there will be any decrease in the yield of normal or current tax during the next few years.  The decline in taxable income which has been going on since before the setting up of a separate revenue service in the Saorstát seems to have come to an end. A calculation made by the Revenue Commissioners on the basis of returns supplied by over 200 representative firms engaged in all sorts of enterprises, indicates that profits as a whole in 1926-7 were only 5 per cent. lower than in 1925-6.  In many cases it is certain that profits would have been even higher but for costs and losses arising out of the British coal stoppage, and the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that but for that stoppage profits generally in 1926-27 would have shown no decline as compared with 1925-26.  The fall that has hitherto taken place in profits has not adversely affected the yield of income tax to any appreciable extent, because in each succeeding year the tax has been more efficiently and equitably collected.  It is hoped that before long evasion will be reduced to a minimum.  In this way it is expected that the effect of the lowering of the three years' average this year will be largely, if not entirely, neutralised.</P>
    <P>In my last two Budget statements, before comparing the estimates of expenditure with the estimates of revenue for the purpose of deciding whether taxation could be reduced or must be increased, I first segregated those items of expenditure which, because of their abnormal and non-recurrent character, might properly be met by borrowing.  It is proposed to proceed in the same way this year. The provision for property losses compensation <Col N="1344" /> and for capital for the Local Loans Fund as well as provision for drainage, for capital grants to University Colleges and for loans to agricultural credit societies and creameries, will all be found entirely by borrowing.  In the case of expenditure on public works and buildings and on the improvement of estates by the Land Commission part of the outlay will be regarded as normal and part as abnormal and non-recurrent.  In the case of Army pensions the amount representing provision for arrears will be set aside to be met by borrowing. This year's forestry estimate is substantially increased and reflects a decision taken last autumn to propose to the Dáil a planting programme of 5,000 acres a year for ten years.  It is felt that as a national asset is being created, some part of the annual outlay might reasonably be met out of borrowed moneys.  The whole amount due to be paid next June to the subscribers to the Dáil Eireann Internal Loan of 1919-20 will be borrowed.</P>
    <P>Except for Army expenditure this completes the list.  I need not repeat to the Dáil the arguments I have used in previous Budget statements against borrowing to meet any part of the charge in respect of R.I.C. pensions; nor need I again emphasise the fact that it would be wrong to pick out of the estimates every item that had anything of an abnormal character.  The estimates must every year contain a considerable number of such items and to exclude them all when calculating the total of our normal expenditure would be to falsify the result.</P>
    <P>I have hitherto held that out of the total outlay on the Army a sum of £2,000,000 should be regarded as normal and recurrent and be paid out of taxation.  In the estimates for the year 1923-24 the provision for the cost of the Army was something like £10,700,000.  In the course of a statement on the financial position made to the Dáil in November, 1923, I announced that in the following year the sum provided would be brought down to £4,000,000.  At that time the Army numbered over 35,000 men, and we still had a large number of internees behind barbed wire.  Some time later the Government decided that £4,000,000 <Col N="1345" /> must be regarded as double the amount that would in normal times be required for the maintenance of the defence forces, and that we must work down to £2,000,000 as speedily as possible.  The conditions that existed when that figure was fixed were still far from normal. The time has now come when it may be reconsidered.  I need hardly say that the Government regards the maintenance of an efficient defence force as one of its primary duties, and that it would give no countenance to the idea that the cost of the Army is expenditure which at any time may be arbitrarily cut down.  We need a defence force to protect the State and the people from internal attack; we need a defence force to ensure as far as possible that our national rights will be respected by other States.  That this is a small and comparatively poor State does not affect the position.  If we can only have a small Army we can still have an army of strength proportionate to the wealth and territory to be defended. The state of international morality is not yet such that we can rely on our own national good behaviour to safeguard us.  A country that will not provide for its own defence according to its capacity is not likely to have its rights protected in a spirit of pure altruism by any other country. Heretofore our defence force has been simply a standing army.  It could, indeed, have taken no other form.  But it has always been recognised that once the country had definitely reached normality, a standing army of ten to twelve thousand men would no longer be the cheapest or most suitable type of defence force.</P>
    <P>The Government is of opinion that immediately after the General Election it will be possible to take in hand the task of gradually transforming our present Army into a different type of military machine.  This opinion rests on the assumption that the electorate will give increased support to parties which accept the Treaty and Constitution and are prepared to work them.  If that assumption proves to be justified, it will be possible to save expense by concentrating troops into a smaller number of posts, to push on with the creation of an army reserve, and within a short time to create the nucleus of a <Col N="1346" /> territorial or militia force.  In this way we may in a couple of years reach a position in which the number of troops with the colours will be much smaller than at present, but in which many more men than we have now could be immediately mobilised in case of need. Even allowing for any additional burden which may be put upon our Army in connection with coastal defence under Article 6 of the Treaty, it is believed than an efficient defence force, of which the standing troops would only be a part, could be maintained at a cost of not more than £1,500,000 per annum.  I propose, therefore, that we should no longer regard £2,000,000 as the normal part of the present cost of the Army, but that the figure should be reduced by £500,000.</P>
    <P>The estimate of expenditure for the year 1927-28 on Supply Services is £23,502,631, and on Central Fund Services £3,771,369, making a total of £27,274,000.  In order to ascertain the amount that must be defrayed out of taxation or other normal revenue, the following items may be deducted from the total:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A.  Vote 8. Local Loans, £234,000 provision in respect of new capital.</P>
    <P>B.  Vote 11. Public Works and Buildings, £375,000 out of a total provision of £583,195 for sites and buildings, new works, alterations and additions; £20,000 the total provision in respect of compensation for premises commandeered by the Army; £145,000, the total provision in respect of drainage works.</P>
    <P>C.  Vote 14. Property Losses Compensation, £979,180, the entire provision.</P>
    <P>D.  Vote 52. Department of Agriculture, £51,500, provision for capital expenditure in connection with the establishment of the new faculties of General Agriculture and Dairy Science at Dublin and Cork respectively; £19,000 being the amount by which the provision for loans for agricultural purposes exceeds the amount expected to be received in repayment of such loans.  £85,000 the entire provision for loans to co-operative creamery societies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> E.  Vote 53. Forestry £25,000 out of a total of £50,000 provided for the purchase of land and cultural operations.</P>
    <P>F.  Vote 54. Land Commission, £174,000 being that portion of a total provision of £274,000 for the improvement of estates which may be regarded as abnormal.</P>
    <P>G.  Vote 55. Advances to Agricultural Credit Societies, £84,000, the entire estimate.</P>
    <P>H.  Vote 64. Army, £683,767 the amount by which the Army estimate exceeds £1,500,000.</P>
    <P>I.  Vote 65. Army Pensions, £57,000 the amount by which the estimate exceeds the provision which would be required in a normal year.</P>
    <P>J.  Central Fund Services, £530,450, provision for the repayment with interest of the Dáil Eireann Internal Loan issued in 1919-20.</P>
    <P>The total of the deductible items given under these ten heads is £3,462,897.  If we take this figure from the aggregate estimate of expenditure on Central Fund Services and Supply Services, we get an estimated sum of £23,811,103 to be spent on purposes for which borrowing ought not to take place.  But, as I pointed out last year, our estimates taken in bulk necessarily reach a total figure greater than will in practice be required for the service of the year.  The estimates containing provision for normal and recurrent expenditure, apart from Central Fund services, number 66, and the number of sub-heads under which such expenditure is set out totals 550.  The principle on which the Estimates are framed is that in each sub-head sufficient money shall be provided for the purposes of the sub-head.  The Estimates, moreover, are drawn up from 15 to 18 months before the end of the period to which they relate.  Consequently it may be accepted that no matter how carefully the Estimates are framed it will be found at the end of every year that, taken together, they have contained provision for more money than was actually required.  Last year I put the margin of over-estimation included in that part of the aggregate, <Col N="1348" /> which had not been set aside to be covered by borrowing, at £650,000. This year the figure might be taken as £630,000.  If this further amount is deducted from the estimates of expenditure we get a net total of £23,181,103. That is the figure upon which we must base our calculation in regard to any adjustment of taxation.  The whole sum will be spent during the year, and no part of it ought to be borrowed.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the revenue side.  In the White Paper, as Deputies will have noted, it is estimated that taxation on its present basis will this year yield a sum of £20,765,000, while postal and other non-tax revenue is expected to bring in £3,685,000.  The anticipated income of the period is, therefore, £24,450,000.  Portion of this sum, however, consists of receipts that for the purposes of comparison with the estimates of normal and recurrent expenditure cannot properly be taken into account. Since we have deducted from the total on the expenditure side, items representing capital outlay or outlay that was abnormal and non-recurrent in character, we must also deduct from our gross income all similar items. Accordingly, the figure which appears in the White Paper for miscellaneous non-tax revenue must be lowered by the deduction of the following sums:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The amount to be deducted from the aggregate estimate of revenue is, therefore, £640,800, leaving, a net figure of <Col N="1349" /> £23,809,200.  When this sum is compared with the total expenditure which must be met out of income, we get a figure of £628,097 representing excess revenue.</P>
    <P>Before considering how this surplus should be disposed of, we must allow for the increased debt charges due to borrowing for abnormal expenditure, which will have to be borne this year. It is probable that these charges will absorb £150,000.  On the other hand, it may be assumed that the Currency Bill will be passed by the Oireachtas without any amendments that would reduce the profit which will accrue to the Exchequer from the proposed new system of note issue.  Of course nothing like £250,000 can be expected this year. But it is not unreasonable to look for a profit of £90,000 or £100,000 before 31st March next.  The position, therefore, is that after providing for increased debt charges on the one hand, and allowing for a contribution from the Currency Commission on the other, the sum available for reduction of taxation in the current financial year may be put in round figures at £550,000, leaving a small sum for contingencies.</P>
    <P>It may fairly be asked whether there is a good prospect that burdens removed this year will not have to be reimposed next year.  There are, I think, two rules which should be observed in deciding how an estimated surplus shall be applied.  One is that as far as possible taxation in any particular year should be adjusted to the financial requirement of that year; the other is that switch-back fluctuations in tax rates should be avoided. Accordingly, it is clear that while we should certainly use the available surplus to reduce taxation, we should, in deciding on the form that reduction will take, have regard to the prospects of next year and the following years. If it seems likely that shrinking yield or increasing liabilities will necessitate taxation next year at rates higher than will suffice for this year, then any relief that is now given should be in the shape of concessions the entire cost of which will fall upon the Exchequer in the present year and will not recur.  If, however, it seems probable that relief given this year can be continued and even increased next <Col N="1350" /> year, then we may now decide upon a measure of relief that will not only absorb the surplus of this year but will cost an additional sum in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Without even a remote approach to the realms of prophecy, two factors bearing upon the finances of the year 1928-29 can be foretold.  Firstly, present recurrent expenditure will be increased by the annuity of £250,000 payable to Great Britain in accordance with the Agreement of December, 1925, and secondly, debt charges will be further increased.  That is one side of the picture.  The other is not so gloomy.  In 1928-29 a full year's contribution of £250,000 should be paid by the Currency Commission.  It is hoped to complete shortly the steps necessary to secure that death duties on shares held by Saorstát citizens in British companies doing business here will all come into our Exchequer.  The work of the Tariff Commission may lead to the imposition of some customs duties which, though not designed to produce revenue, will nevertheless bring money into the Exchequer. With a sufficient effort savings may be effected which will reduce appreciably the cost of public services.  Finally, at the end of another year or two, consideration may be given to the question whether it will be necessary to continue to the end extinguishing compensation stock at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum entirely out of revenue.  Taking everything into consideration the Executive Council are satisfied that they are justified in proposing such relief from taxation as will cost £550,000 to £570,000 this year and perhaps £300,000 additional in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>We are in the fortunate position of having received a good deal of sincere and eloquent advice about the reductions we should make in taxation. But unfortunately, we have only a limited sum in hand and much of the sage counsel that has been tendered us must be rejected.  Let me say at once that we do not propose to abolish the corporation profits tax.  By the concessions made last year the number of companies paying this tax has been reduced from about 600 to 60.  Half or <Col N="1351" /> more than half of the tax collected is paid by British companies and until the death duties problem which I have discussed in previous Budget statements has been satisfactorily solved we shall keep the corporation profits tax.  I admit, however, that in its present form it is not a tax that should be continued permanently.  We have been urged to reduce the entertainments tax, though it was scarcely pretended by the kinema proprietors that the reduction would be passed on to the public.  I understand that in the event of this Budget proving unsatisfactory, some of the picture-house owners have made preparations to show slides stating in plain terms what they think of the Minister for Finance.  I may say that the Executive Council as a body is quite undismayed.</P>
    <P>Though it is not really a tax matter, we have considered further reductions in the telephone charges, but in view of the still very considerable deficit on the Post Office as a whole, we have decided to make no change at present.  We have once again inquired into the possibility of reducing the beer and spirit duties.  As I have already indicated, the decline in consumption which took place after the establishment of the Saorstát has very nearly ceased.  It can no longer be urged that it is necessary to make substantial sacrifices of revenue now in order to avoid much greater losses later.  We have all along felt unwilling to reduce either the beer duty or the spirit duty separately and our attitude in this respect is unchanged. If we gave, in the case of both beer and spirits, any reduction that would be worth giving, the cost would fully equal or perhaps exceed the entire relief which the present financial position and prospects would render justifiable.  We should not, however, consider it sound public policy, with economic conditions as they are, to propose no changes in taxation, other than a lowering of the liquor duties.  Consequently we do not recommend to the Dáil any changes in the taxes on beer and spirits.</P>
    <P>Apart from the protective taxes only two important customs duties remain. The sugar duty has been reduced by 1¾d. per lb., and is 1/4d. per lb. below <Col N="1352" /> the British level.  In view of the establishment of a sugar industry in the Saorstát and of the possibility of its extension, it is not considered desirable to alter the existing duty.  The cost of reducing the tobacco duty by 1d. an oz. would be £500,000.  If there were a very big sum available for reduction of taxation, making possible a variety of reliefs, favourable consideration might well be given to the idea of lowering the tobacco duty, but to make it our principal tax change at the present time could hardly be described as the best thing that could be done for the country.</P>
    <P>The need of the moment is for something to stimulate enterprise, to promote a spirit of business confidence, and thereby to speed up production and increase employment.  Relief from taxation should accordingly be given in the way that seems most likely to have a tonic effect on the economic life of the Saorstát.  After considering with all care the possibilities of the situation we have decided that such relief as we are able to give will be most beneficial to the country at large if granted in respect of income tax.</P>
    <P>We do not accept the extravagant arguments of those who advocate the abolition of income tax.  We think that, efficiently administered, it is an eminently just tax.  But we also believe that the rate at which it may be levied, without unduly slowing-down the machinery of production, depends on the degree of economic advancement that has been attained.  In a country like this where, unfortunately, there are less business initiative and tenacity than would be desirable, a stimulus to development can be given by a reduction in the rate of income tax which could not be given by any other form of relief.  Strong social arguments can, of course, be advanced in favour of increased allowances of various kinds, but a lowering of the rate, through its general economic reactions, will give advantages to much greater numbers of people than could be reached by any change in the allowances.  It may be hoped that a reduction in the income tax by fostering enterprise will help the unfortunate class who have no income.</P>
    <P>Before passing away from this point <Col N="1353" /> I should like to mention one or two subsidiary reasons which we saw in favour of giving relief to the income tax payer.  I have already referred to the praiseworthy zeal and efficiency of our revenue service.  If the taxpayer, whatever his motive, now pays up better than he used to pay, there seems to be reason in the contention that he should be rewarded by a reduction in the rate.  Again, any cause of complaint that the shareholders in Saorstát companies may have with regard to corporation profits tax will at all events be lessened by a lowering of the income tax.  A reduction of the rate by 6d. would cost between £250,000 and £300,000 this year, and about £500,000 in a full year.  On the other hand, while a reduction of 1s. would cost just about £550,000 this year, in subsequent years, according to the calculation which we have heretofore used, the cost would be somewhere about £1,000,000, which is more than we could afford to give.  I am, however, optimist enough to believe that the effect of a reduction of 1s. in encouraging enterprise and in modifying that sense of grievance amongst taxpayers which impedes collection, would result in a 3s. rate yielding ultimately not £3,000,000, but £3,100,000, or even £3,150,000 per annum.  Income tax in the coming year will be charged, levied and paid at the rate of 3s. in the pound.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to make any general changes in the income tax code at present.  The system we have inherited is undoubtedly much too complicated for this country and some attention has been given to the question of simplification.  But the pressure on the Revenue Commissioners and their staff has heretofore been so heavy that it has not yet been possible to map out a scheme of reform.  The matter will be kept in mind and as soon as any experienced officials can be spared from urgent current work, an effort will be made to carry out an investigation of the problems involved, but it seems unlikely that any proposal can be submitted to the Dáil for some years.</P>
    <P>The provisions of last year's Finance Act consequent on the double taxation relief agreement contained a flaw which, if not removed, would result in super-tax payers who are doubly resident, <Col N="1354" /> receiving in respect of the year 1926-27 a much greater measure of relief than they are really entitled to.  It is proposed to put the defect right.</P>
    <P>The basis on which the match duty was charged has just been altered in Great Britain.  It will no longer be paid on the 10,000 matches but on the 1,000 containers or the gross of containers. In consequence matches packed, as many brands of Continental matches are, in containers holding 35 or 40 sticks, will be severely penalised. There are large quantities of such matches in bond in Great Britain at the present time with names and other inscriptions printed on the boxes in English.  The Saorstát is the only place in which they can conveniently be dumped.  If we were not to adjust our tax in such a way as to make our market no more favourable than the British, the quantities of Continental matches which would be sent here from Great Britain would be such as would probably oblige the Saorstát factory to close down for a considerable period. We propose, therefore, to change the basis of charge of the match tax in the same way as has been done in Great Britain; but whereas the rate of duty was raised in Great Britain by 20 per cent., we propose no increase.</P>
    <P>It has been represented during the past year that certain business is being lost to the Saorstát because of the fact that the sections governing the boot tax contain no provision enabling the Revenue Commissioners to allow duty free admission of parts which have been imported to undergo a further process of manufacture and are then exported. Power will now be taken to allow duty free importation in such cases.  Similarly, when oatmeal is imported, made into oat cakes and then exported, it is proposed that the Revenue Commissioners be authorised to pay drawback.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the time available for the consideration of the Finance Bill this year will be short, we do not propose to incorporate any changes in the law which can be postponed without hardship to individuals or serious loss to the State.  Consequently, we shall have fewer resolutions and a much shorter Finance Bill than usual.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> It only remains for me to say that the important reduction in taxation which is proposed was decided on after the fullest consideration and with the knowledge that it necessitates a great and immediate effort to achieve economy. The pool of income-tax arrears is now undoubtedly within sight of exhaustion, and although there are expedients by which a temporary increase of revenue may be got for a year or two without raising the actual rates of taxation, the point will be reached in three years at the outside when substantial fresh taxation will be unavoidable unless there has been either an appreciable reduction in expenditure or such a definite and general improvement in the economic position that existing taxation will yield a good deal more.</P>
    <P>The need for retrenchment can scarcely be mentioned without provoking demands for a &ldquo;Geddes&rdquo; Committee. And it is always most loudly demanded by those who have not the vaguest idea of what the original &ldquo;Geddes&rdquo; Committee was, or did, or of the circumstances in which it was appointed.  The Government is fully satisfied that even if suitable personnel could be found (which is doubtful), the conditions which would enable a body on the lines of the &ldquo;Geddes&rdquo; Committee to perform useful work, do not exist here at present.  We recognise, however, that some special machinery is necessary to bring about the economies which are requisite within the next couple of years.  Heretofore the staffs responsible for examining proposals and controlling expenditure have been somewhat fully occupied with work arising from the transfers, adjustments and developments consequent on the change of Government and with the many proposals for new and additional services that have been submitted by Departments. They have been able by means of special Departmental committees and otherwise to examine the staffing of various departments and to secure reductions.  They have been able to fasten on heads of expenditure here and there and effect important economies, but they have not been able to <Col N="1356" /> undertake a systematic and searching survey of Government expenditure as a whole.  The Executive Council is satisfied that the time has now come when such a survey can and must be begun.  Accordingly it is proposed to set up a special committee of experienced officials taken partly from the Department of Finance and partly from other Departments to examine the whole field of Government expenditure and recommend such reductions as appear to be possible.  If it can be arranged, a Minister will act as Chairman. It may be that two or three Ministers will undertake to act in turn. It is intended that the Committee shall be constituted forthwith and that it shall keep steadily at work until the investigation is completed.  The Committee will have full authority from the Executive Council to require the attendance of all officials and the production of any information it considers necessary.  The idea is that every item of recurrent expenditure should be put on trial.  The plan I have outlined can lead to satisfactory results only if the widespread demand for ever-increasing State help and State activity is resisted for some time to come.  If new burdens continue to be cast upon the State not only will the positive results of the Committee's labours be nullified, but the volume of current work will make it impossible to spare continuously from their Departments the officials of whom it is intended that the Committee should be composed.</P>
    <P>I am personally satisfied that economies will be shown to be possible in classes of expenditure that have not been the subject of public propaganda at all.  It may prove that some of the activities we inherited from the British are unnecessary or too costly for the Saorstát.  In other cases it may be seen that British methods aimed at a standard of technical perfection which the Saorstát need not look for.  It would be wrong, however, to give the idea that enormous savings are possible.  They are not. The standard of social services ought not to be further lowered and cannot be further lowered so as to give true economy.  The amount required for educational services is bound to increase <Col N="1357" /> somewhat.  The economic conditions of the Western sea-board cannot be dealt with without expenditure. In certain other respects increases are inevitable.  To find savings to meet these additional charges, and to provide the required margin will not be an easy task.</P>
    <P>The popular idea that the cost of the Civil Service presents a practically unlimited field for economy is baseless. Civil Service pay constitutes a comparatively small part of the outlay of the State.  The greater number of civil servants are employed in the Post Office which is really a business run by the State&mdash;a business which is steadily moving to the point of paying its own way.  Its employees from the financial point of view are in a slightly different position from other State officials.  So far as the greater part of their pay is concerned, they are no more a charge on the taxpayer than railway engineers or tram conductors. Apart from the postal officials, the cost of the pay of the Civil Service is £2,777,777 or 11.2 per cent. of the total of the Central Fund payments plus the votes exclusive of that for the Post Office.  The figure I have given includes the salaries and wages not only of civil servants in the ordinary sense of the word, but also of the Governor-General, judges, prison warders, Ministers and charwomen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If we add the Post Office figures we find that salaries and wages of the Civil Service amount to £4,563,277 or 16.6 per cent. of the State expenditure.  In this connection it should be remembered that a great deal has already been done by way of retrenchment in the Civil Service and that there is continuous revision. Staffs have been reviewed and numbers adjusted.  Salary scales have been reduced in respect of new entrants and promoted officers.  Annual leave and the subsistence rates of travelling officers have been cut down.  The weekly hours of work have been increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not much further can be done without the abandonment or restriction of <Col N="1358" /> services.  I am satisfied that there are services that can, at any rate, be partially suspended without great loss to any section of the community.  But we can no more afford the reckless scrapping of services than we can afford reckless expenditure on them.  We must seek for economy, but we must not forget that we have an undeveloped country, and that our real hope is in development.  Public money is the money of people who are for the most part poor and struggling; we must spend it carefully and sparingly.  But we must not spend it so sparingly that opportunities of national development are missed or national efficiency is lost instead of being increased.  We believe that an inquiry such as is now proposed to be instituted will enable us to pursue a policy of retrenchment that will be at once sound and effective.  We have, of course, pursued in the past such a policy, but the point has now been reached when more systematic methods are necessary if further progress is to be made.</P>
    <P>The remission of taxation proposed in this Budget will, with the remissions which have already been given, mean that apart altogether from any question of fall in yield, the burden on the taxpayer and ratepayer has been lightened by a net annual sum of nearly £3,000,000.  The tea duty, which was 8d. per lb., has disappeared, together with the corresponding duties on coffee and cocoa.  The duty on sugar has been reduced to very little more than one-third of the former figure&mdash;from 2¾d. to 1d. per pound.  Income tax, which was 5s. in the pound four years ago, is now being brought down to 3s.  Rates on agricultural land, taking the country as a whole, are lower by more than 1s. in the pound in consequence of the doubling of the agricultural grant.  Telephone charges have been substantially reduced.  Corporation profits tax was formerly charged on all profits above £500; now it is only charged on profits above £10,000.  A number of the customs duties known as key industry duties have depreciated currency duties have disappeared.  The protective duties which we have imposed must be set against some of the remissions.  But these duties have resulted <Col N="1359" /> in 10,000 people being employed in factories in the Saorstát in the manufacture of the protected commodities.</P>
    <P>The constructive schemes which have been initiated within the past few years are well known to Deputies and to the public, and their importance is appreciated.  But remitted taxation is soon forgotten, and whatever relief may have been given there are many who groan as fervently as before.  It is not always realised that economic depression in the mind of the individual helps to produce economic depression round about him.  It is, however, a simple fact that heavy taxation, besides the damage it does directly, injures business by making the individual feel that the odds against him are too heavy, and that he cannot contend with them.  Conversely, an important part of the benefit of reduced taxation normally lies in the psychological effect on the individual and the community. If a substantial number of people obstinately refuse to allow even substantial remission of taxation to have any effect on the settled melancholy of their outlook a not inconsiderable part of the value of the relief is lost.</P>
    <P>It would be for the good of the country if the kind of inverted Couéism which is so commonly practised in regard to taxation and the effects of taxation lost a little of its popularity. If the facts of the financial and general economic position are looked at squarely, it will be recognised that greater difficulties than any that are still before us, have been surmounted, and that the future may be faced in a mood of sober confidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement will, no doubt, give satisfaction to a certain number of people, but I think the number of people is limited.  The actual number is not yet available.  I do not know whether the Minister can give the House any idea of the number of persons who are income tax payers and who will thereby receive some relief from this particular Budget statement and the resolution that is now before us.</P>
      <P>I noted that the Minister adopted the usual attitude of the Ministers for Finance in this country and the Chancellors of the Exchequer in other countries.  He seemed to create the impression, or endeavoured to create the impression, that the national credit was the equivalent of national prosperity; that when we have national loans at round about par, or a little above par, that is an indication that the country is in a state of prosperity. I am willing to agree that it will add something, or, at least, it will prevent some decline in prosperity which a fall in the national loan might possibly entail, but I think it is quite wrong to let the argument go without comment that simply because the national loan stands at 101, that is evidence of national prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as one can gather from observations, from the reading of statistical returns and from comments from business houses and agriculturists throughout the country, the state of the national loan in the market is not by any means a reflection of the state of economic prosperity in the country. I am sorry that the Minister's statement <Col N="1361" /> does not show an appreciation of the necessity for some positive act on the part of the Minister to remedy the very appalling state of things economically that we hear about or see in the country.</P>
    <P>The reduction of income tax to 3/- will, no doubt, be heard with great satisfaction by a considerable number of people.  I am not going to find fault with it, but I think it would be much more pleasing and much more beneficial if there had been some discrimination instead of making a flat-rate reduction&mdash;if there had been some discrimination and if some relief were given to that section of income tax payers who would re-invest whatever they save through this reduction in Irish productive industries.  To speak of this reduction of income tax as being a necessary stimulus to industrial activity is, I think, fallacious.  I do not know whether it is possible to analyse the figures that may be in the hands of the Minister, but if it were I am pretty confident in saying that the reduction in income tax will, in a comparatively small measure, find its way into productive enterprise or in re-investments. The economic effect will rather be that the saving of the shilling in the pound will be spent on new imported luxuries, with no economic effect of a productive kind in this country.  That is perhaps too sweeping a statement&mdash; not no economic effect, but a small economic effect.  I am willing to concede the point that there will be a minority of people, who have been endeavouring to live simply and within their means, who will continue on the same scale of living, and such relief to them as is occasioned by this reduction may find its way into capital expenditure in productive enterprises.  But I think the chances are that the amount of stimulus that will be given by this reduction will be very small and that a much greater benefit would have been achieved had there been some discrimination and even greater relief given where it could be shown that the income had been re-invested in Irish productive enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a statement which I am not sure that I can appreciate to the full.  It seems to me to be <Col N="1362" /> very doubtful wisdom and rather like a pre-election dodge to make a paper appearance of a surplus.  He is disposing of half-a-million pounds, or thereabouts, and he finds that half-a-million pounds by saying: &ldquo;We are going to think of the Army expenditure in normal times as being half-a-million pounds less than it is at present, and we are going to consider that half-million pounds, which we are taking for the relief of income tax, as being abnormal, and borrow for the purpose of meeting that sum of money.&rdquo;  I cannot appreciate the Minister's argument that it is fair to take the Army Estimate of £2,183,000, reduce it mentally by half-a-million pounds, and say: &ldquo;We shall borrow that sum because it is abnormal,&rdquo; and to do the same with £53,000 worth of Army pensions, and borrow against that for the purpose of finding money to remit to income tax payers.  I do not think it will stand examination by any careful finance expert.  It is rather, I suggest, a financial dodge, the dodge of a Chancellor of Exchequer or Minister for Finance who wants to put before the country a somewhat popular Budget, at least to that part of the community which pays income tax, and to say: &ldquo;Well, we are going some day in certain circumstances to reduce the Army to smaller proportions, and we are going to borrow one-fourth of this current year's expenditure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want at this stage to repeat the queries which I put to Ministers on more than one occasion, but I will suggest, for the consideration of the Dáil, that if this Army, which is going to be transformed, is in fact to be a protective force, to be, in the words of the Minister, &ldquo;sufficient to protect the wealth and territory of this country against external attack,&rdquo; that there will be a considerable sum of money required for defence work, which is not merely the maintenance of men, but defence works, expenditure of various kinds which are not contemplated in the £2,183,000 which form the sum in the Estimates as required for the Army. If there is to be this protection against possible external attack you will have to meet that out of current revenue, and you are not justified in borrowing £500,000 odd to meet the expenditure <Col N="1363" /> on the Army for this year and treat it as non-recurrent.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister has not given us some hint or promise that it was the intention of the Government to provide moneys to meet the very clamant needs of hundreds of thousands of people in various parts of the country.  There are many people who will not have much thought of the finance statement of the Minister, will not be very pleased to know that income tax is to be reduced by £500,000, and that no definite, positive steps are to be taken to relieve them of the very imminent peril of death by starvation. The Minister has taken some credit for his promise to meet the calls of his critics by setting up a Departmental Committee, to be presided over by some Ministers, with a view to retrenchment in Civil Service charges.  I take it that the assurances that were given last year and in previous years, time after time, were really not warranted, because I think it will be remembered that all that he is now promising has been in operation for two or three years past, that there has been a very rigorous examination of departmental expenditure, and that the result of that examination has been to confirm the Minister in his frequent statements that the utmost economy is being exercised. Therefore I take it that the promise regarding a Departmental Economy Committee is merely so much fudge, because it has already been in operation, and I would prefer to take the Minister's assurances in previous statements to that of this particular statement. If we were only to add the number of times together that such assurances have been given, the majority has it, the economy has been practised, there is nothing further to be gained by this new Committee, simply by the fact that it will be presided over by a Minister.</P>
    <P>But I would suggest that it might be worth the Minister's while to take some trouble to find out whether some economy of the right kind, economy because of public satisfaction, economy in more contented service, could not be achieved if he were to consider the situation within the Civil Service, consider with a little more sympathy <Col N="1364" /> the calls and pleas and demands of civil servants for consideration of their grievances.  I have reason to believe that there exists in the Service a considerable amount of irritation and dissatisfaction, and that will not be removed by examinations into economy; it is much more likely to be removed by some sympathetic consideration of the claims that the Civil Service is putting forward.</P>
    <P>Credit was claimed by the Minister, and I have no doubt that from his point of view as a collector of taxes the utmost credit is due to the Revenue Commissioners for the manner in which they have succeeded in abstracting blood out of stones.  I am not sure, though, that, for the sake of giving a somewhat satisfactory report to the House on the Budget day, it is good public policy to attempt that process of abstracting blood from stones.  I think it possible that you might be doing much more harm to the economic stability of the country by that particular kind of process, that a little more leniency and a little more consideration of the circumstances of the individual who is called upon to pay is due.  I am thinking at this moment more particularly of notices which have been given to workmen in receipt of under £4 per week informing them that for a certain number of weeks they shall have deducted from their pay a sum of 50/-.  Now, when you ask a workman who is receiving £3 10/- to £4 per week to hand over £2 10/- per week out of his pay for a certain number of weeks and when you say that it must be deducted, it is not likely to inspire respect for Governmental institutions, and I think that there are other Deputies who could instance a process equally indefensible in respect of other classes of the community.</P>
    <P>The statement that the Minister has made will be read by me and by others with care and, I am sure, with a good deal of interest, and we shall have opportunities of examining it and discussing it with more detail and with a better understanding.  But I do commend to the House and to the public this idea, that they are not by any means to take to themselves the satisfaction <Col N="1365" /> that because the Budget shows a surplus ,and because the National Loan stands at a certain figure which appears satisfactory, that is ample evidence of the general prosperity of the country.</P>

      <P>The procedure usually followed on Budget day is that the Minister makes his statement, which is then circulated. The resolutions are discussed.  But until we reach the final resolution the debate is confined to the actual resolution before the Committee.  On the final resolution, when Deputies have had an opportunity of reading the Minister's statement, as Deputy Johnson suggested, the general discussion is taken on all the matters raised in the Minister's speech.  That was the procedure followed heretofore.  I think it is the most sensible procedure, and I take it it will be followed again to-day. The resolution now before us deals with income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not prepared to deal with income tax alone, but I can see the justice of your remarks.  To the ordinary individual, who is living as best he can in these hard times, the Minister's statement will not give very much satisfaction.  It is not every individual who receives sufficient salary or wages to pay income tax, and the great bulk of the population are in that position, particularly those whose livelihood depends on agriculture.  To that great volume of the people&mdash;the poor people of the community&mdash;the Budget is barren of anything in the nature of relief.  I agree, however, that the reduction of one shilling in the income tax will have two effects.  It ought to stimulate industry, and it ought to bring back to this country people with incomes who have been forced out of it by reason of the high income tax, and who, if they come back, will bring so much revenue earning power to the community by giving necessary employment in the way of household staffs, etc.  In that respect, I view the reduction in income tax as a matter of great importance.  It is a move in the right direction.  However, I am very much disappointed that the Minister has not put the <Col N="1366" /> farmer in the same position in regard to income tax that he was in previous to the war.  Farmers are still paying income tax on their valuation, plus their position as occupiers and owners, and in some cases they are assessed on six times the amount they were assessed on before the war.  I contend that the revenue from income tax from farmers is small, and that it would have been a very good electioneering dodge on the part of the Minister if he had removed the payment of income tax from the farming community.  Of course, I do not advocate it from that point of view.  I am advocating it from the point of view of the disadvantage occasioned to the ordinary farmer when he gets this particular form from the income tax collector.  I am supposed to be a judge in these matters, and I am met by a hurricane of papers whenever I go to a fair.  Many of the people who receive these demands are not liable to income tax at all.  What is the procedure?  They go to some person in the city who calls himself an expert and they are charged a couple of guineas for finding out that they are not liable to be assessed.  The Minister is wasting time and paper and stamps, and the persons who receive the demands waste their money, and nobody is benefited, while the Government is all the time being railed at.  I have to take the side of the farmer and say that it would be good policy on the Minister's part to abolish income tax altogether so far as the farmers are concerned. I suppose I cannot touch on anything else but income tax.</P>

      <P>Dealing with the general question, perhaps the Minister will let us know his ideas.  He is giving relief in taxation to the extent of half a million.  We know that there was a Coinage Act passed last year and the income from the new coinage was supposed to have brought a sum of £600,000 into the Exchequer.  No mention was made by the Minister of that £600,000, which he is supposed to get from the new coinage.</P>

      <P>I do not intend at this stage, because it would be practically impossible, to go in any detail into the Minister's statement. The Minister made his statement at an exceedingly rapid pace, and I, for one, was scarcely able to follow what he said.  However, I may have an opportunity later of examining the figures in closer detail.  Taking the Budget as a whole, I, for one, could not but congratulate the Minister upon, at long last, taking, shall I say, judicial notice of suggestions made to him by myself and others during the last four years. I am particularly pleased that he has come to see that there is something to be gained by altering at some future date the style of our present Army. He has mentioned that it will be possibly constituted on something in the nature of a territorial basis, besides providing a standing army.  I have advocated that proposal time and again here, and I welcome the eleventh-hour decision of the Government in the matter.  I am in full accord with the proposal that we should have a defence force, as the Minister said, in accordance with our capacity, and also that a proportion of that force should be not in the nature of a standing army, but rather in the nature of a national reserve.  I am also pleased that the Minister has thought fit to regard a certain amount of the present expenditure on our defence force as abnormal expenditure, and to provide for it by way of borrowing.  I myself made that <Col N="1368" /> suggestion this time last year, but I was not listened to.  He has further stated that there is to be something in the nature of a Geddes Committee appointed. That proposal was made from all quarters in the House which are not occupied by Government supporters, and it was time and again turned down.  Of course, we now know what is going to take place on the 8th of June.  So, naturally, the Minister is coming to see that he had better do something to show the people that the Government pays some regard to suggestions that are made from other than Government benches.</P>
      <P>The only proposal by way of reduction in taxation is one along the lines of a decrease in the amount of income tax.  It is not necessary for me to labour the case that has been made for this by almost every non-Government speaker, both inside and outside the Dáil.  My complaint about this proposal in the Budget is that it is the only thing in the nature of relief that the Government proposes.  When this Government came into office one of their first actions was to dock the poor old age pensioners of some of their paltry pittance, and now, when they find themselves in a position to relieve some of the citizens, I thought that they might have considered at the closing stages of their term of office the revocation of that unwarranted action of theirs at the opening stage. But no.  We are to have a reduction of one shilling in income tax, which is very welcome, and, to my mind, a very belated and almost death-bed act of repentance on the part of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be necessary to have a choice of either one or the other.  I think that the alternative is not exclusive, and that probably both could be done.  But the Minister has decided at long last to reduce the income tax, and he says that it will cost something like £500,000 for the coming year, and possibly a million in the subsequent year.  That <Col N="1369" /> means that we have £500,000 according to his calculation, more or less to play with for the coming year.  That is all very well, but what about the other £500,000, which will have to be found for the subsequent year?  There is nothing that I can see in the Minister's proposal to show that the general expenditure in the year 1928-29 will be substantially reduced from the estimated expenditure for the coming year. The statement of the Minister was made in such a hurried way that it is practically impossible to debate it now, but the Minister has gone some way towards meeting demands which have been persistently made from all quarters of the country and of the House for the last four years.  I regret he has not seen his way to do something towards a reduction in the spirit and beer duty.  That reduction has been proposed here year after year.  I myself have pointed out that probably a reduction in those duties would not mean anything like a proportionate decrease in the amount of revenue which would be obtained; in fact, that if something is not done shortly to relieve those industries of this burden of taxation, this taxation in itself will probably eventually destroy the existing industries.  Much has been said and claimed on behalf of the Government about what has been done for the starting of a new industry in the shape of the manufacture of sugar in the County Carlow and elsewhere.  I think it is the duty of any Government to take care of, and to secure, the welfare of existing industries, especially industries which give rise to a large amount of employment, agricultural employment especially, throughout the country before they embark upon entirely new ones.</P>

This discussion is confined, as I understand, to the question of income tax, but I was only endeavouring to show that there could have been other means of relieving taxation, not in substitution for the income tax relief, but alongside the income tax relief.  The only complaint I have is not with the reduction in income tax, such as it is, but that there has not been a reduction elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise principally to remind the Minister for Finance of a promise which, I think, he made the year before last in his Budget statement. At that time the Minister made a definite promise to the House that, if and when there was a surplus to be distributed, the old age pensioners of the country would have first claim on it.  His exact words were that &ldquo;some revision of the Old Age Pension Act of 1924 will have to be given precedence to any reduction of taxation, however much required.&rdquo;  If the Minister thinks that he has now £550,000 to play with, as he appears to think he has, I think he should have honoured the promise he made to the House.  The Minister and the Government pretend to take no notice of what they usually call Press clamour, but this Budget proves, beyond all doubt, that the Press has won a victory; that the Press clamour has been responded to by the Government on the eve of an election. There is £550,000 in relief for the people who pay income tax.  There is nothing in the Budget for the people who have no incomes on which to pay tax.  I think the general opinion will be that this is a most uninteresting and tame Budget so far as the majority of the people of this country are concerned. There are fifty or sixty thousand people in this country to-day who not only have no incomes, but <Col N="1371" /> many of them have no food.  There is nothing in the Budget to hold out any hope of relief to these people.  The line taken by the Government has been to rob the poor, to put it very bluntly, in order to assist the rich or the comparatively rich.  We were told that the old age pensions had to be reduced because the country was too poor to afford to continue to pay the pensions which had been awarded by another Government.  The Minister and the Government expressed their regret that they had to do that, but the Minister gave a very definite promise to this House and the country that immediately they were in a position to do so the cut then made would be restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I would like to know is, how far this House or the country can place any reliance upon promises given by a Minister?  I am sure the Minister will not try to deny that he made the promise.  It should be noted by the House that it would take less than half of this sum of £550,000 to restore the shilling.  I do not suggest that the Minister would be able to put the old age pensioners in this country back into the position they were in prior to the passing of the 1924 Act for £250,000, but he certainly could restore the shilling cut to all the old age pensioners in this country for less than £250,000.  But no, the Minister thinks that this will be a much more popular thing and will get Press publicity, and draw forth the plaudits of the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; and of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; and other papers to support the Government for the coming election. I think the people of this country have every right to feel that they have been badly, treated in this matter.  I feel that the House ought to say whether the payers of income tax who had already got relief to the extent of a shilling in the pound are to get relief to the extent of another shilling in the pound at the expense of the blind and the old people in this country.  That is the position in a nutshell.  I was rather surprised to hear Deputy Wilson talking about farmers who pay income tax. Indeed I may say that I was pleasantly surprised, because I thought, from what I had heard going through the country, <Col N="1372" /> and in this House, and from what I know myself about the farmers of the country, that very few of them were able to pay income tax.</P>

If the Minister were to consider the people who are not able to pay income tax he could have given greater and much more deserving relief to them than he is giving by way of reduction of this sum of £550,000 to the income tax payers.  As I said at the outset, I rose principally to remind the Minister and the House of the definite promise the Minister made to the House the year before last.  I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter when he comes to reply, and as to how he proposes to get out of the definite promise which he then made.</P>

      <P>It is somewhat gratifying that the reduction in income tax should have been made in advance of Great Britain by the Irish Free State.  It will demonstrate the confidence that the Ministers have in the capacity of the public to believe that they have, as was stated in the opening passage of the Budget speech, securely established the Free State on a sound financial basis.  I think that as an advertisement it is magnificent. Deputy Morrissey is not alive to the fact that the Ministers were afraid to adopt another line of advertisement. They might very well, and I am sure they did consider the possibilities of it, have entertained the idea of restoring the shilling to the old age pensioners, but they realised that that would be declared on all hands to be a trick to restore the voting power of the Ministerialists in the country.  They were afraid that that should be urged against them and so they dropped it. They knew also that the reduction of the income tax would be complained of while nothing was done by the old age pensioners and the national school teachers on whom a draft had to be made in the lean years, but they came to the conclusion that of the two the less obvious and the less open to derisive <Col N="1373" /> criticism would be this which could be defended so well from the side of those who are interested in the economic recovery of the country.  I have always held, since I had the honour of being a member of this House, that the direct tax is the proper tax.  I am sorry that, while I have been able to convince the Ministry of the error of their ways in regard to financial policy in one or two important respects, I have failed utterly in regard to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surprise was expressed just now that farmers pay income tax.  It ought to be a matter of surprise that more citizens are not called upon to pay income tax.  We have steadily reduced indirect taxation, with the result that the vast majority of the people have no means, directly, of being aware of what the Government costs them: of how much they are mulcted in to pay for the expenditures in the State according to the policies pursued in this, that or the other department of the Government. People are not aware, to begin with, that it is their Government, and that the Government ought to be carried on according to their needs. I must say, with a certain amount of conscious exaggeration, that it is only the income tax payer who knows fully how the shoe pinches in the finances of the State.  We all counted upon a recognition of the income tax payer's right to have a reduction in the special form of discrimination between earned and unearned income.  We have followed, for some years, the newer British procedure which was a reversal. Formerly a difference was made in the amount of the tax according as it fell on earned or upon unearned income, and when the two were joined together the case of the earned income taxpayer was met somewhat by relieving a fraction of his total earned income from taxation.  In the Free State that has been kept at one-tenth.  We had counted upon it being increased to one-sixth. That form of relief is very desirable inasmuch as it meets the equities of those whose income is an earned income and, consequently, are being bled in respect of their capital as well as of their dividend.  It is unfortunate that the rentier, as he would <Col N="1374" /> be called in France&mdash;the man living on dividends, rents or annuities which come from property inherited&mdash;should be on exactly the same footing in regard to income as the man who earns what comes in to him by way of income, and which is not, therefore, a dividend in any sense.</P>
    <P>I hold that it is most desirable to discriminate effectively between those two, and that the measure of discrimination which is at present in operation, to wit, that exemption of one-tenth, is really not sufficient in the Free State. A large body of the Civil Service pays income tax and, while complaints are made everywhere, almost universally, about salaries, account is not taken in this ignorant, rash, and uncritical comment upon the cost of running the Government of the State.  A large number of civil servants pay income tax, and their salaries are therefore larger to the eye than to the recipients. I believe that every class of citizen should have the fact of his citizenship in this respect brought home to him with equal clarity as it is to civil servants. I think it a pity, therefore, to leave the incidence of income tax precisely as it was.  The farmers have been harried for income tax at the same time as they have been harried for annuities and debts both to banks and other creditors, and, in so far as this reduction of income tax will give them relief, I think we must all be very grateful.  I do not know if Deputy Johnson is absolutely in earnest. Surely he realises that there is no way in which a stimulus to production and to the restoration of vitality in existing industries is so effective as in relief from income tax?</P>

      <P>Heavy income tax is a direct handicap upon production, especially in industry. That can be demonstrated.  In the <Col N="1375" /> effort which we are making at present for the re-creation of national life and for the provision in towns of forms of occupation which will stop emigration, we who are interested in that, particularly those of us who believe in national protection as a great instrument for the regeneration of the country, must welcome reduction in income tax. Therefore, by that reduction, even those who pay no income tax must benefit.  The relief is immediate, no doubt, in the case of the taxpayer and somewhat more remote in the case of the employee, but undoubtedly anything that tends to relieve the employer of labour and that gives a greater incentive to enterprise and to the investment of money, particularly that leaves money free for investment, will help to revive industry and give a larger volume of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The super-tax affects, unfortunately, only a very few, and the few have correspondingly few friends. If there was a division made and distinction drawn between earned and unearned income tax I should certainly advocate a reduction of super-tax in respect of earned income.  I believe that that will give relief to very few.  It is obvious that the man in the street will consider that the Minister's utilisation of the surplus for a reduction of income tax is an effort to placate the city voter and to disregard the man in agriculture.  I believe, giving the Minister credit for the best intentions, that his purpose in this respect was really inspired by the desire to do something for the development of industry. He was looking rather to the yield that would come in later years to some successor of his when bringing in a Budget.  Some of us in this House have repeatedly argued that a reduction in income tax would really give a greater yield after the lapse of a few years.  That was an argument which I put forward in advocating a reduction of sixpence in the pound some years ago.  The Minister complained that if he were to make such a reduction his revenue would fall by so many hundreds of thousands of pounds.  I had faith in the rehabilitation of the country.  I looked forward to progress, <Col N="1376" /> and was confident that a reduction, even of sixpence, would give a greater yield to-day.  A reduction was made, and the result is a better and fuller reduction to-day.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that that surplus would not be available now if the Executive Council had not followed another line of financial policy than that on which they originally set out, and in which with a certain amount of obstinacy they persevered.  I think I am entitled to call this Budget, especially in regard to its better features, a Clann Eireann Budget, because in the Provisional Parliament my first difference with the President, who was then Minister for Finance, was with regard to his slogan, &ldquo;we must balance the books.&rdquo;  I found it necessary then to differ from him, and point out that a policy of balancing books is a sound policy if the expenditure of a particular year is met out of the income of that year, but attention must be had, and due regard paid, to a distinction between recurrent and non-recurrent expenditure.  When that distinction was made, and when certain charges were met by loan, the Minister found that a certain amount of buoyancy was created.  Having been taught by that experience, he is following it up this year, and, because this wiser financial policy has been followed by the Ministry, they can now dare to make a reduction of one shilling without fear of a recoil detrimental to the future of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>We can only talk on income tax at the moment, and I do not propose to say very much.  Every Deputy is prepared to welcome any reduction in taxation, and it is in that spirit that I say that I am glad to see that the Minister has had the courage to face up to this matter in the way he has.  I am in agreement with Deputy Wilson that the great majority of the people will not get any direct benefit from a reduction of the income tax.  The best we can hope for is that the anticipations of the Minister will be realised, and that this reduction will make for increased endeavour in the way of reviving and expanding our industries.  I am at a loss to understand the policy enunciated by the <Col N="1377" /> Minister when he points out in his statement that a reduction of one shilling will cost us £550,000 this year, and, in subsequent years, according to calculations, it will cost something about one million.</P>
      <P>Thus, what we are doing to-day the Minister calculates will cost one million. In order to do this to-day, we must calculate upon having one million to spare when the next Budget is introduced. That is, undoubtedly, a very big step, and I feel that the Minister should give some indication that he has proof that his anticipations in that respect will be realised.  In another part of the Minister's statement, when dealing with the beer and spirit duties, he gives an indication that the Executive Council have had under consideration a reduction of those duties, but that inasmuch as they could not give a reduction in both duties unless they were to absorb this total sum of £550,000, they decided to give no reduction.</P>

      <P>I want to know from the Minister whether the financial policy enunciated in the Budget is going to put us up against the proposition that next year, in order to carry on the policy to which he has given expression, we must have one million instead of £550,000.  Will we be able to have that one million for the relief of income tax payers alone, and, if having that one million as being essential to continue this policy, will it also mean that there will be no possibility of relieving taxation in any other direction? I am glad that it has been possible to have a reduction in income tax, but I think there are other fields that have to be explored, and, in my view, reduction of taxation in other ways would have a greater influence on the life of the people than would those steps which the Minister has taken. The steps which the Minister has taken to-day create a situation for future Ministers which will make it practically impossible, or, at least, very difficult to give remission on other taxation. I have been trying to examine that aspect of the question, but I find <Col N="1378" /> it difficult, and, if it means that this bold step&mdash;a step which I recognise demands a certain amount of courage and which, I hope, will have good results&mdash;will affect a comparatively small number of the total citizens of the Saorstát, will that step have such influence on our financial policy as to make it likely that future Ministers will not be able to make a remission of taxation in other fields?</P>

      <P>I do not think that the rule of keeping to the resolution has been very closely observed.  I think that most speakers have strayed off from the resolution before us to deal with other matters.</P>
      <P>I mean to stick to this motion, and say on it the few words that I have to say.  Later on, when we have an opportunity, I shall deal with other matters. I think that this reduction of 1/- in the income tax will have a very great effect for good in the country.  I think it will bring a lot of money back to the country, and that it will give people here who are held back from doing productive works by the awful drain of income tax a chance of giving more employment. Long ago I thought that if the income tax could be brought down to 1/- or 1/6 it would have a great effect in giving additional employment throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Magennis always makes a very interesting speech.  It is always a pleasure to listen to him.  And with a great deal of what he said on this matter I agree.  He claims that he urged the Minister long ago to reduce income tax but that he would not listen to him. I think the Minister showed great wisdom in not listening to him.  It would have been a very great mistake, in the state the country was in, to embark on any rash change until he was quite certain how financial matters stood and that the country could stand it.  I am very glad he did not listen to clamour in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey alluded to the old age pensions.  We would all like to see the old age pensions restored to the state in which they were, but I think it would be a great mistake to give back the shilling just now; it would be judged very adversely throughout the country.  We hope that it will be done <Col N="1379" /> in the near future.  But substantial taxes have been taken off commodities that the old age pensioners use largely, and which should be a great relief to them.  The taking of the tax off tea and the reduction of the tax on sugar to a very small amount, was of great assistance to them.  I think, in the circumstances, that the Minister was perfectly right in not proceeding to give back the shilling that was taken off the old age pensions until he was certain the country could bear it.  I am quite certain, however, that it will be one of the first things that will be done later on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to confine my remarks at this stage to the income tax aspect of this Budget.  I may have an opportunity, at a later stage, of dealing with the general financial conditions existing in the country.  I must say that I congratulate the Minister on the reduction in income tax, but I want to be honest in the matter.  I believe that it will not be a popular reduction.  I believe that the other reductions which the Minister might have made, or the addition that he might have made to the old age pensions would be far more popular from a vote-catching point of view.  While I believe that certain advantages will accrue to the general population, and that production will probably be stimulated to a small extent by this reduction, if I were to have a choice between this reduction in income tax and other reductions that might be made I would not put it first, but I am very glad to see a reduction in taxation of any kind.  I believe that any form of reduction of taxation, as I think Deputy Magennis pointed out, <Col N="1380" /> will be of advantage to the poorer classes of the community.  It would be of advantage to the consumer, and very often the farmer is the consumer.  I am in agreement to a large extent, but not altogether, with Deputy Magennis and, perhaps, Deputy Johnson's theory in that regard.  I believe that income tax is largely passed on to the consumer. It is not altogether passed on, because there are people with certain fixed incomes who will not pass it on. This reduction will be of direct benefit to civil servants.  There is no doubt about that.  But we do not see that there is going to be anything taken off the salaries of civil servants to correspond to it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the old age pensioners, I must say that I am perfectly in agreement with Deputy Morrissey when he says that any surplus money should have been put to the advantage of the old age pensioners rather than to the relief of the income tax payer, and I base my claim in that respect on a promise made by the Minister. It is in the records of this House that the Minister promised that when an excess revenue was available the first use that would be made of it would be to give back to the old age pensioners what had been taken from them. I voted for the reduction of the old age pensions reluctantly, as I stated at the time, in the hope that if there was a possibility in the future of returning to them what was taken, advantage would be taken of it.  The Minister has, in my opinion, violated a promise in that regard.  It is not the first promise that the Minister made in a Budget speech that he afterwards violated.  I may say it ought to be a lesson to the Minister in regard to making promises.  I can point to two definite promises made by the Minister which he has seen fit to break.  I say that a promise made ought to be kept, and it is an obligation on this House and on the country that any surplus revenue should be put to the advantage of the old age pensioners.  I am only referring to the reductions and not to the change in the calculation in regard to means.  I think there is ample money to allow the shilling to be returned to the old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> I would like to call the attention of the Minister to a point in regard to the double income tax payments.  I understood from a statement made by the Minister last year that the arrangement which was arrived at with the British Exchequer with regard to the double income tax payments was, to a large extent, consequential on the maintenance of the rates of income tax on a level basis in this country and in England.  This changes the level.  The income tax in England is still at the old rate, while in this country it is down to 3/-.  I want the Minister to tell me if that is going to have any effect on the reciprocal arrangement that has been made, and whether he has been in touch with the British Exchequer authorities in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to quote from the Minister's speech in that regard.  Perhaps I had better finish.  The Minister stated: &ldquo;It is quite true, I believe, as a necessary consequence of this arrangement, that the income tax in the two countries cannot be very far apart.&rdquo;  Later he said: &ldquo;On the other hand, if we reduce our tax so low that very serious loss would be suffered by the British Exchequer by people coming here, they, on their part, might terminate the agreement.&rdquo;  Undoubtedly benefit will accrue to this country if we can induce people to come over to live here because of this reduction in income tax. I believe that there are considerable possibilities in that direction.  This reduction will induce people to come here, people such as those who take charge of packs of hounds and engage in sporting matters of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather inclined to agree with the suggestion made by Deputy Magennis that the exemption scale in regard to earned income is too low in this country and that we ought to be on a par with the scale allowed in England. The Minister might consider the question of raising the exemption scale on earned income from one-tenth to one-sixth.  I want to make one passing reference to the statement made by Deputy Magennis in regard to the <Col N="1382" /> taxation on unearned income.  I understood the Deputy to suggest that because, in his opinion, unearned income is inherited, there ought to be a difference between the rate of taxation on unearned income and earned income. I want to point out to the Minister that very probably a good deal of the unearned income is not the result of inheritance.  Very often it is the result of the hard work and savings of the people who get the advantage of it, and because of their business enterprise, and I cannot see how it would be possible to differentiate between the man who had inherited the money and the man who earned the capital that produced the unearned income.</P>
    <P>As an income tax payer on a small scale, I appreciate the reduction which the Minister is giving.  It is certainly an advantage to the country and an advantage to me personally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>I welcome the reduction in the income tax, which may be an inducement to capitalists to open their purse strings and start industries in the country that otherwise they are a little timid about doing.  Those industries would give employment, and our great outcry for the past two or three years has been regarding the lack of employment.  I am sorry, at the same time, that the old age pensioners were not considered.  I will venture to travel outside the proper sphere and to say that I am a little disappointed that the Minister did not reduce the tax on stout&mdash;the poor man's food and drink. That is all I will say on that matter now, lest I be called to order.  I am glad the Minister reduced the income tax, because many people asked themselves why they should invest money here in face of such high taxation. These people will now have no excuse. It is a pity, however, that there is not some differentiation between the man <Col N="1383" /> who has to earn his income and the man whose father earned it for him.  I am sure that, now that we are going to the country, we will be tripping over one another in order to get in popular amendments.  When the Minister sees the old amendment that I have been putting in constantly for the last three years, I hope he will say: &ldquo;Lest he should not come back any more, I will not refuse him this time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction of a shilling in income tax may have the effect that Deputies Wilson and Daly predicted, of encouraging people to invest money here, but I wonder how many people will be employed as a result. Deputy Wilson suggests that people who will come to live here will have to employ servants for their domestic convenience, but I wonder what was the real reason why the Minister reduced income tax and forgot his promise of two years ago to the old age pensioners. He was, no doubt, looking to himself.  If we take a salary of £1,700 a year we find that a reduction of 1/- in the £ will mean to the Minister and his colleagues £85 per year.  The jobs of the Ministers will be worth £85 a year more.  That may have been a great inducement to the Minister to bring about the reduction.  If we take count of all the Ministers, we find that the saving to them amounts to about £850 a year.  The Minister has left the Chamber. He cannot stand criticism.  He knows I struck the nail on the head. However, this reduction will be welcomed throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that when the Minister was applauded the applause did not come from Deputies interested in the worker. The applause came from those who are regarded as capitalists, to whom a shilling in the £ reduction will mean a great deal.  It is all very well to shout over a shilling in the £ reduction in income tax, but, as Deputy Morrissey has said, this is all Press propaganda. I think income tax should be abolished completely on all salaries up to £400 a year.  The man who earns from £300 to £400 a year is least able to pay income tax.  If the Minister abolished income tax on all salaries under £400 a year, he would be doing a good turn <Col N="1384" /> to a greater number of people than he is benefiting by this reduction.  Deputy Johnson has cited the case of a man earning £4 a week who must pay £2 10s. 0d. per week as arrears of income tax.  I know a man in my own constituency who is earning £3 10s. per week and who is compelled to pay 30/- per week arrears of income tax.  That is why the Minister says he is getting in the income tax.  He has made every employer in the country an income tax collector.  We were looking forward to getting something worth while this year&mdash;something which would enable people to live in the country.  We now get a reduction of a shilling in the £ in income tax, which will help a certain class and a certain class only.  We hear nothing about the 80,000 people with their families who are starving in the Saorstát.  There is no response to the appeals made by Deputies here on behalf of those people.  The Minister for Finance has reversed the role of Robin Hood and he is robbing the poor to give to the rich.  I hold that the Minister reduced the income tax for his own and his colleagues' personal gain.  Eighty-five pounds a year is no bad increase in salary.  I hope the people will realise this, and that they will accept this as an election stunt on behalf of the Government.  &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo; seems to be the policy of the Government as regards the majority of the people. This is merely a stunt on the eve of an election.  Who knows but in 1928-29 there may be an increase of 2/- in the £ in income tax?  We have no guarantee that there will not.  However, I am pleased that the Minister gave this reduction. It may mean that a few people who left this country will return. Even if it only gave a livelihood to a few domestic servants, it would be worth while.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose at this stage to deal with the Minister's speech.  I will confine myself to the resolution about income tax.  I am not in a position to say whether or not the country can afford the reduction. I cannot say at present whether, owing to the expenditure that the Minister has definitely committed the country to this year, he can afford to let <Col N="1385" /> revenue go under any head.  But I am not resisting the proposal to reduce income tax by a shilling.  A reduction in taxation, no matter in what direction, is very welcome.  I have not been able to analyse the effect of this reduction, with the smaller allowances here, as compared with the higher scale of tax in Great Britain and larger allowances. At a later stage I propose to deal with that.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that a reduction in income tax must affect us externally and internally in the political sense. Externally, I trust it will have some effect upon our relations with Northern Ireland, and that the hard-headed men in the North will come to understand that it is in their interests to join in with us here.  If this reduction is to be taken as a gesture, then it is a very welcome gesture.  There is the further point that the reduction will tend to increase the rate at which capital will be invested here.  Needless to say, that will not take place this year.  The increase of investment will be a very slow process.  Industry requires something more than a low income tax to be solidly established.  It must have plenty of raw material, cheap labour&mdash; I speak in a comparative sense&mdash;and cheap power.  These are the essentials of increased production.  But we cannot expect very great results this year or even in this generation.  However, it is a step in the right direction to make a reduction.  People with fixed incomes who have withdrawn from this country may be induced to return, and under that head we can look for substantial and material benefits.  Furthermore, people heretofore domiciled abroad may take up residence here and, of course, their expenditure here will increase the purchasing power of the community.  That will help to counterbalance the loss of revenue involved by this reduction.  You will have more wealthy people in the country, and that will mean that you will get greater results from a smaller tax, with a smaller cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think no man can say that this is a popular Budget.  It does not give relief to the majority of the people. This reduction will affect but a limited few.  I think the Minister should <Col N="1386" /> have given relief in other directions. Why not reduce the tax on boots? That would give immediate relief to a very large section, particularly the agricultural section.  I think that position should have been faced.  While a 3/- income tax may be very useful, I would not hesitate to make it 3/6, but not higher, in order to give benefits to a wider circle of the people.  In confining benefits merely to a few, the Minister has not done what is best; after all, the many have to be taken into consideration.  I have not been able to analyse what extent of relief the Minister's one shilling reduction in income tax will give to a man with an average family and possessing a salary of £250 or £300 a year.</P>

      <P>I should say the Minister's family&mdash;three or so&mdash; would be average.  I have not been able to analyse the position whether the Britisher with an allowance of one-sixth as compared with an allowance of one-tenth here is in a better position. The people who should first get the benefit of reduced income tax are those with small, fixed salaries.  The majority of people here are in that category. In England there is a different system. Incomes of £2,000 are there as plentiful as incomes of £200 or £250 a year here. It is for the man with a very small salary that we must cater.  The country business man, the clerk, and the wage-earning class of better standing&mdash;these are the people who need benefits such as reduced income tax.  The Minister has not made the case whether he is giving those people the benefits they are primarily entitled to.</P>

There is one thing we want more than another here, and that is to encourage wealthy people to live in the country.  If we have wealthy people coming to live here from other countries, that will help to create industries here.  I have no doubt about it that just at the time when the Shannon scheme will be <Col N="1387" /> capable of providing electrical power for industries you will have large numbers of wealthy persons coming to live here, and this reduction in income tax will, in my opinion, prove a big attraction. It is a rather large reduction in income tax, and I have no doubt that it will be an eye-opener for the people in Northern Ireland.  As regards the present hostility and opposition on their part to coming in where they ought to be, I believe this reduction in income tax will have far more effect than all the political intrigues or arguments that could be brought forward by any party in the State.  I am very confident about that.</P>
      <P>I believe the persons who are going to gain most by the reduction in income tax are those connected with labour organisations.  The most important matter in Ireland at the present time is, to my mind, the provision of employment. I do not think conditions were worse for a long period than they are at the present time.  Many persons who might have been anxious to start industries and so give employment were possibly handicapped heretofore by the high rate of income tax, but now that difficulty is removed.  I am surprised that there should be any opposition from the Labour Benches, because workers generally will be the persons who will benefit.  I am very pleased and delighted with the Minister's announcement of the shilling reduction.</P>

      <P>Whilst with other Deputies I am very pleased about this income tax reduction&mdash;and I hope it will confer all the benefits on the country that the Minister indicated in his speech&mdash;still I think the Budget, to some extent, is a very sectional one. From time to time in the House we have been told that sectional ideas are not the thing.  To my mind the Budget confers benefit only on one section, and that section comprises the well-to-do people in the country.  It confers an enormous benefit on them, and the majority of the people are left completely without any benefit.  The favoured few, so to say, are reaping an extraordinary benefit.  I hope this benefit will react in every way the <Col N="1388" /> Minister has described.  For my part, when there was last a reduction in income tax, I never could see that increased benefit to the country at large that we were told of.  Let us hope that this extraordinary relief to income tax payers that the Minister has spoken of will be made apparent in some fashion.</P>
      <P>I have not so much sympathy with the income tax payer at all.  After all, where are we to look for taxes to keep up the State if not from the people who have incomes?  Is it to the few half-starved people throughout the country we are to look for revenue? Unless a man reaches a certain standard and has a certain salary, he is not compelled to pay income tax.  Some people may say that this Budget is not sectional, but I hold it is entirely sectional.  Take the farmers, for example. I do not think there is a farmer in the country who, if he kept correct accounts, is entitled to pay one shilling income tax at the moment. We know what the farmers have gone through.  This, perhaps, may be a little outside the mark, but we know what the farmers during the last two or three years have suffered through depression in their industry.  The farmer who has kept accounts for the last three or four years could not be compelled to pay income tax.  The whole Budget is completely sectional. I would be more pleased if the Minister had made a division of benefits amongst the community at large, and had not taken into consideration only one section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to occupy too much time, at this stage at any rate, in speaking about the question of old age pensions; but, as it has been mentioned, perhaps I will be permitted to read to the House exactly what I said two years ago:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not proposed to apply any part of the gross surplus towards supplementing the Old Age Pension Vote, because we feel that the situation does not permit of any increase in recurrent expenditure; that, in fact, existing expenditure can continue to be borne only if conditions improve.  Substantial reduction in taxation is, consequently, necessary above all else, but if the situation <Col N="1389" /> is found to have improved at the end of the year, we believe some revision of the Old Age Pension Act, 1924, will have to be given precedence of any further reduction of taxation, however much required. Meantime, the tea and sugar reductions will be of some benefit to old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>At the end of the year what exactly happened was that we imposed two new taxes, the additional duty on wine, which is estimated to bring in £100,000 this year, and the betting duty, which is estimated to bring in £250,000 this year.  Really, at the end of the year the position had not improved, and so far as we are able, even with the help of these two new taxes, to propose the reduction which is now proposed, we do it because we are making new arrangements about the Army, and are reducing expenditure on the Army.  The conditions that were suggested in the statement with reference to the old age pensions have not come about.  Undoubtedly, there has been an improvement in this sense, that taxes, the yield of which was falling very rapidly, have begun to steady and perhaps have stabilised.  Various sorts of improvements have taken place, but not the sort of improvement that was suggested in that particular paragraph. I hope that will come, and undoubtedly there are signs that the general economic depression which has been over the country is passing off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give us some evidence of those signs? It would be very valuable if we could have some evidence in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular revenue figures I gave are a certain indication of it.  Deputy Johnson asked me how many income tax payers there were.  I cannot give him the exact figure, but I should say there are between 60,000 and 70,000.  If we were only to give a benefit to 60,000 or 70,000 we would not be justified in applying as much money as we propose for that purpose; it is because we believe that though the direct benefit goes to a comparatively small number the ultimate benefit will go more widely over the people of the State. You are not going to improve the <Col N="1390" /> economic condition of the country very much by a reduction of, say, a penny an ounce in tobacco or by a reduction in regard to drink.  If there is any validity at all in the argument that heavy taxation handicaps production and militates against economic progress, it is certainly a heavy income tax does it.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the people who say that the whole or a greater part of the income tax is passed on.  I think income tax is one of the taxes which are difficult to pass on, and it is quite different from customs or excise duties. On the other hand, industry is really built up and extended by the profits made in industry.  I admit that the fruit of any reduction in income tax will only be applied in part to the extension of industry.  There are people who, as Deputy Johnson said, when they get more money because the income tax is reduced will spend it on some luxury with no great effect; but there are many others who will do the opposite, and there are many who will be encouraged to do the opposite.</P>
      <P>There must be, if it can be got at all, an encouragement in enterprise.  There must be some improvement in production. The best that we can do when we find any sum to our hand for the reduction of taxation is to apply it in such a way as we think will give us these economic results.  I think it is very desirable, if you can do it, to let the man who uses tobacco have it at a penny an ounce cheaper, but in our particular condition it is more important to aim at stimulating industry, making the wheels go faster.  We cannot do it by direct means; at least, we can do no more by direct means than we have been doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is in any way unsound to regard this extra half million on Army expenditure as abnormal. Undoubtedly in 1923 when I spoke, and nobody would have challenged it, the position was abnormal and the money we were spending on the Army at that time&mdash;£10,700,000&mdash;was abnormal.  The difference is not so great now, but what we are spending is abnormal.  We have already paid out of revenue great sums in respect of abnormal expenditure on the Army.  As I pointed out in my statement, our net national debt is only <Col N="1391" /> something over £12,000,000, when we allow against the gross sum the amounts that have been advanced to the Shannon scheme, for local loans and other things of that sort.  So that it is quite clear that we have already paid out of taxation great amounts of abnormal expenditure, and we are now justified in borrowing for abnormal expenditure for which perhaps we might not be justified in borrowing at all if in the beginning we pursued a different line and if every penny that we could put to borrowing during the abnormal years had been so put.</P>
    <P>We have done a great deal in the matter of procuring economies in public administration, and if I were to take up the time and it were in order, I could quote a great many instances.  But what I said in the Budget speech is exactly correct.  We have not gone over everything. We have not taken the Estimates and gone through them sub-head by sub-head, and even divided the activities for which each sub-head provides and asked for each of them to be justified.  We have heretofore rather gone where we could see on the surface that economies were to be got.  We have not carried out the kind of microscopic scrutiny that I think we must now carry out, because unless we can succeed within the next two years in bringing about some appreciable reduction in expenditure, unless economic conditions improve more rapidly and more generally than I can see justification for believing that they will improve, not only will we not be able to give any other reductions in taxation but we will have to look for revenue to meet the expenditure and to fill the gap that will be left by the disappearance of certain revenue that we have, revenue that has been coming in in respect of arrears of income tax.</P>
    <P>It is quite impossible to do the variety of things that Deputies suggest we could do.  It is, perhaps, not worth, while to deal at great length with the suggestion made by Deputy Redmond, that we could do something for the drink traffic and increase old age pensions as well as reduce the income tax. I do not think that that suggestion was made after any great study or with <Col N="1392" /> any great seriousness.  Deputy Heffernan referred to my statements last year about the reciprocal arrangements that had been made and my statement that the existence of these arrangements made it impossible to have any very wide difference in the rate of taxation here and in Great Britain.  I feel that if there was a greater difference than one shilling, it might lead to the arrangements being reconsidered, but I believe that that would really depend on the effect of the difference and whether or not it led to large numbers of people coming here to have the benefit of the lower rate. Deputy Connor Hogan said that there were other taxes we might have reduced, and referred to the tax on boots.  This is an Income Tax Resolution, but I will answer that point. The tax on boots is one of the protective tariffs, and I certainly am quite clear that none of these could or should be reduced for a reasonable period.  I have always set that period at seven or more years.</P>
    <P>When people have been induced to invest capital and instal plant, and when they have faced the difficulties of training operatives and getting industries going, it would certainly be most unfair and would damage any prospects of future industrial development if one of these protective taxes were changed before it had got a fair chance.  I have already answered the point that Deputy Doyle made about a sectional Budget. The Budget is the best plan that we can devise, not merely for relieving the taxpayer, but for so relieving the taxpayer that industry will be fostered and employment will be given, that there will be something more than merely making a particular luxury cheaper, although that is very desirable and is quite a proper thing to do. But we did not feel that the making of one of the common taxed luxuries a little cheaper would meet the bill in the present situation.</P>

I do not see, unless great economics can be effected, or until there is an improvement in conditions, prospects of further reductions following. The Deputy is right there.</P>

      <P>(1)  That notwithstanding anything in Section 5 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, the total income from all sources of any individual who, if legislation is not passed to the same effect as this resolution, would have been entitled for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1926, to relief from double taxation in respect of income tax including super-tax exceeding in amount one-half of the total amount of income tax [before deduction of any relief in respect of life assurance premiums or any relief from double taxation in respect of income tax including super-tax granted under the Finance Act, 1926 (No. 35 of 1926)] and super-tax payable by him for that year shall for the purpose of super-tax for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1926, be estimated as if the modifications of the Income Tax Acts contained in paragraph 1 of Part II. of the First Schedule to the Finance Act, 1926, had had effect for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  That if an individual has been assessed to super-tax for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1926, for an amount less than that which he would have been liable to pay if legislation had been in force to the same effect as this resolution, the Special Commissioners shall have power to make an additional assessment for the purpose of adjusting <Col N="1394" /> his liability in accordance with the provisions of this resolution.</P>
    <P>This motion, as I have already indicated, is to remedy a defect which crept into the legislation of last year.  In consequence of the provisions that were passed last year a super-tax payer who was resident both in this country and in Great Britain would be liable to receive a relief that would leave him substantially better off than if, instead of being doubly resident, he lived either in England or in this country. The matter arises in this way, that to give effect in the provisions that were passed last year to the new relief arrangements it was provided that relief from double tax should be given by the two countries at half the combined income tax or super-tax rate, whichever was the lower of the two. This difficulty that has arisen relates only to the transition year.  In this I am speaking always of people who are doubly resident.  We charge all the incomes of persons who were resident here to income tax and to super-tax. Before the new arrangement they were charged, if they were not domiciled here, only on what was remitted.  So that before last year those people who were resident in England and who also had residences here paid income tax and super-tax only on what was remitted to this country.  This year they will pay income tax on the whole of their income, but they will, of course, get the relief.  The super-tax is charged on the basis of the preceding year, and of course the preceding year to the year 1926-7 was a year in which we got very little.  But as the arrangements are drawn, we must give the relief on the basis of the rates of this year.  The result of that would be that in several cases we would have to give people more relief in respect of super-tax than we actually got in super-tax from them.</P>
    <P>At first we thought of introducing a provision that would leave the Revenue Commissioners free not to make a super-tax assessment if they thought that the revenue would lose by it, but finally it was decided to make this arrangement, which enables them to deal with super-tax as if the arrangement which came into effect last year had come into effect the previous year. <Col N="1395" /> I will mention a hypothetical case to show how the present arrangement would work out if this defect were not remedied.  If there was a taxpayer whose income was £250,000 and who previously had only £50,000 of it remitted here the position under the law as it stands would be that he would pay British income tax and super-tax on this £250,000 at a combined rate of 9/9, and the amount he would pay would be £122,500.  He would pay Saorstát income tax on the £250,000, which would be £50,000, but because only £50,000 was remitted last year he would not pay super-tax on the whole of the £250,000, but only on the £50,000 which was remitted last year, because the basis of super-tax is the year before. So that we would only get from him £10,000 in super-tax, and consequently the total amount of tax that he would pay would be £182,000 odd.  He would get relief from the British, who would allow him double taxation relief on the whole of the £250,000 at 4/-.  Our combined rate of super-tax and income tax would be 8/-, and relief would be allowed at half the rate, because under the arrangement that was entered into the super-tax rate and the income tax rate are determined separately and then they are added together to get the combined rates.  The man would get British relief at the rate of 4/-, that is, £50,000.  He would get the same relief from us, a total of £100,000 relief, leaving him to pay only £82,000 odd, whereas, but for this flaw, he would eventually have had to pay £122,000 odd.  We are proposing to remedy that to give him income tax relief, so that each country will pay him £52,000 odd and he will pay exactly the net amount of tax that he would pay if he had been resident in only one of the two countries.</P>
    <P>The arrangement entered into last year was very complicated.  Some of the details were worked out hurriedly at the end, and this is a flaw which crept in.  In a sense it is retrospective legislation&mdash;we are legislating for the year that is past, but we are legislating in order that the man who happens to be doubly resident does not pay less tax than the man who is singly resident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to keep in line with previous statements which I made with regard to the import duty on motor vehicles, and to put in what is practically a form of protest against its reimposition.  I take the point of view that this is really not a luxury tax at all, but a tax on articles of necessity. In view of certain developments in this country, and particularly in view of tourist development, it is a pity that the Minister has seen fit to continue the imposition of this duty.  With the exception of Ford cars, all the motors used in this country are imported, and they cost a very much larger sum than similar cars in England and a still greater sum than in the United States.  Cars which cost close on £200 here are advertised in America at slightly over £100.  The Chevrolet car is advertised in the American papers at something over £100.  Citizens of the United States, which is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and where motors are so commonly used, can get a car for nearly half the price at which it is sold here.  The tax might be justified if it could be regarded as a luxury one, but I do not so regard it.  I regard the bulk of motor cars used here as being almost absolutely necessary in connection with business development. The number of cars used for pleasure must be very small.  Motor cars enter into tourist development to a great extent.  For transit purposes they are being used to a very considerable extent, and with the improvement of the roads their use will be considerably increased.  I can quite understand that it is quite out of the question for the Minister, in view of the way in which he proposes to use his surplus, to take off this tax at present, but he appears to regard it practically as a permanent imposition which he can always rely upon.  That is a wrong outlook, and I think he ought to change his outlook in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the difficulty <Col N="1398" /> experienced in importing small parts of motor cars and bicycles through the customs, owing to the 2/6 minimum tax.  On small parts which may be only value for 6d. this minimum tax of 2/6 has to be paid.  Not only is the tax excessive, but it is the cause of great inconvenience and delay.  I cannot say if the delay is anything like what it used to be, as things may have improved, but there were grave complaints in the past.  I have heard of cases where men had to wait for three weeks or a month for small repair parts.  I suggest to the Minister that there ought to be some means found by which small parts for repair purposes would be allowed in without tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister differentiated between the amount derived from the tax on motor cars as a whole and that on parts.  If he did not, I would ask him to let us have the amount which is derived from cars as a whole and from such parts as were referred to by Deputy Heffernan.  I presume that the revenue derived from the latter must be very much smaller than from that on cars.  I should like to know if it would be possible to give relief in this respect, because what Deputy Heffernan has said everyone knows to be the case&mdash;that not only is there considerable delay but it is a most irksome though small tax.  It is extremely annoying when parts have to be imported that this tax has to be paid, with the result that sometimes weeks are spent for one reason or another in getting those small parts through the customs.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister last year if he could give separate figures for cars and parts, so that we could make a comparison.  One of the reasons put forward for retaining this tax on parts is that if it were removed a whole car could be imported in sections and reassembled here.  I think that is too far-fetched and that it would be almost impossible.  I cannot emphasise too strongly the case that has been put up as to the vexatiousness of this tax, what trouble it gives to people in the trade and what staffs they have to employ running from the <Col N="1399" /> garages to the ports in order to get these parts out of the clearing-house. It causes endless trouble, and the amount of money derived is so small that the Minister would be well advised to do away with it.

I think the relations between this customs duty upon imported cars and the excise duty is one that has to be taken into account.  I am just calling attention to the necessity for considering the effect of last year's duties upon the owners and drivers of old Ford cars.  I take it there will not be any resolution this year with regard to excise duty, and, consequently, we shall have to find an opportunity of discussing the question before the matter gets very much further. I am merely giving notice that that will be done, if we can find a way of doing it.</P>

      <P>There are no delays on the part of the Customs.  Wherever there are delays now, and, in fact, almost since the beginning, they are due to mistakes and refusals to comply with the regulations of the importers or the clearing agents.  This matter was investigated by a Committee on which there were two representatives of the motor agents, and they were satisfied that there were not any delays on the part of the Customs, and there are not any delays.  Any trouble that arises could be obviated if people would simply exercise their intelligence when importing parts.</P>

      <P>On previous occasions the plea was made that the Minister should consider the abolition of the duty on musical instruments, and in view of the small amount involved I think there is a ease for that abolition. I think it would be well worth while for the State to sacrifice £20,000 in the cultivation and the spread of music.  It would make life brighter for the people and from the cultural aspect I think it is the duty of the State to endeavour to foster a taste for music and the ability to use musical instruments.  I think this duty limits to some extent the number of people who purchase and make use of such instruments, and in view of the small amount involved the Minister should consider its abolition.</P>

The position, as Deputy Baxter himself saw, is that with the income-tax relief which is proposed this year, it is not really possible to give any other relief.

At the time this boot tax was imposed there was no demand at all for such exemption, and no exemption was inserted in the Bill.

      <P>I think this opportunity might be taken by the Minister to give us some information upon the <Col N="1403" /> effect of the boot tax generally.  I dare say this proposition is quite reasonable and that boots may be brought into the country so as to be finished, by the addition of a printed tag, &ldquo;Made in Ireland,&rdquo; attached to them.  This further manufacture would then enable them to be exported with a false trademark and a false statement.  However, apart from that, I think this opportunity should be taken by the Minister to tell us something about the boot duty, and what are the views of the Ministry as explaining the curious anomaly that while there has been very little of a decrease, if any, in the total number of boots and shoes imported, there has been quite clearly an increase in the number manufactured in the country. It may be said it is because of a wider prosperity that there has been a greater purchase of boots and shoes by people, but judging by the very considerable increase in the number of boys and girls in the cities having no boots at all&mdash;in their bare feet even during the winter&mdash;it is not quite clear to me how the curious anomaly of an increase in the imports or the maintenance of the imports and at the same time an increase in the production at home can be explained.  It has been suggested to me that the explanation lies in the fact that there is a much poorer quality of boots being imported. Some people even allege that a poorer quality is being made as a consequence of the tax.  I am very slow to believe that, but I would like to have, if possible, the views of the Minister's Department on this aspect of the boot tax.  When the Minister brings forward this resolution has he reason to believe that there is a considerable number of boots imported into the country, partly manufactured, then finished here and afterwards exported?</P>
      <P>Does that to any degree account for this increase or maintenance of the imports, notwithstanding the tax and notwithstanding an increase in the number of home-manufactured boots? I think if the Minister would give us some enlightenment on this it would help to clear away a few misconceptions and to understand the actual results of the tariff more clearly than we do at present.</P>

      <P>I desire to support what Deputy Johnson has said. This was the one duty that I felt a considerable objection to at the start.  I felt that it would certainly increase the price of boots.  I thought that would be a very objectionable thing as far as the poor people of the country are concerned, especially in the matter of providing boots for their children, who have to walk perhaps three or four miles to school in the winter time, and with perhaps a large family of six or seven children.  There was no doubt whatever but that the cost of boots would be increased.  Like Deputy Johnson, I have been struck by the fact that as far as the import of boots is concerned there seems to be no diminution. Like him, too, I have been told that there is a cheaper class of boot being made.  When I ask in any of the shops that I frequent what the Irish boot trade is doing they all shake their heads and say: &ldquo;It is doing nothing.&rdquo;  I suggest to them that possibly its boots are being exported.  I do not know whether there is any ground for the belief that there is any substantial export of boots from the country.  At all events, I would like to know what the reactions of this tax have been, whether the amount of the revenue has diminished as it would diminish if the class of boots that were imported were of an inferior character to what formerly came into the country.  I remember that on one occasion the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs made a statement here with regard to boots.  He said that there was no increase, as well as I remember, in the price of boots; that he had gone to the people who manufactured the boots.  He had not, however, gone to the people who purchased them to find out whether there was any actual increase in the cost.  If, as Deputy Johnson says, it is going to be an import of pieces or parts of boots, I think it is advisable that there should be some limit to the condition in which these parts would arrive in this country.  The Deputy, I think, was going a little too far when he suggested that they might only be brought in here and have a tag attached to them with the words &ldquo;Irish manufacture.&rdquo;  At all events, this is one of the taxes as to the implications <Col N="1405" /> of which I would like to have some information.  I would like to know how it stands at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be admitted that the tax on boots has not been a success.  When it was proposed Deputy Good said that instead of being a tariff of fifteen per cent. it should be a tariff of thirty or forty per cent.  It should be a tariff that would enable the Irish manufacturer to compete with the British, or any other foreign manufacturer and, if the charge could be made against the Irish manufacturer that he was lacking in enterprise or initiative, it would be open to the British manufacturer, or anyone else, to come in, like the manufacturer of cigarettes, sweets and other commodities, and make the industry a success. It is also questionable whether we should not have led off in this tariff by specialising in one line of boots.  I sympathise with Deputy Sir James Craig when he talks about the workingman having to pay increased prices for children's boots in these depressed times.  That is attacking the tariff in a very vulnerable point, but it is not a point against the whole policy of protection. There are as many boots and shoes, both for young and old people, bought in this country as were bought before the tariff was introduced.  Our case is that they could be made in this country, and there is no reason why they should not be made.  If everything that could be made In this country was made here, the workingman, about whom Deputy Sir James Craig talked, instead of having empty pockets, would have his children working in factories and would have money to buy boots for them.  The tariff of 15 per cent. on boots has not been a protective tariff, but has been a revenue tariff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at the speech of Deputy Sears.  He gives it as his opinion that the tariff in the case of boots has been a failure, and, in order to make that failure worse, he suggests an increase to the extent of double the amount of the present import duty.  Has the Deputy given any serious consideration to the reasons why the tariff has not been a success for the people engaged in that industry?  Does he realise that a large manufacturer, say, in Northampton, can send a traveller over her and say to a retailer, &ldquo;Here are 1,000 pairs of boots.  In twelve months' time I will expect a cheque&rdquo;?  Compare that position with that of a traveller, say, from a factory in Dundalk, where the tariff has proved a partial failure, who goes to the same retailer and says, &ldquo;Here are 1,000 pairs of boots.  I want a cheque on delivery.&rdquo;  In my opinion there is not sufficient working capital at the disposal of people who have got the protection of such a tariff in this country.  Before the Minister considers the question of any increase in import duty, either in the case of boots or anything else, he should take into consideration the amount of capital at the disposal of firms engaged in these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have supported, generally speaking, the policy of the Ministry in regard to tariffs, but I think we will have to be a little bit more careful in examining the real issues involved than Deputy Sears has been, judging by the speech he has just delivered.  To impose a 30 per cent. import duty, without having in this country people in sufficiently large numbers with the necessary capital, would, in my opinion, be a suicidal financial policy.  I hope that the <Col N="1407" /> Minister will not pay any serious attention to the suggestion of Deputy Sears. It has been circulated&mdash;it is one of those canards which are usually circulated previous to the introduction of a Budget&mdash;that the Minister proposed to increase the import duty on boots by 10 per cent.  I believe that there has been an increase in the import of boots as a result of that false rumour.  I would object to any increase in the import duty for the reasons I have given, and I hope that the Minister will not be rushed into ill-conceived schemes of that kind in regard to any article until he is satisfied that there are people with sufficient capital which will enable them to compete with those who send in boots from foreign countries.</P>

There has been a decrease of £77,784 in the value of boots imported last year, as compared with the year before.  There has been collected from the general public the enormous sum of £272,228 11s. 10d. for boots and shoes, and the Government tell the farmers: &ldquo;We give you that back, because we are doubling the agricultural grant.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, but it is time for you to consider the relief you give to poor people by way of the agricultural grant.  It is time for you to examine its effect.  Take the case of a man with a £10 valuation.  He gets 15/- as an agricultural grant and he may have ten children.  How far would 15/- go in paying for boots for ten children? On the other hand, a man with £100 valuation will get £15 by way of agricultural grant, and he may have no children.  I interviewed my constituents, particularly shopkeepers, in connection with this tax.  They are very anxious to do what they can for Irish industry. They try to push the sale of Irish-made boots, but they find that they cannot give the same value as they could in the case of imported boots.  They point out that children's boots ought to be free of duty.  The Minister would confer a great advantage on poor people if he did that.  These people cannot afford to buy children's boots at present.  The Minister will say that it is hard to differentiate between children's and adult's boots.  If it were possible to let in, free of duty, children's boots not manufactured in the Free State, there would be something in the argument as to the fostering of industry.  I am willing to admit that boots of a certain type made in this country are good value, but I cannot agree with the proposal to put a tariff on boots which are not, and cannot be, made here.</P>

      <P>Take the remission of the tea duty.  We acknowledge that it is because of the extra tax raised by the import duty on boots the Minister has been able to reduce the tax on sugar, but these taxes were imposed primarily as protective taxes.  The position is really, misleading, and farmers are told, not by the Minister but by members of his Government, that they are given the agricultural grant as a result of the extra tariff and that therefore protection is good.  That is not an honest argument, and I believe that the people who use it know that it is not honest.  If they do not know that, they are really not capable of arguing the question of protection at all.  There is one fact emerging very clearly in regard to this particular form of protection, and it is this, namely, that if the Government were justified, and I deny that they were, in establishing tariffs it is now clearly shown that there was not a proper examination made into this tariff on boots.  It is quite impossible, and will always be impossible, that a tariff of 15 per cent. will enable an Irish boot manufacturer to make even half the number of grades of boots used in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sears is right when he says, if you want to protect boots, you will have to put on a tariff of 50 per cent. I am not sure that that would not be justified in certain circumstances.  That may seem an extraordinary thing for me to say, but, if you want to protect an industry, you should protect it so as to give it a chance of getting control of the home market.  With a tariff of this kind now prevailing you will not protect the boot industry.  I do not say that I stand altogether against protective tariffs on principle, but if the Government embark on tariffs they should make them effective.  This tariff is quite ineffective.  In England you have factories, and even towns, specialising in the manufacture of a particular grade of boot or shoe.  At present it is quite impossible for us to specialise and to compete in the open market with British manufacturers.  We have had a clear indication of that in the case of Dundalk where they attempted to make a high grade boot but failed to do so.  The factories here were making a certain type of boot with <Col N="1410" /> which they could compete in the open market before any tariff was put on. They are, in fact, still competing, and this protective duty is of no advantage to them.  They could not, however, jump into the market and compete if they made various other kinds of boots. I am not supporting protection.  I agree with Deputy Sir James Craig that it is a desperate thing to make a man pay 3/- or 4/- per pair extra for boots for his children in the circumstances existing in the country.  If we are to have protection the least we might do is to inquire sufficiently so as to make it a protective and not a revenue duty, because this form of revenue is most expensive and troublesome to collect.</P>

      <P>I should like to find out from the Minister what is the value to the country and to the export trade of the parts imported here partially manufactured, and having sustained a further process of manufacture here, re-exported.  It seems to me, as far as I can judge, that the trade in that particular line is very small, and I am wondering whether it is worth while that these remissions should be given.  I am not against the theory of remission, but I do say if the value of the trade is very small you are going to impose a burden upon the taxpayer, and you are going to complicate the system of account keeping. For instance, you are going to put up the cost of collection of revenue under those heads, because I believe you will have to maintain a larger staff, not necessarily very large, but a larger staff to keep the increased accounts which your resolution must impose on you. You cannot give a rebate without keeping full particulars of the imported article.  You will have to verify that the article is re-exported and that nothing else is substituted for it.  That, I say, is going to put a very great amount of work upon the revenue collection department, and is it worth while to impose this extra cost upon the Saorstát for, perhaps, a few hundred pairs of boots partially manufactured and imported into this country and re-exported?  The Minister, of course, can give us some definite figures to show whether this remission <Col N="1411" /> ought to be granted and whether it is worth while.  I agree, I repeat, with the theory of it, because, after all, any boot industry in this country must build up an export trade if it is to succeed.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Sir James Craig in what he said in condemnation of the boot tax.  At the present time, in my opinion, it is about the cruellest tax you could inflict upon the community, and particularly upon a community depending upon agriculture, most of whom are small proprietors with large families.  I say that it is striking at the health and the vigour of the country to have this manifestly unjust tax upon boots imposed.  As a matter of fact, as a protection, as has been very well pointed out, it is not an effective tax.  The British boot manufacturers are able to cut in here, to jump over the barrier, without any difficulty whatever.  The reason is because they have a big export trade, and while your boot manufacturers have, perhaps, only two or three lines the manufacturers in Great Britain have, perhaps, two hundred lines of trade.  In the days before the duty was imposed our boot manufacturers only turned out, perhaps, one kind of boot&mdash;a farm boot.  They never went in for a high-class trade.  They had not the machinery nor the capital to turn out the other boots imported into the country.  Of course, on the face of it, it would be absurd and utterly wrong to impose a tariff upon the lines analogous to the boots manufactured here&mdash;that is to say, imported farm boots.  It seems to me to be absolutely absurd.  That £270,000, I say again, is levied off some of the poorest people in the country.  It is levied off your semi-starved peasants in the West of Ireland, off the people in Connemara, the people in Achill, the people in Donegal and parts of Glare, Cork and Kerry, where the families are very large and where they can receive no contingent benefit from the imposition of the tax.  I say this boot tax must be fought and must be repealed.  It is inimical to the health and the weal of the country.</P>

Deputy Wilson is, in my opinion, one of the most fair-minded members of his party, but he has no right to misrepresent, either consciously or unconsciously, any remarks made by me.  If he will read the official report of what I said, I think he will find nothing that will lead him to believe that I am withdrawing from the position I have already adopted on the general question of tariffs.  I was merely dealing with the question that was raised by Deputy Sears or the demand for the increase of the existing import duties on boots.  If Deputy Wilson has any doubt with regard to my attitude on that, and if his party has any further political life in this country, he can nominate one of his agents in Leix and Offaly, and I will join issue with him on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, Deputy Heffernan is for and against, which is the usual attitude he adopts.  Deputy Heffernan in one part of his speech says that they should protect the industry by a 50 per cent. tax, if necessary, in order to get control of the home industry.  Is there a sufficiency of factories in the country at the present time?  Is there a sufficient amount of working capital and the necessary number of men and women working in the boot industry to supply the needs of the population?  If not, what would be the use of putting a 50 per cent. import duty upon boots when we have to import about 75 per cent. of the boots that are required by the people?  If you have to import 75 per cent. of the boots that are needed for the people's requirements you are merely giving a lever to the people who must import the boots to pass on the amount of the tariff to the purchasers. I have always supported the tariff in the hope that in the near future there will be a sufficient number of people with capital to invest in the home industry, and that as a result of the <Col N="1413" /> encouragement given in the shape of tariffs the industry would be able to provide for the requirements of the population.  The imposition of a tariff, even on a low scale, is an encouragement by the Government of the day to people who have capital and who have a patriotic outlook to invest money in the home industry as against the foreign industry.  I hope the reduction of income tax by a shilling will induce Deputy Wilson and other members of his party to put their money in the boot industry and to provide the working capital that is necessary in order that the Irish industry will be able to compete with the people who have been importing boots into the country for generations past.  Deputy Heffernan is against having the duty merely a revenue-raising medium.  I do not see how he can have it both ways.  So far as I am concerned, the tariff should not be imposed merely for the purpose of raising revenue.  I do not know whether Deputy Heffernan made himself clear or not, but he seems to advocate, on the one hand, that there should be a prohibitive tariff of 50 per cent., and, on the other hand, that it should not be a revenue-raising medium.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how far I should discuss tariffs in general on this particular motion.  I do not think that I should try to defend the whole policy of tariffs, nor do I <Col N="1414" /> think that I should, perhaps, follow on the remarks that have been made.  I think Deputy Sears was premature in his conclusions about this particular tariff.  Deputy Johnson asked certain questions.  Frankly, I could not give him any certain answer in regard to them.  I think we had only statistics of our trade for a year before the boot tariff was put on.  We could not know, with any certainty, what was the normal import of boots before the tariff and, consequently, we have not the figures to show with any preciseness or certainty what change has come about. When it is said that the import of boots has been practically maintained we really do not know; to know that with certainty we should have the figures for a period of years, because the one year which we have may have been an abnormal year.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that there has been a great fall in the quality of boots imported. I know that there has been a fall in prices.  I know that from an examination of the prices quoted for Army boots, which are a standard quality.  The prices have come down substantially, both the prices of the British firms that were quoting and the prices of the Irish firms that were quoting.  It is possible that the substantial fall in prices that has taken place may have led to some further import than otherwise would have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the question of stocks. I think that the first impost causes a good deal of disturbance.  Sometimes there is an abnormal reduction of stock.  Traders have not only to pay for the price of the article but they have to pay for the duty.  They may find it impossible to get their stocks up in time.  I think we have not had these figures for a sufficient period to enable any certain conclusions to be come to, but it is true that employment has increased. The factories were small and there were few people in them, I think about 300 or so.  The number has gone up.  The number has gone up by what is equivalent to 720 people, or thereabouts, on full time.  I know that there are at present people here from the other side of the Channel.  I have quite lately met one British boot manufacturer who was over here considering <Col N="1415" /> the possibility of starting a factory.  I think anybody who says that this tariff has been a failure speaks prematurely. I do not think, even when we are looking to the starting of new factories, we ought to put the duty very high in order to get very speedy results.  I think it is better to keep the tariff low and let the factory be fairly efficiently run from the beginning.  One justification of the tariff is that the factories cannot be really efficiently run.  We should, at any rate, have the tariff low enough to ensure that they will be fairly efficiently run from the beginning.</P>
    <P>There is at present very little export of footwear which has come in in a partly-manufactured condition.  But there is some such export.  Because of that, we propose to give the people who are dealing in that line of business the same facilities that people in other lines have&mdash;manufacturers of confectionery and apparel, for instance.  Because this export is very small, it will require no increase of staff at the moment, and it will lead to no increase in cost.  If it became a big thing, it would, of course, lead to additional administrative work and consequent expense, but, then, it would be justified.  I think we must give to a manufacturer who can export a fair opportunity of exporting.  So far, I think there are only two firms concerned. One of them deals in boots. The other firm deals in clogs, which is included in the definition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any reason for thinking that any boot-manufacturing firm is going to specialise in a particular portion of manufacture?  Is it to meet that kind of specialisation that this resolution is proposed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that a manufacturer imports his heels made up. He will have to pay duty on the heels. If he exports the whole boot, getting a market for it outside the Saorstát, he ought to be repaid the duty he has paid on the heels coming in, just as a manufacturer of confectionery, when he exports the finished product, is repaid the duty which he paid on the sugar.</P>

I accept the Minister's statement that the resolution is not going to impose additional administrative expenses, and, therefore, I am not disposed to challenge a division.  But I think the principle ought to be laid down that we ought not to deal with exceptional cases of hardship.  It is a bad practice in legislation.

If we did not give them those facilities, it might not be long until we would not have any such exports.</P>

    <P>(3)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> I have referred to this motion in the Budget statement.  It effects no change in the revenue or in the actual weight of the duty.  It is simply a readjustment of the basis on which the duty is assessed, and it is necessitated by the changes that have taken place in Great Britain.  Heretofore, no matter what size of box they were packed in, matches paid duty at the same rate.  The duty was leviable on the 10,000 matches.  It did not matter whether they were packed in boxes of 10, 20 or 50, they paid duty at the same rate.  There was a special provision for large boxes over 80, and we are continuing that&mdash;that is, in regard to the household match.  Now, the great majority of matches will be paid for at so much per gross of boxes. That means that the box which contains, say, 35 matches, instead of paying a proportionate rate of duty, as it did in the past, will pay the same rate of duty as the box containing 50 matches.  A great many of the Continental brands of matches were packed in boxes of 35 and 40.  The rate of duty they will have to pay in Great Britain will be substantially raised. In some cases, allowing for the increase of 20 per cent., the amount would be 2/- or 2/1 per gross.  That makes the British market very unfavourable to them.  The names and inscriptions on these boxes are printed in English.  They can ordinarily be sold only in countries where English is spoken.  What would happen if we did not make the change would be that all these boxes would be sent over here.  Traders might get some benefit. These matches would be sold at a somewhat smaller price.  About one-third of our match consumption is imported. As a result of the dumping that would take place, there would be some slight lowering of prices, which would not reach the public.  These matches would be practically all unloaded here, in preference to taking them back to the country from which they came, or selling them at a still greater sacrifice in England.  The factory which makes matches here would thus be put out of action.</P>
    <P>This is no protective duty.  The excise duty is the same as the customs <Col N="1420" /> duty, making the usual allowance for excise supervision&mdash;the expenses incurred by the firm in complying with excise regulations.  Continental match manufacturers will only have to adjust their methods of packing, and the same competition to which the manufacturer here has been subject he will be subject to in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel myself in rather a difficult position.  I am aware of the difficulties in which the Minister for Finance finds himself in his endeavour to provide revenue for the various services of the State.  His position is more unenviable and unpopular than that of any member or Minister in the House. Mr. Winston Churchill described himself the other day as &ldquo;the public executioner.&rdquo; I suppose the Minister for Finance would put himself in the same category.  However, it is my duty, as representing a great industry, to bring the position of that industry under the notice of the Minister.  In doing so, I will endeavour to be as fair to the Minister as possible, knowing his difficulties. When the Budget was discussed here on the last occasion, I said, speaking of the betting tax:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It is the considered opinion of everyone who is conversant with the subject that, if this tax is imposed, racing will be so injured that it will not survive a period of nine months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position of racing to-day? Between the entertainment tax and the <Col N="1421" /> betting tax, the attendance at race meetings has been so depleted that more than one meeting has already been closed down.  I was at the Curragh to-day for a short time.  I went down in an empty train.  I arrived to see empty stands.  It was perfectly plain to everybody conversant with the subject that if something was not done, racing in the Free State would be killed inside the period I mentioned when I was speaking on the betting tax last May.  Mullingar meeting&mdash;one of the most up-to-date meetings in Ireland&mdash; after paying a large amount in entertainment tax, has suffered a loss of £280 on the year.  Their one meeting held this year was so badly attended that they are seriously contemplating closing down altogether.  Many other race companies are in a similar position. The Minister said last year:</P>
    <P>I am anxious, as I have said to the House, not to injure in any serious way the carrying on of racing in this country.</P>
    <P>I have not any doubt that the Minister was sincere in that statement.  Under the circumstances, I simply desire to present the present position to him in a fair-minded way.  I do not withdraw one word of what I said when this tax was imposed.  Quite the contrary.  I gave racing nine months to continue then.  That will bring it up to the end of July.  After six months, I make the statement with greater emphasis.  No business could stand a tax on turnover. It would be all right to tax a new hat when you got it, but if you were to be taxed every time you put it on it would be a different matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have indicated is what is happening in connection with the betting tax.  You have just had five days' racing in succession&mdash; Phoenix Park, Fairyhouse, and three days at the Curragh.  A man might go to Phoenix Park with £25.  He might come away from the Curragh with neither winnings nor losings, and the £25 would be gone in the tax he would have to pay.  There are six races on each day and he would have thirty investments, on each of which he would have to pay 2½ per cent. on the <Col N="1422" /> winnings, including the stake.  Either the betting tax or the entertainment tax must go if racing is to continue. In November the licensing and taxation of betting came into operation, so that we have now nearly six months' experience. When I made the statement I have quoted in the Dáil, I pointed out to the Minister that the effect of the tax would be to kill the breeding industry in Ireland, because of the onerous effect it would have on racing. The first notable effect of the tax is the closing down of Tipperary Race Meeting. An annual two-day meeting had been held without intermission in Tipperary for the last 50 years.  That is, I regret to say, only a preliminary to similar action which will be taken by various other racing bodies throughout the country.  On many of these courses a large amount of capital has been spent, and the closing down of the meetings will throw a great many people out of employment.  Those of us who have been attending race meetings lately have been amazed at the small number of the public in attendance.  I think members of the House have a very faint idea of the amount of irritation and resentment felt by those connected with breeding and racing on account of the position created by the betting tax.  The last year for which I could get statistics showed that the export of horses from Ireland accounted for £2,000,000.  Of that amount, I think £1,500,000 represents money paid for thoroughbred horses bred and reared in Ireland.  The breeding and rearing of these horses gives the most lucrative return which can be obtained in the agricultural industry.  These stud farms constitute the best home market for farmers for their straw, hay, oats and other agricultural products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to Ireland's status as a horse-breeding country and the great natural advantages it possesses, I need only mention that the British Empire, with the choice of every country and every climate, has its national stud in the County Kildare, and that the Aga Khan, the immensely rich Indian potentate, whose wealth and position gave him the opportunity of selecting a stud farm in any country, also selected Kildare as the home in which to breed the chargers which are to carry his <Col N="1423" /> colours in every country in which he races.  The Aga Khan runs horses in India, England and the United States of America, and I think he has paid Ireland a wonderful compliment in choosing it as the centre for his stud farm.  The greatest living authority on thoroughbred horses at the moment is probably the German, Frederick Becker.  He has compiled a monumental book giving details of thoroughbred horses in every country.  In reviewing, towards the end of his book, every country in which thoroughbred horses are bred, he gives it as his considered opinion that Ireland stands in the forefront as the most successful place in which thoroughbred horses can be produced.</P>
    <P>Now, is it the intention of the Minister for Finance and the Executive Council of this young Free State, for the sake of what is really an insignificant amount of revenue, to destroy this great national asset?  The people for whom I speak in this matter, the breeders, owners, shareholders of race companies, and the public who attend race meetings, are unanimous in their declaration that if the entertainment tax and the betting tax are kept on as they are at present, the whole of this great industry will disappear.</P>
    <P>I was asked by the owners, breeders, and persons who attend racecourses to approach the stewards of the Turf Club with reference to the present position of racing in Ireland, and to-day I was given the following statement from the stewards of the Turf Club:&mdash;&ldquo;With reference to the interview which Mr. Shaw had to-day with the stewards of the Turf Club, they consider, from personal knowledge of the facts, that it is essential to the interests of racing and breeding that the Government policy concerning betting and amusement taxes should be modified.&rdquo; Now, can the Minister ignore that statement?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to put any difficulties in the way of the Minister or the Government.  I am not going to propose any amendment.  I simply make a statement which is absolutely true and which can be borne out by any person who goes to race meetings.  I have no hesitation in saying that if <Col N="1424" /> something is not done, before twelve months' time racing will have ceased to exist in Ireland.  The entertainment tax and the betting tax together are an impossible burden and you will have one meeting after another closing down.  I have confidence enough in the Government to believe that they will not consider the statement made by me unfair.  I claim it is a fair statement and I have the evidence of the stewards of the Turf Club, the custodians of racing in Ireland, the owners and trainers, and every person interested in the industry, that if something is not done one of the biggest assets of the Free State is going to disappear. I do not intend to say anything more. I simply place the case before the Government, and particularly before the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. J. CONLAN Mr. J. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the very forcible plea which Deputy Shaw has made for the abolition of this betting tax.  I think he has shown very clearly it is going to have a disastrous effect upon racing.  I, as one of the representatives of the premier sporting county in Ireland&mdash;a short-grass man, born and reared within a stone's throw of the short grass&mdash;can give my testimony to the fact that these taxes are having a most injurious effect upon racing and this is bound to have a reaction upon the breeding industry. If we cannot have racing carried on, if we cannot test the speed and stamina of all horses, we will cease to have a market in England, and in foreign countries as well, for our thoroughbred stock.  Horse-breeding is a very important industry, not alone in Kildare but in very many other counties of the Saorstát.  Stud farms cost a very large sum of money to maintain. A great deal of employment is given; good wages are paid and, as Deputy Shaw has pointed out, farmers have a market for all their produce.  It would be most disastrous, in my opinion, if racing is killed; through the killing of racing the breeding of high-class thorough-bred animals will be seriously affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The imposition of the betting tax had one effect which its sponsors did not imagine would come to pass.  Since the imposition of this tax and the <Col N="1425" /> regulations making betting lawful, betting shops are being set up all over the Free State.  I am told of one individual who has no fewer than 26 betting shops in every town and village within a radius of 20 miles.  I think some of the people who supported the imposition of this tax did it with the idea that it would prevent betting, especially among the young people.  But it has had a contrary effect.  It has brought inducement for betting to their very doors.  I think the Minister and the Executive Council would be very well advised if they reconsider the imposition of this tax, taking into account the effect it is sure to have on racing and horse-breeding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support my colleague in the representation of Kildare in supporting Deputy, Shaw in what he said about the bad effect this tax is having on horse-breeding and racing throughout the Saorstát.  Nobody, I am sure, wants to reduce the employment that is being given by racing in the country.  There is no doubt that Kildare is suffering, and will suffer, frightfully if this tax is not modified.  Racing is the greatest industry in Kildare, and an enormous number of people are engaged in it. It gives a great deal of employment all round the Curragh district.  Anybody who attends race meetings throughout the country must be struck by the miserable attendance, except at such places as Fairyhouse or Punchestown.  Even at Fairyhouse, though the attendance was large, I have seen it very much larger in former times.  There is no doubt something must be done, and the matter certainly cannot be allowed to rest as it is now, because otherwise a great industry may be absolutely killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very little, if anything, coming into the State as a result of this tax.  Before the tax was put on there were only four corporations that paid any dividend at all in the Free State, Tramore, and three in Dublin.  I doubt very much if any of them are paying a dividend now.  I have not heard anything about the figures in connection with them.  I expect they are paying extremely little, if anything. <Col N="1426" /> I will instance Naas, which is very conveniently situated for racing, and is in the centre of a breeding district. It is just barely keeping going, whereas it ought to be doing well from its situation and all that.  It is not doing well.  If there is not something done to improve matters the whole industry will disappear.  As Deputy Shaw says, in a few months it will be no more, and so many more thousands will be added to the list of unemployed. I think the Minister has a very serious matter to consider in this respect, and I hope he will give it sympathetic consideration.  It will mean an awful addition to the list of unemployed if racing and horse-breeding come to an end.</P>

      <P>Before I switch on to the theme the other Deputies have been speaking about, I want to refer to some items which are included in the list of wearing apparel and which, I think, it was never the intention should have been included in that list.  Cricket is amongst the games played in Ireland, and I have had letters from places such as Tirconaill, and appeals from colleges asking me to question the right of the revenue authorities in taxing, say, cricket pads.  I do not know if the Minister knows what they are?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I need not tell you anything about them.  Batting pads and gloves were certainly never intended to be described as wearing apparel. They are all necessary to the playing of the game.  Did the Minister ever contemplate that cricket pads were intended to rank as wearing apparel?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say I had cricket pads in mind at the time.  I certainly did think that football jerseys and similar articles would be subject to a tax.  If you tax a football jersey, I do not see why you should not tax something else that is worn in connection with sport&mdash;football boots, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between football boots and jerseys, and what I am referring to.  They are worn generally in the country, but in connection with cricket the articles I am referring <Col N="1427" /> to are not worn except when the game is being played.  They are not worn otherwise in business, or in moving about the country.  I think it is ridiculous to describe these as wearing apparel.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  I am only concerned with pads at the moment. I hope the Minister will give instructions to the revenue authorities to see that the farce of regarding them as wearing apparel should not be carried any further.  With regard to the speech delivered by Deputy Shaw and other Deputies on the subject of racing, I have not as much knowledge in the matter as they have.  I have ceased to attend race meetings since I got a bit poor, but I attend coursing meetings. I bear testimony to the fact that the attendance at coursing meetings has been reduced by two-thirds.  I would be obliged if the Minister could give me the comparative figures of what has been collected with regard to betting tax at race meetings and coursing. With the exception of the month of October, the tax as regards coursing has been in operation all the season.  If the Minister is not in a position to give me the information I am asking for at the moment, I will not press him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not separate records.  It might be possible to get a good estimate, but the two and a half per cent. tax applies both to betting on race courses and to coursing meetings, and the amount collected has been about £9,800.  It is estimated that roughly only about £250 of that was got at coursing meetings.  If any further discussion were taking place about it, I would have available the best estimate that could be prepared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has convinced everybody of the absurdity of having a tax on coursing.  I have attended a considerable number <Col N="1428" /> of coursing meetings this year and the attendance at them has been reduced by two-thirds at least.  At Limerick this year at the Irish Cup very few people attended.  The same thing applies all round.  What I have heard from other people bears out what Deputy Shaw and other Deputies have said with regard to racing.  I am told the people are not attending, and that without admission fees the whole industry is going to crumble.  There are very few race meetings you could compare with Fairyhouse and Punchestown. The race meetings at these places are dress parades simply for the manequins of the different drapery establishments, who go not to see the racing but to display the style.  The cost of collection of the tax with regard to coursing must be &ldquo;some&rdquo; item, and the amount collected is very little.  In my opinion, in two years' time we will have no coursing in Ireland, having regard to the way things are going. This is the sport of the common people who cannot afford to spend very much money on it, and they have no other sport.  The cinemas, theatres and other amusements are available here in Dublin for the well-paid labourer who gets £4 or £5 a week, and pays income tax, but you have to consider the men in the country who are only paid 10/- or 15/- or so a week.  I appeal to the Minister to drop this tax on coursing, as the game is not worth the candle. What applies to coursing applies also to racing.  There is very little gate money.  Executives cannot exist, and in a short time I am afraid racing and coursing, the only sport of the rural inhabitants, will have ceased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. J. CONLAN Mr. J. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to a small matter which affects a good many people in the Saorstát, and that is the incidence of taxation on motor cars.  I am alluding to our old friend, the Ford.  I have had a communication from a man who in this matter is typical of many.  He has an old Ford, but owing to the tremendous tax on it he could not afford to pay it and he laid the car up.  He had a very good pony and trap.  The roads in Kildare are made specially for motors, and when he brought out his pony it fell and injured itself, so that unfortunate <Col N="1429" /> man is in a bad plight.  If something could be done to reduce the tax on that old type of motor vehicle it would be a great advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>As everybody knows, the tax on all cars is regulated by horse power, but this car is suffering more than any other in proportion. Compared with others, Ford cars are rated very highly, but they develop little more power than what they are rated for.  You will get many cars rated at 18 horse power that develop up to 60, but they have different types of engines.  I think that the Minister would only be doing an act of justice in treating this car on a different plane from the other cars.  Most of these cars get out of repair very quickly, and it is only with reasonable inducements that they will be used.  Otherwise they will become scrap.  They are of some use in the country, and their use would save a good deal of money going out of the country.  I think the Minister would be well advised, in the interests of the country, and in keeping money in the country, to give these cars the fair play that they are not getting, and I think everybody will admit that it is a great injustice to these old tin-lizzies, or whatever you like to call them, and to the people who use them, to have the tax so high.  The Minister would be well advised to see this in a different light from that in which he saw it last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask mercy, not alone for the old Fords, but for other cars that were of very expensive make and have a very high tax but that are now more or less out of date and could not be sold for an amount of money equal to the tax that is payable on them.  The British Government recognised that fact, and in 1919 there was a reduction in the case of cars of a certain age of about one-fourth. The Minister might consider whether a reduction of a fourth, or of a third, should not be given in the case of cars the engines of which are ten years old.  The tax at present is so high that no one will buy these cars, but if it were lowered they might be able to run for a great many years and bring in considerable revenue to the State. Instead of that, when the owners cease <Col N="1430" /> to use them, they will simply be burnt or given away.  I know a car that cost £700 early in 1913, the tax of which is £29.  It is a splendid car, but you would not get more than £25 for it now, whereas it could run for a long time yet.  It will never be sold with its present tax, but if the tax were reduced that type of car would bring in a good deal of revenue to the State for many years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The racing business is a complicated one, but I think the old cars question is simple.  I am unable to see anything in the argument in favour of a reduction for the old cars. If we had&mdash;what many people want&mdash;a petrol tax, we could not distinguish between the old car and the new car, and if we had it on a different basis I do not think that constitutes an argument for the old car.  The old car uses the road as much as the new car.  There is also this point: Certain people saw me with reference to a reduction in the case of all cars that were four years old and over.  The number of these cars is very considerable, and if that were agreed to there would be a substantial reduction in the road tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the increase in the duty was to increase the revenue of the Road Fund, so that a greater proportion of the cost of maintaining the roads might be borne by the Fund, that there might be some relief to the rates, and, particularly, that the revenue of the Road Fund might be so increased that it would be possible to mortgage part of the Fund to carry out capital improvements, and still leave a surplus for what would be required to meet repayments <Col N="1431" /> and the interest on what had been borrowed to do works of improvement on the roads year by year.  When we looked at the question of giving any concession in respect of four years old cars we at once saw that we would be eating into the revenue of the Road Fund to meet what I may call a sentimental claim.  I can see no claim in equity that the owner of the four or five years old car has, and, certainly, if we had any other system, if we had the weight system&mdash;which was one that was considered before the last Budget, and which exists in some countries&mdash;if we had the French, formula, which depends on the revolution speed, with other factors, such as cylinder capacity, we could distinguish between cars of different ages.  But I can see no basis on which we can do it.  The fact that a man can buy an old car cheaply is not an argument that he should get off the road tax.  I am, frankly, unable to see any argument in favour of reducing the tax on the old car, and it is a solid argument against it, that if we did so we would be eating into the revenue of the Road Fund, and we would be defeated in our purpose of gradually putting more of the costs of the roads on to the Road Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Racing is a difficult matter.  As I said last year, we do not want to do any serious injury to racing, but I am not at all sure that we have arrived at the point when we can form any judgment on the matter.  When you impose any tax, as I have already said in reference to something else, a disturbance is created by that tax; there is a sort of active and vocal opposition, and a sort of passive opposition to it.  I am not in a position to say to what extent the attendance on racecourses has been reduced by the tax, but I do not believe that this collection of £9,000 odd has had all the effects that people say, considering that this is only the smaller part of the whole cost of carrying on betting.  I will hazard the guess that the propaganda that has been carried on against the betting tax has had as much or more to do with the decrease of attendance than the tax itself has had.  Before I would do anything about it I would certainly like to give it a <Col N="1432" /> reasonable trial.  The statement that racing will close down completely in two or three months if the tax is not taken off is too strong for me to be able to accept.  I do not believe that.  I do not believe that this great industry is going to collapse because of these few thousands of pounds.  I have heard on fairly reliable authority that there are ways that have not yet been exhausted whereby the promoters of race meetings, in collaboration with the authorities of racing, might reduce their expenses.  I promised last year that when we were able to get the totalisator going, of the 5 per cent. that would be charged on bets made on the totalisator, apart from whatever was charged for expenses, one-half would be devoted to increasing stakes for the various races.  That holds.  I think I also indicated that of the amount that was actually collected in the ordinary way on the betting tax on races we would be prepared to devote a proportion to increasing stakes if it was shown to be necessary.  Of course very little has been collected yet, and when we were framing the Estimates we had not any information on which to go.</P>
    <P>I would be prepared, when the tax is a little longer in operation, when we see what we are getting, and when we have some idea of what the real effect is, to return a substantial proportion of the 2½ per cent. actually collected to the authorities of racing for the purpose of increasing stakes, in recognition of the fact that we realise the importance of racing to the horse-breeding industry. People have told me that the totalisator would actually increase the attendance and popularise race meetings in spite of the fact that we would be taking five per cent. of the stakes and an additional figure for the cost of working the totalisator.  As indicated in reply to Deputy Shaw, I have been conducting certain negotiations with reference to the appointment of some body which would be licensed to work it.  It would strike anybody at first sight that the Turf Club would be the best body but from certain quarters objections have been suggested to the Turf Club, and another type of body has been suggested&mdash;a specially created body.  I am not sure whether that specially <Col N="1433" /> created body would not itself have certain disadvantages, but that is a matter on which we are not yet in a position to give a definite decision.  If we can come in a short time to a decision I believe that steps can be taken to institute the totalisator in a number of places at an early date.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to Deputies that this is a thing that has not been tried out. I would suggest, too, that while it is possible that it will prove that the tax cannot be borne, they should not jump to that conclusion, and they should not allow themselves to be panicked into the belief that we are going to have a complete collapse of races in a month or two if it is not taken off.  Because of my position, I have had so many deputations from every sort of interest, stating that ruin was staring them in the face, if each particular type of taxation was not at once abolished, that I am somewhat case-hardened, and I do not take these alarmist statements exactly at their face value.</P>

      <P>The racing people are applying, as I gathered from Deputy Shaw, whom I did not see privately at all about this matter, for either the abolition of the betting tax or the entertainments duty.  In response to the case made by Deputy Gorey last year I introduced a section abolishing the entertainment tax at coursing meetings, so that they have got something. I understand, of course, that betting at coursing matches is in small sums.  The amount of the tax is 2½ per cent., so that the labourer who bets £1&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I, as a border Deputy, wish to bring a certain matter under the notice of the Minister. A considerable amount of irritation exists in County Donegal, particularly in my own area, owing to the manner in which officials on the Border act <Col N="1435" /> towards business people, traders and farmers going into and coming out of the city of Derry in the administration of the Border regulations.  The manner in which they treat people is in striking contrast to the civility, courtesy and consideration shown by the British officials in charge of the Northern Border posts.  Our officials do not seem to care what inconvenience they put people to and what obstruction and delay they cause to business through mere technicalities.  They want every &ldquo;i&rdquo; dotted and every &ldquo;t&rdquo; crossed on documents which mean nothing to the revenue, while at the same time wholesale smuggling of yeast and other taxable commodities is allowed to go on and no serious attempt is made to stop it.</P>

In connection with the new motor regulations and getting cards stamped going in and out of the Free State, there is an arrangement which causes the greatest possible trouble and inconvenience.  I do not see why a motor registered in the Free State, of which the owner is a citizen, should not go in and out of Derry merely on the production of the registration certificate and the licence. The Minister should understand that it is our people who are paying the taxes that are put to this inconvenience. These officials at the Border should be instructed that they are the people's officials and not their masters.  The Minister should issue instructions to these officials to discharge their duties towards the citizens of the Saorstát <Col N="1436" /> with more tact, more courtesy and more commonsense than is at present the case.  There should be the minimum of inconvenience to the people who of necessity have to use Derry city, because the Minister or the Executive Council cannot change the geographical position of certain parts of Donegal.</P>

I would facilitate him in every way by getting returns from the various racecourses, and if I cannot convince the Minister that the statements I made are true, I will not make any further objection to either the entertainment tax or the betting tax.  The Minister met us in connection with coursing when he took away the entertainment tax.  I would ask him to consider the advisability, after making due inquiries, of either taking off the entertainment tax or the betting tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the comparatively short time at my disposal to examine the Budget statement, I do not intend to make a very elaborate examination of it.  I think, however, that it is only right to take advantage of this opportunity to express the opinions I hold regarding the general economic and financial conditions of the country, in view of the relations between those and the finances of the State as expressed in the Budget.  In the early part of the Budget statement the point was made, and Deputy Johnson referred to it, that the high price of National Loan was an indication of the comparatively prosperous conditions existing in this country. While I am pleased to see that the credit of the State is good, and that National Loan is commanding a price that is almost on a level with the British War Loan, I think it is a wrong deduction to deduce that because National Loan is at present high, the economic and financial conditions are proportionately good.  Possibly it may <Col N="1437" /> be an indication to the contrary.  The very fact that there is a demand for fixed security of the National Loan type is very often an indication that people are withdrawing money from productive work and are going in for a safe security.  Because of the increased demand for fixed interest security that security increases in value.  It will be found even that a similar condition of affairs obtains in England, where, because of the low and uncertain returns from industrial securities money has a tendency to fly for safety into fixed securities.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be sounding an unnecessarily pessimistic note but, at the same time, I think it would be unreal to pretend that conditions are satisfactory in the country.  I am judging from my own observation and from information I got by coming into contact with people in the country.  Judging by the two classes of people that I come into close touch with&mdash;members of the farming community and people in the country towns&mdash;and hearing the tales they have to tell and the different indications we have as to their financial position, such as civil bill courts, I am of opinion that economic conditions are not at all good.  In the first place, the agricultural community have been feeling the pinch for several years.  We have been preaching since I came to this House in 1923 about the depressed condition of the agricultural industry.  The outlook is not now any brighter.  It is, in fact, less bright now than it was then.  At that time the depression had not found its way into the country towns.  Up to a certain point agriculturists could be milked perhaps even of capital in addition to earnings, but we have reached a stage now when they will not infringe any further on their capital and a definite halt has been caused to the purchaser of anything but absolute necessaries in the small towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shopkeepers are finding it increasingly difficult to collect debts.  I heard them saying that it is almost impossible to collect a large proportion of outstanding debts.  The only conclusion that can be come to is that economic conditions are not at all bright.  I make allowance for the fact that these economic conditions are, to a large extent, due to extraneous conditions.  I am not <Col N="1438" /> at all trying to say that the Government is responsible for the economic conditions. I think it would be dishonest to say that.  Still we must recognise the fact and see if there is anything we can do.  We must see if the Government have any responsibility for aggravating the unfortunate conditions that exist, and if there are any steps the Government should take to improve the situation. As Deputies are aware, the economic depression is due to a variety of causes, particularly, I suppose, because the purchasing power of the outside nation with whom we trade has been reduced, and because competition from outside agricultural countries is such that the price of our agricultural produce has fallen very low.  The incomings of the farming community and those dependent on them being smaller, we ought to try and reduce the outgoings. In that connection I have constantly emphasised the desirability of a reduction in taxation.  I am aware that even with a very considerable reduction in taxation we are not going to make the economic conditions right, but high taxation, certainly in my opinion, is one of the factors which is helping to cause increased depression. If we can, by some particular effort, reduce taxation, we will help, in part at least, to right economic conditions.  I know that taxation is only one factor, but when you combine that with local taxation, the two are certainly a most important factor in the high overhead charges which the producers in this country have to bear.</P>
    <P>We are shown by the Budget statement that the people of the State will be called upon to make a payment of something approximating to twenty millions in actual taxes in the coming financial year.  The total revenue is larger, of course, but the non-tax items come into it.  The total expenditure is, of course, very considerably larger, including, as it does, the items of a non-recurrent kind.  The fact is that in taxation the people will have to meet a payment of something over twenty millions, and in addition to that they will have to meet a demand of something like seven millions in local taxation. Local taxation is, to a large extent, at present governed by the legislative action of this House.  So <Col N="1439" /> that in all, the population of the country will have to meet something like twenty-seven millions in taxation. That amounts to nine pounds per head of the population.  Taking the average family at five, it amounts to about £45 per family in taxation to maintain national and local services.  The question we have to ask ourselves is: Is the taxable capacity of the people such that they can pay?  And secondly, are they getting value for the money expended? I can only come to general conclusions, as it is difficult to say what the taxable capacity of the people is&mdash; when it has reached a stage that taxation will produce no more and revenue begins to go down.  But I am definitely of the opinion that anything in the nature of £45 per family for the services which the community gets from the State is in excess of the advantages which they gain.  I am also of the opinion that they are practically unable to pay, and that if we continue the present high taxation we will reduce the producing powers of the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out the extreme difficulty of showing where reductions in taxation can be brought about.  In that connection I want to say that I am pleased that the Minister has at last acceded to the request I have been making and which has been made by other Deputies for a long time.  He is going to appoint a Geddes Committee of a kind.  I think I was the first Deputy that advocated that such a Committee should be appointed.  The original demand in that regard was not received in any favourable way. We had comments of a kind which showed that the Minister regarded our demand in that respect as insincere. Our sincerity has been proved by the fact that the Minister now says&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but I specifically stated that we still are of opinion that a Committee of the Geddes type would be of no use and that we would not appoint such a Committee.  This Committee is quite a different thing from that which the Deputy proposed, and certainly quite a different thing from a Geddes Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not go into a fine definition of exactly what type of Committee is proposed.  I made it quite clear that I did not model my idea of a Committee on the Geddes Committee.  I was prepared to consider any type of Committee.  If we were prepared to face up to the question of a Committee at all, the House, I am sure, would come to a decision as to what type of Committee would be best.</P>
      <P>I was not unaware of the type of Committee which was called the Geddes Committee. I was not unaware of the terms of reference, and I quoted them here in making the claim that such a committee should be appointed&mdash;a committee to deal with departmental administration and also with policy.  This committee will have nothing to do with policy. Whatever type of committee it will be, it is to examine into departmental expenditure, and I am pleased that that is being done.  I do not say I am satisfied with the type of committee&mdash;I have not thought about it sufficiently yet, but I am pleased it is being set up and I believe that something useful will accrue from the examination by that committee into the financial conditions.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to deal with the general financial statement put before us by the Minister in regard to the revenue of different kinds&mdash;recurrent and non-recurrent&mdash;and his justification for using this £550,000 to reduce income tax, by means of a reduction in the permanent cost of the maintenance of the Army.  His justification is, perhaps, doubtful.  In the circumstances, however, it might be tolerated, particularly in view of the fact that in the past Army expenditure, in my opinion, to an unreasonable extent was paid out of revenue.  There might be a very good case made, as far as I can see, on account of the fact that in the past the Government paid the expenditure of maintaining an army in abnormal times out of current revenue&mdash;one year to the extent of £15,000,000, I think.</P>

      <P>It may be the dead past, but it is important to try to revive it again for the sake of discussion. What was non-recurrent expenditure was paid out of current revenue in the past.  On that account it may be justifiable in the particular circumstances in which we are placed that even recurrent expenditure might be funded, as a substitute, as it were, for the non-recurrent expenditure which was not funded when it should have been.  I do not know whether that is sound finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is arguable. It is certainly worth considering in the present circumstances of the country. I would stand against the argument that in any other circumstances recurrent revenue might be funded.  There was one particular remark made by the Minister which I should like to refer to.  I think it is important, because it denotes the outlook of the Minister and of the Government.  He said:</P>
      <P>But we can no more afford the reckless scrapping of services than we can afford reckless expenditure on them.  We must seek for economy, but we must not forget that we have an undeveloped country and that our real hope is in development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to found our financial policy on the statement that the country is to a large extent undeveloped, well I think that is a fallacy.  An idea seems to be current that this is an undeveloped country, and some people compare it with countries like New Zealand and Australia, which have only been civilised within the past sixty or one hundred years. They seem to forget that this country has been going through a course of development for thousands of years.  It is really not an undeveloped country. There also seems to be an underlying idea that we have extraordinary natural resources here which can be developed. I submit that we have only one of any consequence and that is the agricultural industry.  If we are to rely in the future, in the matter of the tax-paying capacity of the people, on the development of the natural resources <Col N="1442" /> of the country, then in my opinion we are relying on something that is very dubious and uncertain.  I say that with every desire to see the country making progress materially. It would be foolish, I think, to entertain the notion that we can count on revenue from undeveloped natural resources. Any further development that takes place must be very slow, and will be dependent, in my opinion, almost altogether on our technical resources.</P>
    <P>With regard to the taxation that is levied on wireless apparatus imported into the country, this was a duty that Deputies on these Benches took exception to when it was first imposed, for the reason that it penalised the users of valve sets in the country.  We regarded it as advisable that the users of these valve sets in rural districts should be encouraged and stimulated, and we opposed the imposition of the duty.  In actual fact, we find that the importation of wireless apparatus is diminishing and shows signs of disappearing altogether.  Those in the trade say that is largely due to the duty of 33 ? per cent. imposed on imported wireless apparatus.  In my opinion if this duty were not imposed you would have an increase in the number of sets brought into use throughout the country, and consequently an increased revenue from the licence fees that would be paid by the users.  This, I think, would make up for any loss of revenue that might occur because of the remission of the duty.  That is a point, I submit, for the consideration of the Minister, and also the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Under the present system I hold that people down the country who buy wireless apparatus are obliged to pay an unfair proportion of the tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether any report or recommendations have been received from the Tariff Commission, in view of the hopes that he held out when appointing that Commission.  I have a recollection that at the time the Commission was being set up the Minister used words to this effect: That the Commmission would report on industries that might not be able <Col N="1443" /> to hold out after this Budget, and that he would take steps to render some assistance to them.  These were not the actual words used by the Minister at the time, but that, I think, was the impression which his statement created in the House.  Nothing, however, has been done to save many of our industries. I congratulate the Minister on the reduction in income tax.  With him I believe, and am hopeful, that it will lead to increased employment in the country.  I had hopes, however, that existing industries that are gradually being crushed out would have got some relief under this Budget. Our distilling industry, for instance, is getting no relief whatever.  Everyone who reads the papers is aware that at the moment this country is being flooded with imports in opposition to the products of our own distilleries. Even outside the distilling industry, the dumping that is going on in the matter of foreign-made goods is killing our industries, and something must be done to save them.</P>
      <P>We referred last year to the continuous loss of trade to our woollen mills, and we had hoped that something might be done for them.  Then, again, last year all parties joined in complaint about the wholesale importation into this country of foreign-built bodies and motor cars and buses coming in ready to put on the roads, without as much as a paint-brush being put to them or any upholstering done to them in this country.  From the returns published in the newspapers and the official returns from the Department of Industry and Commerce it can also be seen, that there is wholesale dumping of printed matter into this country.  Books, bound, come in from Germany and other parts of the Continent, having been made in places that can only be described, and were descrbed, as sweated works, where wages are practically on slave conditions.  These articles are brought in and set against the home-made articles produced on labour paid for at fair wages.  Take some of our religious books, whether they be bibles or prayer books of any church, and you will find that they have been printed and made in Belgium, while our own bookbinding industry is practically wiped out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> We had hoped that the Minister would do something for these industries since his last statement.  I am certainly hopeful that he may be encouraged now to impose further tariffs in the direction suggested.  If he has not got the power already, I hope he will not wait for another 12 months but will seek for that power in order to save our industries.  To any opponent who attempts to stand in his way he might point to our new tobacco factories and show how well they are doing and the employment they are giving.  He could also point to the fact that recently one of the best-known firms in the jam business in Scotland thought it worth their while to come to Dublin and start a factory.  Any movements that will create employment in this country will receive the wholehearted support of everybody.  We have in our midst thousands of unemployed from every industry.</P>
    <P>The iron and steel trades are also hard hit by the importation of foreign goods dumped into the country.  Girders of dressed steel are coming in ready to be used in the erection of buildings or to be brought into the workshops merely to be put together with bolts and nuts without giving hardly an hour's employment upon them.  Again, I notice that an industry that is giving a good deal of employment in Dublin, while to a very small extent protected, is not, I suggest to the Minister, anything like sufficiently protected&mdash;I refer to the match industry.  We see only a difference of a couple of pence in the thousand containers as compared with foreign matches dumped down here, and, I think, in view of the employment given in Dublin to match workers, that something further ought to be done in the interests of that trade.  The match factory in Dublin is capable of supplying the whole of the Free State with matches, and the Government could get a definite guarantee from those people that they would not in any way increase the cost to the users of matches if they got further consideration.</P>
    <P>Then we have our Irish paper mills still closed.  If anybody wants to order printed goods or to purchase paper he will find great difficulty in getting Irish manufactured paper for his requirements. <Col N="1445" /> I hope if there is any proposal to be brought forward calculated to help that industry that it will be brought forward quickly.  All the other items have been dealt with at length by many Deputies, and I will not delay further but will simply conclude by congratulating the Minister for what he has done, and expressing the hope that in the near future he will seek powers that will enable him to provide employment for the many thousands of idle men in this country.</P>
