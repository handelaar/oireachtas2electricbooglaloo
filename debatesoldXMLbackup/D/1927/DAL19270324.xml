      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has received a memorial from Bundoran Urban Council on the subject of the new motor car regulations; whether he is aware that the restrictions on hackney cars are causing serious injury to the tourist traffic as well as the fairs and markets of the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>A memorial from residents of Bundoran and a copy of a resolution adopted by the Urban District Council of Bundoran were received requesting a modification of the Motor Cars (Temporary Importation) Regulations, 1926, so as to enable hackney motor cars from Northern Ireland to enter Saorstát Eireann without payment of duty in the interests of tourist traffic affecting Bundoran.  The representations which have been made in this connection are still under consideration and I am not yet in a position to say whether any extension of the facilities provided by the regulations will be granted.  A decision will be given at an early date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the Commissioners of Public Works have <Col N="204" /> received an application for a grant from the Stoneyford Drainage Committee, County Meath, to enable it to improve the drainage in the Stoneyford drainage district, and, if so, whether he will state what steps are being taken to meet this application.</P>

      <P>No application has been received by the Commissioners of Public Works from the Stoneyford Drainage Committee for a grant to enable them to improve the drainage of the Stoneyford Drainage District.  In any case grants are not made to committees in charge of drainage districts for such purposes.  A petition under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, for a new scheme in respect of the Ballivor River, County Meath, has been received by the Commissioners of Public Works, and arrangements have been made to have an inspection carried out by an engineer at an early date.  Portion of this river is in the existing Stoneyford Drainage District, and maintainable by the Drainage Committee.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that Edmond O'Reilly, Goolds Cross, County Tipperary, was returned for trial in custody by the District Court on the 29th January, 1927, to the Central Criminal Court which opened on the 8th of February, 1927, in connection with the murder of Guard Hugh Ward, at Hollyford, on the 14th of November, 1926, and, if so, if he will state whether it is the intention to have the case tried at the present sitting of the Court, and, if not, if he will state when it is proposed to have the case dealt with.</P>

Does the Minister consider that an important charge such as this&mdash;a major charge&mdash; should be put back in order to make room, so to speak, for minor charges? Does he not consider that this is in a different category from cases that have been returned for trial on bail, and that are before the court at the moment? When will this case be tried?</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes)</NameTxt>
      <P>A military service pension has not been awarded to Mr. Isdale as he did not establish to the satisfaction of the Board of Assessors that he rendered the minimum amount of military service required by sub-section (4) of Section 2 of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg leave to introduce the Local Elections (Dissolved Authorities) Bill, 1927.  It is a</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Bill entitled an Act to extend the period fixed by Section 72 of the Local Government Act, 1925, for the holding of new elections of members of local authorities dissolved under Section 12 of the Local Government <Col N="212" /> (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, or Section 72 of the Local Government Act, 1925.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is merely a short Bill which I believe will not be contentious.  The object of it is to remove certain anomalies under Section 72 of the Local Government Act of 1925.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I think, is too optimistic when he says that this will be non-contentious. It is usual not to oppose the First Reading of a Bill.  The First Reading of a Bill should not be opposed except in extreme cases, but this is one of the cases in which one is justified in opposing the First Reading. It will be remembered that at first there was no limit fixed in the Local Government Act of 1925 for holding elections where the local authority was dissolved, and this section (72) was introduced before this Bill left the House.  The House thought differently from the Minister, and it insisted in putting in a limit of time within which an election for a dissolved authority should be held.  That was a limit of three years.  The term is now up.  This Bill is quite evidently an attempt to extend that period, and thus do what the Minister first intended to do before the House put in the limit.  I must, therefore, ask the House to oppose the introduction of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy considered the reasons for this?  If this Bill is not passed it means that an election will take place in Offaly this year, and another election will take place in twelve months.  The general consensus of opinion is against having two elections, one this year and another next year.  An alternative proposal the Minister could bring forward would be to have an election this year and to amend the law with respect to having another election next year in Offaly.  This is certainly the simpler method, because it gives a General Election all over the country for the same period for each local authority.  It just happens that one year has to run in this case, and if it were not for that this particular Bill <Col N="213" /> would not be introduced.  It saves the county expense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned we were discussing an amendment which provides for the reinstatement of genuine evicted tenants in their holdings.  I had gone into a case and explained the facts of it with a view to showing that the Land Commission are not sympathetic to the grievances of the evicted tenants, and are not making any real attempt to reinstate them, even where it is open to <Col N="216" /> them to do so.  I dealt with a particular case, the facts of which, I think, are known to the Minister, in order to try to emphasise the argument which Deputy Cosgrave and I are making. The holding in question is one of 80 statute acres in my constituency, outside one of the principal towns, and the original tenant was evicted during the Plan of Campaign.  His only representative is a brother, who lives in Dublin. That estate came into the hands of the Land Commission a short time ago for the purpose of division.  The representative of the evicted tenant made application, and his application was supported by some of the most prominent men in the town and the neighbourhood, but despite the fact that the Land Commission had all the particulars of the case, despite the fact that they must have been aware that this was the representative of a genuine evicted tenant, they have not done anything for him.</P>
      <P>As to the genuineness of the application, the facts are that at the time of the Plan of Campaign this man's brother, being a tenant on the Smith Barry Estate, was forced to withhold his rent, in conjunction with the other tenants.  As everybody knows, that estate was the centre of turmoil in the land fight, and it was practically imperative on every tenant to withhold his rent in accordance with the instructions of the leaders of the time.  This tenant was evicted for non-payment of a year's or one and a-half year's rent.  The lands have since been in the hands of a caretaker, or an emergency man, and now we have them divided.  This evicted tenant is undoubtedly genuine, if any evicted tenant can be regarded as genuine, but he has not been reinstated. To aggravate the case and to emphasise the point that the Land Commission have really no intention of dealing sympathetically with evicted tenants, the actual emergency man who went into that place at the time of the eviction got a grant of land on the estate.  That is a most extraordinary case, and it seems to me to clinch the argument that the Government and the Land Commission have no intention of reinstating evicted tenants, and have no sympathy with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not tried to make the point <Col N="217" /> that evicted tenants must be in open competition as regards ability, farming qualities and other matters with the other people who make applications for grants of land.  I do not maintain that this man is particularly suitable as a farmer, but I do maintain that he is the representative of the original evicted tenant, and that as a matter of justice, a matter of righting a grievous wrong, of keeping in line with the ideals of the old land agitation, and of showing our appreciation of the loyalty of these tenants to the State, that it is absolutely imperative that the Land Commission and the Government should insist that genuine evicted tenants of this kind should be reinstated.</P>
    <P>I have another case, one with which I am more or less personally conversant, in mind also, that of an emergency man who was driven out of his place four or five years ago during the troubled times.  This man is now willing to hand his place over to the Land Commission.  A representative of the evicted tenant is willing to take it over, but there is no indication that the Land Commission intend to take over the place and hand it to this woman.</P>
    <P>I think a very good case has been made, not to prove the justice of this amendment, but to prove that the Government are not seriously dealing with this question at all, and are not really taking advantage of the powers in the Land Act of 1923 for the reinstatement of evicted tenants.  I support the amendment largely as a protest against the Government's inaction. I do not say that the amendment in its present form is quite workable.  I think that the wording of the last line, which states that the tenant is to be reinstated in his original holding, would not be workable and practicable in a great many cases, although it would be in other cases.  If the Minister would accept the principle that every genuine evicted tenant must be reinstated in his original holding, where that is available, or, if that is not possible, that he should get an alternative holding, I am willing to withdraw my support of the amendment. But if the Minister does not give a clear indication that the point of view of the Land Commission in this regard is to be changed, and that we <Col N="218" /> are to have a different outlook, I have no option but to support the amendment, and to ask other Deputies to do so, as a protest against the present policy of the Land Commission.  I put it to them in this way, that any Deputy who does not vote for it may be regarded as not being in sympathy with those who took part in the fight which resulted in the tenants becoming the owners of their land, and which finally resulted in the establishment of our freedom, and in the fact that we are sitting here in a Parliament of our own.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment is that the Land Commission shall take every genuine evicted tenant and shall deal with him by reinstating him in the holding from which he was evicted.  As the law stands, the Land Commission may deal with an evicted tenant.  They are not under the necessity of reinstating him in the holding from which he was evicted.  Moreover, they can pick and choose between evicted tenants.  They can take the present circumstances of the applicant into account, and even though a man may have been a genuine evicted tenant, or the representative of one, nevertheless, they can exercise an option and refuse to give him a holding of land.  But if this amendment is passed it will mean that the Land Commission shall deal with every evicted tenant, no matter what his present circumstances may be; equally important, no matter what the circumstances of the other applicants for land on the estate may be.  They cannot take the equities of the case into account at all.  They must deal with the evicted tenant, and somebody else must be omitted from the scheme, and they must deal with him by giving him his original holding, no matter who occupies it now, no matter what the circumstances may be.  That last condition would be quite out of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody wants to start a series of evictions again.  Lands have changed hands, perhaps, three or four times since 1880.  Circumstances have changed, and evicted tenants have gone away into the cities and built up businesses, or have gone to America. <Col N="219" /> Their representatives may be fairly wealthy people, and the holding from which their grandfather or their father had been evicted twenty or thirty years ago may have changed hands three or four times, and it may have been bought quite recently, or within the last ten or fifteen years, for the full market value, and with the goodwill and consent of everybody, not with the specific consent, of course, of the evicted tenant, but they may have been bought by auction in the ordinary way, without any intimation from anybody that there was any objection to their being bought.  That is the strongest case of all from my point of view.  It would be out of the question to eject such a man.  Even if there was opposition twenty or thirty years ago to a man going into an evicted farm, we cannot re-open these matters now; if we attempted to do so, we would have to re-open a great many cases, and we would find ourselves under the necessity of putting through a series of evictions all over the country, and in a big percentage of cases, doing extreme hardship.  In that state of affairs it is out of the question to say that an evicted tenant must be reinstated on the holding from which he was evicted himself or from which his grandfather, father or predecessor in title was evicted.  That is the first point.</P>
    <P>The second point is that the Land Commission shall at least give him a holding.  Let us examine that for a moment.  You will find plenty of cases of genuine evicted tenants from any point of view, genuine in the sense that their predecessors in title were evicted in the ordinary way from the lands which they held, just as a number of other tenants were evicted during the years from 1870 to 1890, and from the point of view of the legal definition inserted in any Act of Parliament, perfectly genuine cases.  But even admitting that, there are still plenty of cases in which it is inadvisable to deal with genuine evicted tenants.  Circumstances have changed a lot in thirty, forty or fifty years and you cannot base legislation on a set of circumstances that existed on the equities of <Col N="220" /> the case as it stood, say, twenty years ago.  It cannot be done and if you attempt to do it the moment you are brought up against a specific case you realise you are wrong.  The best way to argue this whole question is to argue it around the exact case that Deputy Heffernan gave us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan mentioned a man named Cahill who is the genuine representative of an evicted tenant, evicted because he refused to pay his rent during the days of the Plan of Campaign. He was evicted by Lord Barrymore on the Smith-Barry estate.  From every point of view it was just an ordinary case of eviction.  There are no peculiar circumstances in it.  If there was ever a genuine case of an evicted tenant it was one.  He went away to the Argentine and died there a very wealthy man and his brother and sister remained at home.  The sister is a lady in very prosperous circumstances I am informed, living in the suburbs of Dublin, with a certain amount of means of her own.  She applied in 1905 or thereabouts.  She was offered a holding and refused it.  Then one of the brothers came home from the Argentine, not the original evicted tenant but another brother, and he applied specifically when this particular farm was going and he was refused.  He is a middle-aged man now I think, and is, as far as I know, unmarried.  He is a wealthy man and lives here in Dublin. The farm in question is about 130 acres of untenanted land.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission were in the position that they had an application from a man called Cahill, a genuine evicted tenant, a person probably who could buy this 130 acres three or four times over, a man who if he wanted to expend his money on a farm would buy a farm of 300 or 400 acres.  They had an application from him to be reinstated. He spent his life in the Argentine. He is a middle-aged man now and he has plenty of means.  His sister is also reasonably well-off.  On the other side you have five or six congests with holdings varying from £3 to £4 to £10 or £12 in valuation, living near. Perhaps the shortest way would be to read out the names and the circumstances <Col N="221" /> of the five or six people who got the land and let the Dáil put them on the one side and the case of the evicted tenant on the other.</P>

      <P>Might I point out that exception was taken on the last occasion to mentioning names.  I carefully avoided mentioning names.  I thought the Minister would follow my example and leave out the names.  I would suggest that the Minister should not go any further to deal with the class of tenant because that means dealing with a great many names and bringing in other names.  I do not want to be forced into the position of saying whether such and such a man is a good man for a holding.  There are some very good men who did get holdings, and there are certain objectionable individuals who got them.  I am not basing the case on the type of men who did get holdings, but I am basing it on the claim of the particular man who is a genuine representative of an evicted tenant.  I want to say that my information is that this man is not a very rich man.  I understand he is a man of moderate means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a well-known case, and he might as well have given the name.  Take the circumstances of that man&mdash;we have already mentioned his name, Mr. Cahill&mdash;and put them on one side, and put on the other side the circumstances of the people who got the land and take into account also that there was only about 130 or 140 acres to be divided.  The Land Commission was in a dilemma.  Here we have an application from an evicted tenant for a holding.  How much is he to get?  Is 25 acres any good to a man like that, a <Col N="222" /> man in his circumstances?  If he went in for farming himself he could afford to get a farm of 300 or 400 acres, and are we to give this man who is living in town here 25 acres, and if we are which of the others are we to leave out?</P>
      <P>I will now give the circumstances of the congests among whom the land was divided.  One man got 13 acres 3 rds. and 30 perches.  He was a workman living in a labourer's cottage, and he has consistently got a prize for the best labourer's cottage under the Scheme of the County Committee of Agriculture in the district.  He and another are the only landless men that got land. The herd got 15 acres: he obviously had to be dealt with.  Another man, who has a valuation of £2 16s., and who had 5 acres, got 14 acres in addition. Another man, whose valuation was £12 5s. and who was a most industrious man, got 12 acres in addition. The £12 5s. includes the valuation of his house and his holding, and it is barely economic.  Another man had a valuation of £10 10s., including house and land, and he got 11 acres.  A holding of £10 10s. valuation is not an economic holding, and the eleven would make it barely economic.  Another man, who had a valuation of £15, got 9 acres. Another who had a valuation of £2 10s. got 17 acres, and another man, a married man with 11 children, with a valuation of £2 15s., got 17 acres.  Finally, a married man, who had the grazing of about 10 head of stock there always, and who lived almost exclusively on that, got a holding of 21 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a specific case.  On the one side you have got a genuine evicted tenant who at the time of the eviction had all the equities of the case.  He went out.  He was incidentally a big farmer, well able to pay his rent.  He left his holding behind and from that day to this never got a penny out of it.  He happens to be a well-off man, at least for this country, and he lives here in Dublin; I do not think he has anyone depending on him.  His sister who was also an applicant is quite a well-off woman living here in Dublin, and it would be simply foolish to allot, say, twenty-five acres of land to this man.  Of course, what he would do, if <Col N="223" /> he had any sense, would be to sell it straight away to someone who was well able to buy it.  That twenty-five acres would mean that three, certainly two, of these congests would be left out.  I use that case as an illustration of the fact that you should not compel the Land Commission to deal with every case.  You must take into account not only the circumstances that existed at the time of the evictions, but the circumstances as they now are. That makes all the difference.  The policy of the Land Commission is to deal with every genuine case so far as they have the land to do it.  They have dealt with a couple of thousand cases since the Land Act of 1903, and with 53 since the Act of 1923.  Every application of an evicted tenant gets the fullest consideration.  All the circumstances are taken into account. You cannot give any evicted tenant, except in rare cases, more than another an economic holding.  The Land Commission uses public money to buy land and the basis on which the whole transaction is carried out is that its use will be limited to re-selling to applicants economic holdings.  There are men in Leix and Galway who were evicted from 200 or 300 acres in the year 1880.  Suppose they were never evicted, the Land Commission might be acquiring part of their land to-day.</P>
    <P>You could not give men 200 or 300 acres now.  In some cases they acquired judicial tenancies.  You could only give a man an economic holding. That is the first limitation.  The second limitation is that you must take the circumstances of the time into account. It is obviously bad business and uneconomic to give 25 or 30 acres to a man who, owing to his station in life, is not the sort of man to whom 25 or 30 acres are likely to be of much use.  In this particular case the man was well off.  Take another case.  Take just the same circumstances with this change.  Suppose the evicted tenant had been a shopkeeper in Tipperary near that farm.  He has a small shop with a turnover of from £300 to £400 a year.  Would the Land Commission be right even in that case&mdash;a case of a genuine evicted tenant with a shop, <Col N="224" /> and who is twenty-five or thirty years out of touch with land since his father's eviction and who has lost any little knowledge of farming which he had&mdash;would they be right, I ask, even in that case, in giving the land to such a man?  That case is somewhat different from the case I quoted. Would they be right, I repeat, in giving land to such a man especially if there were congests about?</P>
    <P>If 130 acres were to be divided, and suppose there were ten or twelve congests and one genuine evicted tenant, who was a small shopkeeper in the nearest town, living away from the land, are we to bring him in and leave out two or three congests?  I do not think we should.  The moral of the story is that, no matter how anxious you are to deal with evicted tenants, you should not put the Land Commission in a straight-jacket and pass a rigid section in an Act, saying that the Land Commission shall deal with all cases regardless of the circumstances, merely limiting it to the phrase, &ldquo;genuine evicted tenants.&rdquo;  It would be quite impossible, and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment.  There seems to be an idea in the Dáil that the Land Commission are not particularly keen on dealing with evicted tenants. No meritorious case of an evicted tenant is left undealt with.  Deputies should be careful, when cases of evicted tenants are put up, to look into all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would not ask better than to have every case thrashed out in the Dáil. The Dáil would probably not like it, but it would settle the thing once and for all.  It is the only way to do it. You cannot deal with these on general principles.  Take any specific case, go into the circumstances, and I have no doubt that if the Dáil were to be the judges they would act similarly in each as the Land Commission acted.  You would not get five Deputies to say, in this particular case quoted by Deputy Heffernan, that the evicted tenant should be dealt with, and the congests left out.  The Land Commission will continue to deal with cases of evicted tenants.  The fact that a man made application, and that it was turned down, is no reason why he should not <Col N="225" /> make another.  It will be considered in the light of new circumstances, the land available, and of everything connected with it.  It would be out of the question to insert a rigid proposal of this sort in a Land Act, and it would be a very grave injustice.</P>

      <P>Viewing this from the State aspect, and apart from class and individual interest, one is forced to accept the Minister's view-point.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;original holding&rdquo; ought not, in my opinion, find expression in any Act.  The Bill does not say even &ldquo;portion of the original holding.&rdquo;  It says &ldquo;original holding,&rdquo; let it be 200 or 300 acres.  We know with the present hunger for land that the phrase &ldquo;original holding&rdquo; is not a practical proposal.  I am of opinion that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; ought not find its place in the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDoyle" hpid="Mr. M. DOYLE Mr. M. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has dealt to some extent, I think, in a rather unprincipled way with the evicted tenants.  I hold that the original genuine evicted tenant has a right to the property which was lost by his people, or himself, and he has much more right to it than the congests whom the Minister seems to have very much at heart.  I think that the Minister has congests on the brain.  He seems always to put them in front of the evicted tenants, whereas they have not one-eighth of the right to the land which the evicted tenants have.  I think he has dealt in a most unfair way in the case he put before the House.  He tells us of seven, eight, or ten congests taking this one farm.  This man had a perfect right to that farm from the point of view of tradition and justice.  He was justified in making application for the tenancy of that farm.  It was lying derelict, and if the man happened to be well off, as the Minister states, I do not see how his position in life, or his affairs in this world have anything to do with the injustice of taking that farm from him.  It was his perfect right to own it and remain there.  The Minister told us that he could not possibly give such a man more than 25 acres.  He has not carried out that practice all over the country.  I know tenants who have been put in possession <Col N="226" /> of much more than 100 acres.  If that is the argument that the Minister is trying to cram down our throats it is an unjust argument.  I can specify cases where land has been given to the extent of even more than double 25 acres.</P>
      <P>The idea of 25 acres does not stand for anything.  In my opinion a tenant who had been evicted from a holding of, say, 100 acres is perfectly entitled to receive back his 100 acres.  I cannot see what law would urge the Minister to give that tenant's property to other people.  The Minister, since the 1923 Act came into operation, has been preaching about congests.  A few days ago he told us that he had not enough land to go around.  In my own county there are 3,000 acres of land that could be taken and distributed amongst evicted tenants.  The Minister spoke about not reinstating evicted tenants in their own holdings.  I admit that is impracticable in a great many cases, but at the time the Land Act of 1923 was under consideration here I suggested that where farms were lying on the landlord's hands and evicted tenants had no holdings it was up to the Land Commission or the Minister to try and reinstate these men.  There are a great many holdings in the hands of the landlords on which evicted tenants could be reinstated.  The Minister stated that 50 or 60 evicted tenants have been reinstated since the passing of the 1923 Act.  I would like to know if that is correct.</P>

I tried to avoid dealing with the qualifications of the particular congests who got grants of land, but the Minister has seen his way to open an argument on the question of their qualifications. I think the question of wealth or otherwise does not arise at all.  I am not basing my argument on that point.  The Minister acknowledges that the man I have mentioned is a genuine evicted tenant, evicted because of non-payment of rent which he could have paid if he were allowed to do so. The lands are in the possession of the Land Commission, and they have power to do what they like in the matter, and to give 25 acres or 100 acres.</P>

      <P>We need not go beyond the emergency man and the baker.  These are sufficient to prove my case.  I have not attempted to compare the farming qualities of the evicted tenants and the congests.  I do not think it is fair that the Minister should base his argument on a comparison of that kind.  We base our arguments on a matter of justice.  No matter whether the evicted tenant is wealthy or not, provided he is an absolutely genuine evicted tenant&mdash;and I think there are comparatively few of them&mdash;he is entitled to his land.  The Minister spoke of 100,000 evicted tenants.  We have heard of only, roughly, about 50 cases being reinstated.</P>

      <P>If the old Land Commission reinstated three thousand evicted tenants, surely the Minister cannot claim credit for that?  In fact, it ought to be the other way about. He ought to be ashamed if he could only succeed in reinstating 52 evicted tenants while the Land Commission, under the old regime, was able to reinstate 3,000.  The Minister for Agriculture is a young man.  I am, perhaps, somewhat older than he, and I have some recollection of the land war and of the unfortunate people who were evicted.  The Minister has forgotten and a great many Deputies seem to have forgotten the sacrifices made by the people who took part in the land war.  These people were regarded as real genuine patriots, just as Sinn Feiners were in a later time. Some people, however, seem to forget the past very quickly, and my object is to remind the Minister of the sacrifices made by these people so that the Government and his Department may do something for them.  I maintain that the case put forward on their behalf has not been answered by the Minister.  In fact the Minister has proved that the Land Commission does not intend to deal with these evicted tenants as they ought to be dealt with. I am afraid he does not intend to right <Col N="230" /> the wrong which exists in regard to the evicted tenants.  I think the Dáil ought to express its opinion on this matter, and I hope that Deputies will vote for Deputy Cosgrave's amendment as a protest against the form of administration which is being carried out in connection with the evicted tenants.</P>

      <P>I heard the Minister make that statement.  On one point Deputy Heffernan was rather unfair. He admitted that the wording of Deputy Cosgrave's amendment was unfortunate, and said he objected to the words in the latter part of it. Although he differed with the wording of the amendment, he said that any Deputy who voted against it would be voting against the principle of reinstating genuine evicted tenants either in their original or in alternative holdings. I was born and reared on the border line of Tipperary, and I know a fair share about the conditions in <Col N="231" /> mid-Tipperary.  I could quote better cases for the Deputy than the one he referred to&mdash;cases that should be considered far and away before that particular one.  If the Deputy is aware of what is going on in mid-Tipperary he must know that an agitation is being carried on there for the reinstatement of certain evicted tenants who have better rights and clearer claims for reinstatement than the one he referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing no such thing.  I referred to this before, and I can say that I know of a considerable number of cases that have been passed on to the Land Commission by myself and the other representatives for the constituency that I represent.  I know that some of the cases at least have been given sympathetic consideration. I am not quite sure what is the actual position with regard to all those cases, but I know that the Commissioners have decided in some of them at least, that holdings should be found for the claimants that I am now referring to. I believe that there is an agitation in the country which is influenced by the consideration that genuine sympathetic treatment is not being given by the Commissioners to the claims of evicted tenants or their representatives. I would like to hear from the Minister what exactly is the procedure adopted in dealing with claims put in by evicted tenants or their representatives. I would like to hear him say, for instance, that there is a Department or that there will be one in the Land Commission specially set apart to deal with all these claims that have been sent in, and that certain guiding principles are laid down by the Minister and the Land Commission for the guidance of those appointed to decide whether the claims submitted are genuine or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose, for instance, that you have <Col N="232" /> 5,000 claims from people who regard themselves as genuine evicted tenants or their representatives, then I think the Minister and the Land Commissioners should lay down certain guiding principles for those appointed to decide whether these claims are genuine or not.  Let us take it that 2,000 out of the 5,000 are found to be genuine cases. The Commissioners should, in my opinion, find land for these people.  I do not know whether that is the procedure adopted or not, but I rather think it is not.  I believe that what is going on is this, that when an estate is acquired for division under the Land Act of 1923 the people or their representatives who, in years gone by, had been evicted from that estate, make application for reinstatement on it.  I do not think that is the way to deal with these cases at all.  I think all the cases should be taken in bulk, and that decisions should be come to after certain guiding principles had been laid down for the guidance of those appointed to deal with the claims.  That work might be done by four or five responsible officials who know something about the conditions in the country.  If the cases were dealt with in that way, and if the Minister was prepared to adopt this suggestion which I put forward, it would be the means, I believe, of getting rid once and for all of the idea that prevails in the country that nothing is being done in these cases.</P>
    <P>I know that there are many cases of evictions recorded in the history of the land agitation in the constituency I represent.  I know that in a good many of these cases the people who had been evicted have been provided with holdings on the estates from which they were evicted when the estates were acquired or else they have been provided with other holdings.  I know also of cases where evicted tenants or their representatives were provided with alternative holdings twice the value of the ones from which either themselves or their people had been evicted.  If what Deputy Cosgrave has in mind is to be carried out it will mean an injury, rather than a service, to some people that he claims to serve by this amendment.  I certainly agree <Col N="233" /> with Deputy Heffernan that, if the emergency man, or the gentleman to whom he refers as an emergency man, has been found a holding in this particular case, he is quite right to protest against that.  I would like to hear the Minister state what is the procedure for dealing with claims from evicted tenants, and say that these claims will be dealt with as a whole, and that there should not be a question of waiting until the estates from which these people or their representatives had been evicted are acquired for distribution. The cases should be dealt with as a whole, whether the number be 1,000, 5,000, or 100,000 which was the figure given by the Minister himself, and which I believe is slightly on the exaggerated side.  Whatever the number be, they should be dealt with in a businesslike way, and by people appointed by the Land Commission who know something about the conditions in the country and who will give sympathetic consideration to the claims of those evicted in the days of the Land War.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister can say that there are 100,000 evicted tenants in the country at present. It could not be possible.  Like Deputy Davin, I have put forward claims on behalf of evicted tenants. Those claims are for reinstatement in their original holdings or elsewhere. I am sure they got consideration, but I do not think they got any land.  It has been stated that the congests are the particular pets of the Minister.  I think if it were stated that the western congests are the particular pets of the Minister it would be more correct; he does not seem to give so much consideration to congests in what I may call the home counties.  At the same time, the Land Commission are making grants of very large tracts of land in my county, especially large tracts of land, I am informed in some cases, of anything between 100 and 200 acres.  If there is as much land as that available it ought not to be as hard to provide for the few remaining genuine evicted tenants in the country.</P>

      <P>Like the last speaker, I do not know if the Minister <Col N="234" /> still adheres to his statement that there are 100,000 genuine evicted tenants in the Saorstát, but I would like to ask him again a question which I asked him on the occasion on which he made that statement, whether he is prepared to make a return of the number of genuine evicted tenants now. On that occasion he stated that he was not prepared to make such a return. I ask him now has he reconsidered his decision in the meantime, and, if not, why he could not make this return.  I know I have been in receipt of numerous communications from people who regard themselves as genuine evicted tenants and who were evicted from the year 1880 or 1881 to the present time. There is no doubt that there is a certain number of those unfortunate people in existence, and what we want and what I think we are entitled to get is an official statement as to what is the definite number of genuine evicted tenants to-day.  Some people say there are none.  Some people go to the other extreme adopted by the Minister and say there are 100,000. Some people say because there are none nothing should be done.  Some say that because there is an extraordinary number nothing can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit there is a certain definite number, and that that number could and should be dealt with.  Over and over again during the many stages of the Land War, of which though the Minister or myself may not have been engaged in, yet we must know, there were promises made and hopes held out, to say the least, to men who sacrificed themselves genuinely.  I am sure the Minister is the last man in this House to deny that; if any other members of this House would deny it. I would be very surprised if they did. There were genuine cases where men who could have paid their rents declined to do so because they fell in with the general spirit of the time, the general movement that was on foot, and they purposely refrained from doing what they could in paying their rents in order to bring the landlords to their senses.  Now, I think it is imperative upon us here at this stage in our national history, in our own <Col N="235" /> national Parliament, to do something for those people.  In doing that something we should have proper inquiries made as to the definite numbers of those who are in such a position, and the Minister for Agriculture should come here and make a definite proposal for something to restore these people or their representatives to their holdings.</P>
    <P>I have received innumerable communications, not 100,000, but a considerable number, and among others I have had one case where the writer complained that before the passing of the Evicted Tenants Act of 1907 there were 2,000 such evicted tenants scheduled for reinstatement, and that he was one amongst that 2,000.  Then he goes on to say that the farm is at present untenanted, and is actually in charge of a herd, and of course that he has not been reinstated.  He says that the holding was gazetted in 1908, again in 1910, and again in 1925.  I will, if the Minister desires, give him the name. Perhaps it is not advisable at the moment to make it public, but I am only quoting this as an instance which was brought under my notice, and which I am not, as a private individual member of the Dáil, in a position to reply to.  I cannot tell the writer of that letter why he has not been reinstated, except to say that this Government and this Ministry of Agriculture, after four years or more, have done nothing to remedy his case.  That is the only reply I can give, but I say to the Minister, in all seriousness, in the interests of the Ministry of which he is at present the head, surely, that it would be advisable that something should be done for such people, surely it would be advisable that there should be some form of reply given to writers such as this, except a mere blank negative, and surely it would have been possible before this, and even if it is not too late now, for him to come forward and say not that he is prepared to do this and do that immediately, but that he will, as soon as possible, instruct his Department through one or other of its branches to inquire into the position of evicted tenants at present in the Saorstát as to their genuineness and as to the circumstances in which they were <Col N="236" /> placed, and are placed, and that he will then come forward with a definite proposal to deal properly with those people. I think that that is a suggestion which is in no way extravagant, or meant in any partisan spirit.  These men or their representatives are the wounded soldiers of the Land War.</P>
    <P>They deserve and they must get proper and equitable treatment.  I am not saying that they should get everything in all instances that they ask for, but that they should get as just and proper treatment as is possible at the moment from the representatives of the people.  These men have suffered in a cause for which the tenant farmers of Ireland, and consequently the people of Ireland, have distinctly and definitely benefited.  I say that it would be a lasting and dying disgrace to any Dáil that something should not be done as soon as possible to restore those people to the property from which they had been evicted.  I make this proposal in no partisan spirit.  I suggest that there would not be a dissentient voice raised, either in the Dáil or in the country, if the Minister were to make the inquiries I have asked for, and if on the strength of those inquiries he came to this Dáil or the next Dáil and asked that justice should be done to these men.</P>

      <P>I want to stress one point that has emerged from the debate. I cannot say from my own knowledge that emergency men have got tracts of land in my county, but I accept the case put up by Deputies that they have in other counties.  I am aware that in my own county workmen have got very little land.  Some of them only got four acres, and very many none at all.  I do make the plea that the emergency man should get no consideration from the State.  He was more responsible even than the landlord for what existed in the past.  He was the bulwark of the landlord&mdash;the most objectionable man in the district &mdash;and his continuance there must be always regarded as a slur and an insult. I base my plea on the fact that workmen on many estates which have been divided up got very little land&mdash; in many cases no land at all.  I say that <Col N="237" /> the emergency man should not be considered or, at least, that he is the last to deserve consideration.</P>

      <P>While supporting the principle of the amendment, I recognise the difficulty of carrying it out.  I should, however, like to direct attention to a particular aspect of this question.  About one and a half years ago inquiry was held in Arklow as to the evicted tenants in County Wicklow. I think about forty attended and made claims before the Inspector and I understand that about twelve were recommended for land.  If that is so I think that some effort should be made to give land to those people, because if they were recommended I presume that the Land Commission are satisfied that they are genuine evicted tenants.  They should, therefore, get the preference when any estates are being divided. Certainly there is plenty of untenanted land in the County of Wicklow available on which to place those people.  I put the proposition to the Minister that cases of this kind, no matter where they are, if the Land Commission are satisfied that they are genuine cases of wounded soldiers of the Land War, who made most of the Land Acts possible, should get a preference over congests or anyone else when estates are being divided up.</P>

      <P>I was somewhat amazed to hear the poor case made by the Minister in opposing this amendment. He stated that there was a certain number of evicted tenants reinstated since the passing of the Act of 1923.  When moving the amendment I asked the Minister if he could give the number of evicted tenants reinstated and the names.  He has now stated that there were fifty.  I now ask him, how many have been reinstated in the County Galway since the passing of the Act of 1923?  I can answer it myself if he does not&mdash;I can tell the House that there has not been one.  I presume the Minister is aware that when Mr. Birrell, who was Chief Secretary for Ireland, brought in the Bill of 1909 he inserted compulsory clauses therein for the reinstatement of the evicted tenants.  The Bill was passed in the House of Commons <Col N="238" /> but was mutilated by the House of Lords and the compulsory clauses taken out.  The following day the Tory newspapers came out with large headings of &ldquo;Victory for Clanricarde.&rdquo; If the Minister refuses to accept the new clause I have proposed I suppose the heading in the Tory papers in this country to-morrow will be, &ldquo;Victory for Clanricarde's Planters.&rdquo; The Minister stated that he could not re-open the question of the reinstatement of evicted tenants.  If that is so, I wonder why letters were sent out from his Department to evicted tenants in different parts of the twenty-six counties?</P>

      <P>It is.  It commences: &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Agriculture to acknowledge the receipt of your letter.&rdquo;  I will pass the letter on to the Minister if he wants it.  In moving my amendment I quoted a genuine case for reinstatement in the County Galway, but the Minister in his reply never referred to the case, although he has personal knowledge of it, and, I believe, knows the man I refer to thoroughly.  He did not refer to that case, but went off across to Tipperary, and referred to cases there.  I ask, why did he not refer to that particular case?  He talks of men being out of their holdings for a certain number of years, and said they would not be able to work them now in a satisfactory manner.  This particular man and his two brothers have been working as agricultural labourers and supporting their mother and sisters from the time they were evicted.  Does the Minister mean to say that that is not a genuine case in which land should be given? There is one particular case that I have received information about from the County Tipperary.  I handed this letter and a letter from the P.P. to Deputy Heffernan.  He mentioned it, but he did not refer to the particulars. This man was evicted from 50 acres of land in 1892.  The land was in the hands of a planter until 1916 or 1917, when he was routed out of it by the people of the district, since when it has been derelict. The planter has intimated to the evicted tenant that he is willing to surrender the farm if the Land Commission will take it up and reinstate the tenant.  Is that a genuine case for reinstatement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the remarks of Deputy Nolan on the day I introduced this amendment.  Deputy Nolan, in a mumbled statement&mdash;I cannot call it a speech&mdash;tried to lead the House to believe that when I stated there were genuine evicted tenants in County Galway, it was tantamount to an incorrect statement.  I repeat that statement, and I say that there are genuine evicted tenants, not only in Co. Galway, but in <Col N="240" /> every county in the Free State, including Limerick.  I have letters here from the County Limerick asking me to bring cases forward, as they seemingly have no one to look after them in that county.  I owe no apology to Deputy Nolan for any action I have taken on behalf of the evicted tenants, and I can assure him I shall continue to advocate their cause until the last one of them is reinstated.</P>

      <P>There will be plenty of time for all this enthusiasm.  Am I to take this proposal seriously?  I suppose the best compliment to pay to Deputy Cosgrave is to take his proposal seriously. If this amendment is passed the Land Commission will have to deal with every genuine evicted tenant.  My definition of a genuine evicted tenant is a tenant evicted for non-payment of rent in a certain period, or his representative, be he lawyer, solicitor, or any other sort of professional man, or whether he was a labourer, small farmer or a big farmer, or anything else. Is the Land Commission to deal with all of them?  Remember that is the specific case Deputy Doyle made, but Deputy Doyle is logical in the matter. He says: &ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo;  I quoted a case and made a point that the representative of the evicted tenant is a well-off man, and he said it did not matter; he should get his land back. That is at least logical and there is a case to be met.  But let us know where we are.  Does the Dáil agree with that and does Deputy Redmond agree with that?</P>

      <P>Deputy Redmond is also logical.  He is willing to agree to that, but look at what it means.  It is all very fine to agree when you have not the responsibility of carrying it out.  Look at what it means in hundreds of cases.  It is these cases that do crop up where an Act of Parliament is being passed and five or six very bad cases of that sort would take all the virtue out of an Act of Parliament. If that clause is inserted and passed and the Land Commission acquires three or four hundred acres of land from which somebody had been evicted twenty-five years ago and whose son may be a stockbroker in Dublin or a local dispensary doctor&mdash;if he is to get back this two hundred acres of land against the interest of the congests it is simply absurd and I do not mind joining issue at all on that point. But let us be clear as to the issue that we disagree about.  The Land Commission will not be asked to take up all cases, including every man, no matter what the circumstances may be.  They will not be asked to give back an amount of land equal to that from which a man or his father was evicted years ago.  If the Land Commission did give out such directions and they were carried out then a shocking state of affairs would arise because in many cases the immediate effect would be that men so reinstated would sell out.</P>

There has been more land divided in Galway than in any other county in Ireland.  I know Galway inside out, and to my knowledge, in Galway, out of about 200,000 acres that <Col N="243" /> has been divided, there is only one farm that has gone back to the hands of other people than the people put on it.</P>

That is much better than if they were to borrow and stock the whole of the land.  There was one class of cases where there was wholesale selling of land, and that was the case of evicted tenants.</P>
      <P>I think Deputies are aware that, so far as the evicted tenants are concerned, they are one of the classes that, to a large extent, failed on the land. That is not to be surprised at.  It is their misfortune rather than their fault.</P>

      <P>I take it that in this country, and in this Parliament, when a discussion on land arises considerable latitude must be allowed. I have always allowed considerable latitude, and I have been assisted in allowing considerable latitude by my own considerable ignorance of the subject. We are discussing an amendment to-day, but in discussing it, we are really wandering into a debate on the administration of the Land Commission. We are also discussing an amendment so framed that apparently nobody is in favour of it.  I am not sure that Deputy Cosgrave himself is in favour of it.  Up to the present nobody else has said that this amendment meets what he wants in its present form. There is a certain amount of heat about the question of evicted tenants, but we <Col N="244" /> cannot proceed to discuss the question by way of interruption.  Deputies who have made speeches will have to listen to other Deputies making speeches.  We must listen to speeches with which we do not agree.  There is no other way of doing business.  Considerable latitude is being allowed, but we cannot wander at will.  If the Minister wants to make a statement he must be allowed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the conventional thing to introduce heat into a discussion on land purchase and I suppose we must be conventional.  I could not possibly accept from Deputy Redmond or Deputy Cosgrave an amendment the meaning of which is that the Land Commission shall deal with all genuine evicted tenants.  It would be quite impossible for the Land Commission.  I am asked what is the difficulty.  Anyone who knows anything about the administration of land purchase realises that if I attempted to bring a shopkeeper, a professional man or a fairly wealthy man, because his father had been evicted, into a district in which there are a large number of congests it would be a very dangerous thing to do, and the whole law would be brought into disrepute.  After going to the trouble of putting in these people a lot of the holdings would have to be sold. Up to the present no one has suggested, except Deputy Cosgrave, that the evicted tenants should be reinstated in their original holdings.  I could not agree to that.  There seems to be an impression that the evicted tenants are not getting fair play.  Subject to what I have stated on those two points, I can assure Deputies that the claims of evicted tenants, where they make claims to the Land Commission, are considered sympathetically. Perhaps I had better give the information Deputy Redmond asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 13,620 applications from evicted tenants recorded in the Land Commission; 6,965 were rejected, 3,347 have been reinstated; 312 are noted for consideration in the allotment of untenanted land; 2,996 have not yet been considered. <Col N="245" /> That is the whole position.  Deputy Davin asked what is the procedure? There is a small section in the Land Commission which acts as a sort of clearing house for these applications and does the clerical work.  What happens?  An estate is bought.  Everybody in the district knows about it. One thing is certain, that every evicted tenant or the representative of every evicted tenant will apply.  Deputies need not be afraid that the applications will not reach the Land Commission. They always do.  They reach first of all the section I have mentioned and are then divided into sub-sections. There are four Chief Inspectors in the Land Commission, each being responsible for a certain district.  The applications go through each Chief Inspector down to the Inspector who is dealing with the estate, so that in the final result there are four men in the Land Commission who, under the Commissioners, have the ruling of the matter&mdash; the four Chief Inspectors.  Every application goes down actually to the Inspector who is on the land, whose duty it is to make all the inquiries into the circumstances in which the tenant was evicted, into his present position, and the circumstances of the other tenants in the district who are also applicants for land.  There is no other way to do it.  No three or four men in the Land Commission could sit down and pick out the good applications from the bad ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are aware of the sort of applications that come in.  They state &ldquo;I was evicted&rdquo; or &ldquo;My father was evicted 50 years ago from a particular place.  I heard the estate is sold and I want a holding there.&rdquo;  The application is generally as vague as that.  No one in the Land Commission could examine these applications.  The information must be got down the country through the Inspector.  The information is brought back to the Chief Inspectors. They have the full facts before them, all the circumstances of the eviction, the merits of the application as it stands to-day and, in addition, they have before them considerations such as the amount of land available, the circumstances of other applicants&mdash; who must be considered&mdash;as well as the <Col N="246" /> representatives of the evicted tenants. On that they have to make up their minds.  Personally I have got a good many cases of evicted tenants from Deputies, but I have never got a case yet where I consider the equities were on the side of the evicted tenant or the alleged evicted tenant.  I can give Deputies an undertaking that within these limitations the Land Commission will try to deal with every genuine case.  I must have these limitations. We cannot go beyond that.  We cannot deal with them all on account of present day circumstances.  We cannot deal with them on the line of reinstating them in their own holdings. It would do injustice.  I agree with Deputy Redmond that the evicted tenants are entitled, other things being equal, to a little more than fair play. I agree with him as to the sacrifices they made at the time, but a very big number of these people were dealt with pre-1923.</P>
    <P>The men who are left are either of two classes&mdash;people who are in extremely poor circumstances in another walk of life, and people who are very well off, having made good in other walks of life and who have cut off all connection with the land.  It would be an extraordinary attitude, at this stage, to take up, that every one of these 7,000 applicants who have been rejected should be put back in their holdings. It would take an immense amount of land, and a number of them &mdash;a very large number probably&mdash; would sell out.  That is almost certain when you remember that even in approved cases a very large number sold out.</P>
    <P>With regard to the case quoted by Deputy Cosgrave, that evicted tenant was offered a holding in 1908 and refused it.  He may have had good reasons.  The fact that he refused does not prevent his making an application again.  I do not know the circumstances. Deputy Cosgrave gives me credit for knowing the circumstances of the case.  I do not know the full circumstances, but it is open to the evicted tenant to apply again.  His application will be considered again, but remember that he was offered a holding before. <Col N="247" /> The name, I think, is Madden.  He was offered a holding and refused it in 1908.  It is open to him, in applying again, to show that his circumstances have changed&mdash;to show that he had good reason for refusing in the first instances, and that his circumstances are now such that, in equity, he is entitled to a holding.  The Land Commission will consider the case.  The Land Commission give every consideration to evicted tenants, and will continue to do so, but I cannot accept amendments which would force them to deal with all evicted tenants and, above all, I cannot accept an amendment which would force them to reinstate evicted tenants in their original holdings, because that would impose considerable hardships on a fairly large number of innocent people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. COSGRAVE Mr. COSGRAVE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COSGRAVE</NameTxt>
      <P>The tenant, Madden, in the case referred to by the Minister, was evicted from 34 acres of the best land in my part of Galway, which he held at a rent of £33.  The original rent was £24, but his father voted against the landlord's nominee at the Parliamentary Nolan and Trench election and his rent was increased by £9.  It was £33 when he was evicted.  He was offered a holding on the Daly estate of 22 acres of inferior land, the rent being £23 per year.  That was the first holding he was offered.  I know the farm well. Half of it is moor land, and there are only 22 acres in it, as against the 34 acres which he had held.  The second holding he was offered was on the Butson estate.  It contained 16 acres and the rent was a little over £16 a year.  I think that man was quite justified in refusing to accept such a small holding as that after he had been on the roadside for 25 years.  The Minister stated that a number of evicted tenants were selling or had sold their holdings. There have been over 200 tenants reinstated in Co. Galway.  I should like to know how many of them have sold their holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. COSGRAVE Mr. COSGRAVE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COSGRAVE</NameTxt>
      <P>I assert that not five of them have sold their holdings. <Col N="248" /> The Minister also stated that it would be an injustice to remove people from their present holdings.  I suppose it would be an injustice to remove the planter and reinstate the evicted tenant.  Is that what the Minister regards as &ldquo;injustice&rdquo;?  The Minister also stated that he did not think it would be advisable to reinstate poor people&mdash;&ldquo;people who are in poor circumstances,&rdquo; I think, was the phrase used. Is it any wonder that they are in poor circumstances when they have been on the roadside for 25 or 30 years?  Are not the poor people the people who should be reinstated?  The Minister referred on several occasions to the last paragraph in the amendment referring to the reinstatement of evicted tenants in their original holdings. But he did not suggest to the mover that the wording of the section should be changed.  Would it not be possible for the Land Commission to reinstate the evicted tenants in their original holdings and give alternative holdings to the planters?  That could be done in many cases.  It could be done particularly in the case of Horsemann&mdash;a man who has 199 acres, 131 acres being grabbed land.  I do not see why the Land Commission should not do that.  This man is not living on this particular holding.  The buildings were levelled by him and the emergency men, and he is living in another holding about three miles away.  Why not give him a holding elsewhere if you are in favour of giving him land?  I say these people are not entitled to anything, because they paid no fine for the land when they grabbed it.  But if the Minister and the Land Commission think they are entitled to get land in lieu of that which they are deprived of, it can be given them.  It is a matter of indifference to me so long as the evicted tenants are reinstated.  I hope the majority of the Deputies here&mdash; especially the farmers, who have benefited by the sacrifices of the evicted tenants in the past&mdash;will support this amendment to get rid of the planters, and reinstate the evicted tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that the Minister has thought fit to give us the figures.  I should like to know since what date the 13,000 applications were made.  It appears there were almost 7,000 applications rejected, that 3,300 evicted tenants were reinstated, and that there remain almost 3,000 applications to be dealt with.  Of the 6,000 odd applications which were not rejected, 3,000 odd have been reinstated, and there are almost 3,000 yet to be considered.  My complaint&mdash;I want to put it as fairly as I can&mdash;is of the delay in the consideration of these 3,000 cases.  The Minister may say with perfect justice that the Land Commission, as at present constituted, was not able to cope with this work, but that does not meet my case.  My case is that he, as Minister for Lands, should make some provision whereby the Land Commission, or some other body, would speed matters up and deal with these 3,000 applications.</P>
      <P>I do not stand for a moment on the wording of my friend's amendment. I take it that the real object of the amendment was to draw the attention of the House to the delay which at present obtains in the consideration of the claims and the reinstatement of the remaining evicted tenants.  Whether or not the Land Commission, as at present constituted, can cope with these 3,000 applications is beside the question.  I want the Minister to provide some means by which the work will be done. As regards the point as to the present circumstances of the evicted tenant, I agree that it would be illogical to suggest that because a man is in better circumstances than his neighbour he should not have equal rights in respect to action that they both took, or that their representatives took, in the interest of the Irish farmers during the period from the year 1880.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be illogical: I think it would be worse than illogical.  I admit that all legislation, or, indeed, sometimes very little legislation, can go entirely upon the lines of logic.  But I put it <Col N="250" /> further, and I say that this question of reinstatement, to my mind, is not a question of present circumstances at all.  It is a question of right.  These men or their predecessors were evicted. Why?  Because they did certain things and took certain lines.  Is it to be said that because in the meantime by their thrift or by their energy or by the exercise of their talents, whether at the learned professions or at the plough, they are to be deprived of the rights which in all equity should be theirs?  I do not think that that is tenable.  I do not think either that it will mean such a wonderful excess of numbers as the Minister seems to suggest. I doubt very much if so many of these evicted tenants as it would appear from the remark that has fallen from the Minister to-day, have succeeded in advancing themselves whether in the professions or in the trades or otherwise.  If they have done so, and if in the meantime they have got on, why should that be a reason for denying them what I consider to be their right?  I think that his case, from that point of view, falls to the ground.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave proceeded to read from a letter which, he said, came from the Department of Lands and Agriculture, and he was asked to give the name of the writer of that letter.  He read the letter, as far as I know, for what it was worth, and as coming on behalf of the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture. The Deputy did not give the name of the writer.  I would ask the House whether the Deputy in that case did not act perfectly fair?  Because the name of the writer is probably the name of one of the Minister's own staff, and I think it was from that point of view that Deputy Cosgrave did not give the name&mdash;I am sure my friend did not want to injure the writer of that letter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister says that.  Before I sit down I would like once more to impress upon the Minister the view that I take on this question, and it is a personal one&mdash;that this amendment in itself as it is now drafted, is not the only way whereby these cases of the evicted tenants <Col N="251" /> can be met, nor do I suggest that it is the best way.  What I do suggest is that it is up to the Minister, here and now, if he will not accept this amendment, to give the Dáil some assurance that he will get to work and do something. Even if the staff at his disposal now are not sufficiently adequate to do the work and to deal with these remaining 3,000 cases, it is his duty, and I say the House would assist him in that duty, to provide a sufficient staff, so as to put a stop to the delay that has taken place.</P>
      <P>On the question of the wording of the amendment, I have not really consulted my colleague, but I do not think he would refuse if he were asked to alter the terms, certainly as regards the last words of the amendment&mdash;namely, if it was suggested that the evicted tenants should be restored and if the words &ldquo;original holding&rdquo; were omitted, I should say that the amendment might meet with general approval.  But I admit the difficulty in the restoration of all the evicted tenants to their original holdings.  There is no use in blinding oneself to that difficulty.  The object, as far as I understand it, is that where possible, and acting in the circumstances in a reasonable and fair way, the tenant should, everything else being equal, be restored to his original holding.  I am not bound to that, and personally I would not press that point. I would be perfectly prepared to have the amendment altered so that the tenant should be restored or that he should be placed in a position as regards a holding as good as he or his predecessor held at the time of the eviction. I hope, therefore, that the Minister understands that the reason why I am supporting this amendment is that I want these 3,000 cases dealt with at once.  If the machinery at the Minister's disposal is not sufficient, I will give him every support in my power, and I think the rest of the Dáil will too, to provide that the machinery will be sufficient.</P>

If the Deputy is to give the Land Commission discretion, then that is the existing law, and it does not require an amendment at all.  The Land Commission may deal with all genuine evicted tenants taking all the circumstances into account.  That is the law.  If the Deputy wants to give the Land Commission discretion there is no occasion for the amendment at all. On the other hand, I cannot agree with Deputies that the Land Commission must deal with all cases of evicted tenants.  They could not do it.</P>

      <P>As regards the 13,620 applications received by the Land Commission from the tenants who were evicted, or whose predecessors were evicted, in the event of the estates from which they were evicted not being likely to be acquired under the 1923 Act, how does the Land Commission propose to deal with the applicants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Place them on other estates.  This is really not a question of staff at all.  We cannot deal with the applications made by evicted tenants except when the estate from which the tenant was evicted comes up for consideration.  In other words, an inspector must be sent down to the estate.  He must get all the circumstances connected with that estate, and that only happens when the estate comes up for consideration.  That is not a question of want of staff.  If there were more staff there, no doubt the purchase and distribution would go faster and the cases would be reached sooner.  But you cannot take cases out and proceed to go around the country to estates from which there were some evictions.  It is not a question of staff. The only assurance I can give is that the Land Commission will, so far as possible, sympathetically consider the cases of any evicted tenants who put in applications.  The fact that an application was turned down in the past will not prevent the Land Commission from considering it again.</P>

The fact that they have rejected 7,000 does not mean that every one of the other 7,000 cases is a genuine case.  On closer examination it may be found that some of these cases could not be dealt with for one hundred and one reasons.  You can only deal with each case in conjunction with the estate from which the person concerned was evicted.  If it is a genuine case, one that should be dealt with, and there is no land, it is quite easy to deal with the tenant on another estate.  Numbers of evicted tenants have been dealt with on estates other than the estates they or their predecessors were evicted from.</P>

I suggest that tenants may get land on some other estate actually under consideration.  That has already occurred and in that way a certain number of them were dealt with long before their own estates came up for consideration.

      <P>I believe the Land Commission are trying to do their best in the circumstances.  I come from a <Col N="256" /> part of the country&mdash;I was born very near Tipperary&mdash;where there were very great sacrifices made by evicted tenants.  It is true that most of those have been restored to their original holdings, but there are still a few tenants who have not been restored, and we cannot get over the fact that they have been victimised.</P>
      <P>The trouble with regard to the settlement of evicted tenants is this: they have to pay too much rent.  When tenants are restored to their original holdings or get new holdings, the rent of those holdings, when you compare it with the adjoining land, is often thirty and forty per cent. more than what they would have paid if they were never evicted.  I think the price paid for what I may term evicted land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an evicted tenant.  I say that the price paid for evicted land should not be higher than that paid for untenanted land.  The price paid for evicted land should be the same as if the tenant had run through the whole gamut of the Land Commission and got the reductions that the average judicial tenant would get if he were never evicted. Undoubtedly there were landlords who did not facilitate the reinstatement of tenants.  It is useless to say it is the fault of the Land Commission.  The Land Commission is sympathetic, but there have been many obstacles put in their way by local people. When a tenant is about to be restored <Col N="257" /> to his original holding, there is actually an agitation amongst the local people to get some of that evicted tenant's land.  I do not think that is very creditable.  Those are some of the obstacles to the restoration of evicted tenants and they make it very difficult for the Land Commission to restore holdings.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides for the reinstatement of evicted tenants in certain contingencies where they have been ejected on or after the gale day next preceding the 16th day of June, 1926. I understand that date is fixed by the Minister, having in view the fact that this Bill was introduced at that time, and I think the intention is that this opportunity should not be given to landlords over tenants when the landlords held under the Land Act.  My amendment proposes that the date be put back to the date of the introduction of the Land Act, 1923.  That date is fixed in a more or less arbitrary manner, but I do not stand on it if the Minister could suggest any other date that would meet my point.  But the fact of the matter remains that there are certain tenants of holdings, the landlords of which hold them from the Land Commission.  These tenants have been evicted since the introduction of the 1923 Act, and the argument I put forward is this, that these landlords in all probability anticipated that legislation would have to be introduced eventually to deal with such cases, and in anticipation of that they evicted their tenants.  I suggest that if it is equitable and just to reinstate those who were evicted since the introduction of the Bill, it is equally just and equitable to go back to those who have been evicted since the time of the Land Act of 1923.  There will be cases of hardship if this Bill is passed in its present form.  I know a man in my own county <Col N="261" /> who was evicted about two months prior to the date fixed in this Bill, and he would, therefore, not come within the provisions of the Bill, and I believe there are other cases of that kind.  This case to which I refer has attracted a good deal of attention in the neighbourhood. The man is very decent and honest and the case has created a good deal of sympathy locally.  If the Bill is passed as it is now he will not come under it.  The Minister ought to reconsider the position existing at present and ought to put the date back to what I suggest, or at least a couple of years previous to the introduction of this Bill.</P>

      <P>There was general agreement, with the exception of Deputy Heffernan, that this was the right date, for this reason: There will be, of course, some hardship if we draw the line here, and equally there will be hardship if we draw the line in 1923. There will always be someone a month or two on one side or the other.  If you go back to 1923 it would be retrospective legislation, and what you have to remember here is that, while there may be hardships in any event, the balance is in favour of the position as set out in the Bill, and not as set out in the amendment.  Remember, you are dealing with future tenancies, to a very great extent, not with present tenancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only in the case of a future tenancy that there has been an eviction. It is only in the case of a tenancy held subject to a year's notice to quit, where there is no real tenure, that there has been an eviction.  In a great many cases you are dealing with small tenancies where the landlord and the tenant are practically the same class of people, and where there are really no equities between them.  The landlord in these cases that are covered by that section, exercised an undoubted right, which he had in 1922, 1923 and 1924, to serve notice to quit on a future tenant and take up the holding, and he exercised the perfectly proper right to give it to <Col N="262" /> somebody else.  That was regarded as a matter of form.  Anyone who sets a holding on these terms, even though it is a tenancy terminable on a year's notice to quit, presumably has a right to do this at the end of the term of agreement.  It is not right to call it an eviction in the sense of an eviction as we knew it, say, in the year 1881, in its application to a present tenancy where the tenant had a certain tenure. We are dealing here, remember, with tenants who have no tenure whatever, who are subject to a year's notice to quit.</P>
    <P>We are dealing, to a great extent, with holdings near towns owned by shopkeepers, who set them to other shopkeepers, or people like that, and vice versa&mdash;owned by people who, in many cases, are not farmers at all, who hold this land as accommodation land and set it from year to year.  We are going very far, indeed, in fact too far, if we allow the present occupier to purchase the fee simple in such a case.  If we make that retrospective we are going to inflict considerable hardship on people who would have exercised their right in this way.  The old tenant would have gone out and they would have put in another tenant.  We would have to put out the tenant in existence now and put in the first tenant.  That would be arbitrary and wrong.  Leave it as it is.  No matter where you draw the line, there will be hardship.  There will be injustice on one side of the line or on the other, but you will do less hardship this way.  If you go back to 1923 you will be indulging in the luxury of retrospective legislation.</P>

      <P>There is potential building ground, and potential building ground.  If you hold ground as a future tenancy that is one case, and if you hold it as a present tenancy with the judicial rent fixed, that is another case.  In the latter case the landowner <Col N="263" /> might have served notice on the tenant to resume the holding, notwithstanding that it was a present tenancy, and have actually resumed it.  I think there is no answer, even in a case of present tenancy, and there is no obligation on the landlord to resume it for the purpose of building.  In the sort of cases that this covers, namely, future tenancies terminable at twelve month's notice to quit, it does not matter whether the ground is suitable for building or not. The real owner was the landlord, and he was exercising a perfectly legitimate right in giving that notice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to make the sub-section a little clearer.  It is largely a drafting amendment, but there might be an error in description that was not of a trivial character and it might carry very serious consequences.  For instance, I take the case of a small holding, a cottage with one or two acres attached.  That might be held to be an agricultural holding, but, equally, it might be held to be a cottage with a curtilage, and, thereby, a residential holding.  Unless the position is made a little clearer it would be open to the Commissioners, when all proceedings were over, to alter the final list and say that this is not an agricultural holding but a residential holding, or vice versa. It would be inconvenient both to the landlord and the tenant.  I am not absolutely tied to the description in my amendment, and if the Minister will consider the possibility of making it <Col N="265" /> clear that the error is a trival error of description, or an accidental omission rather than an error of substance, I would be prepared to meet him.</P>

I am prepared to discuss the matter with the Deputy, but I am advised that it has a legal meaning and would be unwise to change it as it is so well-fixed in other Acts.  Up to the present it has been the subject of decided cases, and I think it would be rather a pity to attempt a definition in that state of affairs, because there is no better definition than decided cases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is for the purpose of making some provision for those persons interested in the sale of land from the point of view of having a charge or mortgage upon it.  Under the <Col N="266" /> Bill as it stands, the vesting, which was previously a separate function, now becomes automatic, and the land is automatically vested on the appointed day.  It is possible that people interested, mortgagors and persons holding charges, might not have adequate notice of the appointed day.  This amendment seeks to preserve their rights until registration in the Registry of Deeds is carried through.  It is possible that people interested would be able to find out, at an expenditure of a considerable amount of time and trouble, but when it is registered in the Registry of Deeds&mdash;that is a formality well known in the legal profession&mdash; anyone can go there and look it up.  I suggest that it might be desirable to take a precaution of this kind.  It simply provides that the rights of a mortgagor or a person who holds a charge on the land shall not be abolished by reason of vesting, but shall continue until the necessary registration is made in the Registry of Deeds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(7) Where a holding or part of a holding of tenanted land not exceeding two statute acres to which the provisions of this section apply has been acquired by the Commissioners of Public Works for the purposes of the Public Services and the Commissioners certify to the Land Commission before the appointed day that the holding or part of the holding has been purchased by them for a sum not exceeding one hundred pounds from the tenant in occupation thereof, then the holding or part of <Col N="267" /> the holding shall vest in the Commissioners under this section free from all rights and equities arising from the previous interest of the tenant therein referred to in Section 8 of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1885, and the person to whom the Commissioners shall have paid the purchase money shall be a trustee thereof for the persons beneficially entitled thereto.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is asked for by the Board of Works.  It is not of great importance.  It makes it easier for them to make title.  I am advised that it is not likely to lead to any abuse.

As the Minister doubtless is aware, when lands were forcibly entered a couple of years ago there was no such thing as giving any compensation, and, in fact, by a decision of the Supreme Court compensation claims in respect of land in the occupation of unauthorised persons were not allowed, and have been definitely defeated.  I took the point of view, on the Second Reading Stage, that we ought not to penalise the persons who own these lands and who have been deprived of their use for a number of years by mob violence.  We ought not to hold them liable for rates on lands which they did not occupy, or whose use they did not enjoy. While I admit that the case can be put to me that the county council or the ratepayers must bear the burden&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My opposition to the amendment would be that it proposed to go back to the old trustee system under which the tenant was made <Col N="272" /> liable.  That system has broken down undoubtedly.  The trustees did not do their work.  They had a most thankless job, and found it very difficult to collect the necessary moneys from the rest of the tenants.  The result was that all this work in connection with the keeping of embankments was neglected by the trustees.  That is one of the reasons why work of this kind has passed under the Drainage Maintenance Acts from the hands of trustees to the county councils.  Deputy Heffernan's amendment proposed to go back to the trustee system again; in other words, to give notice to the tenants, six months, say, asking whether they would like to have the work done by trustees or in a different way.  Tenants are not going to undertake a liability if they can avoid it or put it on somebody else.  There is no more unpopular work in the country than that which falls to the lot of trustees in connection with the keeping of these embankments.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Minister's proposal in the Bill because I am afraid it is not going to improve the present position.  It is going to lead to divided responsibility in connection with this very important work. That will not be a good thing either from the point of view of the Land Commission or the county council. There is a very close connection, as I pointed out before, between the work of maintenance and the work of reconstruction. If the reconstruction work is badly carried out, there will be need for additional maintenance work; if the maintenance work is badly carried out, it will give rise to the necessity for reconstruction work.  To my mind, if for any reason there is to be a transfer of any portion of this work, then I think all of it should go together.  I believe that both the reconstruction and the maintenance work should be carried out by the one authority.  If, for any reason, it should be transferred from the Land Commission, then I think it should go to the Board of Works where it would be all handled by the one body and where there would be no question of divided responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very big question.  What happens in practice is that the Land Commission does the work in the first instance.  It puts the embankments right and then hands them over to the county councils for maintenance.  The Land Commission, to start with, is not a permanent body, and its functions are not to go on for ever.  Deputy Wall urges that if there is to be any transfer of the work it should be to the Board of Works.  What we are doing here in connection with these embankments is exactly what is being done under the Drainage Maintenance Acts in respect of drainage maintenance.  A good deal of the initial work is done by the Board of Works and then the river, or in this case the embankment, is handed over to the county council.  Their function is simply to do a certain amount of work in keeping the embankment in repair. Once the original embankment is put right it is simple enough to maintain it.  Of course what happens in practice, in the case of some embankments which are neglected&mdash;especially embankments along the seashore&mdash;is that heavy seas break through because of neglect in attending to their repair and knock down the whole embankment. It then becomes no longer a question of maintenance but a question of construction.  That was the position when tenants were responsible for the maintenance of the embankments. They neglected the work, a breach came in the embankment and suddenly the problem changed from being one of maintenance to one of construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the embankments are going to be put right for them, and it will be only a question of maintenance.  Very little maintenance will be necessary every year.  The county councils have the means for doing that work.  They have county surveyors, men with engineering experience, and the power to stike a rate.  They can strike a rate on the people who benefit by the maintenance. It will be a simple matter for the county councils to do this work. They are responsible for doing the roads, and also the drainage work on the rivers in connection with the Drainage Maintenance Acts.  It will be a simple matter for them to arrange to <Col N="274" /> do this maintenance work in connection with the embankments.  If it is wrong that they should do that, then the whole principle underlying the Drainage Maintenance Acts is wrong.  Of course I realise the difficulties that are peculiar to places like Waterford and other counties that touch the sea, where very heavy embankment work has to be done.  A very big question is involved as regards places of that kind. It may be that ultimately these embankments will have to be taken over by a central authority.  As regards the other cases, the county councils are quite competent to maintain any schemes that are handed over to them. I am willing to admit that the question of embankments on the seashore may have to be considered.</P>

      <P>I do not know, but we will see how the county councils will handle them.  They have a number of schemes now to look after.  This may be a bigger problem than I am aware of.  I do not know much about the problem personally, but we are doing here what has been done under the Drainage Maintenance Acts, and we certainly should not take up the line that the underlying principle of these Acts is all wrong until at least it has been tried out a bit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NocholasWall" hpid="Mr. WALL Mr. WALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite see the Minister's point of view in connection with this. He has been reasonable enough to discuss the matter very fully with me, but even yet, I am not in agreement with him.  I think he is right when he says that he does not appreciate the seriousness of the problem.  I think, as a matter of fact, that very few people do, except those who have had actual experience of the work.  There is really no parallel between maintenance in connection with drainage work and the maintenance and construction of embankments, and for this reason: that if there is a necessity for doing maintenance work on drains it does not make any material difference if it is not done for a period of six months.  In the other case, the effect of a delay of 24 hours <Col N="275" /> in doing some necessary maintenance work may possibly involve an expenditure of £1,000.  That is the serious side of the question as I see it.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I think it will involve additional professional men in the county council, because I understand that the surveyors and engineers in the county councils throughout Ireland have their time fully occupied already, and it will mean that you will have two sets of officials for the work, one in Dublin and another in the country.  This is work in connection with embankment. Take Kerry, for example, which is a rather poor county.  For the ten years from March, 1916, to March, 1926, the cost of embankments in Kerry was £22,648, rather a big sum, and that sum might be increased, even doubled, under certain circumstances in particularly bad weather.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude and to hold this matter over until the Report Stage. In the meantime, he may be able to make further inquiries into the matter and to see eye to eye with us.</P>

      <P>Section 21 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 22.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the Land Commission shall have declared that untenanted land situate outside a congested districts county is required for the purpose of relieving congestion or of facilitating <Col N="276" /> the resale of tenanted land, or that any land wherever situate which was excluded from the operation of sub-section (1) of Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923, by sub-section (2) of that section is required for the purpose of relieving congestion, or shall have commenced proceedings to resume the whole or part of a retained holding, and the price or compensation has been fixed by the Judicial Commissioner, the Land Commission, if they consider that the price fixed is such as to make the purchase of the land or the resumption of the holding or part thereof inexpedient, may, on serving notice within such time as may be prescribed, withdraw from the purchase or resumption on such terms as to costs as the Judicial Commissioner may determine.</P>
    <P>The following amendment, in the name of Deputy Cooper, was agreed to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>29a.&mdash;In line 58, after the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;at any time after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>29b.&mdash;In line 63, after the word &ldquo;resumption&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;on paying to the owner or tenant, as the case may be, such sum as the Judicial Commissioner shall fix as, and for compensation as and for any loss in respect of the income ordinarily derived from, or any depreciation in the capital value of such lands or holding which he may have suffered or sustained in consequence of such declaration by the Land Commission and.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 22 is very drastic, and it gives power to the Land Commission, which proposes to acquire land, to inspect and then if, after the final hearing by the Judicial Commissioner, the Land Commission considers the price for the land too high the land is thrown back on the owner's hands.  That is a procedure that must inevitably entail considerable loss on the land owner.  It is a procedure to begin with undoubtedly which limits his power of sale. No man can sell land if a preliminary notice or an inspection is made.  It limits his power of using the land to <Col N="277" /> the best of its value.  I know after notice of acquisition by the Land Commission he can go on using his land in a normal manner, but in practice no man dares take the risk.  A man with his land in dread of acquisition by the Land Commission would not dare to put his land to any good.  No man in such a case would dare to put a lot of in-calf heifers in, or till or stock land to the full capacity.  The purpose of this amendment is that the owner of such land, on which the Land Commission, after serving notice and giving a hearing as to prices, should receive not only some consideration as to his costs but should also receive some compensation for the fact that he has not been able to use his land to its utmost value. I think it is reasonable.  After all, what is the court which decides the value of the land?  It is the Judicial Commissioner of the Land Commission, an official of the Land Commission who is acting in a judicial capacity.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that he decides fairly, but the Land Commission brings a case to their own court and then they propose, by this section, if dissatisfied with the verdict of the Court, to annul it.  There is no possibility for the owner to say, &ldquo;I am dissatisfied with the price.&rdquo;  There is compulsion on the owner, but the Land Commission has taken the power to discontinue proceedings if the price is too high.  I think there should be compensation assessed by the Judicial Commissioner himself, who is not liable to assess an unreasonable or excessive compensation for the man whose enjoyment and use of the land have been unquestionably interfered with and who has suffered some material damage from the action of the Land Commission.  I do not think this is an excessive amendment. I think it touches a big point of principle and I commend it to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  Undoubtedly it seems improper that one party should have the power to discontinue proceedings, if not to start it, and put the other party into a different position from what it was at the time of the commencement of those proceedings. Undoubtedly when proceedings <Col N="278" /> are started to acquire land, as Deputy Cooper has said, the owner of the land will not treat that land in the way he would if there had been no proceedings. There have been cases drawn to my notice where proceedings have been started and the owner has then been notified that they are to be discontinued. In the meantime he has suffered considerable loss.  The proposal, as far as I understand it, is not that leave should not be given to discontinue proceedings, but rather that if proceedings are discontinued something in the nature of compensation should be given and that that compensation should be assessed by the Judicial Commissioner.  I think it is most reasonable, and I hope that the principle, at any rate, will be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, all land purchase limits a man's right to deal with his land as he likes, and the present position is that the Land Commission may acquire compulsorily all lands for the relief of congestion.  The right to sell and to get a good price are all limited.  This does not carry it much further.  When the Land Commission inspects, immediately after inspection it offers a price.  After six months the Judicial Commissioner intervenes unless the owner blocks it and uses the legal right he has to do so.  You picture the owner being unable to sell?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say first of all before ever the Land Commission intervened there were always Acts of Parliament which said that the Land Commission might acquire any land for the relief of congestion compulsorily, and in so far as you affect the owner's right to deal with his land you are not doing it any more than you affected it by the Land Act itself.  Further, this is not a new section. It was not invented by me.  I would like Deputy Redmond to know that.  This is not the first time it appears.  It is consecrated in every Land Act passed since 1907 and it has done no harm.  We find in practice that there was a really good reason for inserting it in the Evicted Tenants Act of 1907, the Irish Land Settlement (Soldiers and Sailors) Act, 1919, and other Acts.  We find in practice that it was right.  All we are doing is to make <Col N="279" /> the Land Act, 1923, conform to other Acts put through in another parliament. They did not do any hardship.  Why should this do any?  So far as compensation is concerned the owner has the use of land; he is not interfered with as user in the sale.  Interference is always there to some extent by the mere passage of the Land Acts, and in so far as it is accentuated the particular state of affairs only lasts for a few months, but he has the full use of the land for the whole time and I do not think compensation is called for.  As Deputies know, the question of costs is for the Judicial Commissioner, who will undoubtedly do the fair thing, and the fairest way to deal with the question is to leave it to the discretion of the High Court Judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I make a suggestion to the Minister?  As has been pointed out, this section does seem a little one-sided.  Perhaps as a concession we might give the owner the right to object to the withdrawal and give grounds for his objection.  If he can prove to the Judicial Commissioner that such grounds were reasonable such notice of withdrawal should be held to be void.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is: What is wrong with the provision inserted in the previous Land Acts of 1909 and 1919?  They did not work any hardship?  In fact in one of these, I think it was the 1919 Act, there is no provision at all for costs.  They withdraw simpliciter and the landlord gets no costs.  We go one better from the landlord's point of view and we insert a provision for costs and leave it to the Judicial Commissioner to say whether costs should be given.</P>

What are the Minister's precedents? <Col N="280" /> The Evicted Tenants Act of 1907.  That was an Act covering a comparatively small area.  I am not familiar with its working, but I am sure it was not successful, or we should not have the lengthy discussion we had this afternoon.  The other was the Soldiers and Sailors Land Trust Settlement Act of 1919.  If there has ever been an Act that worked worse than that Act and caused more general dissatisfaction and discontent, I have yet to know of it.</P>

      <P>I am opposing the motion that this section, as amended&mdash; even though one of my amendments was accepted&mdash;should stand part of the Bill, on the grounds that I have already stated.  It is an utterly one-sided provision. The precedents given by the Minister do not impress me.  I think this is calculated to inflict great hardship and inconvenience on owners of land.  The precedents quoted by the Minister dealt with comparatively small areas.  The areas of land acquired under the Soldiers and Sailors Land Trust Settlement Act were very limited&mdash;areas for housing, not for farming.  In any town you will hardly find more than four or five acres taken. In the same way the Evicted Tenants Act of 1907 would only apply to certain limited specified areas, and such precedents are of no value in bringing in an Act dealing with the whole State. The Minister said that the Land Commission had power to take all land. That is quite true.  That is the provision in the Act of 1923.  The working of that provision has been very disastrous to the farmer, because it has curtailed his credit, as the banks will not advance money on a restricted credit because of the existence of that provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the farmer is concerned, he must get the resumption price for his land, so that he is in the position he was in since 1881.  If the Land Commission acquire tenanted land we must give the resumption price for it.  With regard to purchased land, if the Land Commission acquire purchased land, held in fee simple subject to a land purchase annuity, they must give an equally suitable and not less valuable holding elsewhere to the owner.  The effect of the two provisions, so far from interfering with the farmer's credit, is to improve it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not made that clear until this moment. I wish he would address the Dublin Chamber of Commerce or some of the other bodies interested in the provision of credit to farmers in order to make that point clear, because there are apprehensions which exist.  Unfortunately, there are people who very often read a section of an Act that concerns them without reading the qualifying section. The provision of Section 24 of the Act of 1923 has given rise to such apprehensions, and this provision in Section 22 of this Bill will intensify those apprehensions. It is a good thing we have been able to get this question threshed <Col N="283" /> out and have been able to get the Minister to make that statement.  I am convinced that this is a one-sided proposition. It enables the Land Commission to put the owner of the land to great trouble and inconvenience and considerable expense, and then enables them to throw the land back on his hands if the verdict of their own judge goes against him.  I do not see how we could stand over a provision of that kind, and I ask the Dáil to reject it.</P>

      <P>There are some cases in which there have been annuities fixed by agreement that the land is unable to bear.  There has been a certain amount of collusion, and the Land Commission wants to be in a position to review cases of that sort.</P>

      <P>New section ordered to be added to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 31:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 23 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" />&ldquo;Where a holding subject to a judicial rent has since the date of the fixation of that rent deteriorated in value to any considerable extent as a result of causes outside the control of the tenant and where the tenant applies to the Land Commission and the Land Commission is satisfied that the completion of purchase of the holding in accordance with the provisions of Part I. of the First Schedule to the Act of 1923 would result in an annuity the capital value of which in the opinion of the Land Commission exceeds the security value of the land the Land Commission may make an order refusing to advance the purchase money for the holding and may thereupon fix the Standard Purchase Annuity in manner provided under the Land Act, 1923, for non-judicial holdings in accordance with Part II. of the First Schedule of the Land Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>This is founded on the same principle as the last amendment.  The idea of this amendment is that in a case where a tenant comes under the Land Purchase Act as a judicial tenant, and where his annuity has been fixed in accordance with the provisions of the Act at 30 or 35 per cent. reduction as the case may be, and where, owing to exceptional circumstances which are outside the control of the tenant, the land has deteriorated to such an extent as not to be security value for the capital sum advanced, that the tenant shall have the power to apply to the Land Commission and that the Land Commission shall have the power to fix the standard purchase annuity at a level which would be commensurate with the security value of the land.  I must confess that this amendment is put down, having in view one or two particular cases where the rent fixed a considerable time ago by the Land Courts is now found to be an uneconomic rent and the tenants at present are quite unable to pay it.</P>
    <P>There is a particular estate in the County Kerry&mdash;the Stoddard Estate&mdash; about which the Minister has some information, where it is generally acknowledged that owing to tidal flooding which must be regarded as entirely outside the control of the <Col N="285" /> tenants the land has deteriorated very much in value and the tenants are quite unable to pay the interest in lieu of rent pending the fixing of the annuities. I recognise there would be a considerable amount of difficulty in administering the Act if this amendment was incorporated in it but personally I cannot see any other way of dealing with similar cases.  I am open to correction if the Minister can persuade me that there is some other method of dealing with cases of that sort, but if there is not it seems to me that there is justification for this amendment.  If I understand the Act of 1923 the question of the security value of land, which has a judicial rent, does not enter into the case at all, the tenant automatically purchasing and the landlord automatically selling and it is taken that the land in all cases is security value.  If I am wrong in that and if the security value counts it seems to me if the present situation is to continue, tenants could not buy and the landlords cannot sell if the land was not security value.  If that were so it would be a most unfortunate condition of things to exist and I think there is some strong need for reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy suggested, there would be considerable difficulty in accepting this amendment. There is considerable difference between this amendment and the amendment accepted previously.  This deals with judicial rents fixed any time since 1881.  These are standard rents and were fixed having regard to the value of the land, prices, and all relevant circumstances and they were, therefore, fixed upon a definite basis and taking quality for quality of land, they approximate fairly closely.  Taking the circumstances into account, the quality of the land, the proximity to towns and all those other things that affect the value of land, all those judicial rents approximate fairly closely. Moreover, there are three classes of judicial rents.  You may have a rent fixed over the first fifteen years after 1881, then you may have rents fixed during the second fifteen year period and then you may have third term rents fixed.  And in that way the idea underlying the Land Act of 1923 was <Col N="286" /> that the judicial rents were standard rents that can be taken as a firm basis for reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this amendment were accepted it would mean that the Land Commission would have to reopen a very considerable number of judicial rents; they would have to set up a fair rent court. When dealing with non-judicial rents it is a different matter.  Everyone recognises that they varied, that they were, to some extent, not fixed upon any definite principle, that they were arbitrary. The tenant never went into court&mdash;it was an arrangement between himself and the landlord and a hundred and one irrelevant circumstances might have to be taken into account.  Some of those rents might be just as fair as the judicial rents, others not so fair; they were arbitrary.  You could not apply the same rule to them all.  We faced that and made an arrangement by which that rent is fixed by agreement between landlord and tenant, or the Land Commission comes in and fixes a new rent.  In the case of the judicial rent you have a standard rent there, and you can apply a general reduction to the whole lot with safety. The case Deputy Heffernan is thinking of is a case where the land was security for the rent at one period, but owing to deterioration is not security now. That gives rise to another and a different question.  I daresay there would be some cases, and the correct way to deal with them would be to deal with them through the Agricultural Credit Corporation, to provide sufficient facilities for the necessary improvement of the land.  The land has deteriorated, and consequently it is not a case of naturally bad land that cannot be improved. It is a case of land that was once security for the rent, and which has deteriorated, and the expenditure of a certain amount of money on drainage or on the treatment of the particular disease, whatever that disease might be, would bring back the land to its original state.  It is from that point of view it should be approached.  It would be fatal and it would be altering the whole basis of the Act of 1923, and doubling and re-doubling the work of the Land Commission.  It might be very unwise from the point of view of the tenants, <Col N="287" /> in many cases, because some judicial rents are extremely low.  If the Land Commission had power to increase annuities they would also have by implication the right to increase them.  If they considered that the reduction of 25 per cent. on the judicial rent was too low, in some cases, if they were able to vary rents at all, they would presumably be entitled to increase it.</P>
    <P>In equity that would have to be done. If you once admit that judicial rents have to be changed and varied on their merits, then the Land Commission must be fairly free to say what the merits of each case are.  It would be a great pity to depart from rents that have become fixed and standardised over long periods.  If there are cases, as I presume there are a few, where a holding has deteriorated, so that it is not security for the judicial rent.  I suggest that the right way to deal with them would be by way of a loan of some kind or by making credits available to improve the land.</P>

      <P>I want to call the Minister's attention to the fact that the Land Courts have hardly been working since pre-war days.  Practically no applications have been made for reduction of rents, the fixation of which took place during war time. There is no means of meeting the unusual deterioration that took place since then.  The suggestion that it should be met by credits is unsound, as, while the land might be improved, the owner would have to pay back by annual instalments the advance with interest, as well as paying the fair rent. I suggest that that is unsound from the <Col N="289" /> economic point of view.  I am keen on having something done for that particular class of tenant.  I am not satisfied with the Minister's statement.  I am sorry that the Deputy from Kerry concerned in the particular case I mentioned is not here.  I would like to hear his views on the matter.  I think an interesting point has been raised, and I would like to hear any other Deputy who has had experience of similar cases.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will see by the section that the Land Commission has power and I believe had in the past such power, when fixing the selling price of untenanted land in a congested area to bear a loss.  The new section goes a further step and says that in the case of a parcel <Col N="290" /> or a group of parcels of untenanted land, which means, I submit, land outside congested areas, the Land Commission is to have authority to bear a loss, which has not been definitely ascertained, and which must necessarily be met from the public purse.  I am not agreeable to the proposal that the State should bear a loss on untenanted land outside congested areas.  I agree that land in congested areas has no relation whatever to land in non-congested areas.  Remember it is not alone an amalgamation of a parcel or a group of parcels of untenanted land with a retained holding, or part of one.  The words are &ldquo;a parcel or a group of parcels of untenanted land or ...&rdquo;  The word used is &ldquo;or.&rdquo;  The loss is to be sustained by the State.  I submit the Minister has put forward no justification for that proposal and, while maintaining an open mind.  I submit we ought not to admit the principle the Minister is seeking to incorporate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission found, in the course of their administration of the Act, that for one reason or another they were able to buy some estates particularly cheaply, and that, on the other hand, they had to give what they regarded as more than a fair price for some other estates.  The reason for that is that, in a great many cases, it is easy enough to buy encumbered land.  But it is very difficult to do equity when you are dealing with an estate with a lot of encumbrances on it. There may be institutions or individuals getting rents out of the land, or they may have charges on the land. When a judge is faced with an estate on which there are encumbrances&mdash; charges of one kind or another&mdash;and when he has to fix a price and take into account, at the same time, that that price must cover something for the owner and something for the encumbrancers, the people and institutions who lent money, the people entitled to something under a family settlement, and so on, he finds that to do the fair thing he must give a bit more for the land than he would like to give if he were to take into account solely the tenants who are getting it.  It is easy to be logical in respect of all that and <Col N="291" /> to say &ldquo;The Land Commission should deal with this matter in a cold, impersonal way and give a price for the land at which they can resell it, and no more.&rdquo;  But I am surprised that Deputy Hogan should take that view. If it were another Deputy who raised the question, I would not be surprised. The Land Judge has to take into account not only the interests of the tenants but the interests of the occupying owner and the interests of the encumbrancers, and in some cases he sees, with the best will in the world, that he has to give somewhat more than he would give if there were no encumbrancers. There are other cases where the same results ensue for different reasons.  I have quoted only one case. There are many cases like that.  To make a long story short, if you are buying something like £300,000 or £400,000 worth of land per annum, the ultimate amount running into millions, you will find that at times you can get land very cheaply and at other times that you have to pay a little more than you would like to pay if you were to take into account only the interests of the tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another consideration which affects that problem, which I should like to bring to the notice of Deputies. Lands are bought that are very valuable as accommodation lands or very valuable because of location, being near a town, or for one reason or another. There has been a considerable income out of them for a long time and the Land Judge has to purchase those lands, and to purchase them within the limits of a section in the Land Act of 1923, which says that the price is to be a fair price for the owner and for the Land Commission.  In that state of affairs he finds it very difficult indeed to fix a price which resolves the dilemma&mdash;which is, in fact, a fair price for the owner and for the Land Commission, the Land Commissioners in that case being really the tenants. There is one obvious way out of the difficulty.  The fair thing to do is, so to speak, to bulk estates&mdash;to combine the cheap with the dear estate and to spread the price over them.  I see nothing whatever inequitable in that. Land purchase should be made, as far <Col N="292" /> as possible, fair all round and on no principle of administration can I see any special reason for giving specially good terms, obtained by accident, to a certain number of tenants.  It is better to give fair annuities to all than to do some extremely well and to do others anything but extremely well.  When the Land Commission buys an estate which is cheap they can always amalgamate it with an estate which is dear, spread the price evenly over them, and then they get something like a fair annuity.  But that does not meet the case at times.  At times it is not convenient to do it, and we have found, within the last two or three years, that in odd cases we had to sell land on an annuity which we would like to see a little lower.  That section is put in to place us in a position to remedy that. I do not know any better way out of it.  You are up against a dilemma, and if this be not done you have got to do injustice to one party or the other. Recognise, at all events, that you are in a dilemma; there is no use in being dogmatic or chopping logic about it. We buy land from comparatively poor people as well as from rich people.  They must get fair play.  We are in a dilemma; if we do justice to the tenants we are doing injustice to the owner.  That section is put in to meet the case.</P>
    <P>I said nothing about the case where you want to buy land which is subject to a land purchase annuity, or tenanted land.  In those cases, we are constantly in a dilemma.  Where you buy tenanted land you have to give resumption price. You have to give the tenant at least the price secured to him by the Act of 1881.  &ldquo;Resumption price&rdquo; is practically the market value.  In addition you have to buy the landlord's interest. When you add the two and take the total sum you have an amount at which you cannot sell the lands without joining them up with other lands that you bought cheaply and selling the whole at a flat rate.  The same thing applies in cases where we are anxious to buy purchased land&mdash;land subject to a land purchase annuity.  As a rule you endeavour to buy that on the lines of exchanging the holding and giving a no less valuable holding to the owner elsewhere. <Col N="293" /> At times, that is not convenient.</P>
    <P>The man would prefer to get the price.  The Land Commission finds sometimes that they cannot give him the money&mdash;at least anything that would pay him.  There is an annuity on a holding, say, of 200 acres.  The Land Commission pay £2,500, and it might take £2,000 to redeem the annuity. In that case, the owner has £500 for himself.  He would rather take the money.  It would suit the Land Commission better to give him the money instead of giving him a holding elsewhere, because land is short.  Yet, they cannot do that because of the necessity for redeeming the annuity. Those are the reasons which impelled us, after two or three years' administration, to ask the Dáil for the powers sought in this section.  If the Deputy's amendment were agreed to, it would take all the good out of it.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement has disarmed my hostility to a great extent.  I should like to point out, however, that, on the Second Reading of this Bill, I drew attention to the fact that the Land Commission had bought land at prices far above those at which it could be set at economic rents to the tenants.  I took exception to what I considered was speculation on the part of the Land Commission&mdash; buying land on a falling market when agricultural prices were tumbling down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While I am with the Minister in his view that the land should not be sold at an excessive price to the incoming tenant&mdash;we do not want to keep these men in a state of pauperism all their days&mdash;this provision is not alone retrospective, but it is to continue for a definite period.  I am with the Minister in his statement that you have often to &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; land, but I do say that this opens up possibilities which are very grave and which should be avoided.  Land might be bought, not <Col N="294" /> necessarily under the present Minister, but under some Minister in the future, regardless of the public purse.  Although the Minister for Finance may have a say in it you are, nevertheless, putting a burden on the public.  Since the land question in this country has not been made a social question, as it ought to be, apart and remote from politics, but is a political question, I do think these words, &ldquo;or a group of parcels,&rdquo; give rise to a dangerous possibility.  I am not disposed to press the amendment if I get an assurance from the Minister that the powers being given to the Land Commission will be used sparingly and with great circumspection.</P>

      <P>Deputies who read this section must realise the very severe and penal legislation which is contained in sub-section (3) as affecting many persons in the Saorstát.  I direct the attention of Deputies to that particular sub-section. It is true that in the Act passed last year, the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Act, a section more or less similar to this was introduced.  At that time very strong exception was taken here and in the Seanad to the provision.  The principle behind it is that the sheriff can go upon any land in respect of which a land purchase annuity is owing and can take anything off that land no matter who owns the property found there.  The sheriff can take it away even though he knows that it is not the property of the debtor, and he can sell it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As some sort of recompense, the party detrimentally affected has the right to sue the Land Commission's debtor.  That is more an apparent right than a real right.  The old privilege by which a man, if any of his stock or implements were found on another man's premises and the sheriff seized <Col N="299" /> them because the man on whose premises they were seized was a debtor, could by affidavit before a magistrate recover his goods, ought not lightly be abandoned.  The present procedure is going to inflict great hardship and it is going to create an element of distrust in the country.  How can anyone lend even a farm implement to another man if, without his knowledge, the under-sheriff can come along and seize it in respect of a land purchase annuity?</P>

      <P>Yes, or rates.  You will find this is not going to help towards the principle of co-operation. Is this the Minister's construction of co-operation&mdash;to give this power to the sheriff and to deny, except by fiction, the injured party adequate redress and subject him to considerable inconvenience and trouble?  Apart from that objection, one has to think of the existing conditions in regard to agriculture.  We have here a number of sections all dealing with the same principle, the more expeditious recovery of Land Purchase Annuities, and these are put forward entirely ignoring and forgetful of the extreme distress prevailing. I am with the Land Commission in recovering the Land Purchase Annuities.  I would, however, prefer that they be recovered by a system which would be quite as effective but not so harsh and not so injurious on third parties.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not on any occasion proved that the previous existing law had broken down, that it was ineffective and failed to achieve its primary object as between the State and the debtor. The Minister has not made that case and I should like him to.  The Land Commission are requesting the Oireachtas to give them extraordinary powers to collect Land Purchase Annuities.  And what follows?  Merely that they may be handed over to Great Britain in respect of some agreement, some secret arrangement which has never come before the House and has never been ratified.  They want to put our people under the harrow for the purposes of the collection.</P>

      <P>I am putting it forward as one reason why the House should not agree to the proposals enshrined in the Bill.  We ought to take cognizance of the poverty of our people and we ought to refuse anything in the nature of extraordinary powers to the Land Commission to collect annuities. They have the normal procedure of law, which remains in effect even if these penal sections are defeated.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the primary interests of our people, having regard to the acute distress amongst the agricultural community, which I fear will not be relieved for a considerable time, and in view also of the fact, in many cases, of the great mortality in their livestock suffered by the people, I am opposing this.  As yet, no adequate system of relief has been put up by the Government to meet the loss caused by this mortality in livestock.</P>
      <P>I hold that we ought not to give way to the panic legislation the Minister calls for.  To do so is not in the best interests of the community, and it is certainly striking a very severe blow at these farmers who are down and out. We might as well say that we are voting for the wholesale eviction of the farmers.  They are to be crushed out under the penal sections of this Bill. I challenge a division on this Bill, and I ask the Committee not to give the extraordinary powers that the Minister is seeking.  In the normal circumstances of the people they are not needed, but we are asked to establish them now in perpetuity.</P>

      <P>I am going to support Deputy Connor Hogan in this amendment.  On the occasion of the passing of the Occasional Powers Act, I took advantage of the opportunity on the first occasion to oppose a similar section in the Bill that was then going through.  This is a sub-section of the same kind.  I would oppose it altogether, apart from the question of the land annuities.  I think the tendency to safeguard the sheriff in every way is rather a dangerous one and is a growing one.

      <P>I say this, that there is really a growing danger in the country that the sheriff and his officers are going to act, and in many cases are acting, in a tyrannical manner to the people, backed up as the sheriff is by the legislation of this Chamber.  I think the first principle of legislation should be to protect the innocent citizen so that he could not, by action of the State, in any way suffer loss in his person or purse.  It is quite possible that an innocent person may suffer very considerable loss to his purse by this particular section.  I have in mind very definite and tangible evidence of the work done by a sheriff.  It is a case where a local small farmer in my neighbourhood was writted for £40 or £50. The sheriff's man came out there very coolly and, having walked into the land, seized stock.  He did not go to the trouble of finding out the boundaries of the farm, and so he quietly walked into my brother's farm and walked off with 40 sheep.  I happened to catch him before he got to the pound, and made him sorry.  The fact is that if these sheep had strayed into the farm of that debtor, and they had been taken by the sheriff and sold, we would have no redress except to sue the defendant in that particular case.  That is an instance of the hardship that this sub-section may do to the citizen.  It is up to the sheriff and his officials to find out if the stock on the farm belongs to the defendant in a particular case; he should take responsibility for the stock seized, and so assure himself of the facts.  Sheriffs are well paid, in salaries and in fees; they are, in fact, paid too much, and it is not unreasonable to expect that the sheriff should take responsibility for any stock or property that he may seize and which may not be the property of the owner of the <Col N="302" /> land.  There is a principle involved in this, apart altogether from the obligations of the Land Act, and I suggest to the Committee to support Deputy Connor Hogan on this amendment, that is, if it is not accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Yes, and so do the Farmers' Party.  It was, and it is no harm that they should now be reminded of it.  I am supporting Deputy Connor Hogan in his amendment to have this sub-section deleted from the Bill.  To my mind, it is undoubtedly a rank injustice to have such a provision as this in the Bill, whereby another man's property, a man who is in no way concerned with the debt, may be seized, and that he may be put to extraordinary trouble and cost in trying to recover from somebody from whom he may not be able to recover.  Surely that is not in accordance with fair play or justice.  I have in my mind instances of cases where this sub-section will work out very harshly.  Take the case where a man takes grazing of a farm.  He pays in advance, as is the <Col N="303" /> case sometimes.  He then puts his stock on the land.  He knows nothing about the particular circumstances of the man on whose land he has placed his stock, and that man fails to pay his annuity. What happens?  The sheriff comes along and seizes the cattle, the cattle of a man who has no connection with the debtor.  The only remedy the man has in that case is to proceed against the debtor, who may have no means and who may be no mark.  I hold that that is fundamentally wrong, and that there is no justification for it.  It is the sheriff's duty to recover the debt from the man who owes the debt, and not from somebody else whose cattle either accidentally or otherwise may happen to be on the man's premises or farm at a given time.  There may be cases of evasion, where a debtor may be able to evade payment of a debt, but it ought to be up to the sheriff to exercise his judgment in such cases, and where it is clear and definite that the stock seized does not belong to the debtor, then an action should lie against the sheriff, as has been always the case in the past.  This sub-section should be deleted from the Bill.  It is unfair and unjust and fundamentally wrong.</P>

    <P>I desire to protest emphatically against this attempt to create a reign of terror amongst the farming population, because that is what it amounts to.  It is an attempt to create a reign of terror amongst people who are unable to recover their economic stability and who suffered a series of disasters from many causes.  This attempt to make the sheriff the high priest of our administration is a thing we should not tolerate.  He should be amenable for his actions in the ordinary way, and the Minister has made no case to prove that there is any need for this drastic legislation.  I know one particular case where an unfortunate widow cannot keep her children at home owing to the fear of the sheriff coming, because he came once.  They clear away every night through the <Col N="304" /> country.  Does the Minister not see that that state of terror is going to be created through the country?</P>

This is an attempt to prevent all people who have suffered losses from recovering economically, and the Minister knows it.  Rather than seek drastic powers he should use the ordinary law.  The ordinary law has not broken down.  It is very well able to meet the position at the moment, and instead of seeking drastic powers the Minister ought to make a survey of the agricultural conditions in some districts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it this way: It is alleged that this will shake security and stability.  It will not. But what is going to cause insecurity and instability are the suggestions that have been made in connection with this section.  Let us see what is in all this talk about insecurity and instability. One would imagine that there was no similar provision in respect of any other debt.  There is.  I do not want Deputies to be deceived about this, because there are Deputies who do not know the country very well, do not know how the various processes of the law go on, and just what reactions they have through the countryside.  At the present moment this section is the law of the land in respect of rates, and has been for generations, and did it ever cause insecurity and instability? Were Deputy Heffernan's sheep ever seized for the neighbours' rates?  Why have not all these evils that Deputies foresee, when we extend these powers to the sheriff in respect of Land Commission annuities, shown themselves for the last twenty or thirty years, considering that the rate collector is seizing for rates, and, I may say, that seizures for income tax are made under exactly similar legislation?  Now, this is the acid test.  After all, do Deputies want Land Commission annuities to be collected?  If they do, there is no use in saying that the people are not able to pay.  That is another way of saying that they do not want them collected. The case that the people are not able to pay should be put up in another way; Deputies should state expressly that Land Commission annuities should not be collected.  We would know where we stood then.  But when you <Col N="306" /> say in one breath: &ldquo;Of course I am anxious to collect Land Commission annuities,&rdquo; and in another: &ldquo;People are not able to pay,&rdquo; what do you mean?  Do you mean that the Collection Department should stop operating and that annuities should not be collected?  No one will frankly take that attitude.</P>
      <P>If they are to collect Land Commission annuities why should not the sheriff have the same powers in respect to them as in respect to rates? You might ask: &ldquo;Why should he not have the same powers in regard to every other debt?&rdquo;  We are in an absolutely illogical position about this, because arrears of Land Commission annuities are, in fact, arrears of rates. I hear it alleged that the rates are very high in certain counties, such as Clare, Galway and Limerick.</P>
      <P>Is not this partly the reason?  Could you be doing a better service to the small farmer who is endeavouring to pay his rates in these counties than by relieving him of the painful and costly luxury of paying his neighbours' as well?  Why is it that this has not caused any hardship with regard to rates?  For the simple reason that no one ever dreams of taking land until he gets the rate receipt.  If I am going to take land the first thing I ask is: &ldquo;Are the rates cleared?&rdquo;&mdash;and if they are not cleared I make sure that I will not pay the rent without paying the rates first.  There is no difficulty about it, and it works out perfectly&mdash;never any hardship and never any trouble. The first thing a solicitor, who has ever acted for anybody wanting to take land, asks for is the rate receipts.  If he does not get them he advises his client to hold a certain amount of the money and pay the rates, and the ordinary man who is taking land knows the law well enough.  How many cases have occurred in County Clare, in the past or under present circumstances, where other people's property has been seized for rates?  Very few, and in these few cases the men knew that they were deliberately taking a risk.</P>

      <P>The rate collector is the first person to seize stock on the land, no matter who owns it, and there is never any trouble.  Do Deputies allege that exactly the same thing will not occur in regard to land purchase annuities?  I say, from my experience of the collection branch, and from my knowledge of certain counties, that this provision is vital, and I know that in certain counties during the last three months arrears of annuities have come in sufficient to reduce the figure in these places by, say, ten or fifteen per cent. as a result of this section. Remember that this Bill has been before the Dáil for a long time.  This section is known throughout the country, and I know, of my own knowledge, of counties in the West and elsewhere, that annuities have come in because of the threat of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is said that this is going to lead to instability, that no one will know where he is.  On the contrary.  At the moment a mortgagee is in a most unsatisfactory position. No matter how old his mortgage is the Land Commission annuities may be accumulating, and they have a prior charge.  What we need is to go back, as far as possible, to the cash basis, and the best service you can do to mortgagees, and the best service you can do to shopkeepers and everybody else&mdash;it may mean a wrench at the moment, but it will be a very slight one&mdash;is to bring about the state of affairs where this particular mortgage, which has a priority over all other mortgages, will not be accumulating and increasing every year.  No shopkeeper knows where he is now.  If this were in operation, if you had the collection up-to-date, you would do more to reestablish the credit of the small farmer than you could by any other means. To my mind this section is vital.  It will do no injury whatever.  It will re-establish the security of the small farmer's holding to a great extent.  It <Col N="308" /> will put him in a better position to borrow, and it will lower the rates.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the point of view of people who complain of high rates, who have a good deal of pity for the farmer who has to pay direct taxation in the way of high rates, but who, at the same time, will not take this obviously right step for the purpose of saving the rates from the large number of people who, whatever their circumstances may be, do not want to pay until they are forced to pay, and there are a considerable number of people like that.</P>
      <P>There are a considerable number of people who will not pay their rates if they think they can get away with it. The same applies to Land Purchase Annuities.  The mere threat of this has already had a most salutary effect. It has made the wheels go round.  You will not have a healthy state of affairs in this country until people realise that they must pay their debts.  If the small farmer realises that he must pay his debts he, in turn, will make his debtors pay him; he, in turn, will look after the shopkeeper's pass-book.  You will have complete co-operation through the country to get us back to the cash basis that is needed so badly.  At present the country is run on credit to the extent of 20 per cent.  Until we get to a cash basis and get rid of this slovenly system the country will not be what it should be.  I am in a position to keep my hand on the pulse, so to speak, of the country; I am in a position to know the conditions in my own county, and I know from the Collection Branch and from auctioneers and solicitors the conditions under which land has been set, and the mere threat of this section has been more than salutary.  I regard it as absolutely vital.</P>

But we know the condition of the country.  It may be true that there are a number of annuitants who refuse to pay for some reason, perhaps because some of them are not honest.  But there are great numbers of annuitants who are not able to pay and who are honest; the Minister knows that, and so does everybody on the Government Benches.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Minister's experience is in regard to collection of rates.  My experience up to the present is that the rate collector in practically all cases takes the defaulting ratepayers to the court, and even the threat of the court, if the money is there, will make it forthcoming. If the value is not there the rate collector knows enough of the conditions to know it is no use taking the defaulter to the court.  I have a great number of cases before my mind during the last couple of months where rate collectors had to stump up for men who had not paid their rates.  No compensation is paid if a man is not able to pay, because his lands are unstocked.</P>

      <P>He will not seize it. But if there were men in the district prepared to help an annuitant to live by giving him some contribution for the service of the land, owing to the very desperate conditions that exist in many districts&mdash;because the State did nothing for these people who wanted help so badly&mdash;the sheriff takes away the man's stock without trying to discover who owns it.  He does not try to discover whether the annuitant is an <Col N="311" /> honest man, who is not paying his rates simply because misfortune has come upon him, or is the type of man that some people are always prepared to cast up in this House&mdash;a rogue.  If the Minister tells us that there are as many dishonest people in the country as he tries to make us believe, there is very little future for the country, and I think that legislation based on the assumption that there are so many dishonest people is very unsound.  No matter what the Minister says, there is nobody who wants to make a plea for the dishonest man, but at the same time, in order that there may be a chance to get at the dishonest man we are not prepared to confer powers which will be used mercilessly against the honest man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I understand this point.  It is one in connection with Bills that were before the House two or three years ago which I had to consider and discuss at some length.  Deputy Baxter puts the dilemma to the Minister and to the Government: Turn out a section which will discriminate between the person he chooses to call an honest man, the person who cannot pay, as he puts it, and the dishonest man who can pay but will not.  The Deputy knew he was quite safe in making that offer, because he knew that the Parliamentary draughtsman never drew breath in any State who could turn out a section of that kind.  &ldquo;The devil himself,&rdquo; as some judge remarked from the Bench, &ldquo;knoweth not the mind of man,&rdquo; and this question of the honest and dishonest man is not practical politics, it is not practical legislation.  What it comes to is this: The Deputy's plea is that the man who cares to set his land need never pay his land annuity, and he can have his neighbour salted in rates because of his default.  He is to be free to have the user of his land by setting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He can set, year in, year out, and make money from it, but he need never pay, because there is nothing seizable. The stock on the land is not his, and so the default mounts up in the county and the ratepayers are salted in rates for the default of the land annuitant. <Col N="312" /> The provision exists, as the Minister said with regard to rates, that stock on the land is assumed to be the stock of the owner of that land.  The rate collector may take the stock that is on the land in quittance of rates, and the net result of that is that people are cautious, that people do not put grazing stock on land without ascertaining whether the rates are paid or not. What does that effect?  That effects this: that the man who wants to set his land pays his rates and if he cannot pay out of his own pocket he sees the rates are paid out of the rent, because otherwise the stock that goes to graze those lands is in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan talked about innocent citizens.  There may be some innocent citizens, but I doubt if there are any citizens so innocent as not to see the dilemma that it is sought to put the under-sheriff in in this matter.  A man owes land annuities and will not pay. He has, perhaps, read Deputy Connor Hogan's speech in the Official Report, and he will not pay his land annuities to England, as the Deputy said.  The under-sheriff in due course comes along; he goes out to that farm to seize. He makes for the speckled heifer.  He is told: &ldquo;Do not touch that, that is not mine; it belongs to my brother-in-law.&rdquo; He is paying 5/- or 10/-, or whatever the grazing rate is, and the under-sheriff is up against the problem of rebutting that statement of the man that that heifer or that the bullock is not his.  The thing is absurd.</P>
    <P>If one cannot take stock present on the land as being the property of the owner of the land, if stock cannot be treated as the property of the owner of the land, then in fact there can be no seizure of stock&mdash;and that is what some Deputies are aiming for&mdash;because it would not be within the wit of any under-sheriff in any county in the State to rebut a statement that a particular bullock or heifer, or a half-dozen particular sheep, was not the property of the owner, that they belonged to his uncle, his cousin, or his brother-in-law. Do not tell me that even in Clare a farmer would not strain things to the extent of saying that half a dozen sheep were his uncle's rather than his own if he were going to have his property by making that statement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> Deputies who are not farmers and who have not a knowledge of rural Ireland and agricultural conditions must try to put themselves into the position of an under-sheriff with a decree for land annuities in hand. They must fancy that man driving out fifteen or twenty miles from his base to a particular farm, going into a field, seeing stock there, being met by the owner&mdash;the word has passed round&mdash; and the owner has simply to say, &ldquo;That is my cousin John's,&rdquo; and the under-sheriff must drive away.  Might we not as decently write into our Bill that livestock shall not be seizable in quittance of land annuity decrees as to allow a situation of that kind to exist? Surely, we must say in respect of land annuities, as we have said long since in respect of rates, that where there is default in respect of land annuities as in respect of rates, the stock on that land shall be liable to seizure in respect of deficiency.  Then you will create the same position that exists in respect of rates; people will not take lands on letting or on grazing until they are well satisfied that the land annuities, as well as the rates, have been cleared in respect of that land.  That is what we want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this section from the point of view of the third party.  We have heard about the defaulter who is a wilful defaulter and who sets his land, or who allows stock to go up on his land and receives payment for such.  I desire to draw the attention of the Dáil to the drastic nature of this sub-section, as at present drafted.  Under the sub-section, the Sheriff may seize goods, including stock upon the land, and even if that stock does not belong to the owner of the land, the remedy proposed for the actual owner of the stock is that he shall have a right of action against the owner of the land.  Let me give a case in point.  This is a case that occurred some time ago in County Wicklow, and the facts are shortly these.  There were two farms adjoining one another, and the occupier of one of them was in default as regards his payments.  The sheriff came along and discovered stock upon the farm.  He seized the <Col N="314" /> stock, assuming, as I submit, it was proper for him to assume, that the stock belonged to the owner of the farm, but when the real owner of the stock, who lived in the adjoining farm, heard of the seizure of these cattle he went down to the nearest village where the stock was impounded and had to pay £5 per head poundage to recover his stock.</P>
      <P>There were eight animals and it cost him £40 to recover them.  There was no letting contract between these farmers. The grazing rights were not set.  What actually occurred was that owing, perhaps, to the faulty construction of the fence, the stock belonging to the adjoining farmer wandered on the land of the defaulter and, because the sheriff had the right to seize any stock which he found on the farm, an innocent third party had to pay £40 to have his own stock recovered and restored to him.  He was told, when he asked for the return of the money he paid by way of poundage, that an action lay against the defaulting tenant, who in this case happened to be a man who had not a brass farthing, a man who was not actually a wilful defaulter but one who was not able to pay his annuities, and there are such people in the country.  Is that, I ask, not too drastic a procedure?  Would it not be possible to have a recoupment made in some way to an innocent third party, such as I have mentioned?  Why should he have to redeem stock which belonged to him, for which he was not under any grazing contract to have placed upon the adjoining farm, by which the actual defaulting tenant was not benefiting by way of payment, and which rightly belonged to the man himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is unfair.  I do not suggest that there should not be an assumption that stock found on a farm belongs to the owner of the farm.  I am not suggesting that.  That is an assumption which, I think, must lie in order to carry on the affairs of the country, but, if it is subsequently discovered that this stock did not belong to the owner of the farm, and, furthermore, that there was no contract by way of letting or grazing, and that it was not even with the acquiescence of <Col N="315" /> the defaulter that these cattle were there, and that he was benefiting in no way by it, I suggest that there should be some remedy for a third party other than the remedy suggested here, namely, that he should have the right of action at law against a person who in this case&mdash;and there may be others of a similar kind throughout the country&mdash;was no mark.</P>
    <P>The position in the case which I have instanced was that this third party was at a loss of £40 and had actually to pay poundage for stock belonging to himself which was on another man's farm and for which he had no contract whatever.  Viewing the matter from the point of view of a third party, I submit that in such a set of circumstances as I have stated&mdash;it is not a hypothetical case but is known to some Ministers, because I was the means of bringing it under their notice&mdash;this sub-section is too wide.  I suggest in a case like this, where it is subsequently discovered that the stock has been wrongfully seized, some other remedy should certainly be provided than that which is suggested here and which, in the case I mentioned, is no remedy at all.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that a census of the live stock mortality in the County of Clare between 1st October, 1923, and 30th April, 1925, inclusive, should be instituted by the Government forthwith, and the returns be completed not later than 30th April, 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this motion was put down I did not anticipate that it would take such a long time to reach the House and be debated.  If the motion were in substance agreeable to the Ministry I would not tie it down to the 30th April, for I recognise at this stage that would be too short a period.  However, that is a matter of detail.  This question of live stock mortality has not been raised for the first time to-night <Col N="316" /> in the House.  It has been raised at various times during the past few years.  I was, I think, the first to raise it in March, 1925, on the motion for the adjournment.  The question of immediate remedial measures was raised by Deputy Baxter in April or May, 1925.  At that stage the Minister proposed to establish credit societies, and Deputy Baxter, seeing the Ministry had got a move on, withdrew his motion. A subsequent stage arose upon the estimate of £100,000.  Then we were made fully aware of the Ministerial proposals, which many of us on this side of the House censured as being inadequate to meet the grave situation that existed.  The vote, however, was passed.</P>
    <P>In November, 1925, a motion again by Deputy Baxter, came before the House, the substance of which was that credit societies had failed to achieve their purpose.  To that an amendment was put down by Deputy Tierney asking the Dáil to re-affirm its faith in the Government proposals, and it was carried. The present motion is the outcome of a petition which was signed very extensively in County Clare within the last six weeks or two months.  There were about 5,500 or 6,000 signatories to the petition, but it happened that, according to the rules of the Dáil, such a petition could not be presented to the Dáil.  It cannot be out of order to read the contents of the petition.  It was couched in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Petition of Dáil electors resident in County Clare sheweth:&mdash;That the great majority of the inhabitants of this county are engaged in or dependent on agriculture in the form of the rearing of live stock and the sale of such stock and produce.  That the inhabitants aforesaid were and are grievously impoverished by the disturbed state of the county and of its environs between the years 1919 and 1923, by interference with fairs, markets, and means of communication, and by industrial unrest elsewhere, by high national and local taxation and by the great agricultural depression of 1921 onwards.  That, owing to the prolonged rain-fall in the years 1923 and 1924, vast numbers of cattle and sheep died <Col N="317" /> from liver fluke, tuberculosis and other obscure diseases, and their owners were often too poor to replace them, and in consequence are becoming unable to meet their obligations, to the great peril of this county and of its services.  Your petitioners pray that an official census of the numbers and value of the live stock which died between 1st October, 1923, and 30th April, 1925, be forthwith taken.  And your petitioners will ever pray.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit that the question of the mortality of live stock is one which ought to occupy the attention of the House.  It is not confined to Clare alone; a considerable number of the western and midland counties have also been affected.  This is a very important problem calling for prompt remedial measures.  The Government proposals never touched more than the fringe of the problem.  They never got down to close or scientific examination of the problem that presented itself, and never took steps to find out what the losses actually were.  We had various estimates put up to us based on incomplete figures, and it was on these returns that the remedial measures in the form of credit societies were based.  I submit that the first essential was a mortality census, the finding out of the number of persons and the districts affected by losses, and the extent of those losses as regards the different kinds of live stock.  That was not done, though requests came from various parts of the country to do so.  The Government deliberately set itself against entertaining such a proposal.  The Ministry was endeavouring to avert its face from the position that was created.  The Government have yet to recognise what a serious matter this question of live stock mortality has been, although two years have elapsed.  They have admitted that their own scheme of credit societies has broken down and failed to deal with the problem.</P>

      <P>The Minister continued, according to that report, &ldquo;And for that reason the Government would re-examine the conditions under which they would be financed.&rdquo;  If that conveys anything at all it means the Government were dissatisfied, and the Minister admitted it at Ballymote. The Minister gave us certain figures in this House which showed the extent of the mortality.  He said it represented a five per cent. loss throughout the length and breadth of the country.  We know that approximately the number of cattle of all ages is about 4,000,000, and that five per cent. loss on that number would be 200,000.  In addition there are upwards of 3,000,000 sheep in the country, but I am ignoring the mortality amongst them.  It would be no exaggeration to say that on an average one of these beasts would be worth £10, so that the total loss would amount to £2,000,000.  As a matter of fact, the loss was not evenly distributed over the country on the ratio of five per cent.  In some places, and I have given details in the House as regards that, the loss would extend to sixty per cent. and even upwards in certain areas. You have to go down to those areas and find out definitely the position of the people.  You cannot attempt to deal with a particular problem in a general way.  Every district has its own problems of more or less intensity.</P>
      <P>That is one of my objections to the Government.  It was fundamental in my opposition to the idea of credit societies which, I recognised frankly at the time, might meet a normal situation and would be useful, but as I declared at the time, it was absolutely unable to meet the crisis with which we were then faced in certain western counties.  I have here a letter received a couple of days ago from a man in a certain part of West Clare.  I will not give his name, but if necessary I can hand the letter to any Deputy who desires to see it.  The letter is dated the 19th March, 1927, and reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" />&ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;I respectfully submit my claim for the appalling loss suffered in consequence of fluke, and in doing so I wish to impress on you the necessity for immediate assistance. Otherwise, to be candid, I must apply for home assistance.  My plight, and the plight of my household, is miserable, trying to exist on a non-stocked farm and eke out an existence on a few lbs. of butter made weekly&mdash;1/- or 1/2 per lb. for that same, when my average weekly output should be from 100 to 130 lbs. Broken am I.  No longer is credit available.  All shops, etc., are shut against me.  This seems an exaggerated statement, but no, I could not describe our plight otherwise. In justice and honour I beg you where am I to exist if compensation is not paid forthwith?  Therefore, with confidence, I herewith submit my claim, begging of you to intercede on my behalf.  I have seen hard and bad times, but never have I had such a crushing blow.  Not in West Clare is a case more genuine for consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he continues on to detail the losses he has suffered.  He says he had 13 coming yearlings, which he values at £10 each; one 4 year old cow, valued at £25; one 1½ year old springer, in calf, valued at £20.  He had eleven strong store pigs and a thoroughbred boar.  At the moment I could scarcely realise that these pigs had died in consequence of fluke, but owing to the state of distress to which the man had been reduced it is quite conceivable that he could not, in shops or elsewhere, get credit to enable him to get food to keep the animals alive.  The man puts his total losses at £333.  I see no reason whatever to doubt the genuineness of that letter.  It came to me unsolicited. I have had many such letters, but unfortunately I have not been able to do anything for the writers of them.</P>
    <P>Within the last two years I have received numerous letters from every area in parts of County Clare from people detailing the losses they have sustained.  I am not alone in that.  The Clare County Council, some months ago, finding it difficult to maintain the organisation of their services and realising <Col N="320" /> the hapless and poverty-stricken condition of the county issued to their rate collectors a questionnaire seeking information on the following: (1) What was the extent of live stock mortality in your collection district between September, 1923, and April, 1925; (2) to what extent is the shortage of money due to that cause in your collection district?</P>
    <P>The replies received indicate the seriousness of the position.  In the Ballyvaughan No. 1 district, the rate collector answers the two questions by giving the figure of 20 per cent.  In Corofin the questions are answered: (1) by the figure 10 per cent., and (2) by 25 per cent.  In Ennis the first question is answered by 30 per cent., and the second by 40 per cent.</P>

      <P>Another rate collector in the Ennis district answered the first question by putting the figure at 40 per cent., and the second by the figure of 75 per cent.  A man in another part of the Ennis area seems to have been very careful, and to have gone to an extraordinary amount of trouble to find out the mortality amongst live stock.  He gives the figures of 10 per cent. for Clara; 5 per cent. for Dowra; 5 per cent. for Spancil Hill, and says that the shortage of money was due to that extent.  In the Ennistymon area the mortality is put at 25 per cent. amongst cattle, and 60 per cent. amongst sheep.  This collector says that the distress was practically 100 per cent. and that the shortage of money is due to the above causes.  I have a letter here which was received from a rate collector in the Miltown-Malbay area.  His letter is dated <Col N="321" /> 2/12/'26, and he says: &ldquo;I have made careful enquiries among the farmers all over my collection area and have taken lists of those who have lost their stock. I am giving the following reply to question 1: I think 20 per cent. would be a fair estimate.  With reference to question 2, it is rather difficult to give an estimate, but I must point out that a certain percentage is due to the fact that many farmers, especially with regard to sheep and young cattle, when the fluke visited their flocks, took the remaining healthy ones and disposed of them at any price rather than let them die.&rdquo;  In the Kildysart No. 2 district 80 per cent of the live stock are returned as having died in the period September, 1923, to April, 1925, and 90 per cent. of the shortage of money is stated to be due to that cause.</P>
      <P>In Kilrush the mortality is put at 70 per cent. and 80 per cent. of the shortage of the money as being due to that cause.  The rate collectors, who know their districts inside out, give you these returns, the figures varying from 10 per cent. to 70 per cent.  These men had no axe to grind, and there is no reason why they should exaggerate. They were asked to compile careful and accurate returns and they did so. In addition to those, the Clare County Board of Health sent down a circular asking the home assistance officer to give the name of the electoral division where the mortality of live stock was greatest; secondly, to state whether the resulting poverty led to a fresh class of applicant for home assistance; and thirdly, whether this burden was due to people who had lost stock or due to poverty and unemployment connected with the losses of others. Replies have been received, and I shall give one.  I take, for instance, this one from the home assistance officer in Kildysart district.  She answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to numbers two and three.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The resulting poverty has led to a fresh class of applicant for home assistance.  The burden is due both to people who have themselves lost stock and the poverty and unemployment consequent on the losses of others.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here is another one from the Kilmihill area, which was badly affected:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" />&ldquo;(1)  I beg to report that I made minute inquiries and found that the mortality of live stock in all parts of my district was appalling, comprising the parishes of Kilmihill, Kilmurry M`Mahon, Killimer, Knockerra, Cooraclare, and Kilrush.</P>
    <P>(2)  The resulting poverty led to a fresh class of applicant for home assistance, namely, the farm labourer.</P>
    <P>(3)  This burden on the rates is not due to people who had lost stock themselves, but due to the poverty and unemployment caused by their losses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to read every one of those, but I think I have established a case to show that the position in connection with live stock mortality in Clare has been very serious indeed.  I anticipated the criticism that it is rather late in the day to come forward with this Motion for a census, but I put it up to the Minister two years ago, and it is no fault of ours that the Motion has not been taken earlier. The fault lies elsewhere in putting up a petty scheme good enough for immediate poverty but not capable of dealing with such a crisis as that which we were faced with in many counties in Ireland.  Again, think of the amount of money put up to deal with this credit society&mdash;a petty £100,000 to deal with the losses of cattle and live stock.  The Government's own figures amount to 2,000,000.  I admit they are willing to give £2 for every £ subscribed locally; the original proposal was pound for pound.  You had £200,000 available for distress under the new scheme, which was held to be an advantage.</P>
    <P>The net sum is £150,000 which would then diminish the original one by 25 per cent.  The fact is that this sum is only playing with the question.  Then again how difficult it is to start even at the end of two years to deal with this provision; two valuable years have been lost.  Is it realised what a menace it is to the whole social system to leave land unstocked for a period of two years destroying the whole earning power of a community?  I may expect men will say land was not very profitable for the past two years and these people have not suffered a great loss. <Col N="323" /> It is fallacious to take the point of view of a return on capital.  The ordinary farmer works his land with unpaid family labour; he does not look for a return on capital or for payment for his time and service.  He is glad if he makes both ends meet.  In the absence of having his land stocked he has failed to secure that much.  He has had no earning power of any kind or at the best a very little earning power and remember his overhead charges were the same and are still accruing. His rates remain the same and his land purchase annuities remain the same. But because he had not live stock on his land he could earn less.  The return weekly or monthly from the residue of his live stock was not sufficient to make both ends meet and even now at the end of two years it is demonstrated that these credit society schemes have failed.  Anyone who could visualise the prospect felt that they were bound to fail and we are back again where we were two years ago.  We have to go over the same old grounds.</P>
    <P>I claim the first thing is to find out accurately what areas this mortality was heaviest in because you can lay down no hard and fast lines.  Every area will have to be taken on its merits, and will require treatment different, more or less in degree, from other areas and you will have to schedule those areas.  As to the expense of this thing it cannot be very much.  We have already a few checks.  The Gárda Síochána carry out a census of live stock and annual returns of crops once a year and even to that extent the existing returns are a check upon the returns of losses which the people may give in at the moment.  You have a further check.  You know the area of every man's home, and his poor law valuation.  You know his land purchase annuity, the character and the class of land it comprises and any practical farmer I claim can determine whether a man has many cattle.  If he is exaggerating his cattle it at once becomes apparent.  You have a further check.  If you tell a man that if he exaggerates his losses he will be denied relief it is a check.  I claim <Col N="324" /> people are not so bad as they are painted; they are quite willing to come forward and they do not want to exaggerate their losses.  Exaggeration of their losses reacts against their own interests.</P>
    <P>It does not do them any good to get their lands the reputation that they are unsound even in a season when lands were not sound.  It does not do for a man to say he has lost everything when it is well known that he did not, and that though his losses were heavy he did not lose a hundred per cent.  I submit the expense would be trifling, and the administrative side presents very little difficulty.  Even the President himself, when he visited Clare about the 30th May, 1925, was under the impression at first that Clare was not as badly affected as other counties. He even said that while a special case for treatment could be made out for Leitrim no such case could be made out for Clare.  But I understand he definitely modified his views before he left the county.</P>
    <P>This question is not brought forward as one of party tactics.  The question is so big and of such vital importance that no one would be foolish enough to bring it forward for party reasons or for political expediency.  We want to show that those people have lost their stock and have been unable to replace them, and that the credit society was not, of its very nature, able to meet the situation partly through lack of funds and partly by the proposal originally put up that the sufferers should take the initiative to relieve themselves by providing deposits.  In addition a high rate of interest had to be charged, five per cent. for the money from the credit society.  That is a pretty stiff rate of interest.</P>
    <P>I admit that the Government quite freely gave to those credit societies a loan of £100,000 for three years free of interest, but that did not reach the sufferer, who was obliged to pay to his credit society 5 per cent.  That in itself meant a very big difference even upon his borrowing.  It represented really very little less than the rate at which he could get money from a joint stock bank.  What is more, he could get the <Col N="325" /> money from such a bank without the investigation of his affairs locally, which is necessary in the other case. The credit society scheme was from its nature unable to meet the situation.  I submit that not alone to my own county, but to every county in the Saorstát, this is of primary importance. If we let the people sink into abject poverty&mdash;and you have lost two precious years&mdash;what is going to happen? The credit society scheme has failed, and I see no hope for it in the future. I submit that we must get back to fundamentals and find out where the losses were occasioned.  You have got to come down to something definite and find out where the loss was before you can think of a remedial scheme.  A remedial scheme must be dependent upon the conditions, good, bad or indifferent, in an area.  I claim that that is the first course of prudence, the first direct measure by which you can go to the assistance of those men.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies not to be bound by Party leanings, to look at things from the higher and national point of view, and realise that if this community sinks, as is only too evident, into hopeless poverty, the social services must break down.  You cannot maintain roads or hospitals or any social service. The position is daily getting worse.  I think I have sufficiently impressed the House with the position in County Clare.  I have not exaggerated it, and I say that the losses there were so heavy that the methods adopted by the Government failed to meet the situation, and that the one proper and direct method is to find out accurately and determine concisely the losses sustained in every parish, in every townland, and in every farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion, which I submit deserves support and ought to be acted upon.  We must try and get a picture of the conditions in Co. Clare at present in order to realise fully what is happening there.  We must picture to ourselves an over-draft of £60,000 on the account of the Clare County Council; something like £70,000 of rates outstanding, and £40,000 due to the Land Commission.  We must ask ourselves what has been the cause of all that. <Col N="326" /> Surely it cannot be said that all this debt has accrued because people are unwilling to meet their local national liabilities?  Those of us who are locally in touch with this matter, both as members of the Clare County Council and Deputies, find that the cause probably is two-fold.  The Anglo-Irish war probably started the trouble.  Clare during that period was something like a beleaguered city.  The Clare County Council was declared an illegal body and met in castles and cow-houses alternately. Fairs were prohibited, markets were few and out of reach, because of the break-up of the roads, and the making of money by the farming community at that period was very difficult.  Consequently, the small farmer had to use up any capital he had made during the world war.  Then came the epidemie and he had nothing to meet it.  The little margin of live stock which stood between the small farmer in Clare and inability to meet his liabilities was swept away.  A few head of cattle generally marked the margin between ability and inability on the part of the small farmer to meet his liabilities. This is not an exaggerated picture&mdash;it is a true picture of what happened. Therefore, the position to-day may be said to be due to the cumulative effects of the epidemic and the inconvenience consequent on the Anglo-Irish war.  The County Council will be taken as the most representative body to speak authoritatively as to the condition of affairs in any administrative county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the County Council found when certain ratepayers were not able to meet their liabilities, when certain statements were made from every corner of the county, that it was up to us to investigate the position thoroughly and see what was at the back of it, and if there was a substratum of truth on which these people were basing their inability to meet legal liabilities.  We tested the matter thoroughly with the machinery at our disposal, and Deputy C. Hogan has read out fairly fully the result of those investigations.  We interrogated our officials, questioned them as to the position in the districts they were operating in, and they told us that the position is very serious and <Col N="327" /> that the reports we were receiving were not at all exaggerated.</P>
    <P>The results of those investigations have not been withheld by us.  We have taken what opportunities were afforded us to make the position known to those in authority, and, by resolutions and otherwise, we have informed the responsible Department of what the position in the county is, and it is regrettable to say with very little success.  I submit to the Minister that the knowledge of the extent and cause of a disease helps to go a good way towards the cure.  Therefore, this motion is one deserving of support, because it asks the Minister to find out what is the extent and cause of this economic disease from which we are at present suffering in the County Clare. I do not say, at the moment, that we are by any means despondent as to our economic condition in the country.  We are not.  We are certain we will recover. Nor are we anxious that it should be broadcasted that cattle disease is prevalent in the county.  We do not want that at all.  But we want the Minister to take what steps are necessary to ascertain what is the true position of the county, and I think if he investigates the matter thoroughly he will find it is very much worse probably than he imagines.</P>
    <P>The Government has not put forward anything that might be seriously recommended as a remedy up to the present. But of course it is good to know that we have got a remedy now.</P>

      <P>Speaking in Ennis yesterday, the Minister for Lands and Agriculture said that the policy of his department is to help those who help themselves and let the others go to the devil; so that the men who have lost ten or twelve or fifteen cattle and cannot help themselves and cannot meet their local and national liabilities know now the gentleman to associate with.  This supernatural policy, of course, was well worth waiting for and, probably, the Minister was well directed in waiting for a favourable atmosphere to advance that policy.  A modern Cromwell has sent his ultimatum to the farmers of Clare, and who knows but he may probably make <Col N="328" /> arrangements with the devil, in the shape of the sheriff, to call upon those farmers in turn.  When one finds the Minister for Agriculture calling into conference a gentleman of the order and character he did in Ennis, one is inclined to suspect that the Government, for which the Minister speaks, is heading in a certain direction. Truly, political bankruptcy makes strange bed-fellows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed on several occasions previously, and if I say anything on this motion it is something that is bound to have been put to the Dáil at least twice before. But I think in face of all that happened since, the complete and absolute failure of the Minister to deal with the existing conditions must always stand to his discredit.  No greater disaster came upon so large a section of the people of this country, in our time, as this disaster of the loss of cattle by disease; and nothing real has been done.  The Government, at the time, had an opportunity, and we asked them to recognise that the problem existed and to find a solution.  We made that clear in a reasonable manner.  I think they must admit, now, that if after two years they have done nothing to meet the difficulties that confronted those farmers, and nothing to try and help them, it must be either due to want of knowledge of the extent of the disease or to callousness as to the fate of the unfortunate people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a grand thing to have great spectacular schemes in the country, but those are very little good to the thousands of people who suffered loss not yet repaired and that can never be repaired by themselves.  If our advice given to the Ministry and pressed on the Dáil had been taken two years ago something real would have been done before now to enable those farmers to face the problems of life, to honour their obligation and to do their duty to the State.  The first obvious step, as we pressed upon the Ministry then, was to find out the extent of the losses. On every occasion when this matter was discussed we pressed that point as strongly as possible.  The Minister does not yet know the extent of the losses.  He has suggested, and other <Col N="329" /> Ministers are suggesting, that this problem, and other problems of the farmers, are to be dealt with by the operation of the new Agricultural Credit Corporation which is to be established in the not far distant future.</P>
    <P>But I put it to the Ministry can that credit corporation do this work and help the farmers who have suffered grave and serious losses without finding to what extent these men have lost and to what extent damage has to be repaired?  Unquestionably they cannot-do so, and any action taken by this Corporation will be unwise if its first effort is not to discover the men who have suffered and how much they have suffered.  What the Ministry should have done, two years ago, remains yet to be done.  If it is not done by the Minister's Department now in Deputy Hogan's constituency, and I suggest in other constituencies, although the motion does not embody that, it must be done under some authority and by some organisation if these men are to be helped across the stile.  Is there any sincere indication of a desire to help them over the stile, or is this all so much talk in the air?  If the social order as it exists is to continue, if chaos is not to reign in many parts of the country, undoubtedly, the problem will have to be faced.  It has been shirked so far, and the problem still remains.  Under another Bill the Ministry are trying to meet conditions for which they, themselves, are largely responsible. Now are they sincere when they say that the farmers are to be helped and are to get credit facilities to enable them to do their business better?  Are they honest in that?  I certainly feel no credit should be given to farmers until it is first made perfectly clear that the credit is required. and required because men are going to extend their business and are capable of making their business a success, or because a man's business is failing because of lack of capital, suffered from loss of stock.  Those inquiries will have to be made before credit facilities can be given to any body of farmers.  If these inquiries were made two years ago the data would be available. If the census was taken two years ago, which would, perhaps, have <Col N="330" /> been more easy than now, the magnitude of the problem would have impressed itself so much on the Minister that he would have had to do something that remains yet to be done.</P>
    <P>If the Minister still refuses, the machinery of the Agricultural Credit Corporation must be utilised.  The Minister has the machinery at his disposal and he can utilise it to do what Deputy Connor Hogan desires. If the Minister does not do so he must explain to the Dáil by what other way he means to deal with a problem that has not been dealt with up to the present.  Deputy Tierney, on behalf of his Party, tried to make Deputies believe that the Ministry were meeting the problem in another way, but the problem is still there, and it will remain there until the Ministry have the courage to face it as they were urged.  The Minister's reply will want to be different to that which was given on a previous occasion if relief is to be given to thousands of people all over the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in going back on what has not been done. Deputy Hogan and Deputy Baxter have dealt with that side of the question. I hope I will not hear the Minister answering that means were put at the disposal of county Clare as well as other counties, and that Clare did not avail of these means.  There must be some cause for that due to local conditions.  Politics may have been very acute in Clare.  I always knew that there were factions in Clare, tremendous local jealousies as well as secret societies, and that the same spirit of co-operation did not exist there as exists in other counties.  Might not the explanation be why the credit societies did not succeed in Clare that there was a spirit of jealousy, distrust and envy there.  I heard that, although I have never been in Clare.  The fact remains that societies which the Minister thought, and which many Deputies thought, were going to cure all the ills that existed have not done so, and, as far as my information goes, there, is not a single credit society in Clare.  If there is any statesmanship left, the position in Clare must be faced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the statements of Deputies <Col N="331" /> and officers of county councils to whom the returns were sent cannot be doubted.  The problem remains unsolved. The fact remains that a problem of the greatest magnitude exists, one much more serious than the Dáil had before it a few nights ago in connection with the subsidy scheme put forward by the Minister.  I do not think any Deputy wants a grant or a subsidy in this case.  I think I am speaking with authority when I say that the most that is asked now is a loan, on very special terms, and for a reasonable period.  It would be a confession of bankruptcy in statesmanship and kindly feeling if the House were to pass over the proposal that has been put forward with the answer: &ldquo;Why did they not take advantage of the credit societies to meet the case?&rdquo;  I do not know that these societies have met the problem anywhere in the districts affected.  I do not believe, at any rate, that they have met it fully.  However, we do not want to go back on what has happened and say &ldquo;We told you so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Minister intended to meet the question, as Deputy P. Hogan suggested, in the spirit of &ldquo;let them go to the devil if they do not and will not help themselves.&rdquo; I do not anticipate that there will be any writing down in whatever national effort is made to meet the situation.  I do not believe we need write down as a dead loss £50,000.  I see no prospect of having to write off anything in connection with this question, and I am sure the Government is big enough, regardless of politics or anything else, to face the problem in the proper spirit.  I will be very disappointed if the Minister does not deal with it in a different manner to that in which he dealt with it up to the present.</P>

      <P>The proposal is to take a census of the mortality in livestock since 1923.  That census would not be worth the paper it was written on.  In my opinion it would be a complete waste of time.  With regard to the measures that have been taken; first of all, credit societies were organised on a basis of £ for £ free of interest.  That, <Col N="332" /> I thought at the time, a good scheme, but in order to meet representations the amount was increased from £1 to £2. Some counties availed liberally of that scheme.  The scheme has been doing extremely well, and better than all, from the point of view of the Government, and from the point of view of the taxpayer, the money was given out with great discretion and the security appears to be excellent.  You can never be certain of a complete 100 per cent., but from the point of view of security and the chance of its being fully repaid, the outlook is very hopeful. I agree&mdash;and we need not go into the reasons&mdash;Clare did not avail itself of that scheme.  Another scheme has not been promised; it has been put into operation.  Under that scheme there is money available without deposits.  The money is lent at 2½ per cent. to societies and may be lent out by the societies at whatever rate of interest covers their expenses. The societies get the money at 2½ per cent., which is about twice as good as the American Government can borrow at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>About £75,000.  My own opinion is that what has happened in every other district will happen in Clare.  To a large extent, when two alternative schemes are available; they will elect to take the deposit scheme.  That has happened in a few cases, and in some districts, where it was stated no deposits could be found. It was pointed out to them that they could have the money without deposits at 2½ per cent. interest, but when they thought over the two schemes the deposits were forthcoming.  If that does not happen in Clare, the position still is that there is a certain amount of money available.  It can be had at 2½ per cent.  If there were deposits it could be had free of interest, but 2½ per cent. is an excellent rate of interest. Money could not be got anywhere else at that rate.</P>

What I said is not likely to be misunderstood.  If anyone has any compassion for me from the point of view of political reactions they ought to save their feelings at once.  They can leave that to me.  I made my position in Clare clear yesterday and I need no explanations from anybody. I am quite certain that the societies will be organised in Clare as in other counties, and, what is more, I want to point out that this scheme gives money at 2½ per cent. without any deposit.  It is an excellent scheme and is as much as the State should be asked to do, especially as a stop-gap, because the ideal way to deal with this question is through banks.  Only banks can lend money economically and effectively, because banks have agencies throughout the country.  They can inquire into the security of the borrower for the loan through their agencies.</P>

If the Agricultural Credit Corporation were actually established, it would be the ideal body to deal with this question, but that will take time.  It will take many months after the Act is passed before that Corporation can be established.  This particular scheme, which provides money at 2½ per cent. without deposits, will certainly meet the case until then.  It takes away all excuse from these small farmers.  It is not much good to the big farmer, because the maximum amount which can be lent, as between man and wife, is £100.  It is almost an ideal scheme for the small farmer. You can do a man almost as much harm by giving him too much money as by giving him none at all.  There is only one basis on which it is safe to give a <Col N="334" /> man too much money, and that is on the understanding that he is not to repay it.  On any other basis, it is extremely bad for the man and bad for the lender.</P>

      <P>All the law can do is to deal with the position generally, We started with these Societies, to which we contributed £1 for £1.  We went on to offer £2 for £1 and that scheme has been a tremendous success, particularly in one county.  Now we have modified that and the modification has made it ideal from the point of view of the small farmer.  Presumably, the big farmer has more security <Col N="335" /> and he can try his luck at the joint stock bank until the Agricultural Credit Corporation is set up.  As far as the small farmer is concerned, the man who wants to get into stock gradually, the £50 or £100 stock man, this is the scheme he wants.  He is offered a loan at 2½ per cent without any deposit.  That, in my opinion, meets the case so far as the State can be expected to meet it and, in the long run, it will meet it far better, both from the point of view of the State and of the farmer, than if you were to give the farmer too much money.</P>
      <P>As regards a census, a census would be a waste of paper.  I can see no use whatever for a census and I do not desire even to discuss it.  Fancy sending round people with forms to ask farmers &ldquo;what stock did you lose since 1922 or 1923?&rdquo;  A census would be quite useless.  The only permanent way to deal with this question is by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  All I claim for the credit societies is that, so far as the small farmer is concerned who wants small credits, they will fill the gap between the present time and the date when the Agricultural Credit Societies will be established.</P>

      <P>They made a serious effort to deal with it and they are continuing that effort.  They are also extending their operations in several directions.  They took the banks into their confidence and they gave loans, through the banks, to the sufferers at 2½ per cent interest.  What is more, they are even extending, at present, the period for repayment.  While they <Col N="336" /> were sufficiently impressed in the beginning with the gravity of the case, circumstances have since necessitated an extension of credit and that also is forthcoming.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands has pinned his faith to the credit societies.  The credit society, I submit, has failed.  I have yet to learn of a district in which the credit society has completely achieved its purpose.  The House has not been impressed with the gravity of the situation at all.  If these losses continue, you will find that men who are to-day solvent will be rendered insolvent by the insolvent condition of their neighbours.  That is a horrible thing to visualise.  I wonder was this the policy of the Minister two years ago&mdash; that the Government cannot deal with losses&mdash;when his Department, for a considerable time, seemed to be unaware of the fluke losses, although they had the male fern as a specific at the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <P>Why not quote what I did say?  I referred to &ldquo;all losses.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. C. HOGAN Mr. C. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite willing to accept that correction.  The Minister has not made a serious attempt to deal with a tithe of the losses, not to speak of all the losses.  Two years ago, if it had been sufficiently advertised that the extract of male fern was available as a preventive, I believe considerable numbers of stock could have been saved.  The cure was there and the veterinary officers knew all about it but there was no serious attempt made to bring it to the knowledge of the general public.  The public were ignorant of the fact that a cure existed. You had this unfortunate effect that, through a spirit of fatalism, the people resigned themselves to the losses.  At the beginning of the bad season, one might have anticipated fluke in cattle and sheep but nothing was done by the Veterinary Branch of the Department to bring this to the knowledge of the public.</P>
      <P>That in itself is something that calls for very severe censure.  I repeat that even with a loan advanced to a credit society at 2½ per cent., the case is not met.  What the people require is cheap credit for quite a considerable period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is cheap right enough from the State to the society, but you have an organisation intervening.  The members of that organisation are jointly and severally responsible for the refund of the sum to the Government, and in order to cover doubtful losses they must make themselves secure in that way upon the ordinary average borrower.  In any case, these facts stand out, that the borrower does not get the benefit of this cheap money at 2½ per cent.  I submit that the Irish banks should have been taken into council and a reasonable credit on the State guarantee should have been put forward. Some of the legislation that we were repudiating to-night might have been acceptable, and I would not have put up the same opposition to it if the Government had dealt with the matter in a generous spirit or with some realisation of the position in the country.  Had <Col N="338" /> they done so, I would not be in opposition to these extraordinary powers. They are seeking these extraordinary powers and leaving the economic problem untouched.  I fail to see how such a proposal can be justified.</P>
      <P>I am going to ask the Dáil, irrespective of Parties, to vote for this motion. I feel I have not made it a Party issue. I have made a broad appeal, and I ask Deputies to bear in mind that over and above the fate of Ministers and of administration there is this supreme principle, the weal, prosperity and success of the common people.  I say definitely that the credit societies scheme has failed, and to continue it longer is only to make remedial measures to restore prosperity, when they become available, more costly and more lengthy in operation.  Therefore, I ask Deputies to support my motion and to pass a vote of censure upon the inactivity of the Government.</P>
