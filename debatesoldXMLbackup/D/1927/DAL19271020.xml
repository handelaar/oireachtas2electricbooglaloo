      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that the official time-tables of most of the Road Transport Companies operating in the Saorstát involve an all-over speed for passenger omnibuses of more than twenty miles per hour, indicating a very much higher actual speed when <Col N="282" /> allowance is made for stops; whether any steps are being taken to enforce the existing law; how many prosecutions for exceeding the speed limit and for overcrowding have been taken against motor omnibus companies during the past three months; and when he proposes to introduce legislation governing the effective control of traffic and the enforcement of regulations in the interest of the safety of the travelling public.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that certain omnibus companies operating in the Saorstát have public time-tables which necessitate drivers travelling at more than 20 miles per hour if they are to observe the scheduled times.  Instructions have been issued to the Gárda Síochána that in such cases the proprietor of the vehicle should be summoned for aiding and abetting the offence of the driver.  There were 317 prosecutions instituted in the past three months in respect of motor omnibuses; 211 for speeding and dangerous driving, and 106 for overcrowding.  In addition to the foregoing, 160 prosecutions were instituted in the Metropolitan Division for breaches of the regulations made under the Dublin Traffic Act, 1875.  The question as to what fresh legislation is necessary to deal with the proper control of public service vehicles and traffic generally is at present being considered by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Road Traffic.</P>

      <P>The Superintendent at present stationed at Dungloe was allocated to that District a few months ago.  He had some knowledge of Irish and it was hoped that with the special facilities there available he would in a short time acquire an adequate knowledge of the language.  This procedure is in fact unavoidable if a sufficiency of competent Irish speaking officers is to be provided for the Gárda.  At present the number of persons who combine an adequate knowledge of Irish with the other qualifications essential to a police officer is necessarily limited, and in addition, internal administrative reasons, such as the inexpediencey of a police officer serving in his native county, or in his wife's native county, make the task of manning the Irish-speaking districts with Irish-speaking officers extremely difficult.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will introduce legislation to amend the Poor Law regulations so that relief can be granted to women and children in needy circumstances; if he is aware that the families of the unemployed, many of whom are unemployed for two years and without means of support, cannot get relief of any sort under the existing regulations.</P>

      <P>Under the law as it stands in its application to Dublin, relief outside the Workhouse cannot be afforded to able-bodied unemployed and their dependants.</P>
      <P>The Report of the Commission on the Relief of the Sick and Destitute Poor has recently been published, and copies are available.</P>
      <P>The general recommendations of the Commission bearing on this matter of Home Assistance are contained in Chapter IV., pages 53 to 61.  Special recommendations as regards Dublin County and County Borough are contained in Chapter 10, pages 88-91. Legislation where such appears necessary will be introduced.  The report generally and the recommendations made are at present under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, in addition to discharging in the most sympathetic and painstaking way their statutory duties in the matter of relief, the Commissioners of the Dublin Union, acting in conjunction with the City Commissioners, endeavour to secure the maximum <Col N="285" /> amount of employment on the repair and maintenance of roads, on housing, and on kindred public works.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that under Section 13 of the Act of 1895 it was within the discretion of Boards of Guardians, and is within the discretion of Commissioners, to introduce a special scheme.  That scheme was availed of a couple of years ago and it was very disappointing both as to results and to the amount of money necessary to be expended on it.  The Commissioners are giving the matter the fullest possible consideration and are dealing with it very sympathetically and painstakingly.  In addition to what they can give statutorily in the way of relief, it must be borne in mind that they are giving assistance by way of meals to school children.  In the estimates for the coming year in the county borough the amount set aside for that purpose will be £11,000.  They also give grants for milk in connection with Child Welfare schemes, and this year the amount allocated for that purpose will be about £4,000.</P>

Also, would the Minister say why that section is not put into operation considering the number of unemployed persons who have been refused relief and whose wives and children are practically hungry?</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be well, perhaps, before moving either of the resolutions which I have to move, to say a word in regard to procedure.  It is customary, when resolutions proposing or modifying duties on customs and excise have to be proposed, not to circulate them in advance, but to distribute them to Deputies when they are being moved.  That is necessary in order that forestalling may not take place.  If the resolutions were put down on the Order Paper in the ordinary way it would be possible for traders, and other interested persons who might be very much alert, to take advantage of the knowledge and succeed in either importing or removing <Col N="288" /> goods from bond, thus making considerable profit and either injuring the revenue or defeating the object of the tax.  Under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, if it is declared expedient in the public interest that a resolution in Committee on Finance shall have statutory effect, the position then is that the tax can be collected but, within ten sitting days after the passage of that resolution, it must be confirmed by the Dáil on Report, and if it is not confirmed by the Dáil on Report, it ceases to have effect, and any taxes collected under it must be repaid.</P>
      <P>If it is confirmed on Report, the Second Reading of the Bill, embodying the substance of that resolution, must be passed within the next twenty sitting days.  If it is not so passed the resolution ceases to have effect and any tax collected must be repaid. Finally, the Bill giving legislative effect to the resolution must be passed within four months of the passage of the resolution in the Dáil or the time of coming into effect of the resolution. If that resolution is not so passed, the tax so collected must be repaid.  If there is any modification in regard to the tax and money is collected which would not be collectable under the Act as finally passed, then repayment must be made.  We have not hitherto had any duties on customs or excise imposed except at Budget time, but I think the same procedure would not be suitable on the present occasion.  When we have had a Budget the usual procedure has been for the Dáil to pass without a full debate the resolutions submitted to it.  Within a week or ten days the resolutions came up on Report and were fully debated.  The reason that they could not be fully debated when first presented was that Deputies had not opportunities for thinking over them in advance, and it was also necessary on several occasions to pass a large number of resolutions on the same day.</P>
      <P>The first resolution which I have to propose is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  That a customs duty of an amount equal to thirty-three and one-third per cent. of the value of the article shall be charged, levied, <Col N="289" /> and paid on every rosary and every article which in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners is a substantial part of a rosary imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 22nd day of October, 1927.</P>
    <P>2.  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This resolution is introduced pursuant to a recommendation of the Tariff Commission. We passed in 1926 a Tariff Commission Act setting up a body to which the proposals for tariffs were to be referred.  That body was given power to make regulations for its procedure, to hear witnesses and to employ such people as were necessary to investigate fully and effectively the proposals which were brought before it. It was directed to report under ten heads on a proposal.  These were:</P>
    <P>1.  The efficiency, extent, and relative importance of the industry in respect of which the application is made, the amount of capital invested therein, the number of persons employed therein, the total annual value of the goods produced by the said industry, and the cost of production of such goods in Saorstát Eireann as compared with such cost in other countries.</P>
    <P>2.  The cost, efficiency, conditions of labour, and rates of wages in Saorstát Eireann in the industry in respect of which the application is made as compared with such cost, efficiency, conditions, and rates in other countries.</P>
    <P>3.  The effect which the granting in whole or in part of the concessions asked for in the application would be likely to have on the several matters mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Schedule.</P>
    <P>4.  The effect which the granting in whole or in part of the concessions asked for in the application would be likely to have on other trades and industries in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> 5.  The effect which the granting in whole or in part of the concessions asked for in the application would be likely to have on consumers of the goods produced by the industry in respect of which the application is made and on the cost of living.</P>
    <P>6.  The effect which the granting in whole or in part of the concessions asked for in the application would be likely to have on the public revenues of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>7.  The prospects, if any, which the industry in respect of which the application is made has of establishing itself eventually on a permanent basis without the continued aid of a customs duty or with a modification of such duty after a period.</P>
    <P>8.  The minimum amount of customs duty which would probably be necessary for the successful conduct in Saorstát Eireann of the industry in respect of which the application is made.</P>
    <P>9.  To what extent, if at all, the competition from imported goods to which the industry in respect of which the application is made is exposed is unfair by reason of currency depreciation or the grants of subsidies or bounties in the country in which such goods are manufactured.</P>
    <P>10.  Such other economic, industrial, and administrative aspects of the application as appear to the Commission to be relevant to the determination of the merits and demerits of the application.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see, the Commission is expected to cover a fairly wide field. Even in respect to the simplest and easiest application considerable delay is likely to take place.  That arises out of the circumstances of the case. Delays will occur, but even without any undue delay occurring the investigation of an application will take a good deal of time.  The application in respect of rosaries was made by the one firm which manufactured rosary beads in the Saorstát, Messrs. Mitchell and Co., of Waterford Street, Dublin, and it was referred to the Tariff Commission <Col N="291" /> on 31st January, 1927.  Evidence was given in support of the application by the manufacturers, and by Miss Louie Bennett and Miss Moloney on behalf of the Irish Women Workers' Union.  Evidence in opposition was given by a number of firms engaged in the wholesale and retail trade.  The Report has gone to the printers and will be circulated to the Deputies to-morrow, and they will have a chance before the Report Stage of the Resolution comes on to study it and make any inquiries in respect of it they care to make.  The Commission recommends, as appears in the resolution, that an ad valorem duty of 33? per cent. be imposed, and it recommends that it be imposed in the first instance for a period of five years.  When the Bill is introduced giving effect to these resolutions a clause will appear limiting the period of the duties to five years, and the matter can then be reviewed. The industry is a small one, the capital invested being about £10,000, and the number of workers employed in 1926 was 85, many of whom were part time.  In previous years the number had been higher, being 165 in 1920-21.  It is anticipated that following the imposition of this tariff the number of workers will be about doubled, and that the total will reach 160.  The average annual output for the four years 1923-26 was £8,700. As a result of the imposition of a tariff it is expected that the output will be increased to £15,000 or £16,000.  The competing goods are manufactured very largely in France, and are made in the homes of those engaged in the industry and not in the factories.  It is alleged that the rates of wages paid are extremely low, and that the labour costs are so low in fact that it would not be possible for the industry to continue here without some tariff.  Unless great changes occur there will be a time when it cannot be continued without some tariff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It has continued in a declining way, and if the decline continues the industry will cease.  It is <Col N="292" /> anticipated that there will be an additional investment of about £5,000 in the industry.  The present manufacturers do not propose to undertake the manufacture of the cheaper grades, and it is possible that some other people may come in and engage in the manufacture of these particular grades. The Tariff Commission anticipates that the imposition of these duties will give about 50 per cent. of the trade in this country to the home manufacturers.  It estimates that the value of the rosaries bought in this country varies from £60,000 or £70,000 a year to £20,000 or £30,000 a year.  The manufacturers here estimate it at the larger figure and those engaged in the retail trade estimate it at the lower figure, and the Tariff Commission is inclined to accept the statement of the retailers.</P>
      <P>At present no rosary manufactured here is retailed at less than 9d.  The manufacturers believe that with increased output and the consequent decrease of overhead charges in relation to output they will be able to be retailed at 6d.  I do not think that there is anything else I need mention except just to read the last paragraph of the Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Another aspect to which the Commissioners feel that they must refer, though not included in the above list, is the possible repugnance which the Catholic community may feel towards the imposition of a duty on objects of devotional use.  This difficulty has been settled for the Commissioners by a letter of the 13th March last, addressed to Messrs. Mitchell &amp; Co., by the Secretary to the Archbishop of Dublin, stating that &lsquo;the Archbishop sees no objection to a tariff being placed on rosary beads.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The views of Deputies <Col N="293" /> on these Benches on the matter of protection for industries are well known. We welcome this step that has been taken by the Ministry to protect the manufacturers of rosary beads in this country against competition from outside. I think, however, it is no harm to comment&mdash;we will have an opportunity perhaps of commenting at greater length later&mdash;upon the fact that the Tariff Commission took nine months to make a recommendation on one of the most trivial matters that could have come before them.  At the rate of progress which the Tariff Commission has established it will take them more than the lifetime of the majority of Deputies before all the industries in this country which are in urgent need of protection against unfair competition from outside can be considered.  The amounts mentioned in connection with the rosaries are small.  If we take an increase of £5,000 in production here, and if that takes nine months to secure, Deputies can calculate for themselves how long it will take before the subject of wearing apparel, for example, on which the existing tariff is totally inadequate, and the imports of which for the first six months of this year amounted to £600,000, is likely to be adequately considered.  However, it is a step in the right direction and as such we welcome it, and trust that whatever opposition may be forthcoming to this resolution from the advocates of Free Trade in this Assembly will not be considered by the other Deputies.</P>

As to the statement of the Minister that the evidence was that rosary beads sold at 9d. hitherto will in future be sold at 6d., I should like to ask if his experience has been where tariffs have been enforced that there has been a reduction of 33 1-3 per cent. in the selling price of the article.  I think it is more likely that instead of being sold at 9d. in future they will be sold at 1s.</P>

It is a matter that might be enlarged indefinitely. I think that the resolution, as it stands, is vague, and perhaps the Minister could improve on it.</P>

      <P>I am glad that that point was raised, because there are quite a number of people in the country who get a good deal of employment through the making of rosaries from raw materials imported, <Col N="295" /> which are not manufactured and could not be manufactured in the country on any kind of economic basis unless a tariff of something like 200 or 300 per cent. were imposed.  Even then it would mean the setting up of expensive machinery, and it is quite unlikely that that would be done.  It would be well if the resolution were made clear, otherwise the result may be that a number of people at present earning a living through the assembling of beads may be thrown out of work.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Egan in the hope that the Minister will consider this matter more carefully.  We have had experience already in the case of the furniture tariff of the manner in which the Revenue Commissioners interpret the wording of the Act.  There have been very remarkable cases of hardship, as far as I understand, suffered by people importing various articles which can only be described as furniture by the Revenue Commissioners but which no ordinary person in his senses would dream of describing as furniture.  I know of the case of a professor who purchased some dialect maps in Germany which had rollers at the top and bottom.  The professor was charged something like 30/- duty on the maps because the Revenue Commissioners held that they were furniture because of the rollers. I wonder whether it might not be possible, as this resolution is worded, for the Revenue Commissioners to charge a duty to the purchasers of statues of Buddha or any other kind of ornament on the ground that they may have something to do with rosary beads.  I think the matter of giving powers to the Revenue Commissioners by the vague wording of a resolution like this is one which should be very carefully considered and I am glad that Deputy Esmonde has drawn attention to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the length of time that a tariff involving a few thousand pounds has taken, as complained by Deputy Lemass, it does not follow that an application for a tariff involving larger sums would take <Col N="296" /> a greater time.  A man could look over a field and see two sheep and also see a hundred sheep at the same time.  It is not a question of the amount; it is a question of the complexity and the effect of the duty on other industries. A matter like the application for a tariff on flour will take a great deal more time because it involves the question of the cost of living.  And so with many other applications.  An application for a tariff on woollens is a much more difficult matter because it involves consideration of the existing tariff on apparel.  It might be impossible, even if it were thought desirable, to impose a tariff on woollens without altering the tariff on apparel. There are a lot of reactions to be considered.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the Tariff Commission have only had one or two sittings in relation to rosary beads, but it had to take steps to get information in regard to the conditions in other countries and the wages paid by the manufacturers of these articles in other countries, and it has given a great deal more time to some other applications which it is not yet in a position to report on.</P>
      <P>With reference to Deputy O'Hanlon's question, if the manufacturers increase the price, then presumably, no benefit will result from the tariff and the industry will disappear.  The Commission believes that if the manufacturers are given increased output they will be in a position to carry on profitably and to sell their goods at a lower price than heretofore.  If they fail to do so and if the tariff fails to produce results because of the manufacturers not taking advantage of the opportunities which it gives them, then, at the end of the five years period for which the tariff will be imposed, I presume the Dáil would decline to reimpose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde, Deputy Egan and Deputy Professor Tierney have referred to the wording of the first part of the resolution, &ldquo;on every rosary and every article which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, is a substantial part of a rosary.&rdquo;  It will be possible, if it is thought necessary on consideration, to put in restrictive <Col N="297" /> words in the Bill, but it is necessary to have something like these words in the operative clause because if the power is not there it might be possible for people, for instance, to detach a crucifix, which is part of a rosary, and to import the crucifix separately and the other parts separately and claim exemption from the duty.  It might be possible to separate the rosary into two parts and to say in respect of each, it is not a rosary, and claim exemption from duty.  It is necessary to prevent that, and to make sure that it is not possible by some simple trick to evade payment of the duty.</P>
    <P>The effect of the resolution is not to charge upon the component parts; it is not intended to charge upon the wire used for making the chain or on the separate beads.  If the beads are imported separately they will not be charged on.  Deputies may have noticed the wording in relation to certain other articles on which there is a Customs duty.  The wording is generally &ldquo;component parts.&rdquo;  We have not used the words &ldquo;component parts&rdquo; here because it is not desired to charge on the beads or on the wire.  If any restrictive words are thought necessary they can be inserted at a later stage, but some powers to the Revenue Commissioners are necessary here if the tax is not to be evaded altogether.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  That a Customs duty at the rate of threepence on the pound shall be charged, levied, and paid on all margarine imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 22nd day of October, 1927.</P>
      <P>2.  That in this resolution the word &ldquo;margarine&rdquo; means any article of food, whether mixed with butter or not, which resembles butter and is not milk-blended butter.</P>
      <P>3.  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition which is used here for margarine is the definition which is in the Butter and Margarine Act, 1907, and which is part of the Food and Drugs Act.  I presume it has served its purpose satisfactorily up to the present. The proposed tariff of threepence in the pound is intended to effect the exclusion of foreign-made margarine from the Saorstát and to give the entire Saorstát market for margarine to the home manufacturers.  An application was made by Messrs. W. and C. McDonnell, of Waterford, Messers James Daly and Sons, Shandon Castle Margarine Factory, and Messrs. Dowdall, O'Mahoney and Co., Ltd., of Cork.  Their application was for a duty of threepence per pound.  The firm of Dowdall which had been associated with the application up to the present month and had given evidence withdrew their application on 8th October on the ground that their interest in this application was to preserve Messrs.  W. and C. McDonnell's factory, which was then threatened with extinction.  It has since been <Col N="299" /> closed.  However, the closing of Messrs. McDonnell's factory took place in February last; consequently the Tariff Commission went on with the consideration of the matter in the same way as if all the applicants still were desirous of having a tariff imposed.</P>
    <P>In addition to hearing evidence at public sittings, the Commission visited the two margarine factories in Cork and the factory in Waterford.  They also visited a number of margarine factories in London and in Liverpool. The opinion of the Commissioners is that as regards one, at any rate, of the factories &ldquo;the premises, modern equipment and general outlay of the factory and the competence of the technical staff are satisfactory.&rdquo;  They are of opinion that,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;judged by their ability to put on the market a product as cheap as that of outside firms, quality for quality, the manufacturers in the Saorstát appear to be able to hold their own so long as their output is maintained and they are not the victims of a trade war carried on by foreign corporations, whether these as rivals endeavour to oust each other from the world market in margarine by cutting the prices of the cheaper grades to a figure which yields no profit, or as allies unite and, by the pooling of their resources and continued price-cutting, seek to share the market between them to the exclusion of all other manufacturers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The industry is confined, as Deputies are aware, to the cities of Cork and Waterford, and it cannot be regarded as of general importance.  The capital involved is about £65,000.  The number of persons employed by the firms has varied.  In the case of McDonnell and Daly it has varied from 187 in 1921 down to 104 in 1926.  I will just give the figures for these years.  In 1921 the number was 187; in 1922 it was 151; in 1923 it was 132; in 1924 it was 114; in 1925 it was 111; in 1926 it was 104.  Of course, since then the factory of Messrs. McDonnell has closed down.  So far as Messrs. Dowdall, O'Mahoney is concerned, the employees <Col N="300" /> have ranged from 112 in 1918 down to 37 in 1926.  The cost of production as compared with the cost in other countries is higher.  That is due very largely to the fact that the factories here are not producing up to their output.  It will probably be always somewhat higher here because of the extra freight on raw materials and the cost of returning empty containers.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It should be mentioned that the large scale concerns which are the chief rivals of the home factories in the Saorstát market have oil refining plant either on their own premises or operated in the same neighbourhood by companies associated with themselves. They are usually able to obtain their liquid oils either through pipes from the refining plant or as the result of prudent selection of sites from tank barges which have been loaded at the associated factory and brought alongside the margarine factory to be unloaded by pipes.  In this way the handling of individual drums of oil is avoided and costs kept low.  In the opinion of the Commissioners the demand by the Saorstát factories would not justify the installation of oil refining or seed crushing plant for their own service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apart from that, however, the opinion of the Commissioners is that the costs of production here need be very little higher than the costs of production of competing firms outside.  If the tariff results, as the Commissioners anticipate, in securing to the Saorstát manufacturers the practical monopoly of the home market, the output of the factories will be immediately increased and will approximate to full capacity.  The first effect of increased output should be to bring about the general improvement which is experienced when staffs which have been working only part time at a low pressure are restored to normal hours and a high rate of output.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners believe that the effect of the tariff will be the re-opening of the Waterford factory and the employment, at least, of the 78 workers who were employed in 1926 in addition to the office staff.  It is not possible to say to what extent there will be an <Col N="301" /> increase on the existing staffs in Cork. The margarine produced in Saorstát Eireann in 1926 was value for £271,868. The margarine imported was value for £168,382 making a total of £440,250. From this must be deducted the margarine exported from Saorstát Eireann, £153,458.  The consumption therefore in the Saorstát is value for £286,792. The consumption in the Saorstát is not greatly in excess of the output of last year, but if the home market can be secured for the existing firms and if the export trade which they have always had can be maintained the position of the industry will be substantially improved. At first, the Commissioners were of opinion that the general effect of protection would be to raise the retail price of the article.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They then proceeded to inquire from retailers what classes of the community are purchasers of margarine and for what purposes they purchase it, and as a result of these inquiries ascertained that it is consumed by all classes&mdash;by the wealthy for cooking only and by the middle and poorer classes chiefly for eating, but also for cooking.  As the Commissioners realised that any increase in price would bear most hardly on the poor and might in some cases deprive them of fats which they would not obtain in any other element in their diet they decided that any increase whatever would cancel the advantages to be expected from a tariff on margarine.  Further, they considered that unless they could secure consumers in the Saorstát the benefit of every reduction in price, quality for quality, which consumers here would enjoy in the absence of a tariff, they would not be justified in recommending a tariff at all.  For this reason they requested the applicants to formulate and submit a definite undertaking in regard to the price and quality of margarine made and offered for sale in Saorstát Eireann in the event of a tariff being imposed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The following undertaking was furnished by Messrs. W. and C. McDonnell, Ltd:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We undertake to guarantee that the retail prices in the Irish Free State, for all our various grades of <Col N="302" /> margarine, shall not at any time be more than the contemporary prices in Great Britain, and we shall advertise the retail prices of our various brands monthly in the daily Press. We can also guarantee that in the event of a reduction in the future market prices for raw material, consumers in the Free State shall have the full benefit of any reduction that may be quoted as in Great Britain. We are prepared to give any guarantee the Government or the Tariff Commission may require as security for keeping the undertakings formulated in the request for a tariff. We have a reputation to uphold, and consider that the Government have it in their power to withdraw the tariff in the event of our breaking the contract.&rdquo;</P>

This, in itself, will be quite sufficient to standardise prices in the Saorstát, and we only hope to compete against such opposition by merit and quality alone.  In the event of a protective tariff being imposed we wish to assure you that it will always be our foremost ambition to safeguard the interests of all our consumers in such a manner that the public will not suffer thereby.  We could not, of course, agree or undertake at any time to follow the unwarranted, intensive price-cutting campaigns adopted by foreign combines from time to time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If I were allowed to finish perhaps I would be able to clear up some of these matters.  The Commissioners proceed to say:</P>
      <P>The very specific undertaking given by Messrs. W. &amp; C. McDonnell, Ltd., is acceptable to the Commissioners only because they are fully satisfied of the ability of the company to carry it out.  The situation and lay-out of the premises at Waterford, the plant and general equipment, the efficiency of the staff, and certified costings which have been submitted to them, lead the Commissioners to believe that when the factory is running full time with a high rate of output it will be able to manufacture margarine cheaply enough to fulfil the undertaking.  In the absence of such satisfactory conditions no undertaking, no matter how definite, would influence us in our recommendation, and we think it important that this should be fully understood in view of the possibility of undertakings as to price and quality being offered in connection with other applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners recommend that it should be specifically stated, when proposing this tariff in the Dáil, that if the undertaking is not adhered to that steps will be taken to bring the tariff to an end.  The Commissioners are satisfied that this industry can have its condition improved and can be kept going without any cost to the consumers if the manufacturers desire to do so, as they are being given practically a monopoly of the market, and that, on the other hand, if the manufacturers <Col N="304" /> do not adhere to their undertaking they should be deprived of the benefit of the tariff.</P>

With reference to what Deputy Byrne asked, no undertaking was given by the firm of Messrs.  Dowdall, O'Mahoney and Co.  It had, as I stated in the beginning, withdrawn from the application on the 8th of the present month.</P>

      <P>I welcome the somewhat belated report of the Commission. I desire to ask the Minister again if he can give the House any information as to the respective outputs of the Waterford and Cork factories. The question, I think, is pertinent and of extreme importance, considering that the guarantees given by two firms are of a different nature.  If the output of the Waterford factory is greatly in excess of that produced in Cork, then there is a great deal to be said for the course that has been taken by the Commissioners.  I think that Messrs.  McDonnell are to be congratulated upon the specific and candid manner in which they have given this guarantee.  I think, too, that the Commissioners are to be congratulated upon asking for such a guarantee before they recommended the imposition of a tariff upon an article which is so much used by the poorer classes.  If the Minister can show&mdash;and I think, with all respect, it is the least he might do&mdash;to the House whether the output in Waterford is considerably larger than that in Cork, then I think the Commissioners are justified in the action they have taken.  I cannot see why the factory in Cork could not have made the same offer, nor can I conceive that the Commissioners would have recommended this tariff if they did not <Col N="305" /> believe that the Waterford factory was the main source of the supply of this article in the Saorstát.  Again I desire to congratulate the Commissioners.  I think they have shown great discretion and judgment in the matter in insisting upon this guarantee.</P>

      <P>Naturally the Labour Party would support any proposal that makes for increased employment, but they must make this distinction of necessity, that they must look at a proposal to put a tariff on food in a somewhat different light from one to tax an ordinary article of manufacture. This is especially the case when the article to be taxed is one that is largely used by the very poorest class of the community.  That is so in this case, and we have the admission from the Tariff Commissioners that there is a possibility in any case that the tax on margarine will hit hardest the very poor who use it and are not in a position to buy butter.  I must say that, so far as it goes, the Tariff Commission seems to have taken precautions, and that the guarantee is satisfactory, but it is rather disturbing that the definite guarantee with regard to the matter comes from a factory that is, I understand, at present closed.  I did not follow the Minister quite clearly as to whether there is a definite guarantee that this factory is to re-open.</P>

      <P>That statement qualifies it and makes the matter more satisfactory.  But I hope the Ministry will be very careful to see that the guarantee which has been given in the case of the Waterford factory will be carried out.  When other tariffs were imposed here somewhat similar promises, though not so definite, I admit, were made.  There were somewhat similar expression on the part of the Government and those who were urging the claim for a tariff, but I am afraid it cannot be said in connection with the tariffs that were imposed that it has been always the case that prices have not gone up.  I am afraid that has occurred in many cases.  Certainly I would be a very much stronger supporter of protection if we could get a similar guarantee to that given by <Col N="306" /> Messrs. McDonnell in the case of other articles.  I think if that guarantee could be carried out, and it ought to be our duty and the duty of the Ministry to see that it is carried out, then the tax is worthy of support.</P>

      <P>I welcome this belated measure which will do something to relieve the very considerable amount of unemployment that exists.  I cannot refrain from pointing out that whatever progress has been made in the matter of tariffs has been largely due to the Republican agitation.  It brought such pressure to bear on public opinion that Ministers have been obliged to see the value of that agitation, and in the case of Waterford, perhaps, I cannot dissociate the recent results from this belated measure to relieve unemployment and to do something which is really of national benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of this resolution, I would again like to comment on the delay which occurred between the making of the application and the presentation of the report.  I think the Minister has informed the House that since the application was made one of the firms making it has ceased to produce margarine.  I would suggest to him that one of the reasons why the Commission is going so slow is because they were not constituted to go fast; that they were designed to impede and not to facilitate the imposition of tariffs for the protection of Irish industries. The officials who compose the Commission have numerous other duties to perform, which must take up a very considerable portion of their time, and they cannot undertake the work of the Tariff Commission in a satisfactory manner unless they are whole time on their job.  The Minister stated that the Commission hope, as a result of the imposition of this tariff, that they would secure a monopoly of the home market for the Irish manufacturer.  That statement is a proof that, although they have taken a very considerable time to consider the application, they have not considered it well enough.  They might just as well give a monopoly of the home market to a foreign combine and not to Irish manufacturers at all.  There is nothing to prevent foreign combines establishing branch industries in this <Col N="307" /> country which can sell for a period under cost of production and squeeze the Irish manufacturers out of the field altogether.</P>
      <P>The imposition of a tariff of this nature is highly dangerous unless it is associated with the enactment of legislation that will make it impossible for these foreign combines to operate in the country to the detriment of Irish manufacturers. I would remind Deputies that only yesterday we debated at length the purchase, with State money, of a foreign interest in the creamery business.  It is just possible that this day twelve months we will be discussing the utilisation of State money to buy out foreign interests in the margarine industry as well.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell mentioned the possibility of a tariff on foodstuffs resulting in a rise in prices.  We are told that the imposition of a tariff of 3d. per lb. will be, in effect, prohibition. Why not, therefore, make it prohibition? Why not prohibit the importation of margarine into this country altogether, with the proviso that under special circumstances a licence could be given for its importation?  For example, the Waterford factory might through misfortune have a fire, and as a result the supply of margarine in the country might not be sufficient to meet the consumption. Consumers of margarine would then have to buy the imported margarine, tax and all.  A much better system would be to prohibit the importation of margarine, except under special licence, and when it is admitted in that way, admit it tax free.  In any case, as a temporary measure this resolution will have the support of Deputies on these benches, but, when any such legislation comes before the House, it is well that we should make it clear that we do not believe the Government is tackling the problem of protection for Irish industries in a serious manner.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if the recommendation of the Tariff Commission that quality will be maintained and that present prices will not be exceeded will be contained in the Bill that the Minister intends to bring before the House.  As the Minister <Col N="308" /> shakes his head I take it that that recommendation will not be contained in the Bill.  Then I will oppose this measure, because if such a proviso is not contained in the Bill it will give other manufacturers who have given no guarantee an opportunity of coming into this country and availing of the protection to increase the cost of living to the working classes.  That class will then be practically told to eat dry bread.</P>
      <P>In the City of Dublin to-day there are many people who have bread and tea for breakfast, bread and tea for dinner and bread and tea for supper. That is what our people are living on, and I say that some of them who cannot afford margarine at a dear price must be protected against the manufacturer who may exploit protection.  I say that as a Protectionist, one of the few who, in the early stages in this House, advocated protection on all kinds of luxuries.  But I cannot welcome, as has been welcomed by very many Deputies, this resolution, without some further guarantee that the consumers will be protected from the class that I have just mentioned.  All I am looking for is that such guarantees will be insisted upon, that both price and quality will be maintained, and that there will be no shortage of the commodity that would in any way lead to a scarcity in any part of the City of Dublin, because it is largely to the tenements and in the working-class areas of the City of Dublin that the products of the margarine manufacturers go.  In country districts they can make their own butter, or buy butter very cheaply.  But I certainly say that if this guarantee, recommended by the Minister's own Commission, is not inserted in the Bill the poor people of the City of Dublin will be the sufferers.  Before supporting the motion I would like to have a little more information from the Minister.</P>

      <P>Well, it is rather difficult, because the question of whether the Minister for Finance knows or does not know that is significant in this discussion. I am informed that McDonnell's of Waterford belonged to Messrs. Jurgen's.  You are faced now by the fact that, fifteen months after intervention in this matter, certain very definite changes have been made in that time.  There were three applications, and it is significant that the applications from Cork were for the benefit of somebody else and not for themselves. It is also significant that the neglect of the Government to meet that application has meant the shutting down of one of that firm's opponents in Cork. It is significant that when this meant the shutting down of one of their opponents Cork is no longer particularly interested in the application. That is why there is a difficulty now in getting the guarantee from Cork which could have been got fifteen months ago.  This guarantee was signed in October; fifteen months and two general elections intervened between the time when they were prepared to give that guarantee, which would have kept one of their rivals in existence, and the time when they were asked to repeat it, when that rival had disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to express any particular opinion at the moment on the subject of tariffs.  I am in favour of every sort and kind of protection, and, above all, the protection for our industries of an educated national opinion, which I believe to be the most effective of all.  But this particular tariff, and the circumstances surrounding it, raise problems in relation to tariffs which we might very well investigate.  McDonnell's being Jurgen's and Jurgen's being one of the two big competing organisations, the other being Van Den Bergh's it was quite safe for Irish manufacturers to have a tariff, because if McDonnell's were used for the purpose of illicit price-cutting they would be up against an organisation as strong as themselves.  But Van Den Bergh's and Jurgen's are not rivals, so far as I know at present.  It is possible to get a condition now where you would have your Irish manufacturers inside the ringed fence of a tariff, and I want you to see what might happen.  One of those <Col N="310" /> organisations cuts prices until they shut down the Irish organisation.  It is simply a question as to who has got the most capital, and there is no question as to who has the most capital, the foreign combination that is behind Messrs.  McDonnell or the Irish capital that is behind the other institution.  I have no hostility towards, and I am not saying one single word against, the factory in Waterford.  I want to see the people employed there.  But you have to face the fact that in these tariff cases, where you have largely capitalised organisations operating in this country, with the tariff alone and without some other safeguard, such as conditional prohibition or conditional licences, as has been suggested by Deputy Lemass, it is possible for these highly capitalised organisations to wipe out, without any loss to themselves, the competition of financially weaker organisations in this country, because remember that when they have wiped them out they will have the market to themselves and they will have taught to fools who dared to compete with these highly capitalised organisations the fate that is likely to come to enterprising manufacturers who dare to challenge the very complete monopoly of Irish manufacture to-day.</P>
    <P>The important thing eventually and permanently in Ireland is that we must protect our own capital in the employment of Irish Labour in this country. Unless and until that is done all such things as prohibition, protection, licences, and the rest can be worked backwards and forwards by people who are prepared to lose a considerable amount of money for the purpose of getting possession of a market out of which they can eventually comfortably recoup their losses.  The basis of sound economics, as far as our industries are concerned, is an Irish capital which is converted from an international outlook to an Irish inlook.  That is first. The second point is that our industries, predominantly those industries the products of which are consumed by our own people, shall be capitalised by Irish capital having that inlook; thirdly, that there shall be behind Irish industries so capitalised and so producing a body of national public opinion which will guarantee and safeguard those industries during the <Col N="311" /> period of their inception and development against unfair outside competition of very much larger financial interests.</P>
    <P>In every case of tariffs we must watch that we do not become turned into merely the wage slaves&mdash;I withdraw the word slaves, because I do not like using strong language of that kind&mdash;merely the wage earners of foreign capital, because there is no stability in such employment. Where you have Irish industries&mdash;and this has been largely the tendency of development under the tariffs imposed by the present Government&mdash;merely branch houses or branch manufacturers of larger outside concerns, two things happen.  First, the Minister for Finance does not get any more income tax than they choose to give him.  It is a matter merely of book-keeping, and of perfectly legitimate and honest book-keeping, to keep the income tax of any subsidiary company paid in whichever country those who control the lot choose.  Secondly, it is important to see that you do not get the diversity factor of industry always working against yourself.  There will be ups and downs in industry, bad times and good.  Where you have two factories, one in your own country where you are anxious to employ your own people, and another established merely temporarily for the purpose of getting over a tariff in a foreign country, such as Ireland, it is natural and it is right that the owners of the factory should concentrate to give the load factor of production to the factory in their own country and to leave the swings to the other country.</P>
    <P>The outstanding difficulty we have in this country is that economically we are controlled from outside.  I do honestly believe that the Treasury Bench does not understand that or their measures would be of an entirely different character. I say to you deliberately that England could have quite freely, easily and safely conceded, if I may use that impertinent term, to this country the whole of its political demand and more; could have conceded that with ease and with safety to herself, so long as she could keep the absolute economic grip she has upon us to-day.  I am afraid I am wandering into rather larger economic <Col N="312" /> considerations than those that are immediate, but in this particular case of a tariff, this case in which a patriotic and a good Irish manufacturing firm like Dowdall's have withdrawn, you are up against very significant things.  If Deputies will understand fully and examine fully the national and economic implications of what is going on in relation to this tariff, I believe it will revolutionise the outlook of this House. At the present moment we have one single industry, we have one single consumer. In this House at the proper time I will contend that the logical and the inevitable outcome of such an economic condition, except in so far as in the past the operation of that economic law has been mitigated by violence, by the shooting of landlords, by firing into houses, by boycotting, by neglecting farms, by the degradation of education &mdash;I am going to contend in this House that the logical result of that doctrine and of the conditions which were brought about under that doctrine is that you cannot get for production in Ireland anything but the bare cost of production; that the poverty, the depopulation, the emigration from this country are the logical outcome, and that every bit of prosperity, every bit of decency that we have in our lives, every bit of hope we have for the future is purely an accident. The logical outcome of the economic policy for which the Government stands, and in accordance with which, I believe, they set up a Tariff Commission which was not intended to operate until it was shown as the result of electoral changes that it ought to operate&mdash;the logical outcome of the economic policy for which the Government stand is depopulation, is poverty and is that whatever the amount of agricultural wealth you may produce in this country, your customer can demand it from you at the net cost of production, which expressed in terms of population and standard of comfort, means that there shall be maintained in Ireland the smallest possible population upon the lowest standard of comfort that will produce and will continue to produce the product which that single customer requires from you.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to go into the general topic of free trade or protection as the last speaker did. I have got two illuminating instances of the point of view of those who are whole-hog protectionists.  I am sorry to see Deputy Lemass leaving the House. There were one or two points in his speech that I would like to deal with. Dealing with this question of margarine, Deputy Lemass went so far as to say that we should prohibit the importation of any margarine.  I wonder will Deputy Lemass go a step further and prohibit the raw materials from which margarine is made?  Would he not allow even one drop of oil to percolate through the tariff wall which he would put up around this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This margarine question, according to the figures read out by the Minister for Finance, affects 104 workers, and according to the output and consumption in this country&mdash;even assuming that we did prohibit the importation of margarine&mdash;we could not hope under any circumstances to do any better than double the number of workers.  Nevertheless, we must import all our raw material, and until some economic policy is adopted in this country which has some semblance of sense behind it, we will be fooling at this question and peddling at it, as has been done by both sides of the House, until the cost of living to the poor people will be such that it will become unendurable.  Deputy Flinn mentioned about foreigners taking up factories in this country.  Is <Col N="314" /> it possible under any circumstances to stop foreigners from taking up factories in this country?  I do not think so.  There are Irishmen who will always link themselves up with foreign capital and do the part for foreigners in this country.  There is another question which arises on the question of guarantees given by the two firms, or, should I say, by one firm only.  The guarantee is with regard to the price. There is no guarantee with regard to the quality.</P>

      <P>I cannot hope to swallow all the theory that was advanced by Deputy Flinn a few minutes ago in regard to the doctrine of protection, nor do I think that anyone will take him seriously in this House when he says he is in favour of any and every protection.  To a countryman looking at the question from what one might call a sensible standpoint, surely the acid test of any impost would be&mdash;will it ultimately benefit the country?  When reading some time ago that a tariff was to be put on boots I found that the argument was used that as we make only one pair in ten there was big room for development.  In regard to the figures that the Minister for Finance read out, I would point out that they show that whilst we import margarine we also export some.  The margin between what is consumed and what is imported is very small.  The figure also that the Minister gave us as to the number of persons employed in the margarine business is very small. I remember that I heard him state that 204 is the maximum.  Our experience of tariffs in this country has been that they have not been in the direction of a reduction in the price of the <Col N="315" /> article.  The benefit that has accrued has been along the line of the labour employed and the wages earned by the workers.  These wages, of course, circulate to other people, to the shopkeepers and to all those who supply them with goods.  To my mind, however, the tax on this margarine is not going to be helpful to the country. There is not room for that larger development that would help the country, seeing that only a small number of hands can be employed in it.  Another aspect of the question is that we are now nearing the time of the cold winter days, and I do not think any of the people of this country will welcome this tariff on margarine as a Christmas gift.  We know that in very many cases margarine is an alternative to butter. Cattle, through many causes, are diminishing in the country, and we cannot hope to have very cheap butter.  Margarine is an alternative to butter.  The question is, in protecting this industry will we be doing the poorer people of the country a good turn at a time when they need all the help they can get, at a time when people are crying out for food?  Why at such a time should we put such a tax on foodstuffs?  As one who comes from the country, as one who has been in touch with the dairying industry, though I did not inflict a speech on the House on that matter yesterday, I must say that I am convinced this tariff will not benefit the country, and I am satisfied that we ought not to put a tax on an article in the manufacture of which there is not much prospect of development and the raw material for which we cannot get here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are concerned, we approach this matter from two aspects.  There is the question as to the increase of employment and whether there will be any undue increase in the price of margarine to the consumer.  I am not going to say that if there is to be a slight increase in the article as a result of the tariff, that for that reason the tariff in itself is bad. But to those who are afraid of this tariff leaning so much upon the poor, <Col N="316" /> and particularly when statements as to how hard it will lean on the poor come from those who are employers, I would say that the best way to insure that the tariff upon margarine will not lean unduly on the poor is that they should pay a wage sufficient for the workers, such a wage as would place the poor in a position to buy, not margarine, but Irish butter.  It struck me, when Deputy Byrne was speaking, and telling us in tones of anguish about the unfortunate poor in Dublin, that we would not have heard that type of speech from Deputy Byrne if there was a margarine factory in Dublin City North.  I must say that I cannot at all agree with the statements made either by Deputy Lemass or Deputy Hugo Flinn.  Deputy Flinn objects to Irish workers drawing their wages from factories which are run by foreign capital.  My objection, and our great trouble in the labour movement is that there are thousands of workers in this country who cannot draw wages at all.</P>
      <P>So far as I am personally concerned, I do not care whether it is foreign or Irish capital once the wages are drawn here.  I would remind Deputy Flinn what the position is to-day, and that, while he objects to Irish workers drawing wages in Ireland from foreign capital, workers are being forced out of the country at the rate of 30,000 a year, and they go away and draw money from industries run elsewhere with foreign capital.  If we are to wait until industries are run and floated in Ireland on Irish capital, then God help the unemployed.  Some of our friends here want not only tariffs to help Irish industries, but also want an embargo on foreign capital.  I suggest that it be put the other way, and I say, put an embargo on the export of Irish capital. There is, however, no use in going into that question, because I can see that the Ceann Comhairle has an idea that it will all be repeated.  I agree with Deputy Lemass, that after nine or ten months the Commission has come forward with proposals which, if they are successful, will give employment to about 200 people out of about 8,000 or 9,000.  If that is the best which the Tariff Commission can do for Irish industry and for workless people, the sooner it is abolished the better.</P>

      <P>I wish first to congratulate the Executive Council and the Tariff Commission upon giving us a decision.  That decision was, no doubt, some time in coming, and I may say that the question of a tariff on margarine is one in which I have taken an interest for nearly five years.  For reasons which I need not go into, I had temporarily to suspend that interest five years ago.  I have no hesitation in saying that Waterford, in particular, and the Saorstát in general, regard this tariff, though a small beginning, as a very excellent one.  There have always been very friendly relations between Cork and Waterford, and I am sure that in the course of time people in Cork or else where with Irish capital can take advantage of this tariff.  The bright spot about the tariff is that it gives employment.  When the factory in Waterford closed down in February last there were about 80 people employed. That meant that there were about 400 people dependent on that industry. Winter is coming, and these workpeople are in a very bad way, but, happily, this tariff will give them employment. Some Deputies seem to be perturbed about the price and quality of the margarine, but, as the Minister has said, guarantees have been given on that point.  The fact that such guarantees were given knocks the bottom out of any argument that could be put up against the imposition of the tariff.  I am not going to endeavour to give a dissertation on protection or free trade. I am at one with the Government in what has been described, I think, by some of our friends on the Opposition Benches, as a milk and water policy. I am out for protection with discrimination. I think that certain factories which are in existence should be protected. I can say for Waterford that this tariff will be very welcome to the people there.</P>

      <P>We heard so much about creameries and milk yesterday, and as we are dealing with margarine to-day, I am afraid that we will not be able to look a cow in the face in future. There is something to be said for prohibition in this case, as advocated by Deputy Lemass, in spite of what other Deputies seem to think.  We do not, for example, know from the Minister if <Col N="318" /> there were any special recommendations made by the Tariff Commission as to whether there should be discrimination between the different classes of margarine.  There is a very important aspect of the matter, namely, that this threepence in the lb. duty may not be sufficient protection, because there is a wide difference between the various qualities of margarine.  There is, first of all, the cheap kind made from vegetable oil.  It contains powdered nickel, which remains in the margarine until it is eaten, and it is held by many authorities to be inimical to public health.  There is the better-class margarine which is vegetable oil churned with a proportion of milk to ensure that there is a proportion of butter in the margarine to give a butter flavour.  The firms in England who can get the vegetable oil in Liverpool are in a better position to produce the cheaper class of margarine than we are, because the oil has to be imported here first.  We in this country are in a particularly happy position to be able to produce the better-class margarine, because we have the milk and the butter in conjunction with the vegetable oil. As I say, this threepenny duty may not be sufficient to ensure that the cheaper class margarine will not be imported and sold here because there is nothing to tell the man in the street, the ordinary consumer, whether that margarine is a poorer class, made from vegetable oil plus powdered nickel, or whether it is made from vegetable oil plus butter.  If you had prohibition, and not this threepenny duty, there would be no difficulty in distinguishing, because the cheap and foreign article, which is held by some authorities to be inimical to public health, would not come into the country at all.</P>

I think at this stage it is only right to say that two can play at that game.  Ninety-eight per cent. of our exports are taken by England and Northern Ireland, and if you prohibit the importation of margarine or other articles later on it is quite on the cards that England may <Col N="319" /> prohibit the importation of butter from Ireland.  The result would be a very serious one to this country, and, while I am in agreement with selective tariffs on goods that could be manufactured in Ireland, I think it is high time that the word &ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; should be very carefully used.</P>

In the event of this proposal going through, I ask the Minister is he prepared to consider the idea of a tariff such as exists in Austria?  Where a duty is imposed on foodstuffs imported into Austria if it is found that the internal manufacturers use this tariff for the purpose of increasing the prices, the tariff is immediately reduced or suspended, or put out of operation altogether.  Is the Minister prepared to consider some proposal in that regard which would react unfavourably on those who take advantage of a tariff for the purpose of making the consumers pay an excessive price?</P>

      <P>I think if the policy of the Government was ever justified on any particular question their policy has been eminently justified by the course this debate has taken. The whole question of a tariff is so difficult and complex that it seems almost impossible to arrive at a logical conclusion on it.  We have had placed before us to-day two plain facts.  The first is that we are going to tax margarine, which is the main food of the poor, for the benefit of 187 hands.  Before any tariff can possibly be justified, according to the rule of economic science, we must have a result giving us greater advantages than the benefits it takes away.  A question we ought to ask ourselves in considering this matter is, are the people of Ireland, whose staple food, margarine, is going to be subject to a tariff which amounts to an additional 3d. in the lb. to the consumer, to receive greater benefits from this tariff than the advantage they had <Col N="320" /> without it?  It has been shown here that as far as guarantees are concerned they are of a most unsatisfactory nature.  We had one guarantee from Messrs. McDonnell, and it has been said on the other side that they belong to the foreign firm of Jurgens, but whether that be true or not I cannot say.  They gave a guarantee both as to price and quality.  The second firm that appeared before the Commission, Messrs. Daly, would only give a guarantee as to quality and not as to price.  The third firm, Messrs.  Dowdall, have entirely withdrawn from the bargain.  Was there ever anything like such a commentary on the whole net effect of tariffs?  I thought it was rather unworthy on the part of a Deputy on the Labour Benches to suggest that my colleague, Deputy A. Byrne, with whom I am not always in agreement, would oppose this tariff because there was no factory in the north side of the city. I also come from the North City.  We want some information from the Minister before we can accept the tariffs as now formulated and introduced.  The Minister clearly said, in his opening statement, that the cost of Irish production is higher, and probably always will be higher, than that of the imported article.  Here is positive proof, in my opinion, that the imposition of this tax is a tax on the poor for the benefit of 140 or 180 hands engaged in the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider the policy of tariffs we seem to think that this country is a continent and not an island.  We forget the smallness of the home market, and we forget that unless we have a market of some considerable size the imposition of a tariff is practically valueless.  Some time ago I was approached with regard to a soap factory that has been opened here.  I had a conversation with one of the heads of the firm, Lever's, and I suggested that possibly in the future we would be making &ldquo;Sunlight&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rinso&rdquo; in this country.  He said no, because the cost of setting up machinery for that purpose was high and the market small, and it would never pay to set up that machinery.  What we should aim at is to do the least possible harm to the country and the greatest possible amount of good.  I suggest that it is <Col N="321" /> very doubtful if this tariff will be of benefit to the country, and certainly it will not be of benefit to the unfortunate poor.  The tariff with regard to rosary beads is not so important.  It is limited to a period of five years, but with regard to margarine we are giving permanent protection, and to a firm which we are told is a foreign firm. We do not know whether or not that is true.  This whole question is very difficult and needs the most careful consideration of the House.  I should say to our friends on the opposite side that I think that as far as tariffs are concerned their action has not hastened the action of the Government in a particular way.</P>

      <P>I would like to avoid a general dissertation on the question of tariffs on this particular item, but I do not want to allow these resolutions to pass without expressing the opinions I hold on these particular tariffs, with perhaps slight reference to the general question of tariffs.  I am rather surprised Deputy Davin did not inform the House that I had opposed the appointment of a Tariff Commission. Doubtless he would if I do not do it now.  I did oppose the appointment of a Tariff Commission, but when a democratic Assembly of this kind takes a decision I think it is the duty of the members of the Assembly to accept it.  I opposed the Tariff Commission as a protest against the general ramp which was going on through the country at the time in an endeavour to stampede the people into a policy of <Col N="322" /> general protection.  I have never held any idea other than that once we decide to impose tariffs the only way to have them examined and imposed is by means of a Commission.  It is quite out of the question for a deliberative Assembly of this kind to examine into and decide whether a particular article is entitled to a tariff or not.  The cardinal principle on which we based our opposition to tariffs was that they have a general tendency to increase the cost of living and thereby increase the cost of production.</P>
      <P>I have never said otherwise than that if a tariff could be shown not to increase the cost of living I would not be opposed to it.  It seems to me that there are cases&mdash;isolated cases perhaps&mdash; where tariffs can be shown not to increase the cost of living, and there are cases in this country where tariffs have not increased the cost of the article tariffed.  There is no good in closing one's eyes to facts, and the fact has been impressed upon me that certain tariffs have not increased the price of the articles tariffed.  I have in mind a particular tariff, which was perhaps accidental, but was no less a tariff&mdash; the tariff on tobacco and cigarettes&mdash; which has not increased the cost of these articles.  It does seem that there are concrete examples of articles being tariffed without increasing the cost of the articles, and, therefore, not increasing the cost of living and the cost of production by increasing the cost of labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Farmers' Group are prepared to give our support to these tariffs because they do not increase the cost of living.  We have definite guarantees that the tariff on margarine would not increase the cost of living. I have more than once put up to those who are demanding tariffs the question: Would they give absolute and binding guarantees that the tariff would not increase the cost of the product if the tariff was used to a certain extent as a prohibition of imports; that quality for quality, and price for price, there would not be any change to the disadvantage of the Irish consumer? This is the first case that I have seen of a definite tangible guarantee to that effect being given.  If any guarantee of that kind can be given in regard to any <Col N="323" /> tariff which it is decided to impose, and if precautions were taken to see that the guarantee was carried out, I cannot see how a tariff of that kind could do harm to the country, whereas it might do good.</P>

      <P>If that is regarded as unparliamentary by you, sir, and a statement that I should not make, I withdraw it.  Deputy Flinn, having in mind the interests of the Cork manufacturers of margarine, to my mind, elaborated a most extraordinary argument in regard to the principles of protection, with particular reference to the protection of margarine.  So far as I could gather, his idea is that no manufacturer who applies for a tariff should be granted a tariff unless he is, in the first place, an Irishman, and, in the second place, prepared to use no capital but Irish capital in his business.  If I understand his words, that, in a nutshell, is what the Deputy put before the House.  If that is a sound argument we ought to take steps immediately to see that the Imperial Tobacco Company is taken out of Ireland&mdash;the Imperial Tobacco Company has no business here; any company which is financed by outside capital has no business in this country.  If that is a sound argument, the great Continent of America, and other great countries which have built up their industries from outside capital, have been following an unsound principle from the start and have built on an unsound foundation. My belief is altogether different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if we are to have industries here we must encourage capital from all sources and we should be glad <Col N="324" /> to get capital whether foreign capital or Irish capital.  It seems to me, in many cases, that it is much easier to get foreign than Irish capital.  Irish capital is timid in regard to the exploitation of Irish industries&mdash;much more timid than foreign capital.  If that is the argument put forward from the Benches upon which Deputy Flinn sits, I think it is not an argument that is likely to lead to the industrial development of the country.</P>
    <P>While I am giving my approval to this tariff, it is practically altogether on the guarantee given that the price of the article will not be increased.  I want to see the Government in control of the economic affairs of the country going slowly and very slowly in the direction of tariffs.  We have heard already that fifty per cent. of the articles of a tariffable nature which we import are tariffed, and I think that anything in the nature of a general development of protective tariffs must have the effect, unless guarded as this particular tariff is guarded, and as other tariffs are not guarded, of increasing the cost of production.  Anyone who has the interests of the agricultural community at heart must know that they are being almost crushed out of existence by the high cost of production, the non-decrease in cost of production, while their prices are going down.  That industry is competing in an outside market, as it must compete, and it is in such a position that its main articles of production are incapable of being protected.  We have no means at our disposal for increasing the prices of these articles.  We must avoid every possibility, therefore, of increasing the cost of production and the cost of living of those who are engaged in that industry.  It is for that reason that I urge on the Government the advisability of going very slowly on the tariff question at present. Otherwise I believe it would be ruinous to the main industry of the country. We are not a self-contained country, and we cannot become a self-contained country within any reasonable time. Anybody can see that we must continue to find a market for our agricultural produce in outside countries, and if we, in a foolish endeavour to bolster up a variety of industries, many of which <Col N="325" /> may be quite unsuited to the conditions in this country, and many of which may never have a chance of flourishing or continuing to exist except purely on the home market, we will run the danger of killing the goose that lays the golden egg by killing the agricultural industry through increasing its cost of production. For that reason I believe that the method of careful selection of tariffs, and only imposing tariffs which do not increase the cost of living, is the only justifiable one, once you start to put on tariffs.  I believe these tariffs which are being introduced to-day will not have any appreciable effect on increasing the cost of living on the farming community, and, therefore, we do not oppose them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some points mentioned in the course of the debate by Deputies that I would like to refer to before it concludes.  While out of the Chamber, I am informed, Deputy O'Hanlon was inquiring whether we would also advocate a prohibition on the importation of the raw materials used in the manufacture of margarine in the country.  The note of his observations was taken by Deputy Fahy, and I can hardly think he got it right, because it appears so very nonsensical. Of course we would not prohibit the importation of raw materials. What Deputy O'Hanlon is perhaps not aware of is that these raw materials are no more native to England or Holland than they are to this country, and that the manufacturing concerns in England and Holland must also import these raw materials.  What is a fact is that according to the figures the Minister gave we did import into this country these raw materials from which we manufactured £153,000 worth of Irish margarine, which we exported and sold at competitive prices in the markets of the world.  That fact is the best guarantee that Deputies can have against any decrease in quality or increase of the price of margarine because of its protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shaw raised a point which causes me considerable doubt as to whether he knows what we are discussing. He wished to know whether England would not retaliate in consequence of the imposition of a tariff for the <Col N="326" /> protection of the Irish margarine industry by prohibition.  I would remind Deputy Shaw that we are discussing the imposition of a tariff of 3d. per lb. on margarine, which the Minister has assured us is practically the same as prohibition.  Therefore I shall leave it to the Minister to reply to Deputy Shaw, knowing that he is likely to have more influence with him that I can have.</P>
    <P>As to the points raised by Deputy Heffernan, I am afraid I would have to wait until the Official Report is published before it would be possible to cover them all.  But I assure him there will be no need for him to urge upon the Ministry the advisability of hastening slowly.  In fact it appears to me Deputy Heffernan is moving much faster in the matter of tariff than the Ministry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks I made in connection with prohibition were not confined to margarine.  I said I was sorry to hear from a large Party the suggestion of the prohibition of any article that could be made in this country.

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Redmond asked was the Waterford output of margarine larger than that of Cork.  It is much larger.  I am not in a position <Col N="327" /> to give the comparative figures, but comparative figures were submitted to the Commission&mdash;I mean the actual figures of output&mdash;and a great deal of detail was given, but it is not information that I have at present.  However, the Waterford plant is very much larger than either of the other two and larger than both combined.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell indicated that certain promises given in the past by people looking for tariffs had not been kept.  That is so, but there is a difference between a promise made by McDonnell's of Waterford and promises made by, shall we say, the Glass Bottle Works.  McDonnell's plant was inspected by people who also had inspected other plants.  A great deal of inquiry took place as to whether McDonnell's could fulfil their promise. In the other cases no machinery was set up and no particular steps were taken to inquire into the ability of the firms to fulfil the promises they gave.</P>
      <P>The Tariff Commission specifically states it will pay no attention to a guarantee given by a firm unless satisfied by examination that that firm was in a position because of the type of plant, suitability of the premises, and so forth, to carry out the guarantee in full.  I do not think this is the time to discuss the question as to whether there should be prohibition in certain cases rather than tariffs.  I just content myself with saying that, in my opinion, when we are considering the best means of fostering industry here, the number of cases in which prohibition would be suitable would be very small, whereas tariffs would be suitable in the great majority of cases. There might be a few cases in which neither tariffs nor prohibition would be suitable and where some sort of direct subsidy would be necessary, as in the case of sugar beet, but I do not want to argue the matter at length at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tariff on margarine will not be expensive to administer.  It will practically eliminate the importation of margarine and, consequently, no additional customs staff will be required. Deputy Byrne asked whether there would be certain provisions in the Bill. <Col N="328" /> I do not know whether he meant provisions enabling the tariff to be immediately removed if the prices were higher than British prices or whether he meant provisions to impose penalties on firms if they made their prices higher than prices in Great Britain.  I would not be in favour, at any rate at present, of taking any power to remove tariffs without coming to the Dáil.  So far, there is no power, as our law stands, to impose or increase tariffs by any sort of Executive action, and I would not be in favour of taking power to remove a tariff by Executive action.  Consequently, I could only undertake that a definite scheme of supervision will be set up and that the prices quoted by the Irish firms will be compared with the prices quoted for similar qualities by outside firms, say in Great Britain, and that there will be tests of quality regularly.  I can undertake no more than that.  If the checks and these tests indicate that promises made by the firms are not kept, then the matter will be brought to the attention of the Dáil with a view to the tariff being removed if necessary.  But I do not think the power should be taken to enable the Executive, for instance, to determine that the guarantee is not being kept and to remove the tariff immediately.</P>
    <P>I could not quite follow Deputy Flinn.  I am not quite sure whether he was arguing in favour of the Douglas credit scheme or in favour of the abolition of the income tax. His remarks did not seem to me to relate very closely to the subject we were discussing.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies have talked about the question of enterprises here being owned by foreign capital.  I do not think that the coming in of foreign capital is an evil.  On the other hand it is better to have our enterprises owned by Irish capital.  I do not want to say that there is very much difference between Irish capital and foreign capital, but there is just this about it, that I think a firm controlled by foreign capital, an undertaking which is merely a branch of a foreign undertaking, will not expand except to a limited extent. If, for instance, Jacobs had been an English firm originally, and had set up <Col N="329" /> a branch here, I believe that the branch would never have done more than was sufficient to meet the trade here.  If Guinness's brewery had been originally a British undertaking and had set up a branch here, the branch here would never have done more than supply the trade here.  Consequently enterprises which are controlled from outside and are really branches of outside undertakings, will not expand and will not give us the export trade which we might otherwise get.  Apart from that, I do not think there is very much difference. I do not think any evils are likely to grow up that cannot be easily met when they manifest themselves, and I think we would do a great deal more harm than good by taking precautions which nothing at the present time indicates as necessary and which would discourage the opening of an enterprise here.  I think the great thing here is to get these productive undertakings established, to have plant and premises suitable here, to have workers skilled and trained and have the organisations brought into being.  That is the main thing.  If any abuses manifest themselves, as I have already stated, they can be rectified if necessary.</P>

      <P>No.  I do not know what the Deputy is referring to.  If he is talking about the creameries, the fact that a firm was an English firm has nothing to do with the matter.  It is proposed to buy out the Irish-owned concerns just the same.  What had to be decided was whether these creameries should be run by the proprietary interests or by co-operative organisations. It was decided that the best interests of the industry dictated that they should be controlled co-operatively and consequently the proprietary organisations are being bought out. The biggest one happened to be under outside control, and it was bought out first, but the fact that it was foreign had nothing to do with the matter at all.  I do not know that there is anything else I could refer to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe, I think, only asked in another form the question asked by Deputy Byrne, and I can only say, as I <Col N="330" /> said to Deputy Byrne, that we are setting up a definite scheme for watching prices and quality, and that the House will be communicated with if there is any departure from the undertaking given by the firm.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  A memorandum has been circulated amongst Deputies which indicates what is the effect of the various enactments which will be continued by this year's Bill.  I think there is only one addition to the enactments which were in the previous Bill &mdash;that is one in part 3 of the Schedule, namely, the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have information concerning two enactments which it is proposed to continue.  One is the Unemployed Workmen Act, of 1905.  In the memorandum circulated to Deputies on this it is stated that the machinery of the Act was not widely availed of in Ireland.  The distress committees were financed out of Parliamentary Grants for the unemployed. The Grants ceased to be voted at the time of the European War and were not received for the purposes of the Act. It is difficult to see then what the purpose of continuing the Act is.  Is it the intention of the Government to encourage the establishment of these distress committees, and is it their intention to make the necessary Parliamentary Grant for the purpose?  If so, I think I would be opposed to continuing the Act because I feel that the establishment of such committees would merely give the Government an opportunity of putting on the committee's shoulders its own responsibility in the matter of the relief of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other Act on which I would like information is the Workmen's Compensation <Col N="334" /> (War Addition) Act, 1917.  I notice in the memorandum concerning a number of other Acts that it is stated they are being continued pending the introduction of permanent legislation in the near future.  In the case of that Act it is not stated that a Departmental Committee, I think on Workmen's Compensation, met in 1925, if I am correctly informed, and submitted a number of recommendations for patching up the existing legislation concerning the payment of compensation to injured workmen.  One of their recommendations, I think, involved the repeal of this Act which it is now proposed to continue.  I would like to know if it is the intention of the Ministry to accept the recommendations of their Committee and to patch up existing legislation, or whether they propose to do what we here believe to be necessary, namely, to introduce an entirely new system of workmen's compensation.  The present system was devised to meet the needs of a highly industrialised country and is unsuitable here.  We on these Benches stand for the nationalisation of insurance in all its branches, but in this particular matter, the payment of compensation to injured workmen, we believe it is an obvious case for a State insurance scheme.  I would like to know if it is the intention of the Ministry to give consideration to that suggestion?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has circulated a memorandum dealing with the measures which it is proposed to continue.  It would have been helpful if he had included in the memorandum some notes with regard to the measures which are being discontinued or dropped, because one finds it necessary to compare this measure with the one introduced last year to discover what measures are being dropped.  Complaint has been made to me with regard to one of these measures.  It is in connection with the prolongation of the Insurance Act.  It has been represented to me that this will impose a hardship on very many people who under this Act were getting certain benefits in the matter of insurance although they have been unemployed.  Exception is taken to the fact that this Act is being dropped without consultation with any representatives of bodies of workers, of <Col N="335" /> friendly societies or insurance societies. Some explanation is necessary as to why that action has been taken.  I think it is not right that some reference was not made to that in this memorandum, whose object, I take it, was to give some information to Deputies with regard to this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is one Act being continued here that I personally am not in a position to say much about, but as to which there has been a good deal of complaint as regards its working&mdash;that is the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act.  Perhaps a statement from the Minister in charge of the Bill as to these complaints which I am sure must have reached him as they have reached other Deputies in the House, would be advisable at this stage.  Complaints have been made that local authorities are compelled to purchase material under the Act which they could get in their own locality at least as cheaply.  I do not know whether or not there is any foundation for these statements.  I am sure, however, that the Minister is familiar with them, and a statement from him on the matter would be of interest.</P>

      <P>On the question raised by Deputy O'Connell, another point arises in connection with the same Act. I would ask the Minister to pay some attention to it before Deputies are asked to vote for a continuance of the measure.  It is asserted, and I think with a good deal of truth, that the Act is availed of very largely by the officers of local bodies to purchase goods on special conditions&mdash;conditions which they are not entitled to.  Simply because of their connection with these bodies they are able to give orders for their own personal requirements.  I think that has led to a good deal of discontent in connection with the measure, and certainly, to my own knowledge, has caused a great deal of discontent amongst traders.  It is probably a good measure in essence, but I think it is rather too thorough.  It would hardly pay to have tenders submitted and examined for the requirements of a number <Col N="336" /> of local bodies, and then find that the orders from any one institution only amounted to a few pounds a year. Probably it would be a great deal better if combined purchasing were confined to certain important requirements of these bodies and if orders that only amount to a small sum in the year could be purchased in the ordinary way.  It has to be remembered that the hostility of traders towards this measure is a big factor.  Being ratepayers they feel that they have a grievance when they are ignored in connection with orders.  They feel that the Act works to their utter exclusion from any custom.  I suggest that these are matters for the consideration of the Minister.  I also suggest that care should be taken to see that officers of local bodies are not able to avail of the provisions of the Act for their personal advantage, and that the conditions with regard to goods purchased under it should not be so thorough as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would respectfully urge the Minister to amend the Combined Purchasing Act so as to make it more acceptable to the cities and towns outside Dublin.  My information is that so far as Cork City is concerned, combined purchasing has inflicted very grave injury on many of the local shopkeepers and on local industries.  As the last Deputy stated, an amendment of the Act in the direction of naming a figure, £100 or £200 or any figure over the few pounds suggested could be made at which the Combined Purchasing Act might begin to operate.  It is certainly ridiculous to suggest that important local bodies such as the Cork Corporation must purchase small quantities of certain scheduled articles through approved contractors.  The grievance of many local authorities is that they feel the money which is being spent and which will continue to be spent by them, should be spent in the area of charge, or where the rates are paid.  It would make this Act more acceptable, or less unacceptable, to these bodies if amendments in the direction I have indicated were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another phase of the question, and I think in this connection we will find the Minister somewhat sympathetic; <Col N="337" /> that is the effect it has on employment.  I am not going to enter into a discussion on unemployment now. We will have time to do that next week. But I would point to this fact, that the Act has tended largely to increase the number of unemployed in the areas concerned.  Of course it is quite obvious that, where goods are ordered through this central purchasing body, they must, of necessity, come mainly from Dublin, and largely from across the Channel. I understand that many commodities which are not manufactured here are imported.  I could give several instances which would go to show that Irish industries are suffering largely as a result of the operations of the Act.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should amend the Act in the direction indicated by Deputies, so that it will not tend to operate as it does at present, and create unemployment.  It might be suggested that many of those who are unemployed as a result of the operations of the Act would have the alternative of following their employment in the places where the commodities are manufactured.  That would not solve the difficulty.  It would increase emigration, and the object of Deputies on these Benches, in calling attention to these matters, is to see that as far as possible articles required by local bodies will be, if not manufactured locally, supplied after tender by local merchants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRENNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to call the attention of the House to two of the Acts it is proposed to continue.  No. 7 is The Workmens' Compensation (War Addition) Act, 1917, and No. 8 is The Statutory Undertakings (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1918.  Both of these are war-time measures.  The staple industry of the country, agriculture, is at present back to pre-war level.  Any Deputy who has to go to fairs and markets knows that.  It is high time that we began to consider that as far as the laws are concerned we must consider them in the light of the state of industry in the country. These expiring laws should not be continued beyond the period that they were intended to serve.  I do not think it is possible to cut them out altogether at present, but the sooner the legislature remembers that the staple industry of <Col N="338" /> the country is back to pre-war level the better, so that our laws relating to other branches may be brought back to the same level.</P>

      <P>In the matter of the Unemployed Workmen's Act, 1905, I understand Deputy Lemass to say that if we were going to make use of the provisions of that Act he would oppose its continuance, but if we were not he would let it pass.  As a matter of fact, the provisions of the Act have not been used here, and I do not see on the horizon at the moment anything to indicate that the provisions of this Act for setting up special Distress Committees will be used.  But I am anxious not to lose an Act that would enable us to do this if, in very special circumstances, it might be desirable, for one reason or another, to do so.  In the matter of the prolongation of the Insurance Act, 1921, which is not being continued, it is not correct to say that that Act is being dropped without consultation with the various people concerned. The matter has been gone into by the National Health Insurance Commission, and in paragraph 12 of their Final Report they recommend very strongly that it be discontinued.  The Act arises out of the fact that in the period of depression&mdash;1921-2-3&mdash;the Act was passed in order to give an additional period of time to keep in insurance persons who, by reason of unemployment, would drop the rights they had to insurance, and it has been continued from year to year to the extent that there are perhaps on the register of insured persons nearly 90,000 more than there ought to be. Some of these 90,000 people, simply because they have not been traced by the insurance societies, are either dead or have emigrated, or in one way or another not entitled to insurance, will not be requiring it.  But in the mean-time, because they are on the list, certain reserved funds that are part of the finances of the insurance scheme are being drawn on to keep them in benefit. It has been agreed by the insurance societies that it is most undesirable, from the point of view of the finances of the scheme, that the Act should be prolonged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole volume of evidence given before the National Insurance Commission on the part of the insurance societies.  Taking them off the list by not continuing the Act will mean that the reserve fund will not be drawn on to the extent that it has been drawn on, and it is fairly generally conceded that the provisions are not required in the present circumstances. With regard to the Combined Purchasing Act, the position is that the Act expires in June next year, but in actual operation as a statute it has been working only about two and a half years, although the machinery for assisting local authorities to carry out combined purchasing existed before the statute was actually passed.  There is no doubt about it but that very great results in the matter of economy to the ratepayers have been obtained, because economy that came from standardising and from getting a better class of article brought into use has been brought about.  The report of the Local Government Department for the years 1922 to 1925 contains statements of comparison between the prices that were obtained locally before the Act came into being and the prices now obtaining, and to give some idea of the savings that it has been possible to bring about, the following information will be useful:&mdash;The whole cost of combined purchasing for the year ended 31st March, 1927, was £4,115.  During the six months ended 30th Sept., 1927, on gelignite for road purposes, as between the old and the new prices, there was a saving of £2,917, and on one kind of soap&mdash;tallow crown&mdash;the saving has been £662.  The total saving on these two articles during six months was £3,579, or 87 per cent. of the total cost that the different local bodies were called upon to bear as a result of the operations of the Act for twelve months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult for the Department to get complete statistics as to the saving that there has been, for the reason that the Department is a contract-making one and does not systematically collect statistics.  We have come to the time when we realise the value of the Act. <Col N="340" /> For instance, the County Board of Health in Kerry estimates that it saved £3,000 last year, and the cost of the Act to Kerry was £113.  The Board of Health in North Tipperary estimates that it saved £1,000 last year, at a cost to it of £76.  The conditions with regard to mental hospitals have been particularly stable for some years, and we are able to take these institutions and see from our experience in regard to the main items of expenditure in them that there has been a steady decrease in the average cost per head.  Whereas in 1923 the cost per head for clothing was 68/1d.; in 1924 it was 67/1.; in 1925 it was 57/1d., and in 1926 55/1d., so that the cost has been brought down pretty steadily from 1923.  The same applies to bedding and furniture, which were 36/- per head in 1923 and 28/11 per head in 1926.  Statistics are available to show us that very great savings have been made throughout the country.</P>
    <P>When the Act was passing through the Seanad an amendment was brought in making it simply to run for a period of three years.  I would even suggest that the Combined Purchasing Act might be included in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill of next year, so that you would have a period of five years' experience of the working of the Act before you faced the framing of a permanent Bill.  I am perfectly satisfied that there is no Deputy who would not subscribe to a permanent Bill on the lines of the present Act if we were able to put statistics before him in the proper way.  Some misunderstanding appears to exist with regard to it.  For instance, Deputy French, on the 12th October, suggested here that public bodies are being forced, against their expressed wishes, to get their supplies from a central department in Dublin. The supplies are got from practically all over the country.  It is a contract-making machinery that exists in Dublin. Deputy French also suggested that even where goods could be bought cheaply in the country, and bought as well, local bodies are compelled to buy in Dublin.  There is nothing in the Act to prevent a local body from purchasing locally if it can get the same value in price and material, and it is quite clear, from the experience of local <Col N="341" /> bodies, that they are not able to get the same value locally.  It is quite reasonable to expect that where you have a large number of bodies spending between them, on a fair estimate, half a million pounds in the year, combined purchasing and central contract-making must bring them very large savings and must make the financial burden of the ratepayers very much less than it otherwise would be.  I think that Irish industry has been materially assisted by the Combined Purchasing Act.  The statistics are not yet completed, but we have figures that show that for the six months ended 30th September last at least £75,000 has been paid to Irish manufacturers for goods supplied to local bodies.  It is no doubt possible that the larger cities benefit as against the smaller places.  But the Central Supplies Committee consists of five persons, two representing the county councils and councils of county boroughs combined, two representing the urban centres, and one representing the chambers of commerce.  So that, as far as the smaller towns are concerned, they have at least two out of the five representatives on the Committee. They are better represented than the boroughs.</P>
    <P>Whether you could improve your scheme by confining the contracts to a small number of items in which there are very large purchases, I think it is very hard to say.  These are matters that another year's or two years' experience will tell us on what lines we ought to proceed.  It is very hard at the moment to say.  If you take an item like white enamel I find that the price in Cork is 27/6; the trade list price is 11/-.  While you might not use very much white enamel, there is a great difference between 27/6 per gallon and 11/- a gallon.  I think a person would be tempted to say that, even though you were not using very much white enamel, it would be better to pay 11/- for it under the contract of the Central Purchasing Board than, in order to endeavour to support the local people, you should pay 16/6 per gallon extra for it, even though it is a case where local people are concerned.</P>
    <P>These are matters that can be gone into in the meantime, and more information with regard to the Act can <Col N="342" /> be got in perhaps a very short time.  If you watch the extent to which the number of contractors on the trade list has developed you will find that whereas there was a good deal of local purchasing in 1924, there was less in 1925, and less again in 1926.  All this is pointing in the direction that the local authorities saw they were getting better value both in good quality articles, standard articles, and price by buying through the contract centrally made.  Including this Act now in the Expiring Laws Continuance Act will give the House generally, and the Department a better opportunity of seeing what is the result of the Combined Purchasing Act, which was in statutory working for the last two and a half years.  Although it has shown very great returns it is only now beginning to show how great returns are possible. Including it now in the Expiring Laws Continuance Act will mean that we need not make up a new and permanent Bill between this and next June.  We have first to get a lot of work through and, from my own point of view, I would not advise that a new permanent Bill would be undertaken until the year after next.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Minister in all he has stated.  I am chairman of the Limerick Mental Hospital Committee, and I know that several complaints were sent on to the Department in reference to this system and without any results.  For instance, there was an objection made to our taking a local contract for tobacco.  Our Committee objected to the tobacco that was sent down from the Central Purchasing Board.  We could get a superior tobacco for perhaps a halfpenny or a penny per 1b. more.  Still we would not be allowed by the Department to buy that tobacco for the unfortunate patients, and we had to give them bad stuff.  Deputy Bennett, on the other Benches, will, I think, bear me out in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to the question of the administration of poor law relief in the City of Dublin.  I will not delay the House very long, but what I have to complain of is not in any way due to the Commissioners, and I do not want to blame them in any way for what is going on.  I find that in all the cases <Col N="344" /> that a Deputy sends to the Commissioners of the Dublin Union for attention, the latter inform them that there are no powers to relieve healthy unemployed persons outside the workhouse. I have here in front of me a relief sheet which the Home Assistance Officers are asked to fill up.  It is Form 40, and in column 18 the officer is asked to state the number of cases of adult males, married or single, relieved on account of want of work.  I want to know what is the meaning of that column if it is not within the discretionary powers of the Home Assistance Officer or the Commissioners to grant assistance to persons whose destitution is due to unemployment. In Section 13 of the Act I understood that those who administer the home assistance have discretionary powers to grant assistance where they think it necessary and when they find children or the wives of unemployed persons practically hungry.  Whilst I am satisfied that every effort has been made by the Commissioners of the Dublin Union to grant relief, I do complain about the treatment of certain cases whose claims I have brought to the notice of the Commissioners.  I will just take one case, and I will give only the initials of the person.  I have here an official report from a supervising officer of the Union.  It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Referring to the attached notice from Mr. A. Byrne, T.D., submitting the names and addresses of a number of cases of unemployed and requesting to be furnished with the results of the investigations, I beg to report the following has been the result of my inquiry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And this is a typical case, typical of the tenements in the City of Dublin, where the poor are helping the poor, where they are practically living by helping one another.  If one man chanced to get a day's work in the week, the one day's pay would be distributed over the whole tenement by way of a little grain of tea and a little plain, dry bread.  You will find that happening in many parts of Dublin at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initials of the case I have in mind are W.R.  That man is aged 40 years, and he has a wife and seven in a <Col N="345" /> family.  The eldest boy is 16 years, and the youngest child is a baby of nine months.  He is an ex-service man, and he served two years in the National Army.  Except for occasional short terms of work, he has been unemployed since he was discharged from the National Army some two years ago. The family are at present living on the occasional earnings of Mrs. Reilly&mdash;the name is out now&mdash;as a charwoman.  The eldest boy earns some money selling papers.  They get some help from the house of Mrs. Reilly's brother, and from the Convent of the Sisters of Charity, where, in addition, the children get schooling.  The report on the case mentions: &ldquo;I would recommend this case for work, for outdoor relief is not within the statutory regulations.&rdquo; During the week in which the report was made, the mother earned 2/- washing a shop; her son, the newsboy, earned 8d. a night&mdash;4/&mdash;and the brother assisted her by giving 2/6. That amounted to 8/6 for the support of the father, mother and 7 children. Of that amount 4/- is claimed by the landlord for the rent of the house, and I am sorry to say that landlords, both private owners and public authorities in the City of Dublin, do not hesitate to demand their rent from those people, whether they are employed or not, and if they do not pay, out they get.</P>
    <P>If that is not a case for assistance from the Poor Law Authorities, I do not know the meaning of this paragraph in the official relief list which asks the officer to make a report on the number of adult males, married or single, relieved on account of want of work.  I hold there is power within the regulations for the authorities to grant relief to that man until such time as he is provided with work.  The Minister will probably point to the latter portion of the report, which states: &ldquo;I would recommend his case for work, for outdoor relief is not within the statutory regulations.&rdquo;  The supervisor states there is not power to relieve healthy unemployed persons outside the work-house. The report mentions: &ldquo;As the majority of the cases forwarded by you have been previously investigated and recommended to the Commissioners for relief, it would, they believe, expedite the claims of the people if you sent the <Col N="346" /> names to the City Commissioners direct.&rdquo;  That is throwing the onus on them to send the cases to the Commissioners. The supervisor has power to recommend for work, but he has failed. He writes on the 3rd September that these cases have been previously reported upon.  After a month or two months they will tell you: &ldquo;We have reported on these cases, recommending them for relief work,&rdquo; but in the meantime the people concerned have got nothing; the people still find themselves in the same position; they are still hungry and are still under notice to quit, and the landlord is still waiting for his money.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and his advisers to go into these forms.  They are at his disposal.  I ask him to see if he can give relief to these people.  I am satisfied that the efforts of the Government to deal with unemployment represent a reasonable attempt, but no matter what they spend on relief schemes within the next three months in Dublin city, it will only touch the fringe of the unemployed problem, and you will have only one or two out of every half-dozen unemployed men getting employment. What are the other four going to do? I say the day is fast approaching when something will have to be done.  This is a relief I do not recommend.  It is a relief hateful to anybody to have to take.  It is hateful to suggest Poor Law relief for unemployed workmen and their children, but I know of very many sad cases in which even this relief would be very welcome, no matter how small the sum is.  Something will have to be done quickly.</P>
    <P>I had one case recently of a man with a family of five children.  I asked him how long ago it was since he was working and he mentioned it was two years.  I asked him &ldquo;When did you last get relief?&rdquo; and he said that the St. Vincent de Paul Society gave him 3/6 last Wednesday week.  &ldquo;Where did you get your breakfast this morning?&rdquo; I asked him, and he said that his wife got a free loaf from Mrs. Kennedy, the baker in Parnell Street, and a can of tea from Sister Paul.  I do not know Sister Paul or to what Convent she is attached, but that free loaf and the can of tea fed a family for one day. That is what is going on in the poorer <Col N="347" /> quarters of Dublin, and in some of the very respectable quarters, too.  Unemployed benefits are exhausted and men cannot get a chance of any relief work. They have to look after their wives and children and they dread the time when the landlords will call on them.  I make a special appeal to the Minister to see if something cannot be done to deal with these cases.  I am told there is a queue every morning in the week at Mr. Kennedy's waiting for the free loaf, and the Convents are visited in the same way.  I am told that in many instances in Dublin children are sent hungry to the schools, and in some of the schools there are not even the free meals that are so often spoken about. I put probably 30 or 40 cases in the hands of the authorities within the past week or two and I sincerely hope that something will be done to alleviate the distress existing in those cases.  I am going to give every one of them the names and addresses of the members for Dublin City and County and I am going to ask them whether they are going to help me in my efforts to assist these people.  There is valuable work to be done, and I think that the time has arrived when everyone should help in an endeavour to relieve the situation.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the appeal that something should be done for the unemployed and deserving poor of Dublin, and while Deputy Byrne has not exaggerated the cases which he has brought under our notice, I would suggest to him that there is only one way in which this problem can be solved and that is by the creation of more employment.  Some efforts must be made in that direction, as what is true of Dublin is largely true of Cork.  There are a number of people unemployed and on the verge of starvation.  I do not want to put the plea that this abnormal condition of things is to be met by huge schemes of relief, as I would much prefer, and I am sure Deputy Byrne would also prefer, to have a national scheme of employment by which men could be put to work.  I believe that a further extension of relief is demoralising.  I am sure that the persons for whom Deputy Byrne speaks would much prefer employment <Col N="348" /> to any other form of relief. I hold with him that there is an urgent necessity to do something to relieve distress caused by unemployment.  It would be a generous gesture on the part of the Government if they could open up, even in a temporary way, relief works which would provide employment for those people whose cases have been presented by Deputy Byrne.</P>

      <P>I would like to join in the plea put forward by Deputy Byrne.  In North City my experience has been identical with his.  We send recommendations for relief to the Commissioners and we receive acknowledgments to the effect that they will endeavour to give relief when that relief is available.  The problem is exceedingly serious, and I am sure that the Minister will do his best to deal with it as sympathetically as possible.</P>

      <P>The problem is, no doubt, a very serious one.  As regards the Dublin Commissioners, they have certain statutory duties and, while outside Dublin county the restrictions regarding home assistance and outdoor relief to able-bodied persons and their dependants have been removed, they were not removed, because of special circumstances, in Dublin city and county.  So far as the Commissioners are concerned they can only carry out their statutory duties, and they are debarred from giving assistance to able-bodied persons and their dependants.  There are powers under the Act of 1898&mdash;Section 13&mdash;by which for a period of two months relief can be given in special circumstances.  The particular state of affairs with regard to Dublin was one of the matters which were gone into by the Poor Law Commission which sat for two years and only recently reported.  While that Commission was still sitting, in 1926, the then Minister for Local Government issued an order under which relief of this particular kind was given in Dublin for a period of four weeks. £11,000 was spent during that period and, approximately, 8,000 people benefited by the work that was done then. The whole experience, however, of the people engaged in the distribution and supervision of the relief was such that <Col N="349" /> they were able to say after the month had expired that they had to recommend that it be stopped.  They reported that this particular form of relief in Dublin, whether in money or in kind, administered through poor law resources, was not to be recommended, that it was to a great extent demoralising, and that it failed in its object.</P>
      <P>Thus the people upon whom I can best rely for advice advised in strong terms against the administration of relief in the way in which Deputy A. Byrne would like.  It appears to be a very simple and reasonable demand, but these people know the city through and through, and their experience led them to advise very strongly against it. The Commissioners are not even attempting to look in that particular direction at present.  It can hardly be said that there are abnormal conditions in Dublin generally, but there are abnormal conditions in the worst parts of the city.  The Commissioners have not confined themselves to a purely statutory and official outlook in the matter.  They are looking around to see what works of development could be undertaken.  At present the conditions of housing contribute materially to the situation. The Commissioners would be prepared to go on with the £500,000 housing scheme in Dublin, and would be particularly keen that some of that housing scheme would be so arranged as to result in the wiping out of some portion of the tenement area as a complement to it.  The fact that they are entertaining this scheme, and that they have their eyes on the tenements, to some extent, shows the spirit by which they are animated, and the way in which they regard their responsibilities to the poor in general.  They have formed quite a number of the men about whom Deputy Byrne speaks, able-bodied men, into a kind of special group of road workers or casual workers, and have put them on particular kinds of work.  They take them on for a short time, pay them off, and then take on others.  They try to provide employment in rotation in that way.</P>

      <P>It is not.  The Commissioners are trying to borrow it and to get it on such terms as will make their work as economic as possible. They are going outside their statutory duties in the matter of relief with a view to seeing in what way they can organise work in the city, how they can relieve distress amongst the able-bodied unemployed and take some of those who have been a long time unemployed and get them into an employable condition mentally and physically. In the discharge of their purely statutory duties I believe that the Commissioners have been very broadminded in their work of relief, and that where people are really genuinely on the borders of sickness, or where they can be shown to be even run down, they accept them as being of the sick poor and deal with them as thoroughly as they can.  The Deputy has referred a big number of cases from time to time to the Commissioners.  I understand from the Deputy that in some cases his communications to the Commissioners have not been actually replied to, but I have the assurance of the Commissioners that they are not able to reply to the large number of letters of that particular kind they get, but they assure me that every case put before them is visited by a relieving officer or some other official, so that the cases actually do come under the visible survey of the officers responsible for relief in the city.  In that way, while perhaps they cannot be given the particular type of relief they would require, they are not lost sight of, or the particular problem lost sight of.</P>

      <P>I am aware there are persons on the lists looking for employment for even two years.  I can say to the Deputy, though it may not be any comfort to him, there is no case that will be referred to the Commissioners that will not be visited, and in so far as they can do anything for that case they will do it.  On the general question, the Poor Law report has been only just received, and in so far as the recommendations of the Commission are going to bring the solution <Col N="351" /> of this problem nearer to us, they will get the most thorough and sympathetic consideration.  The problem is really, as Deputy Anthony says, one of unemployment. We can only deal with that problem in a hard-headed and thoroughly systematic way.  I hope the Deputy will not carry out the threat he has made as to sending the people who come to him looking for assistance to the other Deputies for the county and city of Dublin, for he must know that the other Deputies are up against the same problems, and have more than they can do to give any comfort or assistance to those who come to them. I think it would be a hardship to the distressed to be sent from one Deputy to another.  The Commissioners of Dublin Union are, from one point of view, the best people to whom they could be sent if they come within statutory conditions of relief, and the Dublin Commissioners are the best people to whom they could be sent in other circumstances, for they have a certain amount of employment at their disposal.</P>

As the President pointed out recently, you will always have a weakness here and there in administration.  If there was some general understanding amongst all classes as to what help the State as a whole can bring to the relief of distress, such a case as the O'Sullivan case in Cork would not have happened.</P>
