      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether, without the aid of their employers, <Col N="1628" /> workers engaged in any special industry in the Saorstát can have their claims heard by the Tariff Commission; if he is aware that in various businesses in the Saorstát, employer who were formerly manufacturers are now becoming agents for similar goods of foreign manufacture and are importing same to the detriment of Irish labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the negative for the reason that under the Tariff Commission Act, 1926, applications can be referred to the Commission only when made by persons who are substantially representative of persons engaged or proposing to engage in the production of the goods to which the application relates and I do not consider that workers alone making application apart from their employers are of the representative character required by the Act.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BYRNE</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will make arrangements for the restoration of the Public Cricket Grounds convenient to the Wellington Monument in Phoenix Park, and if he will state whether any efforts <Col N="1630" /> have been made to meet the growing demand for cricket grounds and tennis courts in the Park.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated on the 10th March 1926 in reply to a similar question, the demand for cricket facilities was not found to be sufficient to justify the maintenance of the Public Cricket Ground, and the surrounding fence which was falling into disrepair, was accordingly removed.  The ground has not been allocated to any other purpose, but it forms part of the open park and it is not considered that any sufficient reason has been shown for reenclosing it.  No objection is made to the playing of cricket on the ground. The question of providing a few tennis courts in the Park is being considered by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance how many petitions under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, have been received by the Commissioners of Public Works from the County Cavan, and how far the examination of these petitions has proceeded, and in how many cases it is anticipated that works will be carried out this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 3rd November, 1925, the Commissioners of Public Works received from the Cavan County Council petitions in respect of seven drainage schemes under the Act, but all documents in connection therewith were returned to the County Council on the 9th idem for amendment and have not yet been re-transmitted to the Commissioners.  Consequently it has not been possible to proceed with the examination of these petitions and no works can therefore be carried out this year in that county.</P>

      <P>On the 20th January, 1926, Deputy Lyons received the following letter from my Department:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The applicant was examined by a Military Medical Board on 11th September, 1923, when he was found to be fit for service.  He was again examined on 11th January, 1924, when he was found to be below the medical standard required of men desirous of re-attestation.  In consequence he was demobilised on the expiration of his engagement.  At neither examination was he found to be suffering any disability due to a specific wound or injury received in the course of duty whilst on Active Service.  His claim cannot therefore be regarded as coming within the provisions of the Act.&rdquo;</P>

A certificate was sent in by Dr. Robinson who served with this man in Longford to that effect and surely on that certificate something should be done for this man and his family.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state on what basis the grant of £36,470 under the Trunk Road Scheme has been allocated in Westmeath County; if he is <Col N="1633" /> aware that there are 58 miles and 11 perches of trunk roads in the entire County, of which 10 miles 4 furlongs and 10 perches are under the jurisdiction of the Assistant Surveyor for South Westmeath; if he will state why £34,820 is allocated for 47 miles 4 furlongs and 1 perch, as against £1,650 for 10 miles 4 furlongs 10 perches; and if he will see that the amount is allocated according to the proportion of mileage in each part of the County as follows:&mdash;For the 47 miles 4 furlongs and 1 perch, £29,852; and for the 10 miles 4 furlongs and 10 perches, £6,618.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation, was made on the basis of the amount required to complete the improvement of trunk roads in the County included in the National Scheme after careful inspection by the engineers of my Department and consultation with the Acting County Surveyor.  The Deputy's reference to the trunk road mileage refers no doubt to the trunk road mileage in the National Road Scheme. The £1,650 allocated for the ten miles was for the surface dressing of a road already steamrolled as a result of work carried out under previous grants.  A greater proportion of the National roads in the rest of the County required improvement so that the proportionately greater allocation was made for those roads.  The Deputy will no doubt appreciate that allocations cannot be made on the basis of mileage alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that out of the grant of £20,000 made last year, only £2,000 was allocated to South Westmeath, and the mileage of 10 miles, as specified in the question, has not been steam-rolled from that grant, but out of the estimates of the county council?  Does the Minister think it right that in the allocation of grants a monopoly should be given to one part of the county, and that the other part is not equally entitled to a portion of the grant?  Further, can the Minister tell me on whose authority the grants were allocated?</P>

    <Col N="1634" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>On the advice of my inspectors and the local county surveyors it was decided that this grant of £1,650 would bring this particular mileage up to the same standard as that of other portions of the road on which a considerably greater amount of money is being expended.  That being the case, I do not see how the Deputy can justify a larger expenditure on that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it fair that out of the Government grant of £53,000, £51,000 should be spent on one portion of the county, and only £1,600 on ten miles of trunk road in another portion of the county? Surely there is something wrong.  There are at least ten roads in South Westmeath required to be steam-rolled, even with tar macadam.  I ask the Minister to re-consider the matter, so that allocation will be made in accordance with the mileage of trunk roads.</P>

The owner lodged an objection to this Provisional List, which was allowed by the Judicial Commissioner. The lands were subsequently sold in divisions to local allottees, and have again been inspected.

      <P>By arrangement with the Minister for Justice, and with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, a committee consisting of representatives of the Department of Justice, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Local Government and Public Health has been set up to inquire into and report as to whether, and if so, how far, the existing law relating to the control and regulation of road traffic in all its aspects requires modification, more especially in view of the growth in the use of various kinds of motor vehicles.  The representatives of the Departments referred to are:&mdash;Department of Justice: the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána and Mr. J.E. Duff, B.L. B.Sc.; Department of Industry and Commerce: Mr. T.J. Flynn, Transport and Marine Branch; Department of Local Government and Public Health: Mr. James Quigley, B.E., Chief Roads Engineer (Chairman), and Mr. H.S. Moylan, Secretary to the Roads Advisory Committee.  The Secretary to the Committee is Mr. C.J. Whelan, Roads Section of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, 51 Upper Mount Street.  It is expected the Committee will hold a preliminary sitting at a very early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage we have to admit that all the shine has worn off the Minister's Budget, and even the people who have benefited by a remission of one shilling in income tax have almost forgotten about it; they are wondering what the future holds for them.  I do not propose to go over the whole statement of the Minister, but I have given some slight consideration to that part of it dealing with the remission of one shilling in income tax and I have examined its effects.  I <Col N="1637" /> raised the matter the day the Minister made his Budget statement and I think the effects of the Minister's action are entitled to more consideration.  As an act of Ministerial financial policy it is entitled to more attention than it has been given.</P>
      <P>The remission of a shilling this year has been made possible because we have calculated on a sum of £550,000 being available for the relief of taxation.  In order that that policy shall continue next year, in order that this remission shall be continued in the Budget twelve months hence, the financial position will have to be such that the Minister for Finance then will require to have almost £1,000,000 for distribution.  The Minister's statement indicates that next year in addition to this £1,000,000&mdash; perhaps the figure of £900,000 would be nearer the mark&mdash;there will be £250,000 required and that amount will be payable to Great Britain in accordance with the agreement of December, 1925. The Minister expects to have the £250,000 available from the operations of the Currency Commission.  He also states it is hoped to complete shortly the steps necessary to secure that death duties and shares held by Saorstát citizens in British companies here will come into our Exchequer.  I do not know if the Minister gave any indication of the amount of revenue which he expects will come into our Exchequer as a result of the completion of these steps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He points out that the work of the Tariff Commission may lead to the imposition of some customs duties.  Evidently the policy is that further tariffs are expected and it is hoped that additional revenue will be available because of these tariffs which are likely to be imposed within the coming financial year.  If we put the £250,000 that will come from the Currency Commission against the annuity we have to contribute to Britain, where are we to get the additional money which must be made available in order to continue the policy the Minister adopted this year by the remission of a shilling on income tax?  That cannot be continued unless there is a reduction in our expenditure. The Minister has given us no indication that the money which will come <Col N="1638" /> into the Exchequer through death duties and through the shares held by Saorstát citizens in British companies which do business here will be available, or that the revenue coming from the Tariff Commission will be an amount which will make up the difference between the £550,000 we are giving as a remission to the income tax payers and the additional sum which will be required to continue this remission next year.  For a continuation of the Minister's policy we must look for a reduction in expenditure.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere in the Minister's statement he discusses the question of a remission of duty on beer and spirits.  He points out that the sum of £550,000 would be barely sufficient to give a small remission in the duty on beer and spirits, and that the policy would be not to give the remission of duty on beer alone or on spirits if it were not possible to give it on both.  What has been done by the Minister on this occasion puts a new Dáil and the Minister for Finance in that Dáil in the position that if there is not a very considerable reduction in expenditure there will be no possibility of a remission of taxation to any taxpayers other than those who have got a remission of duty in this Budget, the income tax payers.</P>
    <P>We have to consider that a remission of taxation may mean many things Cheaper postage rates would be a relief of taxation.  On the other hand, a relief of taxation might mean, in essence, an increase in the old age pensions. Last year the Minister undoubtedly left the House under the impression that when there would be anything available for distribution, the old age pensioners would have to get consideration.  Nothing less than £250,000 would be of use to do anything for the old age pensioners.  I feel that the Dáil are in the position that they have gone beyond their means; they have done more than they are able to do in the remission of taxation, and very considerable reductions in expenditure must be effected if even the present remission is to be continued in the next Budget.</P>
    <P>Instead of making it possible to relieve taxation in other directions, it <Col N="1639" /> may even be necessary to increase taxation because of what the Minister has done this year.  It is right that we should clearly see the effects of the policy that the Minister has enunciated. There are many farmers who argue that a remission of the duty on beer would improve the conditions of the barley-growers in many counties, and that argument has been very forcibly made. I feel that there is something in it, but as I see the Minister's policy, there is no prospect that that can be done next year.  It would be absolutely impossible to do it next year unless we can make reductions in expenditure of over one million pounds.  That is exactly what we have to face up to.  Is that possible, and will it be done?  Even admitting the courage of the Minister in giving this remission to the income tax payers, I think that the full significance of his action is not yet thoroughly understood.  The other side of the picture has to be examined, and the problem created will have to be faced up to.  It will not be enough to continue to relieve the income tax payer alone; other tax payers will have to be considered, and the people who are affected by the higher postage rates in operation here compared with Great Britain, and by other taxes that have been imposed in the lifetime of this Dáil, will have to be considered.  The Minister's policy will have to be carried further; more will have to be done by him, and in order that this relief of taxation may be equitably distributed, savings must be effected that will make it possible next year for not one section alone but every section of the community to get some relief from taxation.</P>
    <P>A point was raised by Deputy Johnson that was referred to in the Minister's speech.  The Minister said: &ldquo;The economic conditions of the western seaboard cannot be dealt with without expenditure,&rdquo; and he said also that in certain other respects increases are inevitable. Is this problem to be dealt with this year?  If it is, where is the money to come from?  As far as we can see, expenditure under that head has not been calculated for, certainly not in the statement made by the Minister. That will be an additional expenditure. <Col N="1640" /> Where is the money to be found, and how much is it to be?  I would like the Minister to clear up that position and to give us some further information as to his outlook with regard to the effect of the action which he is now taking, commendable action, undoubtedly, and action which will have far-reaching consequences.  But you cannot continue a policy of relieve ing one section of the community from taxation, and leave others with the feeling that they are carrying a heavy burden, to some an almost intolerable burden, without holding out a helping hand to them.  Deputy Johnson discussed the economic position, and tried to indicate that the prosperity of the country was not as pronounced as the Minister would lead one to believe. Deputy Johnson's figures indicated the very serious decline in our cattle population from 1922 to 1926.  His figures are authentic, and to some of us at least who know the conditions they are simply a confirmation of the case we have repeatedly made.</P>
    <P>In very many areas prosperity is unknown to the agricultural population, and undoubtedly if one were to measure the supposed prosperity with the conditions which we know, we could not support the case made by the Minister or say that it was a true representation of the facts.  One does not like to labour this too much, but it is true that in the rural districts over very wide areas people are not enjoying prosperity, nor anything like it, but are faced with poverty, hard, grinding poverty.  I have always contended, and the Minister himself has also indicated this, that in order to give people courage and make the best of present conditions the Government must help by doing all they can to reduce taxation so that people may feel that they are not labouring, producing and selling merely for the benefit of the tax collector so that he may take all that they have.  The feeling is very strong in the country that men only work so that they may be able to keep the tax collector quiet when he calls, and many people are dispirited.  I confess that I do not see any possibility of a very speedy recovery.  I do not think that economic conditions can be <Col N="1641" /> improved in a day or in a twelvemonth. The decline towards poverty in a sense came with a snap, because prices dropped quickly, but the greatest poverty has only been experienced within the last twelve or eighteen months.  It is as bad now as it ever has been.  We have perhaps just reached bedrock.  I recognise that in days like these, when all types of theorists are advancing arguments as to ways and means to improve things and when the condition of our people is really serious, it is a case of the drowning man ready to grasp at the straw.  Our people are prepared to grasp at anything which would make things better for them.</P>
    <P>I am going to join issue with Deputy Davin.  He is the advocate of a policy for the farmers with which our Party are not in agreement.  It would be as easy for me as it is for Deputy Davin to get up before a meeting of farmers and advocate lightly, without very much consideration for the consequences of its results, the policy that the Deputy is prepared to sponsor. To-day the farmers are everywhere looking for a way out.  They are prepared almost to gamble on the chances of a way out.  But I think we all have to be very careful that any way out we urge will not be to many of them, and to the agricultural industry as a whole, a way down and out.  When Deputy Davin urges that the policy of tariffs should be applied to agriculture he should carefully examine the consequences.  The term &ldquo;Protection&rdquo; makes an appeal to many people, but the application of that policy to agriculture has been detrimental in every country where it has been tried.  I do not think that we have had any indication that it would be more successful here than in any other country, and while we all admit that from the point of view of a man in a barley growing county, who sees a market, as he thinks, at his door which can be closed to all but himself, the temptation is very strong to take action which he thinks may have certain consequences, in my opinion such a man is gambling by calculating that certain benefits will come as a result of such an action.  Holding that view, we who have been for a number of <Col N="1642" /> years in very close touch with the farmers, recognise that it is as easy to turn the farmers' minds and efforts into wrong channels as it is to turn the minds and efforts of other people in this country into unproductive ways.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question has no meaning, and if the Deputy made as close a study of all the problems of agriculture as he has made of the work in which he himself is engaged&mdash;for which we must pay him a tribute&mdash;I feel that he would agree with those Farmer Deputies who declare, even against political expediency, let me say, that the policy that the Deputy is advocating is not the soundest agricultural policy for this country.  Undoubtedly on the tide to-day, under the depressed conditions which farmers are experiencing, men can be carried to political victory by making people believe that this policy is the best.  But in desperate times men will be made to do desperate things and live to regret the consequences of their actions.</P>
      <P>We do not see that hope for agriculture from a policy of tariffs which Deputy Davin professes to see.  It would be much better for the agriculturists in his constituency if the Deputy would set himself to think out whether there were not other ways and means on which the farmers could concentrate by which the same end would be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy puts it to me that I should find a way out for the people for whom he professes to speak, I urge him to examine the problem more fully than he has done, and ask himself the question what would happen if the gamble which he is urging them to engage in has not the results he hoped for.  Is it not better to face up to the difficulties of the position, be candid with these people, say there are risks and dangers, and it may not come off, and let them face the alternative now rather than the disappointment which will inevitably <Col N="1643" /> come to them later on.  Other methods must be adopted by farmers to improve their economic condition. There is general agreement on an agricultural policy which aims at the improvement of methods of production and marketing.  We might, perhaps, discuss the question of production, because it has a relation to the economic position.  It might even be discussed with the other question of emigration, which Deputies labour here at times. The productivity of this country is low, and has been low for a number of years past, perhaps from 1919.  Emigration has been high.  People are leaving the country to seek a living elsewhere, believing that there are great prospects for them, while in the majority of cases they only experience disappointment. There are reasons for the present condition of things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be true to say that the population fleeing from the country was brought up under pre-war economic conditions, when the farmers' plight was not as bad as it is now, when he was emerging from the effects of landlordism, when the markets across the channel were improving, and when he was improving his methods and doing better than he had done before. Then the boys and girls of the pre-war years came to the period of war prices, when there was a higher standard of living, and when they enjoyed conditions that had not been previously experienced by the rural population. Now the conditions have altered, and no section of the people have experienced as great a lowering in their standard of living as those living on the land.  Very many boys and girls who were of school-going age before the war, and have now reached manhood and womanhood, find it difficult to go back to the lower standard of living, and accept the conditions which people in the rural districts must accept if they are to live.  In addition, we have the mentality and outlook created by the revolutionary period.  As a result of all these conflicting conditions, large numbers of the people are leaving the country, because they believe that in some other country they will attain the standard of living which <Col N="1644" /> they experienced here during the war, but which is not to be attained here now.  All that is affecting the productivity of the country.  It has its effect on the area of land under tillage, and the quality and quantity of our products.  We have to live through this phase, and I believe it will pass.  I believe that the farmers will fight their way through it.  Some of them will fall by the way, but the majority will hold on to their farms.  The Government will have to give what encouragement it can to them by the adoption of a policy which will indicate sympathy with them and an understanding of their conditions, and which will make it possible to give a remission of taxation, not to any important influential section, but to the citizens as a whole.  That must be the financial policy that any Government must pursue, which tries to do the best they can for the people.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Minister has at last taken the step of setting up a committee to examine national expenditure. It took a great deal of pressure to get him to go so far.  My view is that he has not gone far enough yet. I was looking up to-day the statement made by Deputy Heffernan, in 1923, when he urged the setting-up of a committee. In 1924, in 1925, and again in 1926 it was urged from these benches.  Not very long ago the Minister for Finance, replying to Deputy Heffernan, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Government has given consideration to all these matters.  The real fact is that, in general, this demand for a committee of inquiry is a parrot cry, and it is not worthy of members of the Dáil to come here and repeat it.  It is all right for the leader writer on a newspaper to throw out any sort of suggestion that could be written brightly about and that would interest the readers of his paper and increase its circulation. He has no responsibility to the people.  But it is up to Deputies to face the thing in a very serious way and to search about in their own minds and see what they want.</P>
    <P>It would have been a good deal better if the Minister had agreed that Deputies <Col N="1645" /> were quite serious when they urged the setting-up of this committee.  The Minister in his attitude on this matter up to the present has not been as satisfactory as we would like.  He rather tried to give the impression that economies could not be effected.  We might almost say that he felt that it was low political tactics to urge the setting-up of any such committee.  I feel that the Minister has not gone far enough.  It is not because other Deputies have already urged that this committee should be something more than a mere committee representing the present administration to investigate the administration of the present Government that I am urging that a body, other than the one which the Minister proposes to constitute, should examine into the question of public expenditure.  A short time ago in discussing the Estimates I urged that what we wanted to discover was not alone whether the present national services could be maintained at a lower figure, but to establish definitely for the future what was requisite and necessary and what could be accepted as a definite standard. We should have from an independent committee a full and thorough examination of the entire administration, so that their report could be accepted by everyone as showing that it would take a certain sum to maintain the essential services&mdash;that the case that is made that previous to the war this country was run for something like £15,000,000, can be met by the report of a body that will be accepted by everybody as competent and impartial. I feel that, no matter what effort is made by the most competent persons in the present administration to examine the whole gamut of public services, there will be a feeling that that is an examination of the administration by the administrators themselves.  The Minister would be doing far better, not alone for his Government but for future Governments, and he would clear the minds of the people as to the cost of maintaining a national Government, if he gave us a group of men independent of the present Government for this inquiry.  I urge the Minister to consider that suggestion because it is all important.  The Minister himself <Col N="1646" /> has been up against it and we are all up against it.  The case is made that there is extravagance and that the examination will be a one-sided one.  I feel that we ought to aim at cutting down the present expenditure by a couple of million pounds.  If a committee is to decide whether that is possible or not, then it should be a committee with wider terms of reference and broader in personnel than the committee the Minister has given us.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone a good way, He has given the lie to the policy he has adumbrated here many times&mdash; that such a committee could do no good and that there was no necessity for it.  He has often made the statement to which I have referred.  He states now that he is perfectly satisfied that economies will be shown to be possible in classes of expenditure that have not been the subject of public propaganda at all.  I urged before that a committee such as we desire to set up would be able to do good work. When the Minister asked us to point to possible savings in discussing the Estimates, we were in the position of men who were asked to say what kind a house was while standing outside and looking in.  Perhaps, in the future the Minister will be prepared to go a step further.  To educate the public as to the necessary cost of self-government, there must be a complete and thorough examination of the whole financial position that will show that if we are to have home government we will have to provide a certain amount and that less will not do.</P>
    <P>One other point was referred to by Deputy Heffernan.  The Minister said &ldquo;We must seek for economy but we must not forget we have an undeveloped country and that our real hope is in development.&rdquo;  I am in agreement with Deputy Heffernan when he says that that is not a correct representation of the position.  We are not a new country.  Our country has been populated for thousands of years and it is not correct to say that it is undeveloped.  The genius of our people may not be cultivated to the extent that we should like but our country would be only undeveloped if it possessed certain national resources <Col N="1647" /> which could be developed but which were not.  Our natural resources are limited.  We have not, for instance, the supply of coal which built up England's greatness.  We have no great wealth in minerals of any kind. We have, of course, fertility of soil. But I think what we have to develop is the intelligence of our people, that it may be utilised for the advancement of the country.  It would be foolish of us to believe that our country is really undeveloped.  We have certain natural advantages from the agricultural point of view, inasmuch as we are beside the world's greatest market for agricultural produce.  From the point of view of climate and fertility of soil, we are favourably situated but, otherwise, the resources of the country which give room for development are very limited indeed.  It is not correct to say that we are in the position of places like Australia, Canada or the newer countries.  If the progress made across the Channel has not been made here, there are reasons for it.  Our country has lacked many things essential to industrial progress.  In addition, our people have been mainly agricultural and on that account they have a different outlook from people across the Channel.  Our policy here should be based on a sound conception of the possibilities of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Budget, I recognise, might have been made more popular. The Budget is not unsound, but I should like an assurance from the Minister as to its effects on future Ministries.  Is he satisfied that it will be possible to continue the policy he has laid down in his statement, and at the same time give relief to those sections of citizens who have not benefited by this Budget?  If he can give us that assurance, then we will agree that the statement of the Minister was very sound and that it contains possibilities which we did not see when he was making his statement.  If the Minister is not able to give us that assurance, then he will have placed a future Minister for Finance&mdash;whether that future Minister be the present Minister or not&mdash;in a very unfavourable position indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in <Col N="1648" /> the chorus of congratulation which has been extended to the Minister on his Budget.  I am satisfied that he has devoted the sum at his disposal to the most useful purpose in the interests of the country.  My congratulations to the Minister are somewhat damped because he has not agreed to remove that objectionable tax&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;objectionable&rdquo; after consideration &mdash;known as the Corporation Profits Tax.  That is a most inequitable and unfair tax.  Even though its burden has been considerably eased since it was first introduced, the principle of the tax still remains, and so long as it remains so long will I continue to attack it.  We have induced the Minister to go further on this occasion than he has gone on any previous occasion, because he has told us that, in its present form, this is a tax which should not be continued permanently.  I do not agree with Deputy Johnson when he says that this Budget has done nothing for unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My method of meeting unemployment is by the provision of employment. Possibly other Deputies have some other panacea for that particular ill, but that is mine.  This Budget will ease the burden on industry.  For years those in industry have been complaining that their efforts were thwarted by the burden of taxation. It was heavier here than in England and consequently it was difficult to get the capital necessary for the development of industry to flow into this country.  Looking at the Budget from that point of view, what more could have been done towards meeting that difficulty and the difficulty of providing employment for the unemployed than has been done by the Minister for Finance in reducing income tax?  Because of that reduction we can now look forward to the possible and, I hope, probable flow into this country of the necessary capital for the development of industry.  Therefore, I cannot agree with Deputy Johnson when he states that this Budget has done nothing to deal with the problem of unemployment.  In considering the question of unemployment, the view still seems to be held by those on the Labour Benches that the Government could do a great deal more than it has <Col N="1649" /> done towards promoting industry and reducing unemployment.  I have urged on several occasions that the powers of any Government in that direction are exceedingly limited.  All a Government can do is provide an atmosphere in which industry can develop.  Then it is for those engaged in industry, both capitalists and labour, to see what they, on their part, can do towards developing industry.  I have urged also in this connection, that we, capitalists and labour, have not done all that we might have done.  We still stand aloof instead of co-operating; sitting down together with those on one side putting their difficulties before those on the other and joining together to see how best we can solve our difficulties in the interests of the nation. I am quite satisfied that a great deal of the success that we hope to achieve because of this reduction in income tax will be lost except capital and labour make up their minds to meet at a common table and deal with this problem in a business-like way.  I have urged that previously, and I am sorry to say that one's efforts have not been met in the spirit that one would like to see.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can put forward his own explanation in that connection. I can only continue to urge, on behalf of those engaged on one side of industry, that as far as I am concerned I think every effort should be made to bring about such a conference. While I have said that a Government can only provide an atmosphere in which industry can flourish, there are other elements to which we must attach some importance.  We must have, in addition to the atmosphere, confidence and conditions that inspire confidence in order that capital may flow in here. We have had the question of tariffs raised here on innumerable occasions. There is hardly a morning that one opens his paper that he does not see some new suggestion made with regard to tariffs.  May I urge that all that shows a want of settled policy and of settled conditions.  As long as you have your fiscal system in this unsettled <Col N="1650" /> state, so long will we have capital flying shy.  Capital is not going to invest in an industry in which the conditions may be all altered in the space of a few months.  Therefore, I urge that in the interests of industry and the wider interest of unemployment, we should get this fiscal policy of ours settled and settled soon.</P>

      <P>In that connection I might say that it is not alone our fiscal policy that is disturbing industry and that is likely to stop the flow of the capital which we should naturally expect as a result of the casing of this burden of taxation, but also the want of a rest from legislation.  I do not know any country in Europe, I might almost say in the world, in which a rest from legislation would be more advantageous than in this poor little isle of ours.  Deputies here for the last three or four years know the amount of legislation that we have had to deal with.  Many of us, I think, are coming to the conclusion that we have dealt sufficiently with legislation, and that the country ought to have a rest from any more of it</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one other statement in the Budget that was of interest to commercial men.  It was referred to at some length by Deputy Baxter, and that is the setting-up of a retrenchment committee.  The Minister did not like to call it a Geddes Committee.  It does not matter very much to us commercial men what you call it so long-as a committee is set up to inquire into this very important matter.  It is only right to say on behalf of the Minister that, in the setting up of this departmental committee he has followed very much on the lines adopted in Great Britain.  There a departmental committee sat for a number of years to inquire into this question of retrenchment. It made a report which the Government of the day did not see its way, in view of the near approach of an election, to take under its wing, as it would probably prove an unpopular cry.  The work of that departmental committee, as is known to those who have made any inquiry into the subject, was ultimately taken over, after consideration, by a larger committee, <Col N="1651" /> an independent committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Geddes.  That committee adopted very largely the recommendations of the departmental committee.  While possibly that was the best line to adopt in Great Britain, I am not at all certain that it is the best line to adopt here.  The problem before them in Great Britain and the one before us here are not at all similar from my point of view.  As I pointed out on a previous occasion, our Government has been established for the purpose of governing some four million people, but it is modelled on the lines of Great Britain, whose Ministry is modelled for governing 44,000,000 people.  The system of government necessary for dealing with a population of 44,000,000 is not necessary in a small State where you have only some 4,000,000 people, so that it is not wholly a question of departmental retrenchment in this country.  It is a very much larger question, a question as to whether our system of departments and our whole system of government is a proper one for a small State like ours.  That, to my mind, is a very much bigger question than should be submitted to a departmental committee, composed, no doubt, of excellent civil servants, but the civil servant, from his training and environment, is naturally a man of limited outlook.  In a matter of this kind you want to get minds that are more experienced and more trained in other departments to deal with this larger problem.  That is why I am disappointed that the Minister only proposes to set up a departmental committee to deal with this very large and difficult problem.</P>
    <P>May I say, in addition, that I am somewhat opposed&mdash;I do not speak without some experience&mdash;to this policy that the Government has adopted on all occasions in which it desires to set up committees.  They are all departmental committees.  From what I have seen of the working of these committees I am not satisfied that they are the best form of committees in the interest of the nation.  What happens in connection with most of those departmental committees is this, that you get one or two representatives from the Department of Finance, one <Col N="1652" /> or two from the Department of Industry and Commerce, one from the Department of Lands and Agriculture and one possibly from some other department, and what seems to be the duty of these particular officials on these particular commissions is to watch the interests of their own departments.  I do not think that is likely to achieve the object we have in view in appointing commissions.  Commissions are appointed very largely by Governments, as we understand them to-day, from representative men, having some experience in the particular matter under consideration.  They are appointed from different sections of the House.  In that way you get brought together different views that you would not get if the choice were limited to one particular party in the House.  I would like to see a reversion to that particular type of commission.  We all have had experience of that particular type of commission, and I must say from my experience, my limited experience, if I may put it that way, of Parliament, that we are more likely to get useful suggestions from a commission so constituted than we are from a departmental committee.  I would like to urge on this Government or an any Government we may have in the future, that they should take a bigger viewpoint in the appointment, of commissions than has been done in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>So many Deputies have spoken oil this that I feel that I will not be able to dispel some of the notes of despair and despondency that have been struck.  Practically everyone who stood up spoke in a &ldquo;caoineing,&rdquo; despondent note.  It is no wonder that so many people are leaving the country, and it is no wonder that the benches here are practically empty. Deputy Baxter spoke for nearly an hour, and in that hour he struck just one little note of hope, that is, that agricultural produce had reached bedrock. Even dealing with the reduction of income tax, some Deputies struck the same note that the Press of Northern Ireland and of England struck.  I was not surprised that Deputy Connor Hogan did so.  There is no doubt that the reduction in income tax will do an amount of good, <Col N="1653" /> not alone to industrialists, but to the individual borrower of the country, because it will make money very much cheaper to the borrower.  I can visualise the National Loan, within the next week or month, going up to 105.  I say that with income tax at 3s. in the pound the National Loan would be better at 105 than at 101 with income tax 4/- in the pound.  That will be of the greatest advantage to the Minister in raising the new loan that he proposes to raise.  On the other hand, if it goes to 105 it will be at a disadvantage as compared with, say, the 5 per cent.  War Loan in England, and with all fixed interest or debenture stock.  A person who invests £1,000, for instance, in the National Loan will get only about £40 interest, while if he invested it in the 5 per cent.  British War Loan he would get £42.  That will be a disadvantage to the country, because it will only encourage a greater flow of money out of the country.  I believe there is in this country at the present time about £250,000,000 in foreign investments, and about £150,000,000 in deposits in the banks, making close on £400,000,000 in all.  At the same time, there are many farms unstocked, and so much unemployment.  It is pitiable that that should be so, but it is well that we have it to our credit somewhere. Perhaps if our public representatives struck a different note from that which they have been striking we would get a good deal of that money back.  I wonder would the Minister consider an amendment to reduce income tax to 2/- in the pound on wealth produced in the country, and to take nothing off money from investments abroad.  That would encourage some people to bring back their money and invest it here.  I would urge the Minister to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson referred to the question of the live stock population of the country in comparison to what it was some years ago.  He seemed to suggest that the Government were really responsible for the decreased live stock population.  It would be well that the responsibility should be placed on the right shoulders.  Speaking for Limerick, which I have the honour to represent, Limerick produced <Col N="1654" /> eight or ten years ago about a quarter of the live stock of the country.  Unfortunately in 1922 some people were advised to adopt Soviet methods and wave the red flag over creameries in county Limerick.  The result was that some farmers did not supply milk to the creameries.  They spilled it rather than do so.  These people got no compensation for what they lost.  The workers, on the other hand, foolishly burned some of the creameries, and yet they expected that the farmers would continue to keep dairy cows and produce young stock and butter in those circumstances.  I know some parishes where dairy farms have been broken up to the extent of over 1,000 cows.  Naturally, they could not do otherwise because they were not able to get the cows milked or butter made to advantage.  That is one reason for the reduction.  Another reason was that in 1924 our exports of live stock were nearly double those of the average year for ten years previously.  It is an old saying that you cannot eat your loaf and have it. We cannot export our stock and have them when we do not produce live stock at the same time.  But the dairy scheme recently introduced by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture has brought confidence to the farmers in County Limerick.  They are getting back to the dairy cows again and I do hope that next year the population of live stock will be up to what it was any year for the past fifteen or twenty years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson also referred to the pig population.  It is well known that there was a big strike in 1923.  Pigs were then making a fairly good price. Farmers could get about £15 per head for pigs a few days before the strike, but when the strike started the price fell to seven or eight pounds, with the result that the farmers and indeed a good many poor men who fattened one or two pigs had to bring their pigs home and let them go back into lean again.  When they did get a market not only did they re-fatten them but they fattened the breeding sows and got out of pigs altogether.  I just mention that to let the Dáil know who really is responsible.  The farmers are not responsible and the Government <Col N="1655" /> are not responsible for the decline in the pig population.</P>
    <P>Another point was made with regard to the reduction in tillage.  The same argument applies to that.  There was a strike on the farms in Waterford and look at what the farmers had to lose to fight that strike.  It is pitiable that those strikes should be resorted to. Whether it applies to the employers or the employees I think a strike is the last thing that should be adopted.  I am not blaming Deputy Johnson for those strikes, neither am I blaming my colleague Deputy Clancy, because I know that the red flag was raised in Limerick without his sympathy or approval.  He was, in fact, opposed to it.  The men were led by others from outside.</P>
    <P>A comparison of taxation in prewar days with the present day is useless. The Government of England in this country was to a large extent a Government of destruction in comparison with the Government of the present day.  The Government of the present day is a Government of construction. The administration of the British Government in this country often reminded me of the way a landlord worked an evicted farm, in comparison with the way an agricultural tenant would work it.  The landlord tried to get the most he could out of it while doing nothing to make it more valuable in the future.  Any money that has been spent by the Government in this country will be to the advantage of future Governments.  I am sure when we settle down in the near future and recognise our liabilities and the fact that the country is our own that a different note will be struck by Deputies in the next Dáil.  I would again request the Minister to accept an amendment reducing the income tax to 2/- in the pound on home produced wealth, leaving it at 4/- in the pound on wealth produced outside the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardDoyle" hpid="Mr. E. DOYLE Mr. E. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat disappointed with the Budget that the Minister introduced.  One would have thought that even after four years he would have come to the rescue of the old age pensioners, but his usual line of policy is to take from those who <Col N="1656" /> have not and give to those who have. This has been the policy in connection with the Budget.  The Minister stated, in his opening speech: &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann has four years' complete control of her own finances and during that period much has been accomplished. The financial credit of the State has been established.&rdquo;  If it takes a reduction of old age pensions, a reduction of road workers' wages and a miserable wage to workers on the Shannon scheme to establish the financial credit and stability of the State, then I have no hope for the policy.  Deputy Good in his contribution contended that we must have confidence, that we must have conditions to inspire confidence. I would ask Deputy Good how he could inspire the confidence of the people who render service in the production of wealth in this country when we have a Government, backed up by the Deputy Goods, advocating a policy such as this.  I am one of those who thought that something more should have been done for agriculture.  I regret my colleague, Deputy Gorey, is not here.  He stated, a couple of evenings ago, that none of the Labour-Deputies in the Dáil had made any case for the agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to co-operate with Deputy Gorey in securing a better wage than 10/- a week, which he says is the wage they receive.  There is one means by which that can be done, and that is by changing the fiscal policy of the Government.  The whole question in regard to the conditions of the poor and the tillage farmers of the country has been anything but satisfactory. Unless we regard it from an entirely different point of view to that which we have been hitherto looking at it, the country will go on dwindling and will eventually decline into ruin. There is always good reason to be found for the existence of anything if we look deep enough and if we seek for causes rather than effects.  For over a century we have been trying to treat effects instead of seeking and uprooting the causes.  It is because of the little interest taken in our most precious asset, agriculture, that those who depend on it for a living, such as implement makers, blacksmiths, carpenters, tradesmen and labourers of all <Col N="1657" /> sorts, have to flee from the rural districts to urban centres and cities where they swell the over-stocked market of unemployed workers.  Why are people driven from their healthy, life-giving existence in the wholesome open country to be herded like sheep in pens in over-crowded and unhealthy purlieus of cities and towns?  It is all due to the neglect of agriculture.</P>
    <P>As long as agriculture can only pay a miserable wage which, according to Deputy Gorey, is 10/- a week, the taxpayers will have to continue to pay high taxes, because by paying small wages we create weak and unhealthy people.  The poor people are getting food from foreign countries in tin boxes.  Tinned milk, tinned bacon, and tinned everything is sent across here to feed the population of the poorer classes in the rural districts.  It is in consequence of this old free-trade bogey that we have a ruined land industry and all it contains, including congested labour markets, a dearth of employment, a vast mass of unemployed people, and a constant drain of compulsory emigration, the like of which has not been known in any country, civilised or uncivilised.  We are rearing young men and women and the people have to pay through the nose for their education, but when they are educated they have to flee from the country to take up occupations in good conditions and at decent wages in countries that have got away from the old worn-out beliefs of the free trade policy, the policy of the open door.  Look around on all sides and see the mass of people unemployed.  Why should that be?</P>
    <P>Take the case of the small tillage farmer.  He can get no price for his produce.  He is unable to pay his annuities. He is met on all sides with bills and writs.  The cause of all that is simple.  It is because £16,000,000 worth of farm produce is imported to meet the food requirements of our people.  We import bacon, beef, fish, milk, butter, cheese, eggs, wheat, maize, and a thousand and one other things which we could produce ourselves, and by means of which we could employ our own people at a decent wage.  Does any Deputy, including the Minister for <Col N="1658" /> Finance, contend that it is better to employ other people in other countries, and to have them supplying us with our requirements, instead of having our own people employed in their own country?  We could employ our own people to such an extent that there would scarcely be any unemployment if we produced our own produce.  The necessity for high wages would become less as soon as agricultural conditions improved, and, as a consequence of the increased purchasing power of the people, prosperity, about which we hear so much, would increase.  If the free-trade bogey is worth the paper it is written on, would thousands of our people be so poor, and would such conditions as now exist prevail?  There is no exaggeration about the matter, because past experience has proved that people have died with hunger.</P>
    <P>Would work be so difficult to find if this old policy of asking other people to supply us with our requirements was a beneficial one?  What is the use of offering men cheap bread, cheap boots and cheap clothing if you do not give them the means of earning them? Deputy Connor Hogan, I think, referred to the boot business.  I know that as a consequence of the protective duty on boots the number of persons employed has been considerably increased, and the output has also increased by two hundred pairs of boots per week.  That, with the increased number of people employed, has increased the purchasing power in a particular town alone by a couple of thousand pounds additional every year. You must have decent wages before you can have prosperity.  Deputy Good contends that it is only in £ s. d. that the wealth and prosperity of a country are measured.  That contention is as false as it is harmful.  I believe that the shilling in the pound off the income tax will be of very little use in the development of our native industries, whether agricultural or manufacturing. I agree with Deputy Nolan and I would take off another shilling in the pound in the case of people who invested their money in manufacturing industries here.  In that way we would do something to bring about that prosperity about which so many people are talking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1659" /> Unless we cultivate intensely every acre of land capable of cultivation&mdash; cultivate it not alone in quantity but in quality, and unless we give the maximum of employment, instead of the present miserable minimum, the country is bound to go down.  By adopting such a policy as that we would be taking a step in the direction of the general upliftment of the people. There are people hungry in several parts of the country, but nothing has been done to improve their condition. The reduction of one shilling in the pound off the income tax will do nothing for the 50,000 people who are unemployed.  I congratulate the Government on one thing in regard to the development of our industrial activities, and that is in respect to the sugar beet industry, which has proved a great boon to farmers.  It has given considerable employment at a decent wage, but I do not thank the Government for the decent wage paid in the Carlow beet factory.  That is due alone to the activities of organised labour, not the sheltered trades referred to by Deputy Gorey.  I have no evidence of sheltered trades in any industry in this country.</P>
    <P>The beet factory has, for the first time in Irish history, given an opportunity to the people to produce at least one-seventh of their requirements in an essential commodity.  That money is being spent in the country, and it has brought about a good condition of things, not alone in Carlow but in the adjacent counties.  Something in that direction could be done in other ways.  For instance, we have a woollen industry which has seriously declined.  We import thousands of pounds worth of manufactured cloth, while we get a small price for our wool.  Buildings and machinery have been allowed to go into disuse.  Would any Deputy say that it is wise to let these mills fall into decay?  Is it wise to have millions of tons of flour imported while mills, if not working half-time, are closed down?  Anyone who has the interests of the people at heart and who desires to benefit the people, should first endeavour to keep dying industries alive and to give them a stimulus to enable them to provide for <Col N="1660" /> the requirements of the people.  That would be my outlook as regards the development of the natural resources of the country.</P>
    <P>Again, we have coal mining districts in Kilkenny, but we find the people there working on half-time.  I see no reason why the Government departments which were so patriotic a few years ago in purchasing Irish materials should not be patriotic to-day and burn, at least, 50 per cent. of native coal in the Government offices and in the Gárda Síochána and military barracks. That, at least, would be in the interests of the country.  It would tend towards relieving unemployment and provide work that has not hitherto been provided.  Cognisance should be taken of these matters, and unless the Government helps these dying industries and utilises the materials which have been left dormant, the country will go down and we will always have the unemployment problem.  We will always have the Minister for Finance finding it difficult to balance his Budget.  You will have people calling out for your execution, just as the Government have executed the old age pensioners under the Old Age Pensions Act.</P>

      <P>It will not be necessary for me to refer to more than a few of the points that have been raised. The points raised by some Deputies have been, in my view, adequately dealt with by other Deputies, and I do not intend to refer to them.  It has been doubted whether we are justified in borrowing for any portion of the Army cost.  We have heard it asserted in this House that it is wrong and unsound to borrow for any portion of the cost of the Army.  In these matters I do not think we can have any absolute and rigid standard that will apply in all times and in all circumstances.  If our Army cost were going up it would certainly be wrong to borrow; if our Army cost were definitely stabilised it would be wrong to borrow, even though we might intend to effect economies in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that we have not <Col N="1661" /> reached normality in the matter of the Army, and we paid great sums in respect of abnormal Army costs out of revenue during the first years of the Saorstát.  We have not yet been able to set up the kind of military establishment which we would regard as suitable to the country, or the kind of military establishment which would have been created if there had been no armed opposition to the Treaty and if the Civil War had not been fought.  The present formation and cost of the Army are the result of the war situation which developed here, and in my opinion we are quite entitled to set aside such portion of the present cost of the Army as we regard abnormal to be met out of borrowed money.</P>
    <P>We were not entitled heretofore to regard any sum lower than two millions as the normal cost; we could not until quite recently see the possibility of moving on to a change, to the creation of a different type of military organisation. Undoubtedly, the improvement which had been going on before the beginning of the past financial year continued through that financial year. Even incidents like the attacks on the police barracks only served to emphasise the progress that had been made, and the geenral reprobation which was expressed over those attacks did a great deal more to emphasise the progress made than anything else.  It was seen then that in quarters where one might have expected sympathy with that sort of attack, there was no sympathy, and taking into account all the factors of the situation, we see that unless there is a swing over from support of the Treaty at the General Election, it will be quite safe to proceed in the present financial year with the proposed change.  I do not say the change can be completed in the present or even in the next financial year, but we can take it in hand and, consequently, we can visualise the position in which there will be an Army cost not greater than one and a half millions.  I hold it to be entirely justifiable to borrow for excess over that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>My statements in my constituency are quite in line with what I am saying now.  Deputy Johnson has said that any margin that results from over-estimation should be put to the reduction of National Debt; at any rate, he seems to suggest that. I do not think that in our circumstances any sum resulting from over-estimation ought to be put to National Debt.  Our arrangements in regard to the National Loan are that the total amount of the original National Loan will be extinguished in twenty years. In respect of Compensation stock we are paying it off at the rate of 10 per cent.  per annum; we are paying £140,000 per annum in respect of the extinction of Compensation stock. With these very adequate provisions for sinking fund it does not seem to me that we should arrange to tax the people further in order to reduce our debt faster, the debt being as small as it is and so many abnormal items of expenditure having been met out of revenue in the first two or three years of the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connor Hogan said the margin of over-estimation in Great Britain was 1.5 per cent. and he thought it might be reasonable to allow 3 per cent. here and he proceeded to denounce the reduction of any such sum as £630,000.  I think £630,000 is very nearly 3 per cent. of the recurrent expenditure here.  I think it ought to be less than 3 per cent., but it cannot certainly be lower than 1½ or 2 per cent.  I believe so long as we adopt the British system of <Col N="1663" /> estimation we are bound to have some margin, perhaps not of £600,000 but of £400,000, and while we have our existing provisions for sinking fund we ought to deduct the margin of over-estimation from our expenditure in order to arrive at the amount we must provide for out of taxation.</P>
    <P>I did not say in any part of my speech that I regarded the country as prosperous or that things were entirely satisfactory.  What I did say was there were indications that the slump in which we had been carrying on was passing away.  Without going outside the figures, there are distinct indications of that.  Heretofore there has been a great decrease, a rapid decrease, in the yield of certain taxes, particularly in the yield of the beer and spirit taxes.  That decline has very nearly ceased.  All the indications are that we are no longer, so far as that is concerned, on the down grade.</P>
    <P>The fact that the profits earned by various enterprises in the country were, in spite of the very serious effect of the coal strike, within five per cent. of the profits of last year, is, I think, in all the circumstances, a sign that is somewhat hopeful.  Many undertakings did suffer severely by the coal strike.  Many undertakings were unable to show profits or were able to show very small profits because of the burdens they suffered through the coal strike, because of the increase in the cost of fuel and the difficulties of obtaining fuel.  In addition, profits were affected indirectly through the effect of the coal strike on the marketability of products and the prices obtained for products exported from this country, with a consequent lessening of the amount of money coming into the country.  In view of the circumstances of last year, I think the fact that the profits earned were almost level with the profits of the year before was a satisfactory thing.</P>
    <P>I have definite indications that the economic decline in which we had been carrying on is at an end.  There were whole groups of enterprises which actually had increased profits.  The distributive groups, for instance, had increased <Col N="1664" /> profits.  I do not want to rely too much on reports that one can hear about the condition of affairs through the country.  It is difficult to rely on the reports of even considerable numbers of individuals.  Their views of things are likely to be coloured; but from the most reliable sources from which information could be received the indications are that the worsening of conditions has stopped in spite of the fact&mdash;and this applies to the whole country again&mdash;that there was last year a further decline in the price of agricultural products.  I believe, of course, that decline was certainly in part due to the effects of the coal strike in Great Britain, but in spite of that all the indications are that the worsening of conditions which had been going on, the slump which had been in progress since before the Free State was set up, is at an end.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shaw asked about the betting tax and the totalisator.  I have nothing to say about the totalisator further than what I said in answer to the Deputy's question.  There have been negotiations with the Turf Club and the National Steeplechase Committee&mdash;I forget the full name of the body &mdash;with regard to it.  As regards the betting tax, I think it is entirely too early to come to the conclusion that Deputy Shaw asks us to come to.  The race meetings which have been held this year do seem to have been less successful than they were last year, and I am prepared to examine all the facts of the case.  I say to Deputy Shaw that until we have had a complete season of racing with the betting-tax in operation it would be premature to come to any conclusions at all in regard to the effect of the tax.  The whole position of the various race meetings is a matter which, if it is anything like as serious as Deputy Shaw suggests, merits the closest consideration, and I would be very glad to have the information which Deputy Shaw says he can give me, and I will examine it in no unsympathetic way.  In connection with the betting tax I would like to say again that I think the propaganda which has gone on in connection with it has done a great deal more to keep people away from race meetings <Col N="1665" /> than the tax itself.  If there were a cessation of that propaganda it would probably not be ineffectual in providing some relief, at any rate.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about the committee that it is proposed to set up with a view to effecting reduction in public expenditure.  I think that Deputy Gorey's remarks on that have relieved me from the necessity for saying a great deal.  The people who asked for a Geddes Committee most urgently were the people who took up the position in asking for it that the Government and the Civil Service were dishonest and incompetent, and that certain business supermen from outside must be brought in to put them right. Some people said that they themselves had no confidence in what the Government and the Civil Service would do, and others said that while they thought that the Government and the Civil Service were not bad at all, the people of the country generally would think that they were thoroughly dishonest, incompetent and corrupt.  That has really been the point of view of practically everybody who urged a Geddes Committee. It was practically the point of view of Deputy Good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I dissent altogether from that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was not, I do not know on what basis he was asking for what he called a Geddes Committee. In any case, as I said in the Budget statement, the Government does not see any use, in the circumstances that exist, for anything in the nature of a Geddes Committee.  I have always said that there might be circumstances in which an outside committee of the type of the Geddes Committee might be of some use, but these circumstances do not exist.  We hold that the members of the Government, and the members of the Civil Service who will act under them, can deal adequately, and alone can deal adequately, with everything that has to do with the question of details of expenditure.  In regard to the bigger matters of policy, these are matters for the Dáil; they are no matters for any sort of business supermen. You will not get business supermen, to begin with, and in any case, <Col N="1666" /> when you come to big matters of policy the Dáil itself should take the responsibility of coming to decisions.  The only circumstances in which I see that a Geddes Committee could do useful work were those which Deputy Good himself indicated.  If a Committee such as we are setting up were to advise economies and if the Government were afraid to carry them out and afraid to stand over them, then it might try to get the approval of some sort of Committee to strengthen its hands, but I do not think that that is likely to arise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gorey asked if this Committee would extend its work to county administration.  I do not think that that would be possible.  I do think that anything in regard to local administration would have to be examined separately. The problems are different problems and, as a matter of fact, they are very big problems, because I presume if we were inquiring into local administration we would have to range over the whole field; we would have to consider such questions as whether the mental hospitals, for instance, should remain locally controlled institutions as at present, or should be taken over by the central Government; should they be graded and different types of patients put into different institutions so that the treatment might be more effectual?  An inquiry into local administration, with a view to decreased cost and increased efficiency would be a very big inquiry, and would certainly be enough for one committee or commission in itself.  Again, I think that the body that would inquire into local administration would have to be a different body, because the detailed and expert knowledge that would be required in that case would be different from the detailed and expert knowledge that would be required for an examination of Government expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson said that money invested by the Government is just as good as money invested by the individual. I am not disposed to quarrel with that, with certain limitations.  Undoubtedly there are circumstances in which money invested by the Government is better than money invested by the individual, but at the same time it is very difficult to get what is commonly <Col N="1667" /> called business efficiency in Government expenditure.  There are certain types of expenditure which a Government can undertake very well.  There are certain sources of activity which it can carry out better than any individual, but there are other types of expenditure and other types of activity where there is not the sort of subtleness and quickness in Government administration that is necessary, and the great difficulty is in getting this subtleness and quickness.  I do not think it can be alleged that the policy of this Government has been such as to indicate that it believed that money invested by itself was wasted, or that Government investments or Government activities were not useful.  It is simply a question of deciding the best in a particular case.  But I do think that it becomes more difficult to get good results out of Government expenditure and activities as the activities of Government are extended.  The sort of centralised control, the difficulty of getting individual initiative, increasing as the activities of the Government are extended, seem to me to make it more and more difficult to get satisfactory results. The whole question of responsibility to the Parliament, the question of accounting, the difficulties of delegating responsibility, these difficulties in many respects depending on this question of Parliamentary control and of the necessarily very strict system of accounting for public expenditure, all put difficulties in the way of successful activity on the part of the Government, and I certainly am not anxious for the taking on of new activities by the Government.</P>
    <P>Any search after greater efficiency, any attempt to eliminate whatever waste there may be, is bound to be hindered by the taking on of new activities. I indicated that in the Budget statement.  I said that if the State did in the next year or two embark en a considerable number of new activities, the men on whom we are relying to conduct this inquiry into expenditure could not be spared sufficiently for that expenditure, that they would be occupied fully in dealing with the limitation and the regulation of expenditure on the new activities, and I do <Col N="1668" /> think that we are at the stage when we should pause as much as possible in the matter of undertaking new activities. I do think in the modern world, and in view of the increasing complexity of modern life and modern industry, that the undertaking of new activities by the State is not to be avoided.  It is going on in all countries, and I do not say that it is going to be avoided here.  But I do think that at the present juncture we should try to abstain from undertaking new activities, and that we should give as much of our time and energy as possible to going over the existing machine and existing activities, and eliminating anything in the way of waste and inefficiency that exists.  What we propose at present is simply to continue in a more systematic and concentrated way the sort of work we have been doing, and that will only be possible, as I have said, if we are not at the same time launching out in a number of new directions.</P>
    <P>Two or three Deputies challenged my statement that this is an undeveloped country.  When I said it was an undeveloped country I did not mean exactly what they seemed to think I meant.  But it certainly is an, undeveloped country as compared with, say, Denmark, a country that is smaller and has not as many natural advantages as this country.  I do not believe we have great unexploited mineral wealth, or anything of that sort, but our agriculture is not as developed as it should be, our industry is not developed, our organisation for export, for instance, is not developed. In a great many respects, and in respects that are of the highest importance, this country is undeveloped.  It is really many years behind the times, and it is many years behind other countries&mdash;behind its rivals&mdash;in its methods and in its organisation, in the use of modern science and art in its industry.  Deputy Baxter asked if the reduction in income tax that is now given was justified and if it could be continued next year.  I am quite satisfied that it is justified and that it can be continued next year.  but I believe it can only be continued next year if, during the current year, we are able to effect certain economies, and in the <Col N="1669" /> following year we will have to effect further economics.  I did not go into great detail about, for instance, the amount expected to be received from the new arrangement in regard to death duties on Saorstát companies. The amount will not be much, perhaps £50,000 or £60,000 per annum.  I only indicated it as one item.  I think we have got to rely on the most careful scrutiny of our expenditure and, as a matter of fact, while I could not with any certainty at the moment put my finger on matters in respect of which economies could be effected, I have certain matters before me, to which I will direct the attention of the Committee, in respect of which I believe economics can be accomplished.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nolan suggested that we should give 2/- off income arising here and continue the tax on income arising outside the country at 4/-.  That would involve a very much bigger change than we could undertake at the moment; it would involve a bigger loss, and I am very doubtful if it would give the result he thinks.  Certainly, in the beginning the result would be to lose the country income and capital.  The effect of it in the beginning would certainly be that many people who owned capital outside the country would leave the country.  That would not be a result that we should bring about lightly, because it would be difficult to obtain a return of that capital by any future change, and the good results that the Deputy is looking for can, I think, be brought about slowly, but probably just as effectually, by the lowering of the income tax which we propose and by the stimulus that that will give.</P>
    <P>It has to be remembered that we would not be done with the loss that would arise from the discrimination that Deputy Nolan suggests, even in the first year or two.  It would arise again and again.  If the people of this country were as Irish as the people of France are French, or as the people of England are English, you might do some of the things, but we cannot forget the fact that great numbers of our population, particularly amongst the wealthy people, are to a great extent denationalised and would get out of the country without very much regret <Col N="1670" /> if remaining in it involved any serious inconvenience or restrictions.  That may be lamentable, but it is a fact, and when we are dealing with the economic situation we might as well look at the facts which have an economic bearing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a proposal that a great number of theoretical writers have advocated, and in reading the advocacy of it I have been considerably impressed, but it is the sort of thing that would involve a considerable change in our code.  It is not the sort of thing that could be undertaken lightly.  I have indicated to the Dáil that we could reform the income-tax system.  I believe that the system which we have inherited is suitable to a big industrial country like England, but it is not suitable here&mdash;that it can and ought to be simplified and changed. The reason we have not taken steps is simply that we have not, as I have said several times, had the staff.  We have scarcely enough staff to carry on current work.  When the change of Government took place, although we made every effort to get Irishmen in the British service to transfer here, we could not get them.  We actually were left Englishmen by the British Government&mdash;it was only Englishmen who volunteered&mdash;until, I think, December last.  We actually had them working here, and were only able to carry on by their help.  The young men whom we put in training for inspectors are just beginning to be ready to be commissioned. So that we have got really no help from new men.  In addition to that, we lost certain experienced officers who were given employment by banks and other institutions.  The result is that we have been carrying on, so far as income tax is concerned, with the very minimum of staff, and we have not been able to put men on to work in the investigation branch which we ought to have and which would bring us in anything from a quarter of a million a year upwards.  We have not been able to spare men for that, although we are going to make a beginning this year.  We have not been <Col N="1671" /> able to spare men for any work on the revision of the income tax system.  But it is intended that at the very earliest possible moment consideration shall be given to the question of simplifying the system, and in doing that we intend also to adapt the system to suit the needs of the country in other respects, so that the incidence of the facts will, as far as possible, serve to give encouragement to production, which is the main thing.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable to find the Minister of a responsible Government, after over three years of office, saying in effect that he has not the machinery by which he could determine a minimum wage, or what is a living wage for the workers of this country.  If one could not give the Minister credit for paying close attention to the business of his Department <Col N="1673" /> one could understand that, but one must acknowledge that the Minister at least has given evidence of close attention to the matters pertaining peculiarly to his Department.  Therefore, such an admission from him is all the more regrettable.  If he has not any machinery for determining a minimum wage, on what did he base the wage for the Shannon scheme?  What factors did he take into consideration? Was it purely the law of supply and demand that influenced him?  If it were not, then we ought to know what factors he took into account.  He ought to defend the basis upon which he calculated that wage, and having defended that basis in that connection it should be easy for him to defend its general application.  Having failed to defend that we must come to the conclusion that he had some foundation upon which he bases the wage that he fixed.  Were food, clothing, firing, rent, and education considered?  How much of these does the Minister think a worker entitled to?  How much of these did he think he could get for 29/- or 32/- per week?  An answer to those questions is due to us by the Minister. Did he calculate it as a wage for a single man or as a wage for a married man with a wife and family of three children?  If he has not based it on an examination of those items, surely he has eliminated the human factor altogether, and we ought to know whether that is the case or not.  This case has been very well made before, but the Minister has not defended the attitude he took up in connection with it.  We are told that certain slaves thousands of years ago built a certain monument that exists up to the present day.  Does the Minister want it to be said that certain monumental enterprises are going to be built up on the slavery of the workers of this country? He said: &ldquo;if they cannot live on it, they cannot.&rdquo;  That is the new slogan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister contend that there is a certain margin beyond which capital cannot be employed successfully, and is there not a margin of wages below which you must not force a man to work?  Is that the position on the Shannon scheme as he thought of it?  The Minister wants to know what courts would be established to ascertain the minimum wage under this Bill.  What has he set up to fix it?  On what basis of calculation, on what degree of ordinary comfort, leaving out the amenities of life altogether, has he fixed it?  He has made no statement whatever on this matter.  The Minister's philosophy seems to be that a certain set of the people of this country are to be singled out for special treatment.  Probably someone may correct me and say that it is special ill-treatment, and not special treatment I should have said.  He has singled them out without giving any reason for it.  He has not told us on what he bases his wage.  The only thing he can say is that he is endeavouring to make dividends, endeavouring to force the workers to make dividends out of their starvation.  That is the position to put it bluntly.  Further, the Minister seems to forget that this is a national service, and that as a national service there is a special reason why a living wage should be afforded to the people within it.  In the absence of a statement from the Minister as to the principle upon which he bases this, I do not think that any Deputy can make any further statement beyond challenging the Minister to bring forward the reasons on which he bases his wage and to defend them.</P>

Deputy Hogan does not seem to <Col N="1675" /> have paid any attention to what was said previously when I spoke to this amendment, but directed attention to the fact that there was put down seriously for consideration an amendment which left to anybody's discretion what was going to be a wage sufficient to keep people in certain ways.

      <P>No. I am not going to have two clauses pilfered from an Act, put in here and applied to a particular undertaking and not applied to every other undertaking.  If the Deputy wants to run the gauntlet on that particular type of legislation let him run it in connection with all trade and industry in the country.  Then we can have a decent discussion on that.  I am not concerned with what Deputy Hogan says about standards.  When I spoke it was in answer to a statement made by Deputy Morrissey that there should be a certain fixed minimum wage, and I said there were conditions in which that could not be paid. The Labour Party never seems to advert to the other side of the question, and that is what wages an industry can afford to pay and apply that generally. I applied it to the general statement made by Labour that there must be a particular fixed minimum paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. HOGAN Mr. P. HOGAN">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said anything about a fixed minimum for <Col N="1676" /> capital.  When I say that you cannot get more out of industry than what it can afford to pay, Deputies simply say &ldquo;Oh, pay something.&rdquo;  Deputy Johnson's famous slogan long ago was, &ldquo;skip finance.&rdquo;  It is very easy to talk that way when one has no responsibility for getting the finance.  I simply made the statement, backed afterwards by certain other Deputies, that you have to pay attention to the particular state of the country at any time in which these wage calculations are made.  When I made that statement I did not make it specially with regard to the Shannon scheme.  I made it in answer to the general clamour that we hear with regard to fixing a minimum wage.  That may be a very desirable thing, but there is the other side to it ever and always: what the industry can afford, a particular industry dealing with a particular thing.  If this type of legislation is considered desirable and if Labour Deputies think they can make their case clear on it, then let them bring in their amendment and apply it to all industry in the country, but on this Bill I am not going to have an amendment of this sort, and I intend to resist it. This amendment is brought in without any advertence to the circumstances in Australia.  You have two clauses lifted. out of a piece of Australian legislation with a particular court not specified, and then we get this tirade from Deputy Hogan as to standards.  I am not going to speak at any greater length on this, but if the Deputy has any belief in this being a just thing and a thing that must be accepted, then let us get the whole of the Australian legislation, and let us have it applied to all trade and industry in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>We now understand from the Minister that, following a general rule of his, he is going to allow the wages to be fixed by the Board in respect to any or all of its employees to be determined by what the industry can afford.  What the industry can afford is to be determined by the Board, which means, of course, that there is nothing whatever to check the Board as to the rate of wages it will pay to <Col N="1677" /> its employees.  That is to say, the Board which is established has a perfect monopoly, if it decides so, in the electrical industry.  The control of production, distribution and the manufacture of appliances in connection with electricity can be monopolised by the Board.  The only obligation on the Board is to make income meet expenditure, and what the industry can afford is to determine the rate of pay.  The Minister says it is wrong, unwise and foolish to propose a motion of this kind unless one proposes the whole new code of labour legislation.  Part of this amendment is taken out of the Minister's own Bill, which did not impose the whole of the Australian legislation or any other code of legislation.  The other part is to fill a gap which became obvious in the Minister's administration of the fair wages clause.  We have had assurances from Minister after Minister that the fair wages clause, as it had been practised in respect to public contracts for years, was inserted in every contract made by the Ministry.  The fair wages clause in the Siemens-Schuckert contract was interpreted by the Minister's Department as enabling them to pay a rate of wages based upon the rate current in agricultural labour, and there is no court beyond the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now there is obviously a gap and obviously a flaw and the attempt to fill that gap and remedy that flaw is in the second part of this amendment which provides that the minimum wage shall be sufficient to enable a well conducted employee of average health, strength arid competence with a wife and family of three children to provide a fair standard of comfort.  I say that is a perfectly fair and reasonable proposition to put into a Bill of this kind, especially in the circumstances that I have indicated&mdash;where the industry can afford it if the Board decides that the industry shall afford it.  The Minister talks about industry not being able to afford it.  This Board is going to determine whether the industry can afford it or not.  The Board is the industry. It is a monopoly.  There is no other check or standard beyond that which the Board fixes, and if there is no such provision as this in the Act governing the Board then it is going to <Col N="1678" /> be a question of &ldquo;devil pull baker&rdquo;; a question of intensive organisation, an endeavour to secure a minimum by bargaining, if possible, and if bargaining fails, then strikes, with no legal standard minimum.  It simply means that the Minister is challenging the working class movement to fight this Board for standards of life which are to be merely the result of conflict, of bargaining, and if the bargaining is not going to result in agreement, then a struggle as to who is the strongest and who is the most effective fighter.</P>
    <P>I say there is no alternative position to take up except this one to the provisions in the Bill.  You have got either to make a legal standard or a standard by agreement, and in this case agreements are not practicable without much more widespread organisation than exists at present in view of the ramifications of this proposed Board.  It may be a very good thing, from a certain point of view, to force workmen of all classes into a close compact organisation in the electrical industry.  That will undoubtedly be the reaction from the Minister's attitude towards this amendment. As I say from some points of view that may be the most desirable thing that could happen, but frankly I prefer that there should be a minimum living human standard of life fixed in the Bill.  It is an entirely new undertaking, a new proposal that is going to have very great results one way and another.  The Minister resists the very idea, apart from any matter of detail, of fixing a living wage by law, thus forcing the matter to be fixed by a struggle, a conflict and a fight whenever the opportunity serves.  I think it might be useful to quote for the Minister's information and guidance what has been done in respect to the setting up of tribunals, or reference to tribunals, as to what is a fair standard, what is a living wage.</P>
    <P>I have a quotation here from a country which the Minister himself has some knowledge of.  It was the case of an appeal to Judge Frank Murphy in a recorder's court and the decision is very creditable to the country from which Judge Murphy or his ancestors came.  In giving his judgment Judge Murphy said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A wage is not a living wage <Col N="1679" /> unless through frugality a wage-earner may earn sufficient to develop within reasonable limits his physical, spiritual, moral and intellectual faculties, and in addition be able to set aside a reserve to provide for accident, old age, illness and misfortune. Under the present social order,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;the father is the natural provider for all members of the family.  It follows that whenever the wage-earner lacks the means to provide for the becoming maintenance of his wife and children, marriage and home life are discouraged, women and children are obliged to labour and there is brought about a steady deterioration and lowering of standards in the families affected. Therefore, a living wage means a family living wage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is in harmony with that idea I put down this amendment that the living wage should be sufficient to maintain a man, his wife and family.  I think the case made for the amendment is one which cannot be resisted.  It has not been resisted, except for the suggestion from the Minister, that this matter should be left in abeyance until he has brought forward a whole scheme based on Australian courts' arbitration, wage decisions, and, presumably, the precedents that the Australian courts and wage fixing tribunals have established.  I say that we need not wait until that has been discussed and argued either in this House or in the country.  Here is a concrete proposition&mdash;that the rate of remuneration to be paid by the Board shall be such as may be fixed between the Board and the organised workers&mdash;representatives of the trade unions and the like&mdash;and that in no case shall such minimum wage be less than the ordinary, reasonable, family living-wage, based upon the condition of life of that particular class of employee.  That is a proposition which nobody except Deputy Gorey has attempted to controvert.  Deputy Gorey seems to think that the agricultural labourer's wage of 10s. per week should be the basic wage on which all other standards should be fixed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey said the equivalent of that, and he was merely repeating what the Minister said when we were discussing the larger question of the Shannon scale of wages &mdash;that the wages that the most poverty-stricken industry in the country could afford to pay was to be the basis upon which all other wages were to be counted.  I dissent from that entirely. I say there is no need whatever&mdash;and less need in this particular industry than in any other&mdash;why we should assume that the basic wage should be that of the poorest agricultural labourer. Deputy Gorey, probably, will not state here that he desires that the wages paid in the electrical industry should be based upon the figure he mentioned for the agricultural labourer, 10s. per week, plus food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson wants controversy.  Let him, by all means, have it.  I do not think he has succeeded in establishing a case for this amendment.  To begin with, what proportion of labour in this country tan be placed in the position he wishes them placed in&mdash;the position of having a wife and three children?  We have not got the Census figures yet.  We do not know what the figures are, but we do happen to possess the figures of the last British Census.  I agree that the parallel is not an entirely true one.  But <Col N="1681" /> it is an indication.  I read the figures in a Labour paper.  In the last British Census&mdash;1921&mdash;it was shown that 40 per cent. of the married population had no child under 21 years of age. Further, 20 per cent. had only one child under 21 years of age.  The proportion would undoubtedly be lower here.  Still, assuming that even 50 per cent. of the population have a wife and three children, Deputy Johnson says nothing about their being infant children.  They might be children able to earn for themselves.  Assuming that even 50 per cent. of the population have a wife and three children, why should we endow the other 50 per cent. &mdash;unmarried men or married men with no children or married men with only one child or two children&mdash;with the advantages of a married man with a wife and three children?  Australia has been mentioned.  I had not time when I was in Australia to go into this subject in detail.  I know there was a considerable volume of labour opinion in favour of the basic wage, but I also-came in contact with a considerable volume of opinion which held that the basic wage and the State limitation of hours, combined, acted as a hindrance to the establishment of new industries. From the States where basic wages were highest and working hours shortest, industries migrated into other States where conditions were more favourable.  I am afraid that Deputy Johnson, if he were to pass this amendment, would place a brake on industrial development, because this amendment is not confined to electricians. A skilled electrician will always be able to make terms with his employer.  He has an asset in his skill that will entitle him&mdash;and rightly entitle him&mdash;to demand good wages.  But, according to the amendment, anybody employed by the Board&mdash;the man who sweeps out the office, if he is an adult, or the messenger&mdash;must get this basic wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have supported this amendment if Deputy Johnson had been consistent. But when it was a question, on an earlier amendment, as to the political rights of employees of the Board, Deputy Johnson said that was a matter for contract between employer and <Col N="1682" /> employees.  I do not suggest that on the question of political rights the State should have no say, but I do say that the question of wages is a matter for contract between the employer and employees or between the employer and trade unions of the employees, and that by limiting that contract in the manner proposed in this amendment we should be weighting one side of the scales of justice.  We should be imposing a handicap on industry, and we would probably be benefiting neither the worker nor the prosperity of the country.  I did not intend to speak, but as I intend to vote against the amendment, I just wanted to make clear the grounds upon which I propose to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson's amendment raises a very big question for discussion.  I do not suppose that Deputy Johnson expects that question to be settled on an amendment to this particular Bill.  There have been in the past exchanges of views between employer and employed personally and through the medium of organisations. In some cases, these controversies have gone to the length of strikes and trade disputes, but I have never heard yet of any settlement based on the provisions of Deputy Johnson's amendment. It is very hard to understand why there should be such great differences in the wages paid in different trades and in connection with different employments. If Deputy Johnson could bring forward any proposal that would get rid of these differences, he would be achieving a simplification of the relations between employer and employed that would be very valuable indeed. The controversy is not even limited to countries.  It is carried to the International Labour Conference at Geneva, and is continued there as between nations.  At the conference which Deputy Johnson and I attended in Geneva some years ago, it was apparent that the labour leaders were endeavouring to bring up the standard in the countries that are lowest paid to something corresponding with the standard in the highly-paid countries.  It was obvious to me then, and I presume to Deputy Johnson, that the wages and standards which applied in Great Britain <Col N="1683" /> were the wages and standards that other countries were trying to arrive at.  In so far as Deputy Johnson's amendment would direct one's thoughts to the whole position in this country as it applies to Labour, I think the amendment would be helpful.  It has been mentioned that the rates of agricultural labourers are between 10s. and 12s. per week.  If a man with a wife and three children can exist as agricultural labourer on 10s. or 12s. per week, the wages paid a man with the same responsibility in other industries, and particularly in the sheltered industries, would seem to be luxurious.  Nevertheless, nobody examining that higher wage scale&mdash;even where it is relatively very high&mdash;would claim that the conditions would be covered by the provisions that Deputy Johnson wants inserted in the Bill.  The amendment is open to an extraordinary amount of argument and the question could not be settled on the basis of anything that we know to be in existence in the State to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as that is so, I think we must say that the amendment is inapplicable and unworkable.  In connection with this Bill, in so far as the arguments used by Deputy Johnson are in the direction of saying that in a nationalised undertaking, such as is covered by this Bill, the standard of wages that will apply, while they cannot be out of proportion to other good employments in the country, ought to be a standard which would give a reasonable condition of living to the people employed in it, if there is any industry in the country or any undertaking that could be called upon to pay a good and a fair wage, an undertaking such as this, being a national undertaking, should provide as reasonably as possible, for the wages and, at all events, be protected from a condition of affairs which we hear is prevalent in the country where the farm labourer is employed at 10/- to 12/- a week.  An amendment of the sort that I have tried to indicate is a controversial amendment.  I could not argue for a moment that there could be any possible solution of the position on the basis of the terms of the amendment. <Col N="1684" /> If we had a dispute between an employer and employed to-morrow in Dublin and tried to settle it on this basis you could not get anywhere.  It would be impossible.  At a comparatively recent time I sat on a wages board in which the employees' side put forward a very elaborate table showing the wages prevalent in all the different trades they liked to select by way of comparison.  One had only to look at it to see that there was no comparison whatsoever.  There could be no comparison drawn from it.  The ultimate result of the consideration of that by the board was that a cut in the wages was put into operation although the draft showed the relative wages that were being paid in that particular industry were practically lower on the scale than the various other forms of employment that were tabulated.  One cannot dissociate from an industry what is the ability of that industry to pay in the way of wages. On the other hand, we have got in conflict with this amendment a position where the rate of wages is higher, and if the lower rate of wages is going to provide for the conditions that are laid down in the amendment then the higher wages are luxurious.  Yet you have the same arguments brought forward for the higher wages.  They want more wages.</P>
    <P>This is a point that we could discuss here for a very long time without coming to any conclusion.  The only value of the amendment is in so far as it draws attention to a claim on behalf of a portion of the community that they are to get better conditions for what you might call the lower strata.  The answer to that is: Can that be done, and, if so, how?  It is for the Labour members to answer it. I would not attempt to answer it except in so far as the conditions of wages must be a matter for organisation on the one side or the other.  Until some basic solution is found it must be a matter between the particular set of employers, whether it is the State or otherwise, and the people who want the employment.  I would be sorry to oppose this amendment except on the ground that it is impracticable.  On the grounds of the placing of the whole <Col N="1685" /> of this industry under one organisation under Government control, I say that the people that are employed in it are reasonably entitled to expect better conditions than they would get in the competitive market.  I think they always do as far as undertakings of this sort are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooper quoted some figures here from the British census, which I have not had any opportunity of verifying, to prove that only a certain portion of the population with which the census dealt was married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Were married and had children.  Deputy Cooper proceeded to develop that argument until he came to a point which left the Dáil under the impression that a very small proportion of the population were married and had three children.  While it may be the case that a man may not be in the position of being married and having three children, it can be the case that the man's circumstances, brought about by the fact that he has to maintain dependents, will put him in a position of responsibility equal to the man who has a wife and three children.  I wonder what proportion of the population are under that category.  Deputy Cooper did not tell us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I could not tell.  Deputy Norton wants my reference.  If he goes to the library and looks up this week's issue of the &ldquo;New Statesman,&rdquo; which is a Labour organ, or, at any rate, sympathises with Labour, he will find my authority.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper got a certain class of information that suited his argument here and, on the basis of it, proceeded to tell the House that wages was a matter of contract between employers and employees.  Apparently Deputy Cooper does not wish that any other agency should enter into the relations between those two bodies. In other words, the wages to be paid is to be dependent upon the superior forces of one of the contestants in a wages dispute.  If an employer succeeds <Col N="1686" /> then the employer is entitled to force a certain standard and, because he has better resisting powers the standard which the employer is capable of enforcing is to be the standard which is to obtain in industry, and that standard is to be one which, according to Deputy Cooper's reasoning, is to have no regard whatever for the needs of the individual or his citizen and domestic responsibilities.  That goes very near saying, in other words: Let us abolish the Factory Acts; let us abolish the Wage Boards; let us come to the position that wages in all industries are to be determined by the bargaining powers of the employer on the one hand and the employee on the other hand.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. NORTON Mr. NORTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NORTON</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;And his union,&rdquo; Deputy Cooper suggests.  But if his union is dealing with an employer very heavily capitalised, with considerable resources, it cannot stand up against the standard of living which the employer proposes to enforce.  Then the standard of living in that case is going to be the minimum: is going to be the employer's standard of living, and Deputy Cooper sees nothing wrong with that.  On the top of the employer's strength, and on the top of his financial resources we may have thrown into the scale against the organised workers the fact that the labour world is glutted with unemployed.  Deputy Cooper still suggests that that condition of things is the ideal condition of things to be aimed at, and that there should be no intervention and no standard laid down for the two bodies, the employer and the employee.  Deputy Cooper asks: &ldquo;Is this standard suggested in the amendment going to apply to the office sweeper?&rdquo; And he spoke in a way that indicated that he was astonished that the office sweeper should have a wage based upon a fair and average standard of comfort.  Has not the office sweeper, even although he is the office sweeper&mdash;somebody must sweep the office&mdash;got citizen and domestic responsibilities? Is not he always faced with the problem of feeding himself and his dependents, and why should he not be <Col N="1687" /> given a wage based on a reasonable and average standard of comfort?  It is a rather strange thing for Deputy Cooper to be suggesting that he should not be paid a wage having regard to these facts.  I should have thought Deputy Cooper would have left that for Deputy Gorey to say.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hewat said disputes cannot be settled on the basis laid down in the amendment.  I am going to ask Deputy Hewat and Deputy Good if they will give us any cases where employers have endeavoured to settle wages disputes on the basis of a fair and average standard of comfort for a man with a wife and three children.  So far as this city is concerned&mdash;and I have got some experience of it and some experience of trade union negotiations in it&mdash;there is no instance that I know of where employers have come forward and said: &ldquo;We are prepared to settle any dispute on the basis enumerated.&rdquo;</P>

Nineteen thirteen is not such a distance off, and as a goodly number of us can remember&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This amendment, as Deputy Johnson and other speakers from these benches have indicated, is an attempt to establish a reasonable and fair standard of living in connection with the operations of this Board. This Board has a virtual monopoly; this Board will have considerable resources. It will be put in the position of being able to offer strenuous resistance to any trade union attempt to bring into operation a decent wage and a decent standard of living.  And a board armed with all these powers ought not to be allowed to use these powers for the purpose of depressing the standard of living and paying the lowest possible wages that they can get workmen for.  I think the amendment is an eminently reasonable one.  It is an attempt to establish a fair wage, a wage which will provide for an average standard of comfort, and I think it would be a regrettable thing if the majority of this Dáil went into the Division Lobbies declaring they were not prepared to support an amendment which aimed at establishing a fair wage and one which would provide for an average standard of comfort.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, Section 10, line 19, to insert before sub-section (4) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A member of the Board who is concerned in any bargain or contract entered into with the Board or participates in the profit of any such bargain or contract or any work done under the authority of the Board shall be disqualified for and be deemed to have vacated his office as such member.</P>
      <P>This amendment is an extension of the principle of the section itself, and, I think, it will probably be acceptable. The section provides that a person appointed to be a member of the Board shall sell or dispose of shares he may hold in any electrical undertaking which he may have at the time of appointment, and he shall not afterwards become a purchaser or holder of shares.  That is, in regard to electrical undertakings, a member of the Board is debarred from having an interest. The amendment, which extends that principle a little further, is practically taken from the Act dealing with the London Port and Docks authority.  I think it is fairly common in such organisations and I do not imagine that there is any real opposition to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Deputy's imagination goes very far.  Let us see the position in which we are.  Section 9 states that a member of the Board who has any interest in any company or concern with which the Board proposes to make any contract shall disclose to the Board the fact of such interest and the nature thereof, and such member shall take no part in any deliberation or decision of the Board relating to such contract, and such disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the Board.  Now, we have an amendment which says that if a member of the Board is concerned in any bargain or contract entered into with the Board he shall be disqualified from membership.  The two things are contradictory.  Let us imagine a member of the Board who has electricity in his own house and who is in an area for which the Board is an authorised undertaker.  If the Board makes a bargain with that member for supplying electricity to his house such member will have to retire from the Board. The amendment, if adopted, would <Col N="1691" /> mean that we would have to disqualify from membership of the Board any man who uses electricity in his own house.</P>
      <P>There are a whole lot of other points that could be raised on it.  A man who may be a member of the Board, holding shares in any company, which company is supplied in bulk with electricity, is then concerned in any bargain or contract entered into with the Board, and would have to retire.  It is obviously too widely drafted as it stands.  I do not know if the Deputy could suggest any modification.</P>

      <P>I quite recognise from the Minister's statement that the proposed sub-section is too widely drafted.  I take it practically holus bolus from the Port of London Authority Act.  What I want to safeguard is that a member of the Board shall not be a member of a concern, or a participant in the profits of a concern, which is making contracts with the Board.  I do not think Section 9 covers it.  &ldquo;A member of the Board who has any interest in any company or concern with which the Board proposes to make any contract shall disclose to the Board the fact of such interest and the nature thereof ...&rdquo;  The Board will make the contracts presumably with many concerns in the country and outside the country, and members of the Board, as individuals, will probably not know very much about the details of the contracts, or even the firms entering into them.  A contract will be entered into by the officers of the Board, and this proposition really implies that the member of the Board should not be connected with firms dealing with the Board&mdash;a shareholder or a participant in the profits.</P>
      <P>I see my amendment does not fit sufficiently neatly into the section.  I think the section itself is not tight enough to debar a member of the Board from participating in the profits of a contracting firm.  I have drawn attention to the matter, and, in view of my laxity in the drafting of this amendment, I will not press it, but I hope that the subject-matter will be brought forward on another occasion.</P>

      <P>I stand by Section 9, but I would like to enlarge the section, and I propose, either here now or later, to amend the section in some such way as this: In line 65, after the word &ldquo;contract,&rdquo; to insert the phrase &ldquo;for the sale of electricity or the sale of any electric lines, fittings, apparatus or appliances.&rdquo;  The section would then read in this way: &ldquo;A member of the Board who has any interest in any company or concern with which the Board proposes to make any contract for the sale of electricity or the sale of any electric lines, fittings, apparatus or appliances, shall disclose to the Board the fact of such interest and the nature thereof ...&rdquo;  I am keeping to the point that as long as it is a contract with regard to the sale of electricity, electric lines, fittings and appliances, then the lines shall be disclosed, and the member shall take no part in any deliberation or decision.</P>
      <P>There might be added a new sub-section: &ldquo;A member of the Board who is concerned in any contract entered into with the Board other than a contract for the sale of electricity or any lines, fittings, apparatus or appliances, and who is a participant in any such contract, shall be disqualified for and shall be deemed to have vacated his office as such member.&rdquo;  The net result will be when it is a contract for the sale of electricity, and electrical appliances and fittings, then there is the matter of disclosure.  If the member of the Board is concerned in any contract entered into with the Board for any other purpose than those things I have mentioned, then disqualification follows. That goes some way to meet the Deputy.  I cannot, of course, stand on that wording.  I am not suggesting that is the final wording.  I will get that attended to elsewhere, but I think it goes some way to meet the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Minister has gone a considerable way to meet my point, but I am not quite clear why a mere disclosure is satisfactory when one is dealing with articles which might be thought to be the class of articles above all others that the member of the Board should be debarred from having an interest in.  As has been suggested by the Minister, <Col N="1693" /> the view seems to be that a member of the Board might, in fact, be an interested party in an electrical contractor's business and the only requirement that will be put to him will be that he discloses the fact.  Well, the disclosure to a Board of four or five people, each of whom might be interested in the sale of electrical appliances, would not be a barrier against preferential treatment of that particular firm.  I take it that is the real purpose of these provisions.</P>

      <P>I will agree with the Deputy in so far as I have got him on that.  My amendment, in fact, looks the other way.  It insists on disclosure in the case only of where the Board is selling and where there is a member on the Board interested in the sale of electricity or in lines, fittings, et cetera, but not where there is a member of the Board who is also a member of an electrical concern selling to the Board.</P>

      <P>That is more important. There has been a demand, for instance, for experts on the Board.  The Minister has taken the view, and I support him, that he should not be limited in his choice of nominations for the Board to those who might be deemed to be experts.  It is quite possible, and one may say likely, that amongst the persons to be appointed on the Board will be people who have had or may have a monetary interest in the sale of electrical appliances, whether as agents or as members of a company.  It is important that such a connection should no longer be possible after the person becomes a member of the Board, and a mere disclosure of the fact that a person has an interest in the company supplying appliances is not sufficient. We should provide some means of preventing a circumstance of that kind arising.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 14, Section 20, lines 50, 55 and 58, to delete the figures &ldquo;1932&rdquo; and substitute in each case therefor the figures &ldquo;1939.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment you have ruled out of order and this amendment are-nearly allied but they do not cover quite the same ground.  The previous amendment was put forward for the purpose of raising a rather wide question. I can make the case on the amendment now before the House. The section provides that the charges made by the Board up to 31st December, 1932, may be insufficient to cover the expenditure, but after that date all charges&mdash;that is, the revenue to be derived from the sale of electric power &mdash;shall be sufficient to cover all expenses, including capital charges.  The matter was touched on in an earlier amendment.  Deputy Hewat's amendment would have allowed the idea to be discussed, but unfortunately it was not discussed.  The point I wish to make is that the period as from the date when power will be available from the Shannon to 1932 is, or may be, too short in which to ensure that the consumption will be great enough to enable the Board to cover expenditure by revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it possible for the Board to pay deficits out of capital. I think I would prefer to have it as a possibility that the deficit over this preliminary period might be borne as a subsidy.  I know that last idea will not be looked upon with favour by many people.  I, nevertheless, think it would be cheap and good economy once one has accepted the main lines of the scheme, to ensure, by fixing the rates at which electrical power can be <Col N="1695" /> sold at as low a figure as possible, the consumption being rapidly extended. I think the figure 1932 does not conform to the recommendations of the experts in their report.  They spoke of the fifth year after the coming into operation of the scheme.  The experts expect that payment out of revenue of interest on capital to the full extent of 5½ per cent. after paying all working expenses and sinking fund, will not be practicable until the fifth year after the coming into operation of the system.  Now, 1932 is not five years after the contemplated opening of this system; rather is it three years.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that one of the factors that will influence business and industrial concerns in rising to the offers that may be made by the Board for the utilisation of electrical power is that it will be ensured for a period of, say, ten years, at a price that will be as low as a certain rate.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, I think, that the Board should be in a position to say: &ldquo;We will give you power at such a rate over a period of ten years,&rdquo; before the purchaser will respond to the offer, that is, to instal electrical power instead of steam.  I think, therefore, that the date in this section should be extended, and that the Board should be in a position to sell power at a price which does not include interest charges. Right at the beginning of this discussion on the Shannon scheme I urged that a cheap electricity policy should be encouraged from the start, and I went on to suggest the possibility, even the desirability, of treating capital charges as part of a national scheme for the promotion of the use of electricity and the provision of cheap power.  That is the idea behind this amendment, to enable the Board to make provision for giving power cheaply in the early years and to offer it from the beginning of its activities.</P>
    <P>I have looked into the figures that have been provided by well-intentioned propagandists, and it is quite clear from an examination of them that cheapness is not to be got by dealing with the power production and the distribution from the Shannon station. <Col N="1696" /> You might have .5 of 1d. or round about that, by a very big demand, but the great advantage that will come will come from an extension of consumption and the cheapening of the costs of distribution.  Consequently it is our duty, I think, to give facilities to the Board in every possible way to extend the consumption from.  the earliest possible date, even that they may be in a position, as soon as they are able to distribute power, to sell all that they can generate, and I think that we ought to devise our plans to that end and that the Minister ought to make sure that the Board will not be handicapped in that matter by a provision of this kind. With this section they will not be able to offer power at any price beyond 1932.  They will not be able to give assurances that power will be at such a price, say, in the city of Dublin, or even&mdash;what I would like to have a very clear regard for&mdash;in the smaller urban areas.  They will not be able to budget beyond 1932, and therefore will be handicapped in contracting for the sale of power when dealing with large consumers. It would be very much better, I think, to be able to say to a firm which contemplated changing over from steam to electricity: &ldquo;You will have power not exceeding a given rate for ten years,&rdquo; rather than to say that the whole thing will have to be revised in three years.  The Minister and the Board should have the utmost confidence in their ability to continue to sell power at a certain price, but they will also have to convince a prospective purchaser, and unless they are able to give that prospective purchaser an assurance that power will be provided at a low price over a period of years they will deter that prospective purchaser.</P>
    <P>I have said that the question of cheap power depends much more upon the reduction of local charges, and that brings me at once to the question of the Dublin, Rathmines and Pembroke supplies. These places are keenly interested in this matter, and, as I think, have not divulged their whole case to their own public.  I find, for instance, from the latest figures issued by the Dublin supply, that whereas the unit cost on the average to the consumers for the <Col N="1697" /> last year was 3.64d.  If one could eliminate capital charges, income tax on profits, and the profits, it would just divide by two the cost to the consumer. The capital charges in this matter are the capital charges on the remainder of the stock, and perhaps the opportunity will turn up for me to urge that that is a charge that might well be borne freely out of the general funds of the Board, or out of taxation.  But as we are dealing with the funds of the Board I say that that local interest charge might well be borne by the Board and not charged to the Dublin supply.  If we could eliminate for, let us say, the first ten years that charge, which is .9 odd of 1d., and the surplus of that year, which is .7 of 1d., and income tax, which would not have to be paid if there had been no surplus, we would have half the total cost charged to the consumer which might be saved without any breach of the scheme, without taking into account a very small possible reduction in the cost of the bulk supply, and still allowing the full total for reserves, renewals and the present cost of distribution and management, and we would be reducing the cost to the consumer by 50 per cent.  That is a sample, and a sample taken from the most favourable example.  If you take Rathmines or Pembroke you find the position very much worse from the point of view of the present consumers, and a prospect, if my proposition were acceded to, of current being supplied to Rathmines and Pembroke at about one-third of the price they are at present paying.</P>
    <P>I do not believe at all in the divine right of Rathmines or Pembroke to charge 2d. or 3d. a unit more than they need for the sake of retaining a kind of parental control of these supplies. I do not think, for instance, that one would be justified in welcoming the appointment by one Minister of a Commissioner to control the Dublin electricity supply, and then resenting with emphasis the change of the name of that commissioner.  It seems to me to be emphasising quite the wrong thing in this matter.  But I want to come back to the point, that the essence of this proposal is to enable the Board rapidly to extend the consumption <Col N="1698" /> and demand, and to ensure by that means the cheapening of power. Some references have been made to the rather rapid reduction in the costs of electrical power in Dublin, and it is true that there has been a rapid diminution in the costs of generation and distribution during the last few years.  That, I think, has been brought about by lower charges.  I find, for instance, that there has been a decline in four years of, say, 32 per cent. in the costs of generation and distribution per unit sold, and 31 per cent. in the costs, including capital charges.  But the point is that that is concurrent with an increase in the consumption, and it is the increase in the consumption that has made it possible for these reductions to take place.  There is no need for me to elaborate that, because it is common knowledge, I suppose, to anybody who knows anything about this or has read the Official Reports.</P>
    <P>But it is necessary to emphasise the fact that the cheapening of current will depend upon the rapid extension of the demand in the local areas, and not so much on the costs of generating and distributing the bulk supply.  Therefore, I want to give the Board such power as will enable it, over a period of, say, ten years&mdash;I have suggested 1939 instead of 1932&mdash;to make contracts ahead.  I think, too, that that would enable them to look for the rapid development of the distribution system into the smaller towns, and I want to lay emphasis upon the desirability of extending the supply to the smaller towns at the earliest possible date, and to give these smaller towns the cheapest supply compatible with economy.  I think that is only possible when the Board has powers over a period longer than that contemplated by the Bill to borrow for the purpose of meeting the earlier capital charges, or to give an opportunity at a later stage for a new State policy in regard to the financing of this scheme.  Frankly I want to see electricity treated very much as water is treated, and to have it ultimately dealt with for the ordinary household supplies by way of a rate, with an added charge for power used for industrial purposes.  To do that we want to get it into the commonest <Col N="1699" /> possible use, and to develop the electrical power habit.  The habit of electricity is one that I think has to be formed, and I think it ought to be possible for the Board to begin developing that right from the beginning. To do that it must be in a position to make contracts ahead of 1932.  It is on these grounds that I move the extension of this period from 1932 to 1939.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As put up, this amendment only suggests a term three years shorter than the term which Deputy Hewat had sought to set out for the Board when speaking on the Committee Stage.  But it has been put up in a different fashion and I have to give a different reaction to it.  I will always hold out against any amendment of the time which is based upon the idea of men who never believed that the Shannon scheme could pay and now believe still more firmly that it can never pay, Deputy Johnson has not thrown any atmosphere of suspicion of that type about this amendment, as there has been about the previous amendment.  Consequently, it is much easier to meet this point.  I would, however, say to him what I did say on a previous amendment, that it is bettor to have this period enlarged later on when the absolutely final costs of the Shannon scheme are known.  That would be, say, in about a year from now.  It will be in a very short period from now as far as the civil engineering side is concerned, but it will be a little bit longer with regard to the electrical side, because the orders are still in process of being placed.  I will, as my first reaction, put that point.  The experts gave a certain calculation and I will deal with that five years in a moment.  When I was speaking in the Dáil with regard to the Shannon scheme, my whole estimates were based upon the consumption in 1932&mdash;the interest charges and the losses during a period of years were all based on the year 1932 at the utmost.  Having put the scheme to this House on figures based upon that particular year, and having seen no change for the worse&mdash; if anything a change for the better&mdash;<Col N="1700" /> in the demand for electricity that is likely to accrue by itself in 1929, I had the feeling that it was much better still to stand by that particular year of 1932 than to make any change.  I think Deputy Johnson will agree with me that if I had myself come forward with an amendment to change the year of 1932 to 1939 we would have two large headlines in the morning newspapers about the cat being out of the bag&mdash;at least, about the definite admission from the Minister that the scheme cannot pay, and so forth.  There is no such admission.  The situation has eased in favour of the scheme to the extent of the additional 15,000,000 units of consumption which was seen to be likely in 1929.  I have spoken of 1932 as the year upon which I based all my claims when speaking of the scheme. That was the year, despite what Deputy Johnson has correctly quoted from the experts' report&mdash;that in or about five years from the beginning of the scheme it should make a return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another page of the report the experts state that in the first load stage the interest return would only be about 4.6 per cent., but that in the second load stage this should rise to 6.8.  I am not pretending to quote accurately, as I have not got the exact page before me, but that was the effect of the statement. As was usual in the whole of the experts' report, they took a very conservative figure; everything was biased against the scheme.  When they were going into the economics of it, they took the worst possible view. They placed it in this way: that if you get a return which gave you no interest on your money up to the year 1934, that then you could look for a return of about 5 per cent., and that some time after that the natural ordinary addition by way of consumption would land the scheme with a certain amount of extra interest.  Scaling that back and dividing out interest charges, there will be a biggish loss in the first year, a decreasing loss in the second year, and a very much decreased loss in other years.  It seemed on the calculation of the moneys which the experts set aside to meet interest charges and losses during the early years, that 1932. rather than 1934, was the proper year <Col N="1701" /> On that I would make no great point as between 1932 and 1934 at this moment. That was the reason that 1932 was chosen, although the experts said &ldquo;five years after the opening of the scheme,&rdquo; which should be February, 1929.  While I would be disposed to meet Deputy Johnson on the amendment that he has put up now on account of the manner in which he has dealt with it, I want to point out to him that in the absence of approval of amendment 13, which has been ruled out of order, it does not seem to me that to enlarge the date is going to be very much use, for this reason: there has been given, between myself and the Board, a sum of about £600,000 to meet interest charges and loss on working during the unremunerative years.  This has been based on our best calculations up to 1932.  Merely to state that the scheme is not to be made pay its way up to 1939, and not to give the Board any additional moneys with which to meet the interest charges in the further unremunerative years up to 1939, does not leave them in a much better position. In other words, it will need further additions to the finances at the disposal of the Board.  If Deputy Johnson had succeeded in carrying his amendment 13, which would render it unnecessary for the Board to pay interest on the moneys received by it under this Bill, then of course there would be a financial easing to the Board and they might have carried on into these other years.  While I have a very much more favourable reaction to this amendment than to the one moved by Deputy Hewat, simply on account of the ideals behind it.  I do not think That by itself it is going to be very much use.  It simply is going to put to the Board as a headline that there is no necessity to make the scheme pay until this later date of 1939, but there is going to be another necessity on the Board in addition to the Act of Parliament&mdash;there is going to be this fact, that unless they get extra moneys they must get revenue to equal their outgoings in or about 1932, so that, without a further vote, the headline which Deputy Johnson would set by this amendment would be of very little good to the Board, as the Board will <Col N="1702" /> have to set out to cut its cloth according to its capacity.</P>
    <P>It has, however, been impressed upon me from a variety of sources that it is unwise to set the members of the Board this very difficult task of getting both ends to meet by 1932.  Remember, this was put to me by people who have no doubt about the 110,000,000 units still being achieved and who have very little doubt, following upon conversations I have had with them, that the actual moneys to be expended on the Shannon scheme will not be any larger than the vote given in the first Shannon Act.  They say, simply: Is it good policy to set out merely to secure a sale of 110,000,000 units and to charge, say, .8 all over the country, when by reducing that .8 by a further decimal point you can get, possibly, a consumption of 150,000,000 units and have the bigger load factor operating for the benefit of the consumers?  That has been put very definitely on the grounds of better electricity business.  It has been insisted upon by people who have the fullest confidence that the 110,000,000 units sale can be achieved by 1932, and that the costs are not going to be increased.  Nevertheless, they say it would be bad electricity business to make charges on such a scale that revenue must meet outgoings in that year, and as that seems to be a business point of view that is getting considerable weight, and as it has been put to me in that reasonable form, I would be rather disposed to make some change.  But the change cannot be made under Deputy Johnson's amendment. There will have to be an addition and it will fall for consideration whether there is any way of meeting that addition without necessarily enlarging the money voted here and now. It is possible to leave them to carry on and say: &ldquo;Very well, if there is further money required, this is more or less a headline from the Dáil and, if passed by the Seanad, from the Oireachtas that more money will have to be provided.&rdquo;  I think that is the logical implication of passing the amendment in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I come back to the other point: Is it wise to change the date now?  I refuse, as I have already <Col N="1703" /> refused, to give the House guarantees, but I will give them statements more or less of fact with regard to certain prices, with regard to how the cost is working out, and I will say to them that there is no reason now to ask for further money for the Shannon works. That being so, if there is any doubt on the other side as to the 75 or 78 or 80 million units of 1929 being increased by some sort of ordinary effort on the part of the Board up to 110 million unitil in 1932, are we right in deciding now that the Board should not make revenue meet outgoings in 1932? Would not it be better to leave that until 1929 when the last figure has been determined, and when one is no longer dealing in estimates, although I say these estimates are approaching the region of actual fact?  Would it not be better to wait until 1929 when the final figure will have been determined and when one can see, after the Board has been in operation a couple of years, what is likely to be the consumption even on the date of the opening of the whole Shannon works, set the two things in relation and decide what is the best business proposition for the Board to follow?</P>
    <P>As will be apparent, I have no great antagonism to the amendment but I would like it to get a little more consideration. Really, I do not suppose it matters much as between 1937 or 1939 or 1940.  We are only discussing the matter of sticking to the particular date that I mentioned when urging the first Shannon Bill here, or whether we should enlarge it.  It is not of very much importance whether we enlarge it by three or five years, but I would ask Deputy Johnson simply to take into consideration what I have said&mdash; that it might be better to leave it as it is and deal with the matter when we have the factors more clearly before us upon which a precise judgment can be formed&mdash;that is to say, round about 1929.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says the amendment is brought forward in a very different atmosphere from that in which the corresponding amendment standing in my name was brought forward <Col N="1704" /> in Committee.  I think that is quite true.  The amendment in my name, I confess openly to the House, although the Minister did receive it with a certain amount of indignation, was frankly an amendment asking the Minister to verify the figures on which the scheme was based in the light of his knowledge and information as to the progress of the work and the possible prospects as they appear to him at that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister on that occasion was perfectly frank.  The answer to my amendment was that he had no doubt at all that in 1929 the output at the generating station would have reached 75,000,000 units.  Further, he said that he had no doubt that in the year 1932 the number of units sold would reach 110,000,000.  As the 110,000,000 is the figure on which the experts had calculated certain returns and certain results, then, according to the Minister, in the year 1932 the scheme should be in a position to pay the charges, including interest and sinking fund, as laid down in the previous section of this Bill.  Deputy Johnson, in supporting his amendment, gave very different reasons from those which I gave on a previous amendment for changing the date.  I think the arguments, as coming from Deputy Johnson, are very logical indeed.  But the amendment alters very much the character of the scheme and the objects to be achieved, because Deputy Johnson's proposal is to extend the period under which interest and sinking fund would operate until 1939.  That proposal was with a view to putting a more or less fictitious price on the sale of current so as to introduce more general use of electricity. In other words, the scheme would be subsidised by writing off that amount in its initial stages or it would be burdened at a later stage with the accumulated arrears of interest and sinking fund.  I should not like to put forward a definite objection to either proposal.  I think it is a question for every member of the Dáil and for every part of the country to decide&mdash; that is to say, whether or not, having decided on a nationalised scheme, that scheme should be subsidised in order to provide light cheaply to consumers <Col N="1705" /> throughout the country.  I think the objection would be raised that the non-consumers of electricity were being called upon to make up a deficit in favour of the users of electricity, just as it was stated in regard to Dublin that it was not the ratepayers who paid the money but the consumers.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply, says that it would be better to leave the year 1932 in the Bill until such times as the facts and figures in connection with the Shannon works have been ascertained. I think the Minister's suggestion, that the year 1932 should remain, as far as this Bill is concerned, is the better one, because there is a very considerable interval between the present time and the time when these conditions will operate, in which the Dáil can make provision, if they care to do so, for converting the scheme into a subsidised State scheme from being a self-supporting scheme.  At the present time, I think it is undesirable to go into that very big question.  All things considered, I think it would be much better to leave the Bill as it stands, with the expression by the Minister&mdash; which expression I do not take any exception to&mdash;that, with the information obtained within the next twelve or eighteen months, the Dáil will be in a better position to comment upon and criticise any action proposed to be taken for altering the basis of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I admit quite frankly that the form of this amendment is not at all complete&mdash;that is to say, that the mere acceptance by the Dáil of the amendment would not achieve all that I desire.  Certain consequential amendments would be required, in any event.  I am, unfortunately, coming in rather late in the hunt, and I have to try to recover lost ground.  I take this means of ventilating certain views which I have on the general scheme.  Equally frankly, I want to make it possible for the Board to do what I think would be good business and&mdash;much more important&mdash;good social service&mdash;that is to say, to supply Dublin City, Rathmines, Pembroke and the urban districts at hand, who are paying, notwithstanding <Col N="1706" /> all the boasts about the efficiency of the existing schemes, double, and perhaps treble, what they need pay for consumption of electricity, provided we look upon this scheme as a social service rather than a mere moneymaking proposition.  After all, if we are thinking of this electric power proposition as something that is going to affect the greater part of the country, particularly the crowded areas, and not as an extension of or an improvement upon the Dublin Gas Company&mdash; a sort of subordinate profit-making scheme&mdash;then we should approach it from the point of view of giving a supply of electricity at the lowest possible price to the greatest possible number of people for lighting, heating and cleaning houses.  We should try to get the electric habit inculcated in the city, because it will have a very big social effect.  I am convinced of that from certain observations I made in other cities.  It is worth paying a good deal of money for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the supply of electric power to Dublin, it surprises me, coming with some freshness, to read in the debates expressions of surprise and astonishment that the Minister should be suggesting now that Dublin must come to the aid of the scheme.  My memory is sufficiently acute to make me confident in saying that the conception from the beginning was that the supply to Dublin, Pembroke and Rathmines should be taken from the Shannon, with the possibility that steam plant might be brought in to assist.  There is nothing new about the idea that Dublin must take Shannon power.  I want to see them take that power and get the advantage&mdash;the immediate advantage&mdash;which I think can be got.  If we can supply to the householder power at 2d. or 3d., instead of 6d., as they are paying to-day, if we can ensure that that is going to be supplied for a period of years and if, in addition, there is going to be an early scheme for cheap wiring and the supply of apparatus and appliances, long before 1932 I think we will be considering the question of the extension of the &ldquo;later development&rdquo; of the scheme.  I think it ought to be contemplated from the beginning that power <Col N="1707" /> is going to be supplied to the consumers in Dublin at a price which will eliminate the capital charges that are at present included in the price for the Dublin distribution scheme and the Rathmines and Pembroke distribution schemes; the 2d. income tax, the .7d. surplus, these things, which total nearly 2d. per unit, can be saved and consumers will get the benefit.  I think that, by rapid increase, right in the early stages, of the demand for electric power for lighting and heating and ordinary domestic activities, we would be in a better position to extend to the smaller towns and villages.  I think we ought to have that as a clear objective&mdash;the rapid extension of electric power to and its consumption in the smaller towns and villages.  We ought not to close our thoughts to the proposition that it is worth the State's while to bear a considerable proportion, if not the whole, of the capital charges on the distribution side, which are heavier in proportion than the capital charges on the power-production side, with a view to subsidising, if you like to use the word, the consumption of electric power.  I think if that were contemplated by a future Dáil, from the point of view of making the whole scheme a success, we should need to give the Board the right to expect that they could make contracts for ten years ahead, so that those who are likely to be users of power will have definite encouragement to change their plant.</P>
    <P>I can only leave the matter there. As I say, the Minister has met the point in a friendly fashion, and as I know that other amendments will be required and that it is rather late in this House to try to make all the amendments necessary, it would be useless perhaps for me to divide the House on the matter.  I can only leave it with the Minister, and see what can be done in the Seanad if the Bill ever reaches there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one sentence that I used on the Committee Stage of the Bill that, I think, is worth while repeating on this very point.  I said then: &ldquo;So long as the point is recognised that it may prove to be good <Col N="1708" /> business to run the scheme, even at a loss, for a certain number of years in order to make it pay in the end, I think the Minister is quite right in saying that the proper time to put that motion to the Dáil is much later than now.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I take it the proper time would be when the Board has been at work for some time, perhaps in the year 1929 or 1930.  They would see then what the future was likely to be with reference to running the scheme successfully, and they would be in a position, through the Minister, to come to the Dáil and say that in order to make this scheme a success it may be necessary to have it temporarily or permanently subsidised for a certain number of years.  It would be for the Board to say, through the Minister, to what extent they would require further financial assistance. Therefore, there is not much use in delay at this stage, or in putting this back until we know what the amount of that financial assistance is likely to be.  I think that point of view is supported by Section I in the Bill, where, clearly, there is power given to the Board for a certain period to fix rates and charges in such a way that they should be conducive to that end. Indeed I am not sure that I would not rather quarrel with the looseness of the words making it possible to give the current away for three years in order to get a better sale for the current later on.  I agree with Deputy Johnson that one of the most vital things to secure the success of this scheme is a rapid increase in the demand for the current in its early stages.  It may be necessary for the Board to seek, through the Minister, further help from the Dáil in order to secure that in the early years of the scheme.  I think the Minister was right in saying that the proper time to do that is when the Board is at work and has formed its plan of campaign for the future.</P>

      <P>There is just a point that occurs to me by the reference that has been made to the amount of money already voted.  I think it might be opportune to put this question to the Minister.  A certain sum of money has been voted for the original scheme. The Minister believes, and is quite confident, as far as any evidence is shown, <Col N="1709" /> that the work will be done within that sum.  I gather that there have been certain rather considerable modifications at Limerick in regard to the deepening of the river and so on.  Perhaps the Minister would take this opportunity of explaining how that enters into the question of cost and what bearing it has on the original sum advanced.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson's question reminds me of something that I had intended to refer to when speaking a moment ago.  Can the Minister tell us to what extent the calculations of the experts with reference to the time in which the scheme would be paying&mdash;calculations which, I think. were based merely on the capital expenditure of £5,200,000&mdash;have been affected by the further sum of two-and-a-half millions voted?  The whole of that, I take it, will not go directly as an addition to the standard charges.  I think part of it will.  I have no doubt the Minister has gone into the question as to what extent that further charge will modify the conclusions arrived at by the experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I want to make a point of objection to what Deputy Thrift said in his first intervention when he spoke of a subsidy. There is no question of a subsidy as regards the sum of £5,200,000. because it has all to be paid back. Similarly in regard to Deputy Johnson's amendment, if it were accepted, there would be nothing in the way of a subsidy.  It would simply be a matter of an advance for a period, but the electricity consumers will eventually have to pay all the money back.  With regard to the question raised by Deputy Johnson, there have been considerable modifications here and there with regard to excavations, embankments. and things of that nature.  The two biggest have been, first, that the weir has had to be shifted up stream in order to get a solid rock foundation, and the second item is that the deepening of the Shannon at Limerick has been cut out.  Any change that has been made in the scheme of any importance has been referred to the experts and their sanction has been obtained before any change has been <Col N="1710" /> made and accepted here.  The cutting out of the work of deepening the Shannon at Limerick has left a certain amount of money free, but the change in the barrage, the shifting of that up stream has made a change against the scheme.</P>
      <P>There is one point on which I would like to correct Deputy Johnson.  I do not think I have said yet that I am confident the cost will not be exceeded. I have said that there is nothing yet to show me that the costs will be exceeded, which is a different thing.  I am riot pretending to prophesy, but am going on the facts that I have before me.  With regard to the estimates, I stated that on the electricity side certain orders had not yet been placed, and that consequently certain matters had not yet fallen for consideration. The main thing is that within the powers given to me under the Shannon Electricity Act I was given a certain. sum of money to proceed along the lines of the Siemens-Schuckert plan as modified by the experts.  Any modifications made in that plan have been done always in consultation with the experts, and eventually we will see that a certain power supply is obtainable for the expenditure of a certain amount of money.  These really were the essentials and to these essentials I am keeping. As I have already indicated, there may be certain changes here and there.  The deepening of the Shannon would have been a very intricate undertaking.  It would also have proved to be a very expensive job, but it has been found to be unnecessary from the point of view of the provision of power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Thrift raised a point about the experts' figures.  He asked if they were based on the expenditure of the £5,200,000, and as fresh money was now being voted he wants to know how far the experts' figures will be modified by that.  Their figures only refer to the generation cost and simply go against generation, and these figures have not been modified at all.  In other words, the sums of money spent on the ordinary things on which the unit cost of generation would be based have nut been changed, but these additional things are moneys which will come <Col N="1711" /> as a charge not on the generation side but on the distribution side.</P>
    <P>Might I put the matter in this way: Supposing the Board&mdash;this, I venture to say, will be quite an unlikely contingency&mdash;decided that it would not acquire any existing undertaking; that it would not build any new net work, that it would not give any facilities for wiring, and would not sell any electrical appliances, then the Board will not take one penny out of this sum of two and a half million pounds provided under this Bill.  If the Board does any of these things then that will be a charge against the particular service for which the money is taken.  If the Board decided to sell ex-transformer in every case, then the Board will be handed over the Shannon plant, plus the advance of £600,000, to meet losses during the unremunerative period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment may be said to be unnecessary.  It proposes to insert in Section 31, sub-section (3) that certain specific accounts are to be rendered not merely to the Minister but to the Dáil.  I do not know whether the Minister will say that under Section 6 these accounts will already come within the scope of that section, but as I read it sub-section (3) of Section 31 is governed by the understanding that &ldquo;such statistics and <Col N="1713" /> returns furnished to him under this section (together with a copy of such of the accounts of the Board furnished to him under this Act) as in his opinion are necessary for the proper understanding of any such report.&rdquo; I do not want the Minister's opinion to be the final guide.  I want the statute to be the final guide, and I want to make certain that the Dáil will receive the balance sheet, the profit and loss account, the revenue account, and the capital account.  I do not think that the present Minister has any intention of communicating those accounts to the Dáil, but Ministers come and Ministers go.  I do not know where they go, but I would like to have some permanent indication, not merely the state of mind of some prospective Minister, but some permanent indication that the Dáil, and through the Dáil the taxpayer, will receive information in this matter.  I do not think that at the worst this amendment can be considered more than unnecessary verbiage, and I would not worry about printing two lines of unnecessary verbiage if I could allay some of the suspicions aroused by this Bill.  I think the cost of printing the two lines of verbiage would satisfy the public that this is a fair and above board transaction and would be a very good bargain. I therefore urge the amendment on the Minister and on the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I must say I consider the words more or less verbiage. I put it to the Deputy this way.  Under Section 6 there have, at least, to be published all the accounts to which the Deputy refers in this amendment, and then, under Section 31, certain things must be laid before the Oireachtas. Members of the Oireachtas will, probably, be able to get anything which is published, and, supposing a debate were <Col N="1714" /> to be staged on this report laid before the Oireachtas, I wonder is there any authority which could prevent Deputies referring to accounts published by the Board, when they come to deal with the statement laid before the House.  Even though it may be unnecessary, and I think it is, I am quite prepared to accept this amendment. If I may change the argument, if I thought the same Dáil was always to continue, I would consider this quite unnecessary, because I would consider the members of it quite intelligent enough to be able to deal with accounts published outside.  But viewing a prospective Dáil, I suppose we had better make allowance for deficiencies.</P>

What this amendment does is it gives them fourteen days in which to make application.  I think that is perfectly fair.

      <P>I move amendment 24&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 19 to add at the end of section 34 the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any person who on the 1st day of March, 1927, was selling electricity or supplying electricity for sale shall be entitled to continue until an order is made by the Board determining his right so to do.  In the event of such an order being made the person whose right is so determined shall be entitled to compensation for any loss incurred by him by reason of the making of such order.  The amount of such compensation shall be fixed by an arbitrator.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the last occasion that the Bill was in Committee the Minister promised that he would bring in amendments to meet the case of those people who were known as unauthorised undertakers.  I think it was this morning we got an amendment which will come on later, but there is not a word about compensation and I would like to hear, first of all, from the Minister why he has not fulfilled his promise, the promise that he would bring in amendments to deal with the question of compensation to non-statutory undertakers.  I can see nothing, so far, in the official amendment dealing in any way with the question of compensation to non-statutory undertakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with this point, Deputies will have to consider amendment 25a and amendment 27.  If I might explain, without going into the amendment at the moment, <Col N="1719" /> what generally my two amendments arrive at is this, that the Board must give a permit to every unauthorised undertaker and cannot withhold such permit except in the case of the various exceptions that are stated in 25a, and no unauthorised undertaker can be wiped out of existence except by agreement.  That is the net result of amendment 27.  If the Board can make an agreement as to compensation with an unauthorised undertaker between this and the autumn then that agreement will hold. If the Board cannot make an agreement then the unauthorised undertaker must get a permit and he can continue to supply.  I have adopted this method of dealing with the unauthorised undertaker because when I came to consider the difficulty of dealing with all these people about whom we had no information I considered the best solution was to permit the unauthorised undertaker to continue to insist on the unauthorised undertaker being given a permit.  The Board would then use its compulsory powers in the first six months to get information for this House which I have not been able to put before it. Somewhere in the autumn there must be amending legislation with regard to the unauthorised undertaker.  By that time we shall be able to get from the Board information that we cannot give to the House at the moment with regard to the unauthorised undertaker. When the Board comes into being it can use its compulsory powers of getting information with regard to the number of consumers, the maximum price, the capital moneys put into it and so on and we can get that information from the Board.  Up to that date no unauthorised undertaker can be interfered with.  The unauthorised undertaker must be given a permit and that permit cannot be withdrawn. The only case in which an unauthorised undertaker goes out of existence is where there is agreement with the Board as to the price to be paid if he decides to leave the competitive field.  I want to stabilise that position, but this is simply marking time in which to exercise the Board's <Col N="1720" /> compulsory powers with regard to information and until the House can get information so as to form a proper judgment on the whole matter.  I say that is my intention.  I believe that intention is carried out by the addition of these two amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment 25a states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Board shall not refuse to grant to any person who was on the 31st day of March, 1927, supplying electricity to the public in any area otherwise than as an authorised undertaker a permit under this section to continue supplying electricity to the public in that area if no alternative supply of electricity is available for that area...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There may seem to be a loop-hole there. There will be no alternative supply of electricity available; the Board want all the electricity at its disposal in the first place.  So there is no gap in that particular part of the amendment.  It is meant to guard against this, namely, that permitted undertakers, the terms of whose permit must be that they would give to the Board such information required, might say that they refused a permit on such conditions, that they would operate against the Board, and insist on the permit being given without such conditions.  Consequently, a provision must be put in to the effect that the undertaker must be willing to comply with such conditions. I want the most suspicious mind to understand what conditions the Board would be satisfied with.  The only possible way in which the Board could acquire under that section is by agreement with unauthorised undertakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Myles referred to the special case of Greystones which applied for powers to the House of Commons, and which were blocked by certain non-statutory undertakers who tried to avail of the offers of my Department that they should become statutory at an expense of £10 per head.  All I can do for these people is to suggest to the Board that their position should be examined with a view to their being made immediately authorised undertakings, and that the Board should also look with favour on all undertakings which tried to become authorised at a cost of £10 per head.  That would <Col N="1721" /> affect undertakings like Carrickmacross, Listowel, Buncrana, and Tuam.  I could suggest to the Board that they should regard favourably their position and make them authorised undertakings. If the Board do not accept that suggestion, and they need not, those undertakings, with all their data, will come before the House later when the whole question of these undertakings are dealt with.  All I am doing is that I am following the suggestion made by Deputy Baxter in Committee, but he thought that it was possible to get this information in a limited time.  I have decided that the best thing to do is to get the information and stereotype such undertakings until it is got.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I must still dispute that.  The Minister has stated that, within a period, the State alone will be the undertaker all over the country.  I assume, therefore. that every undertaking will disappear and he has stated that he hopes that that period will be short.  This amendment No. 24, to my mind, is very simple. It states simply that, in the event of such order being made, that is, in the event of a private undertaking being turned out of business, it shall be entitled to compensation for any loss incurred by reason of the making of such order, and the amount of such compensation <Col N="1722" /> shall be fixed by an arbitrator. We are met on that point by the Minister, who says that he cannot get information out of these people.  He does not want very much information, and I would make a couple of suggestions to him.  One suggestion is with regard to what he might have done in the past, and the other with regard to what he could do to-morrow.</P>
      <P>About three years ago he circularised all undertakings in the country, asking if they would become statutory.  A large number said they would, but a larger number said that they would not At that time the Minister could very easily have put a small Act through the Dáil compelling that information to be given, and compelling, as he is compelling to-day, these people to become statutory undertakers or else go out of business.  I believe that at the time such a Bill was in the framing, but it never got any further, and private undertakers believed at that time that the information asked for and the object of becoming statutory were for no other purpose than to levy contributions off the sale of their units.  These people could not see why they should pay that levy.  As ordinary men, they could not see why they should bind themselves to be compelled to take out these powers for the purpose of being levied to the tune of so much per thousand units sold per annum.  I do not think that the Minister can dispute that. Whether he meant to give them any service in the years to come I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second suggestion I would make is that a great deal of the information which he requires could be bought for a couple of shillings by means of any of the handbooks published yearly, which will be found to be up to date. In such handbooks there is a list of every station in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, with the prices and, in some cases, with the amount of plant, with the voltage, and the different prices charged per unit.  That information could be obtained for a couple of shillings, and it would cover the ground.  If, however, the Minister was not satisfied with that, he had only to bring in the Bill which never saw the light of day three years ago.  The <Col N="1723" /> Minister tells us that his amendment is going to leave the private undertakings all right.  It will leave them all right for that period, pending the acquisition by the Board, according to the Minister's statement, of every undertaking in the country.  Then the question will again arise as to compensation. If the Minister will say that these undertakings which he will allow to carry on will be made statutory automatically, the question will not arise, because they will be made available for compensation by the very fact of their being made statutory. Here, however, we have in black and white an amendment to the effect that compensation shall be paid, and that the amount of such compensation shall be fixed by an arbitrator.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that that last phrase, &ldquo;shall be fixed by an arbitrator,&rdquo; covers the matter.  What information does he want?  The arbitrator is the man to get the information, and if the Minister is afraid that somebody might get a little too much, the arbitrator can only do his best.  He may give one man too much, and another too little, but he will get that information when each case is brought before him, and I suggest that he will get it in a better and truer form than in any return made to the Minister, because the experience of a great many private undertakings is that they are asked for returns by various departments.  They were recently asked for returns by the Statistical Department.  Many of these men are workingmen, and they are either acting as managers or they borrowed money to start undertakings. They are asked to fill up forms compared with which the income tax forms are not in the same street as regards questions and complications.  Whenever a plea is put forward on behalf of private undertakings, the Minister always refers to the want of information.</P>
    <P>If a case comes up for consideration the arbitrator shall say whether compensation is to be paid, and he shall fix the amount of such compensation, if any.  I do not see how any man can do more.  He can lay down the basis of compensation which will resolve itself into an equitable basis.  The Minister has raised the point that the plant <Col N="1724" /> of some of these people consists of small mills, and, because they may sell to two or three of their neighbours in the district, their profits are large in proportion. The owner of a small plant such as that might make no profit unless he received £10 or £15 a year from each of half-a-dozen neighbours.  Such cases are few, and when they come be fore the arbitrator I suggest that it is his business to segregate them right away.  He can go into the question, bearing in mind that a man may have put in a larger plant than he probably would have put in if he were only supplying his own mill and house.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the Second Reading of the Bill, and again on Committee Stage, the Minister admitted that the Bill was imperfect with regard to the unauthorised undertakings, but pointed out that it was not possible to fix any basis for compensation in the absence of the fullest information with regard to these undertakings.  The fact that such information was not available was due to the refusal of the unauthorised undertakings on many occasions to supply answers to certain questions put to them.  Amendments were, however, promised so as to secure adequate compensation for these undertakings, and the Dáil will, on Report Stage, have to debate how far the proposed amendments secure compensation on good terms to these concerns.  This is, undoubtedly, the most difficult matter of all those dealt with in the Bill.  Compensation is undoubtedly due, but if the sum were fixed in the absence of the details of each undertaking of this type, it might be put so high as to lay an intolerable burden for the future on the consumers in the area of such undertakings.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I read this circular because it shows that the Minister circularised a certain number of Deputies for the purpose of dealing with the people down the country.  In that circular the Minister says that compensation is undoubtedly due, and he mentions: &ldquo;Amendments were, however, promised so as to secure adequate compensation for these undertakings, and the Dáil will, on Report Stage, have to debate how far the proposed amendments secure compensation on good terms to these concerns.&rdquo;  I think that the question of compensation can be very simply dealt with if the Minister is really genuine in his intention that this Bill should go through the House with fair treatment to everybody concerned. The Minister admits it himself in his own circular which, I presume, was meant only for the supporters of the Government.  My name must have got in by mistake.  I suggest it is very easy for him to accept amendment 24.  That will put the matter beyond yea or nay, and I do not think it is going to bind the Minister nor will it lay an intolerable burden on the consumers.  If it does, it will be because his arbitrator has not dealt with the matter in a sensible manner. I understand the Minister is going to select the arbitrator.</P>

      <P>I will leave him to select the arbitrator if he will agree to the amendment.  I think the Minister has got away from the stage when he reproached these private undertakings with skimming the cream.  In the early stages of the debate on this Bill we were told these private undertakings started off without any regulations or obligations and skimmed the cream. I think it is not right or fair to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has brought no individual case to our notice.  He was asked to mention a case; he was asked had he <Col N="1726" /> a case in mind.  He had not.  The only case he has brought to our notice is one where a man with a small mill, a flax. scutch or corn mill, puts in a dynamo in order to light the mill and his own house and then supplies a few people in the immediate neighbourhood.  According to the Minister's statement about 250 or 300 would be the approximate number.  Time and again he brings the number down to 90, and he even further reduces it to 62.  Even if the number is 62, the Minister could not point to one undertaking that has done nothing but skim the cream.  I suggest to him that these people in most cases&mdash;in practically every case&mdash; held before them the same idea that a statutory undertaker would have to work on, and that their areas were approximately, in many cases, far greater areas than those assigned by the statute of the British House of Commons to those undertakings that took out parliamentary powers.  I know a good many of these cases, and I do not know any cases where the area is not extensive and where the undertakings are not attended to in all details in a similar manner as if they were working under statute.</P>
    <P>In the case of statutory undertakings I admit that certain obligations were put upon the statutory undertaker; but, on the other hand, certain privileges were granted and certain regulations were made for the statutory undertaker. One of these regulations was that the variation in voltage should not exceed two per cent.  I hope the Board will be able to keep to that two per cent.  If they do, they will be doing very well.</P>
    <P>The Minister has acquiesced, if he has not actually stated&mdash;I think it was another Deputy who stated it without sufficient knowledge of the subject&mdash; that these private undertakings are working under the permission of the county councils, revocable at a moment's notice.  That may be so in some parts of the country, but I have never come across it and.  as a member of a county council.  I have seen many of these agreements drawn up, and in every agreement there were water-tight compartments which were as binding as a statute of the British House of <Col N="1727" /> Commons used to be in regard to these matters.  There were penalties for inefficiency; there were terms in that agreement that bound the undertaking to do certain things and do them in an efficient manner.  Failing this, the penalty then was that the agreement should be brought to an end.  So long as certain conditions were carried out those agreements were as good, and were regarded as good at that time, as the sanction of Westminster.</P>
    <P>I know of several undertakings in this country which came into being, and which have been working for almost a quarter of a century, and they were advised so to work by one of the most eminent lawyers in this country, the late Serjeant Matheson, who gave it as his opinion that there was no law in this country to prevent undertakings being carried out as these non-statutory undertakings are being carried out to-day. I fail to see why the Minister has allowed himself practically to ostracise these individuals in most cases, or groups of individuals, people who relied on the permission and authority given by their fellow-men in this country, and who relied on counsel's advice that it was sound policy, and who have been carrying on, in some cases I believe, for a full quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister thinks of what the effect will be if these people are badly treated over the whole length and breadth of the Saorstát. In towns and villages you meet the people who started these undertakings, and you find that in every case they are the most enterprising, the most go-ahead, and the most industrious people as a rule.  They are people who were prepared to put their money into undertakings in their own towns.  They are the people who provided very great benefit for their neighbours.  Remember that these consumers were not bound in any way.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to some of his remarks in regard to non-statutory undertakings.  On the 16th March the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Non-statutory undertakers will be permitted to carry on until such time as the Board is able to make an inquiry as to their plant and their <Col N="1728" /> financial standing, and it will then decide if they are suitable cases for compensation.  When that decision is come to it will be easy for them to become authorised and to fall under the conditions of the Bill with regard to authorised undertakers... It is recognised that they have done good work, and that there is an area of supply open to the new Board that would not otherwise be open under such easy conditions.</P>
    <P>Later on the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In the matter of compensation, I do not want to give the Board powers, as they are undoubtedly given in the Bill, to proceed on a campaign of wholesale destruction of unauthorised undertakers with no compensation given.  That is not the intention. The Board are given certain powers, and, of course, the suspicious mind can bring to me this consideration: &ldquo;But the Board may not use these powers.&rdquo;  I will admit they may not, and they may wipe out, and pay no compensation to, an unauthorised undertaker.</P>
    <P>Then on the next page (column 695) the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>There are, of course, a great many unauthorised undertakers who have done good public service.  They have supplied lighting for streets and for a community.  There are many of that type who would ordinarily become authorised undertakers if they had applied for an order.</P>
    <P>They did not apply for an order in a great many cases because the Minister did not wish them to, or did not go far enough to explain the procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy to be wise after the event.  I do not think the Minister should look upon the matter in the same light as he has looked upon it.  I think the functions of a Minister of the State are not to laugh over the mistakes of the people of the State.  I think the functions of a Minister are rather to help the people on; any other policy is not a policy the Ministry should carry out. On page 715 the Minister talked about <Col N="1729" />&ldquo;the difficulty of dealing with the whole problem, and the best I can offer&mdash;and Deputy Myles will not accept it, because it is not now in the Bill&mdash;to the reasonable portion of the House is that between this and the Report Stage we shall have some amendment thought out based upon the considerations I have spoken of, and we will see if it is possible to determine the basis of compensation and to give an indication to the Board.&rdquo;  I think the Minister is really beginning to realise, especially in the light of his own words that I have read, that these people are, after all, Irishmen, working in their own country, and that they are entitled to fair and equitable treatment when their livelihood is being taken away from them by an action of the State.  This is the question of water-power stations. These stations have saved the country in the matter of the adverse trade balance.  They have produced an article which was formerly produced by importing coal or oil fuel, and the amount of that saving must run into a considerable figure.  I think that these are arguments that should be fully considered, and after all it is the basis on which the Minister is going in connection with the whole scheme, that by the introduction of the water-power scheme perhaps the importation of millions of tons of coal and thousands of gallons of oil will not be further required and the money will be kept in the country. You will be producing from water in the country your raw material, instead of importing it, and I would point out to the Minister that a great many of these private undertakings were run by water, and practically by water alone.  Therefore, they have had no adverse effect on the trade of the country, but quite the reverse. They have been a valuable asset. During the recent coal strike every one of them carried on.  There was no question of a shortage of light, because these people were able to meet the demand without putting up the price and without being obliged to curtail the services.  All these water-power stations carried on during that troublesome time.  I think we ought <Col N="1730" /> to recognise in our legislation, and put into practice in our public administration and in dealing with public affairs the well-known principle that no State necessity can justify an act which in itself is unjust and that no advantage gained can be of service when there is a breach of faith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never heard so much time wasted on an absurd amendment as Deputy Myles has wasted on this, and I would be rather annoyed at the waste of time were I not conscious of the reason for the Deputy's effort.  The Deputy suffers from a bad conscience.  The Deputy is a member of the Electricity Supply Association, and that Association was instrumental in preventing unauthorised undertakers accepting the offer of my Department that they should become authorised at a rate of £10 per head.  A number of them now rue the fact that they accepted the Electricity Supply Association's recommendation, and the Deputy is now making the best case he can by an oration which has no advertence to the amendments I have down, which meet everything that I promised on Committee.  I said that there was a great difficulty in dealing with the situation.  I said on Second Reading that it might be necessary to postpone the whole thing for six months.  Deputy Baxter put up the suggestion that we could get the information in a certain limited period.  I said that was not possible, and I also put in the phrase that it might be necessary to delay until such time as the details could be obtained, so that a proper judgment could be formed on the matter of compensation.  The quotation which the Deputy read stated that some amendment would be thought out, based upon the considerations I have spoken of, &ldquo;and we will see if it is possible to determine the basis of compensation and to give an indication to the Board.&rdquo;  I come here to-night with an amendment which states that we will leave every unauthorised undertaker operating.  We insist that he be allowed to operate, that he must get a permit and that the permit cannot be withheld or withdrawn.  The only case where he can disappear is where he makes an agreement with the Board as <Col N="1731" /> to the price to be paid, and Deputy Myles gives us his brief, prepared without any advertence to that amendment; the amendment might never have been put down for all the effect that it has on him.  Let us see what his own suggestion is: &ldquo;Any person who on the 1st day of March, 1927, was selling electricity or supplying electricity for sale shall be entitled to continue until an Order is made by the Board determining his right to do so.&rdquo;  What is the effect of my amendment?  That the Board cannot make an order determining his right to do so, and Deputy Myles comes along with his sentence with regard to compensation.  As one who has been in touch with business details, may I say I am scandalised by the proposition&mdash;&ldquo;in the event of such an Order being made the person whose right is so determined shall be entitled to compensation for any loss incurred by him by reason of the making of such Order.&rdquo;  And then, casually, this sweeping sentence: &ldquo;The amount of such compensation shall be fixed by an arbitrator,&rdquo; with nothing stated as to who is to appoint the arbitrator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has referred to that before, and I was at pains to contradict him and to enlighten him on the subject, but apparently he has not yet learned.  There is no appointment of an arbitrator by the method that the Deputy has stated. But what are the terms of reference to the arbitrator?  &ldquo;The person whose right, is so determined shall be entitled to compensation.&rdquo;  What compensation? &ldquo;Compensation for any loss incurred by him by reason of the making of such Order.&rdquo;  Let me take the case I gave; the case of an individual who decided to run a plant for a factory or mill belonging, to himself, and having got the plant, and having found he had certain units over, he threw out a line to his own house, lit that, and also threw out lines to his neighbours' houses and lit them, all his overhead <Col N="1732" /> charges being borne by the factory or mill for which he had developed the power in the first instance.  Every penny that comes from the sale of that electricity is profit, and the electricity consumer in an area who may not use that man's lines would have to pay for every penny that that man made by selling to himself and to a few neighbours.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should have remembered that he was framing matter that was proposed to stand in an Act of Parliament, and as the result of its careful consideration this is what emerges&mdash;&ldquo;Entitled to compensation for any loss incurred by him.&rdquo; What is the arbitrator to fix the amount of?  Is it to be &ldquo;for any loss incurred&rdquo;?  The arbitrator would have to take into consideration the loss through the individual not being allowed to sell to himself and a few neighbours in an area where the Board might not want lines at all.</P>

What we are asked to do is to insert in an Act of Parliament that a person who on the 1st March, 1927, was selling electricity should be entitled to continue until an order is made by the Board determining his right to do so.

I do not know, though I have read my own amendment over and over again, that the Deputy finally realises what is in it.  Whatever order the amendments appear in, there is definitely an amendment down in my name stating that unauthorised undertakers supplying electricity on a date in March, 1927, must be given a permit to continue to supply.  The Deputy wants instead of that they must be given a permit to supply until an order is made by the Board determining their, right to do so. My amendment says that the Board cannot make that order.</P>

      <P>Yes, with provisions to carry out certain conditions laid down by the Board.  These conditions may be onerous and may be impossible for them to carry out.  I believe the Minister will say in the case of one of these small undertakings: &ldquo;Your area is too small.  You must enlarge it and extend out where it will not pay you in order to bring electricity into the rural areas,&rdquo; and the undertaker might then say that that was no good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was a bad adviser of the unauthorised undertakers before.  He is not a very good defender of them now.  I could accept that amendment, and in the process of time wipe out every unauthorised undertaker in the country, and the Board need not pay a penny, because compensation only flows from the Deputy's amendment when an order is made by the Board determining the right of the unauthorised undertaker to continue to sell.  In an interjection that Deputy Hewat made in the debate on the Committee Stage he said:&mdash;&ldquo;We do not want compensation.  Let us continue the supply with the unauthorised undertaker.&rdquo;  Deputy Thrift made a remark upon it that it would be very expensive.  Is there any doubt that if the Board went into the area of an unauthorised undertaker, with the facilities that the Board will have, it could not take away every consumer from an unauthorised undertaker, and no compensation at all would be payable on the basis of this amendment? Compensation only flows under the Deputy's amendment when an order is made by the Board determining the selling by the unauthorised undertaker. If the Board's competition throws the man out there is no compensation. That is the best the Deputy can do for the unauthorised undertaker.  There is no information that he can put before. the Dáil on which it can base a sound judgment as to what is to be done with these people.  I say, let us drop this course, and stereotype the present situation. Let unauthorised undertakers be under the obligation to supply information to the Board when the Board demands it.  We get that information later from the Board, and we then form our judgment upon it, and put these <Col N="1735" /> people under certain schedules for compensation. Is that the better way to deal with the unauthorised undertaker, or would Deputies prefer what Deputy Myles has, that representatives of the Board can be empowered to go into an area, set up in competition with the unauthorised undertaker, and drive him out of existence, without a penny-piece being paid in compensation?</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement would require to be qualified. The Minister is a very able and fierce debater and he is, if I may use the expression, ramming it down our throats.  We are entirely in the dark as to the conditions that might be imposed by the Board.  The Minister should give us some idea as to what the conditions will be.  The Minister says the amendment I have moved would be of no use, but I am afraid the Minister's explanation has not helped.  The Minister's amendment says that the Board shall not refuse to grant a permit and the Board shall not revoke a permit, but the Board can revoke a permit if the conditions are not complied with.  I contend that until we know the conditions we are not in a position to say whether the Board should revoke a permit or not. The Minister says the Board cannot revoke a permit.  I say they can, and that that amendment of his is practically no use to us.  It is not what the Minister says that will carry weight when this matter comes up to be construed.  It is what the judge who hears the case will say, and he will deal with this as an Act of Parliament, irrespective of what the Minister says or how he interprets it.  He will not allow the Minister's words in the records to be used as an interpretation of the words of an Act of Parliament.</P>

      <P>It is difficult for me to intervene in this debate, because I have not the technical knowledge either of the Minister or Deputy Myles.  But I am interested in this section, and the amendment put down by the Minister, in my view, meets the situation as I see it.  On the other <Col N="1736" /> hand, I have a great deal of sympathy with the case put up by Deputy Myles, and I appreciate the fact that the position Deputy Myles finds himself in is that of a man interested in an undertaking which, under the Minister's amendment, admittedly will get a permit to continue, but at the same time the permit will only be given on the understanding that certain conditions are complied with.  The fear of such undertakers is that the difficulty of complying with the conditions will be so great that it is likely that permits may be revoked, and that if they find themselves in that position there is no authority under the Bill to give them compensation.  Perhaps it would be possible to insert in the Minister's amendment the words &ldquo;after consultation with the undertaker&rdquo; so as to make it read &ldquo;and such other condition as the Board after consultation with the undertaker may propose to specify in the permit.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not that mean that the undertaker really makes his own conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope not.  I take it that the intentions of the Minister with regard to the Board are that it shall not be unreasonable.  If the conditions of the Board are reasonable, there can be no justification for an undertaker not being prepared to agree to them.  If the undertakers are not prepared to agree to reasonable conditions, a very strong case can be made in a future Dáil for an amendment of this Bill which would take away the permits from those undertakers.  If the attitude of the Board in the matter is reasonable, there must be a reasonable concession on the part of the undertakers, and when the matter is approached in that spirit a great deal of confusion and suspicion can be removed. I hope there will be no such thing as unreasonable demands on the part of the Board.  If we were asked by the Minister to agree to this amendment, and if conditions were imposed afterwards which it would be difficult to fulfil, without the House being given any indication of them, that would hardly be fair to the House.  But <Col N="1737" /> that is not my idea of what is going to be done.  I hope that is not going to be the policy of the Board.  It would be a most unpopular policy.  If the Minister could see his way to insert the words I have suggested, then if the undertakers do not act reasonably in the matter, they will do their case the greatest possible disservice.  If in future the Dáil has to consider an amendment of the Act empowering the Board to remove permits which the Minister now proposes to give, these undertakers will have worsened their position and make the atmosphere for consideration of their case less sympathetic. If the Minister is prepared to consider what I have suggested, I think it would be conceding everything that the undertakers demand, because they are to be permitted to continue just as authorised undertakers, and their permits cannot be taken away without further action on the part of the Dáil.  If this point with regard to the conditions can be met by the Minister, I think the position would be satisfactory all round.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Myles would be well advised to accept the Minister's proposition as really meeting the case for the present, with one reservation.  I agree with Deputy Baxter as to &ldquo;such other conditions as the Board may propose to specify,&rdquo; and I wonder whether the Minister has any definite point in his mind in reference to the other conditions.  The point is to get concurrence with the provisions of the Act so far as giving information is concerned, and it occurs to me that really this case would be satisfactorily met if compliance with the provisions of the Act is secured, and that it would not be necessary to insert this very indefinite term, &ldquo;such other conditions as the Board may propose.&rdquo; I do not think I am of a very suspicious mind, but the Minister challenged us to make a case, and I could submit a whole variety of ways in which quite intolerable conditions could be imposed, with a fair amount of reason even by the Board.  I cannot see from the Minister's point of view the necessity for inserting these additional words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point <Col N="1738" /> out to Deputy Thrift and Deputy Baxter that specifying the provisions of the Act by itself is not sufficient, because the provision of the Act which relates to the giving of information does not apply to unauthorised undertakers. Section 22 is definitely limited to requisition from authorised undertakers. If the Deputy wants to meet that by putting in &ldquo;authorised or unauthorised&rdquo; I have an objection to that, as it would carry certain implications in the rest of the measure that I do not want to have there.  The Deputy may notice that the side note to Section 22 reads: &ldquo;Authorised undertakers and permitted undertakers to give information to the Board.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I was speaking of the provisions of the Act.  The amendment reads: &ldquo;To comply with such of the provisions of this Act and such other conditions as the Board may propose to specify in the permit.&rdquo;  In other words, the Board, would have to rely upon that particular section in order to put upon a permitted undertaker the necessity of supplying information.  That is regarding the provisions of the Act.  That is the main thing we want, but there are certain others.  I come to the other point, &ldquo;such other conditions as the Board may propose to specify in the permit.&rdquo; The unauthorised undertaker to date is completely unregulated.  He has his own area marked out for himself; no obligation with regard to consumers; no maximum price, etc.  He simply supplies for sale, and he does it under the conditions most suitable for himself. What that was aiming at was really that he might be subject, as a condition of getting a permit, to the liabilities and obligations to which the authorised undertaker is to-day subject.</P>

      <P>The amendment, even as it stands, may to the unreasoning and suspicious-minded, give the Board power to impose a whole lot of onerous and unnecessary conditions, so as to drive the permitted undertaker out of existence, but it does not give the Board the clear power to drive an unauthorised undertaker out of existence that Deputy Myles' amendment gives.  As regards these two amendments, 25a and 27, if it would meet the point, I would undertake to get some clause limiting &ldquo;such other conditions&rdquo; on the lines we have been thinking of before we take the motion on the Fourth Stage.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to a matter which was referred to on an earlier stage with reference to this section.  I am referring to the proposal which seems to be implicit in the Bill, and which depends upon this section, that the Board may acquire an undertaking and may sell, lease or grant to anybody at some future time that undertaking which it has bought or which it has acquired.  The Minister thought that there was no possibility of that.  I want to draw his attention to the sequence of the provisions, with a view to his looking into the matter and providing a barrier against the selling of these undertakings to any private organisation that might bid. This section (Section 37) says the Board may acquire the undertaking of any authorised undertaker.  Section 64 says: &ldquo;Any authorised undertaker may by agreement sell, lease or grant the undertaking...&rdquo;  The Board itself <Col N="1742" /> may be an authorised undertaker. It may make itself an authorised undertaker by special order.  The definition of authorised undertaker is a person who, for the time being, is authorised by Act, or provisional order or by special order of the Board to develop electricity.  It seems to me that it is quite possible, within that sequence, for the Board to acquire an undertaking and, at some future time, to sell that undertaking to some private company.  The Minister thinks that that is not implicit in or possible under the Bill.  I draw attention to those sections with a view to making the changes that are necessary.  The Minister thought the road was blocked against any such proceeding but I think he will find it is not by any means blocked.  Nothing has been done in the way of an amendment to remedy that obvious defect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition clause deals with authorised undertakers. Under that section, an authorised undertaker means &ldquo;a person who is for the time being authorised by any local or personal Act of the United Kingdom Parliament or any private Act of the Oireachtas, or any provisional or other order made under statutory authority... or by special order of the Board made under this Act to generate, distribute and supply ...electricity in such area.&rdquo;  Section 38, sub-section (2) says: &ldquo;The Board shall, on the date of acquisition, by special order... constitute itself or some other person to be the authorised undertaker.&rdquo;  Then Section 64 says that the authorised undertaker may sell the undertaking.</P>

      <P>It is quite necessary that the Board should be enabled to constitute itself an authorised undertaker, so that the conditions which apply to an authorised undertaker shall apply to the Board when <Col N="1743" /> the Board becomes a distributor in a particular area.  Otherwise, we should have to patch up the Bill with special clauses.  I shall have Section 64 looked into before we come to it. Deputy O'Connell raised that matter previously.  I canvassed the Deputy's opinion about it with the legal people outside.  The answer they gave me was that it was quite clear, with regard to the Shannon works, that the Board cannot divest itself of whatever it receives of the Shannon property.  The outstanding case was the Board getting possession of some undertaking, not part of the Shannon works, remaining in possession of it for a while and then selling it.  The answer the lawyers gave me was that unless the Board is specially empowered to act in that way its powers would not ordinarily flow&mdash; in other words, that it did not require a section of the Bill to say that the Board shall be prohibited from selling any undertakings which it becomes seised of at any time.  Unless the Board was specifically empowered in a section of the Act to sell, the power of sale would not necessarily arise. Deputy Johnson directs attention to Section 64, which seems to give that power of sale.  I shall have that examined.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 28:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 20, Section 37, line 24, to add at the end of the section the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provided always that the power to acquire an undertaking conferred by this sub-section shall not be exercised unless and until it shall have been ascertained at a public inquiry held by a person agreed on between the Board and the undertaker and in default of agreement by a person nominated by the Chief Justice of Saorstát Eireann that the non acquisition of the undertaking will prejudicially affect the working of the Shannon scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which raises a question as to the granting of unlimited powers.  It more particularly applies to the Dublin station.</P>

      <P>I beg to give notice that I propose to take, after this measure to-morrow, unopposed private business.  I presume that we will have dealt with all the amendments to this Bill (Electricity Bill) to-morrow. If it seems unlikely that we will be able to deal with all the amendments in the ordinary time, I propose to move that we shall not take the motion for the adjournment before midnight, in order to dispose of this.

      <P>We might not be satisfied that the amendments are a fulfilment of the Minister's undertakings and we are entitled to point that out.  If there are 50 amendments to be disposed of, does the President think that they can be fairly dealt with by sitting until midnight?  What is going to happen if they are not dealt with by midnight?  If there are some amendments standing over at midnight, what does the President propose to do?  Does he propose to apply the closure?  We should know that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lyons has given notice of a matter which he intended raising on the adjournment, but the reply given to the question by the Deputy seems to dispose of his point.</P>

      <P>If I might intervene, I should like to say that I do not really know what Deputy Lyons' point is. I gave an answer to his question to-day very fully.  Some of these cases will come under the new Amending Bill when it becomes an Act.  I do not see any reason for occupying the time of the House in discussing cases that could not possibly be dealt with before the Amending Bill has become law.  If Deputy Lyons has any point outside that, I am prepared to deal <Col N="1746" /> with it.  But I do not really know. what other point the Deputy makes.</P>

      <P>I do not want to raise the question at this late hour, if I can get an assurance from the Minister that something will be done for men who contracted disease while serving in the Army.  I want to point out to the Minister the amount of trouble that ex-soldiers have to go through to prove that they contracted the disease they suffer from in the Army.</P>

      <P>The cases that the Deputy speaks of will come to be reviewed under an Act passed recently.  Where, therefore, does the negligence of the Minister enter into the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>The question that I gave notice to raise was as to the treatment of men who had contracted disease while serving in the Army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the negligence of the Minister for Defence. That is what the Deputy gave notice of.  If an Act has been passed to provide certain machinery for dealing with that matter, that is all that is to be said about it.  The Deputy cannot review an Act by way of question on the adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>

      <P>An Act has been passed for dealing with these men.  That was one of the main reasons why the Act was passed, and nothing remains to be discussed now.  The Deputy is not in order in discussing the matter now.</P>
