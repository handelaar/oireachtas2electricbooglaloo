      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether Mr. P. Kennedy, ex-R.I.C., Lisbane, Shanagolden, has been granted a pension because <Col N="612" /> of his having resigned his position in that Force during the British régime, owing to his national sympathies, and if not, whether he will state the reasons for refusal, and whether he will re-open this case in order to allow the applicant to put in fresh evidence to substantiate his first application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Kennedy's claim for pension was duly investigated by the Committee of Inquiry into Regisnations and Dismissals from the Royal Irish Constabulary.  The Committee did not consider that the resignation had been proved to have been caused by national sympathies.  I have reviewed the case, and, after most careful consideration of the evidence submitted by the applicant and as the result of inquiries made by me, I can see no ground for differing from the opinion formed by the Committee of Inquiry and am accordingly unable to authorise the grant of a pension.  I am, however, prepared to consider any fresh evidence that may be submitted.</P>

      <P>Under the Rules of Court every applicant for compensation in the post-Truce period was required to lodge a statutory declaration giving details of his claim with the Clerk of the Peace and to lodge one copy of the declaration with the local State Solicitor and another with my Department.  In this case, no copy has been lodged either with my Department or with the State Solicitor, and when the Judge's report was received the applicant's solicitor was asked for a copy of the declaration.  He has not yet complied with this request, and until he does so the question of payment cannot be considered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that fourteen or fifteen young men arrested last November in County Meath were detained in the Gárda Síochána Barracks at Navan for eight days in four small cells without blankets or any other clothing to keep them warm; whether he considers such treatment proper for tried or untried prisoners, and whether in the event of any further emergencies such as existed last November he will make better provision for persons in custody.</P>

      <P>It is not the case that any of these men were detained in the Gárda Síochána Barracks at Navan for eight days.  Of the men arrested, seven were detained for three nights.  The rest were detained for one night only and no prisoner was detained for more than three nights.  During the period of their detention everything possible in the circumstances, was done for their comfort.  It is true that there were only four cells, but the men all had their overcoats, and two blankets were given to the men in each cell each night.  During the day they were allowed out in batches, and exercised themselves by sawing wood in the barrack-yard. They were also given every facility to warm themselves at the kitchen and day-room fires, and no complaint was received from any of them as to the treatment received when detained in the station.  There was no avoidable delay in having the cases of these men, where necessary, brought before the courts and dealt with, and allowance must be made for the number of the men concerned, the limited accommodation at the station, and the difficulty of providing escorts for their removal to Mountjoy.</P>

      <P>A communication in reference to this matter has been received from the solicitor to the Limerick Corporation, and is at present being considered by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and myself.  The Limerick Corporation was advised some time ago that the powers sought could not be conferred by Order under the existing Gas Acts, and that it would seem necessary for the Corporation to promote a private Bill to secure the powers.  The Corporation has now put forward an alternative proposal which is under examination.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy O Máille, I am not aware of what he states, and, if I were aware, I do not think it would influence the position. In reply to Deputy Heffernan, I have already, on more than one occasion, made it quite clear that there were teachers who were found to be guilty of complicity in the armed revolt, or at least who were decided by the Committee to be so guilty, but a merciful view being taken of the teachers' cases as a whole, a certain number of these teachers were allowed back. That was done because, as I have already explained pretty fully, the Committee were convinced of their bona fides in the sense of their willingness to serve the State loyally in the future, and they thought there were circumstances which enabled them to come to the decision that complicity, <Col N="616" /> though established, ought to be overlooked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well, I think, that we should have a statement from the Ministry on their defence policy when we are asked to provide money for the provision of the Army, Navy and Air Forces, presumably for defence purposes.  After considerable effort at different times, we had on the 8th February a statement from the two Ministers most nearly concerned in the problems of Defence.  From the Minister <Col N="626" /> for Defence, who was primarily concerned, we had a statement that the defence policy of the Government is &ldquo;to defend this country as far as it is humanly possible, within its resources, against every enemy from whatever source.&rdquo;  While that is a quite satisfactory statement of purpose and object, it is hardly informative enough as a statement of policy.  The Minister for External Affairs supplemented the statement of the Minister for Defence, and explained that there was bound up with the defence policy of the Ministry in respect to the Free State a defence policy of these islands.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In view of so powerful a neighbour, so near, and our close relations, it is undoubtedly in the interests of this country to have a general idea as to what the defence policy of that country is.  We need not blink the fact that it is quite possible, in the event of a general attack on these islands&mdash;it is perfectly obvious&mdash; our Army must co-operate with the British Army.  It is practically inconceivable that our Army would ever be opposed to the British Army. But that our officers should go there to learn what they could in general about military matters, and of the scheme of defence which is in the mind of the Government and the military forces, which in the event of a general attack on these islands would have the major share of the defence, was, I think, entirely desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to preface what I have to say in this matter by the observation that, in my opinion, it is very desirable that the relations between the Saorstát, the British people and the British Government should be of the most cordial character possible&mdash;as cordial as the interests of Ireland will allow them to be.  But I think that cordial co-operation does not necessitate a unified defence policy or a unified foreign policy.  There is so much of inter-dependence between foreign policy and defence policy that I think the two must be taken together and thought of together.  I refuse to believe that in the British Commonwealth of Nations, the cordial co-operation <Col N="627" /> of the nations constituting that association, necessitates co-operation in military affairs or necessitates co-operation in external policy.  The information we have from the Ministry as to the line of thought which is apparently determining their views upon the defence of this country is that there must be the conception of an attack upon &ldquo;these islands.&rdquo;  And it is having regard to that conception that I believe it is essential that we in the Dáil, and the people of the country, should understand what the defence policy of the Government is.  I cannot, myself, conceive of the position, within any reasonable period, which would require that Ireland should be prepared to resist an attack upon these islands, unless there is to be a united policy in regard to foreign affairs and an acceptance by our Government of some share of responsibility for British foreign policy, or a refusal by non-British Powers to recognise the independence and the sovereignty of this State.  I do not believe that there will be such a refusal on the part of non-British Powers, provided that our Government makes its position clear and insists upon that position at all times.  That can be done in the most friendly way and with the most cordial feelings towards the British people and the British Government.</P>
    <P>This statement of policy from the Minister for External Affairs on behalf of the Ministry opens up a very big question, and makes it imperative that we should have a statement so that our minds would be clarified and so that a proper understanding will be the result as to where we stand in this matter.  It is undesirable that we should wait until something has been accomplished, and then be told that it has been done, without having had a preliminary statement as to what the intentions are from the Government benches.  We have to bear in mind, for instance, that there has been a preliminary Conference, following and in accordance with the Treaty provision that in five years' time the question of the naval defence of these islands was to be reviewed.  We have been told that such a Conference was held a couple of months ago; that is to <Col N="628" /> say a preliminary meeting was held in London, and the Conference was adjourned for three months.  I take it, therefore, that within a month the new Conference will be held, and presumably some decisions will be arrived at. Therefore, we ought to have some statement from the Ministry as to their policy in this matter.  So far we have had to rely upon the statement of the Minister for External Affairs, coupled &mdash;and I want to emphasise this&mdash;with a report of the Imperial Conference. I am going to ask the Dáil to give some consideration to this report of the Imperial Conference, and to read it in the light of the statement made by the Minister for External Affairs on the 8th February.  The report of the Imperial Conference was divided into several parts, and the only portion of it which has yet had any consideration here has been that dealing with inter-Imperial relations.  There was a portion of it which dealt with defence, and this is surely the occasion when matters under that head, which were discussed at the Imperial Conference and reported upon with the approval of our Delegation, should be discussed. That report explains that questions of defence, and the methods by which the defence arrangements of each part of the Empire could be most effectively co-ordinated, had consideration.  The Prime Minister of Great Britain initiated the discussions and reviewed the work of the Committee of Imperial Defence, emphasising the purely advisory and consultative character of this body.  He explained that since the previous Conference there had been certain developments, notably the creation of the Chiefs of Staff SubCommittee. &ldquo;Meetings also took place at the Admiralty, the War Office, and the Air Ministry, at which the situation from the standpoint of His Majesty's Government in Great Britain was presented in greater detail, and other phases of common interest were considered at a meeting held at the offices of the Committee of Imperial Defence.&rdquo; I want to lay special emphasis on this paragraph, which says that Mr. Baldwin &ldquo;was followed by the Senior Officer of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee <Col N="629" /> (Admiral of the Fleet, Earl Beatty), in a survey of the general strategic situation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now I gather that the Ministers who were present at the Conference had the views of the British Admiralty as to the strategic position, and they will be able to give the House some information as to what part Ireland plays in regard to these matters.  It appears that the resolutions of defence adopted at the previous Conference were re-affirmed.  These resolutions are printed in this report, and they explain that &ldquo;the Conference affirms that it is necessary to provide for the adequate defence of the territories and trade of the several countries comprising the British Empire,&rdquo; while recognising that it was &ldquo;for the Parliaments of the several parts of the Empire to decide the nature and extent of any action which should be taken by them.&rdquo;  Subject to that provision certain suggestions were made as guiding principles. One of these principles was &ldquo;the desirability of the maintenance of a minimum standard of naval strength, namely, equality with the naval strength of any foreign power, in accordance with the provisions of the Washington Treaty on limitation of armaments as approved by Great Britain, all the self-governing Dominions, and India.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us whether, on this question of naval strength and on the other allied question of the limitation of armaments now being discussed, it is part of the general defence position of these countries comprised within the British Empire that the defence forces of all those countries are to be treated as a unit. When there are questions of the relative strength of the military and naval forces, let us say, of Great Britain, the United States, Japan, France and Italy, are the forces of Australia, Canada and the Irish Free State taken as part of the forces to be counted as the British forces for the purpose of comparing strengths?  It is a matter of importance that we should know how we stand in that matter.  Then I find that the Conference re-affirms &ldquo;the desirability of the development of the Air Forces in the several countries <Col N="630" /> of the Empire upon such lines as will make it possible, by means of the adoption, as far as practicable, of a common system of organisation and training, and the use of uniform manuals, patterns of arms, equipment and stores (with the exception of the type of aircraft) for each part of the Empire as it may determine to co-operate with other parts with the least possible delay and the greatest efficiency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that we should be told as to whether that is the practice of our Ministry of Defence.  Are they conferring as to the use of uniform manuals and systems of organisation and training and co-operating accordingly. That was part of the resolutions adopted at the Conference in 1923 and re-affirmed at the last Conference.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Conference observes that steady progress has been made in the direction of organising military formations in general on similar lines; in the adoption of similar patterns of weapons; and in the interchange of officers between different parts of the Empire; it invites the Governments concerned to consider the possibility of extending these forms of co-operation and of promoting further consultation between the respective general staffs on defence questions adjudged of common interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is of interest to us and should be noted when we are discussing the Defence Bill or the financial resolutions connected with such Defence Bill. It is requisite that we should know whether included in that steady progress towards co-ordination of the defence forces, methods, systems, formations, patterns of weapons, and so on, the Irish Free State has made any progress; whether we are part of that general movement, or whether it is clear that so far as progress is concerned we have not kept step with the other portions of the Empire which entered upon this Conference.  This is of particular importance when we are discussing the question of air forces.  The 1923 Conference passed a resolution which was reaffirmed at this Conference, and it refers to the maintenance by Great Britain of home defence air forces of sufficient strength to give <Col N="631" /> adequate protection against air attack by the strongest air force within striking distance of her shores.</P>
    <P>In making an estimation of the strength of that force which was necessary for protection, are the two air forces counted together?  Is the British Air Force counting upon the assistance which might be rendered by the Irish force?  Or is the Irish force counting on the assistance which might be rendered by the British force?  This is a matter, I think, upon which we should have some information, particularly in the light of the paragraph on page 36 of the Report, which speaks of</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The necessity for creating and maintaining an adequate chain of air bases and refuelling stations&rdquo; and &ldquo;recommending for consideration by the Governments interested the adoption in principle of a system of mutual interchange of individual officers for liaison and other duties, and of complete air units so far as local requirements and resources permit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The importance of these recommendations and of having an explanation as to our Government's attitude towards them, is enhanced by the statement made by the Minister for External Affairs, because presumably the conception behind the defence policy is that of attack upon &ldquo;these islands.&rdquo; I ask the House to give thought for a moment or two to the international situation, and the possibility of an attack upon these islands.  The Minister has assured us very definitely that so far as international affairs are concerned, we in the Saorstát have no responsibility for the action of any Government which is not the Saorstát Government, and consequently we cannot be held in any degree responsible for the consequence of such acts. I take that to be the position generally maintained.  I am hopeful that position will be maintained and will be advertised amongst other nations; but that being so, what conceivable occasion for attack upon &ldquo;these islands&rdquo; would arise?  I look around and I cannot imagine an attack upon these islands&mdash;including Ireland&mdash;from Norway, <Col N="632" /> Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Spain or Portugal.  As to the European Powers, Germany is out of the question so far as naval attack might be considered as a possibility. Italy is almost inconceivable as a force that would be attacking this island. What other forces are there?  There is the remotest possible chance of the Saorstát being involved in war with Japan or China.  We have no particular interest in oil wells or rubber plantations, and I do not think that our people have very many or very important financial commitments in Asiatic or Oceanic governmental bonds that would require the military backing or the naval force of this State.  We are driven back on the possibility of France or the United States being the attacking force.  Is it conceivable that this island is going to be attacked by a French naval force?  Is it conceivable that this island is going to be attacked by the United States naval forces?  I think the possibilities are nil.  It is waste of energy and money to make preparation for defence of this island against attack by the naval forces of any of these countries I have spoken of.  It may be said that there is a possibility&mdash;if there is the possibility of war at all&mdash;of attack by any force, by either of these countries or combination of them against Great Britain.</P>
    <P>There is, no doubt, the possibility but why are we to assume the possibility of an attack upon &ldquo;these islands&rdquo;? That is what I want to put before the Ministry.  We have to get some idea as to why they should imagine that these islands are to be attacked because of the action of the Government of one of the islands.  It is, of course, said that there might be an attack on these islands and that therefore defence will be required, also there might be an attack by these islands, or one of them, though probably it would be said that there never has been an aggressive war of a major kind entered upon by Great Britain and that all Britain's wars have been wars of defence!  I am sure that the Minister will agree with that! Consequently, if we are not bound up with British foreign policy, the chances of attack upon these islands are so dim <Col N="633" /> that it is waste of money to be spending it upon means of defence against that kind of possibility.  There is a possibility, of course, of war arising in some part of the world in which Great Britain is engaged, but if the Ministry's policy is to be maintained we, at least, need not fear that we are going to be bound up in any warlike activities because of Britain's engagements in such wars.  Consequently, it seems to me to be a very great mistake to be conceiving the possibility of attack on these islands as the basis of our defence policy.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion to read a certain series of pamphlets with which the Minister for External Affairs will no doubt be familiar.  They were written by a well-known Canadian publicist, Mr. John S. Ewart, K.C., and the thesis of these pamphlets is, that &ldquo;of the British wars since Canada became part of the British Empire in 1763 there is none on which the British people could confidently look back as having been essential and at the same time unescapable.&rdquo;  He has taken his readers through the history of the origins of the wars since that period, beginning with the American War of Independence, 1775 to 1782, the Anglo-American War, 1812 to 1814, the Revolutionary wars of France, 1793 to 1818, the Crimean war, the Afghan war, the Opium war, the Burma war, the Zulu wars, the Indian wars, the Egyptian war, the Abyssinian war, the Transvaal war, the South African war, leaving out of account the war of 1914 onwards.  In not one of these can it be said that it was unescapable and essential but he has pointed out to the Canadian people, and it might well, I think, be pointed out to the Irish people, that as matters have stood both the Canadian people and the Irish people have been involved automatically in these military and naval affairs and that they would never, except perhaps in one or two cases, involve themselves in those wars had they had any volition of their own.  I want to put the case to the Ministry that in looking for a defence policy we are bound to connect it up with our attitude to external powers, and that we ought insistently to make it clear <Col N="634" /> that we are not bound by any action of Great Britain in diplomacy which might result in war, that therefore we cannot be bound to join with them in offensive or defensive action.  If an attack is made upon Ireland then, of course, we are bound to do what is in our power to defend Ireland.  Are we similiarly bound if because of war in the Far East or in the Pacific, some kind of proposals for defending these shores arose, to be involved in that movement?  These proposals emphasise the importance of inter-imperial international overseas trade.  It seems to me we ought to know where we stand in regard to the use that is going to be made of the shores of Ireland in respect to British naval warfare.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that I was hopeful and desirous of the most cordial co-operation in civil matters, in industry, commerce, cultural development, science, art and literature, between this country and Great Britain and other British nations but that I refused to believe in the inevitableness of that kind of co-operation involving military or international foreign policy co-operation.  I ask myself&mdash; what are the risks of that co-operation and cordial feeling being broken?  To my mind the greatest danger to a development of that good feeling lies in the conditions which attach to the Treaty, namely, that we are bound to &ldquo;give facilities in time of war or strained relations with a foreign power such harbours and other facilities which the British Government may require for the purposes of such defence aforesaid.&rdquo;  I feel that in that particular clause we have an occasion for disturbing the friendly relations, and that if ever it were thought well by Britain to take advantage of that particular clause in the Treaty it would almost inevitably be the means of breaking off the friendly relations and disturbing the chances of growing friendliness.  I am not quite sure, but I think it is arguable, that that particular provision in our Treaty is inconsistent with the Covenant of the League of Nations which we entered upon at a later stage, and that by virtue of one of the clauses of the Covenant of the League, by the fact <Col N="635" /> that it is not in accord with the Covenant of the League, it is cancelled and we ought to seek release.</P>
    <P>Whether that is so or not, I believe, while we have that provision of the Treaty existing it is likely to disturb the constant growth of friendly relations, and is really of no value as a means of defence.  It is only of value as a means of offence&mdash;offence upon trade routes. offence upon mercantile marine traffic, between Europe and America.  There is, too, connected with this policy outlined in the Imperial Conference Report, reference to uniformity of air forces, mutual interchange of officers and so on.  Again, I want to ask the Minister for Defence where he stands in this matter.  Our defence policy must have some regard to the possibilities of warfare, and I wonder whether it is the conception of the Minister that Ireland can be defended by the forces at his disposal in respect to the possibilities of air attack.  What is the basis of any suspicion of the possibility of an attack upon Ireland by sea or by air?  Is it not fair to say that the only occasion that could be given for an attack upon Ireland by air or by sea would be the fact that we might be conceived as part of the defence forces of these islands?</P>
    <P>We cannot defend, let us say, by our present or contemplated air force, an attack by, let us say, for the sake of illustration, a French air fleet upon the power station at Limerick.  If we were part of the defence forces of these islands and by that fact became involved in warfare, our vulnerability is obvious.  If we are going to depend, as we must, to a greater degree than is perhaps thought of, upon electrical power, surely we ought to have in our minds the possibilities of an attack upon the sources of that power, and whether we can defend it against modern warfare.  Is not our best defence in giving no occasion or no excuse for an attack?  I submit that when we are considering these islands as a unit of defence, by that fact we give occasion for attack.  We are not likely to be at war of our volition, and there will not be an attack unless Great Britain is at war.  Ought we to involve ourselves in the defence of this island <Col N="636" /> as part of a unified system?  I am again going to risk the Minister's displeasure by insisting upon the new arm &mdash;the air force&mdash;and the risk to any country which may be attacked from chemical gases.  I quote from a statement made by the service head of the British Air Forces at the present time, Sir Hugh Trenchard.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It (aviation) may be more of a blessing for this Empire than for any other country in the world, but I feel that what good it will do in civil life cannot balance the harm that may be done in war by it.  If I had the casting vote I would abolish the air. I feel that it is an indisputably more harmful weapon in war than any other.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another authority who was Director of air operations on all the British fronts in the year 1918, when air warfare was at its height, General Groves, said this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the first phases of the next war there is little doubt the belligerents will resort to gas bomb attacks on a vast scale.  This form of attack on great cities, such as London and Paris, may entail the loss of millions of lives in the course of a few hours.  All gas experts are agreed that it would be impossible to devise a means to protect the civil population from this form of attack.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is necessary to emphasise these things in this country when we are discussing military defence, and to point out the danger to this country and its people, if we are to conceive ourselves as part of the defence forces of the British islands, that if an attack is made upon Britain by air forces from the Continent of Europe, we are by that fact bound up in it, and we are, therefore, part of the belligerent forces, and running all the risks of that attack. I hope the Minister will tell us that this is entirely wrong, that the Minister for External Affairs was not stating the position accurately.</P>

      <P>If I might say so, the Deputy has gone into very great detail.  He missed out the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; in quoting what I said the other night&mdash;&ldquo;in the event of a general attack on these islands.&rdquo; What I said the other night can be put in this way: I said it was practically inconceivable that we would be fighting England; it is practically inconceivable that any country would attack this island unless they were already in the act of attacking Great Britain, and in the event of their attacking this island and Great Britain it would imply a certain amount of co-operation between the two countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not know how far we are getting.  We were dealing, on the occasion in question, with the defence policy of the <Col N="638" /> Free State.  We were seeking some light as to what was moving our Government in the matter of defence, and the Minister for External Affairs explained.  I will read more fully than I did before his explanation:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our Army is inexperienced.  It is a young, new Army.  Deputy Johnson asked what their contribution was.  While I cannot say offhand, I think their contribution mostly was listening.  They were committed to no policy whatever, but it is undoubtedly in the interest of this country, in view of so powerful a neighbour so near, and our close relations, to have a general idea as to what the general defence policy of that country is.  We need not blink the fact that it is quite possible, in the event of a general attack on these islands&mdash;it is perfectly obvious&mdash;our Army must co-operate with the British Army.  It is practically inconceivable that our Army would ever be opposed to the British Army.  But that our officers should go there to learn what they could in general about military matters, and of the scheme of defence which is in the mind of the Government and the military forces which in the event of a general attack on these islands would have the major share of the defence, was, I think, entirely desirable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the statement of the Minister in answer to the demand for an explanation of the defence policy of this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an answer to a demand for an account as to why the officers went to London and what they did there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked certain questions.  I wanted to know what were the matters discussed and what was the policy agreed upon.  I asked would the Minister deal with the policy of our representatives at the Imperial Defence Council in London.  We had the answer from the Minister for External Affairs, but I am quite prepared to take his version that this only had to do with a hypothetical chance which, presumably, ought not to be prepared for.  Are we to understand now that <Col N="639" /> the statement of the Minister really had no relation whatever to the defence policy of the Ministry, and that as a matter of fact&mdash;and on this I would like to hear an explicit statement&mdash;the recommendations of the Imperial Conference in respect to defence, in respect to co-ordination of forces, mutual interchange of officers, and the adoption of similar patterns of weapons, etc., had no effect upon our Government, and that these recommendations have been disregarded?  That is exactly what I am calling for&mdash;a reassuring statement in that respect.  If that is the position, then I think we will understand a little better that the defence forces we are asked to deal with in this Bill are defence forces, not having regard to the possibility of attack upon these islands, but only having regard to the possibility of attack upon this island, and we will adjust the defence forces in accordance with our view of the possibilities of attack upon this island.  I go further and ask, if that is the position of our Government, will they take the necessary, inevitable steps&mdash;as I believe, if we are really to conserve the best interests of this country in a military sense&mdash;at least to prepare the way for a reduction of the risks by the early elimination of that particular section of the Treaty which gives power to another Government to use our harbour and other facilities such as they may require when they find themselves in strained relations with foreign Powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important question, and I would be very sorry to say anything that is likely to embarrass the Government in delicate matters of this kind.  But I do believe that it is desirable that our people should familiarise themselves with some of the problems that are arising, and will arise, the more we think of international affairs and the relations of this country to other States and Powers and Governments. I hope I have said nothing that is going to make more difficult the work of the Government in these international matters, but the statement of the Minister for External Affairs on the last occasion, which I quoted, did seem to me and to many others a complement <Col N="640" /> of the recommendations of the Imperial Conference, which undoubtedly assumed a unity in the defence forces of this country and Great Britain and of the Empire in general.  I believe that once you let it go abroad to the world that these forces are unified defence forces, complementary one to the other, that you will, even apart from legality, even apart from questions of international law, by that very fact involve yourself in war as soon as Great Britain is at war, and you are inviting attack.  As we are the least likely of States to indulge in an enterprise of an aggressive kind, or of a character likely to result in war, we ought to minimise the risks to the utmost possible extent&mdash;to make them nil as far as it is humanly possible to do so.  I believe that the more we disentangle our defence forces from those of Great Britain, the less risk of being involved in war we shall run.  I hope the Minister will be able to reassure the House and the country that this is the direction in which our foreign policy is tending, and more particularly in which our defence policy is tending.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to follow the Deputy into all the details into which he went in his speech, but as he seems to have misunderstood some of the remarks that I made the other night, I shall take this occasion of speaking on the subject.  The other night the Deputy asked about the presence of our officers in London.  Article 47, or 49 it may be, of the Constitution says that, except in the case of an actual attack on this country, this country can only be committed to active participation in war with the assent of the Dáil. I believe we should maintain as adequate an army as is financially possible. We were struggling for a long time to get a measure of freedom in this country, and I think we must be prepared to make it perfectly clear to all who may be interested, that we do not intend to part with that freedom or any part of it except at a great cost to anybody who makes an attempt upon that freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now our forces are pre-eminently defence forces.  Deputy Johnson seems to think that in any country where the Government could examine their conscience <Col N="641" /> and could say: &ldquo;We have no intention of making any aggressive act against any other country,&rdquo; the mere fact that they felt sure of that would enable them promptly to disband their forces.  I do not think so.  As a matter of fact, most Governments assure themselves of the right to maintain a big force because of their non-aggressive intentions.  Deputy Johnson seems to think that war is governed by law.  I have stated with great regret that war has no connection with law.  Deputy Johnson is anxious to have assurances that we should be entirely neutral in the case of a big war that England had engaged in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a small war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, or a small war.  I think Deputy Johnson's statement has been an eloquent appeal for a greater vote for the army, for a larger army, for the maintenance of the naval force, and for a bigger air force in the event of any great war.  I am much more optimistic than Deputy Johnson. I do not think that there will be a great war in our neighbourhood in the life-time of the present Parliament, or possibly in the life-time of the next Parliament. In the event of any great war, I am sorry to say, I have a lower opinion of Governmental and military human nature than Deputy Johnson has.  I presume that any country, if it is going to attack England, will regard the question of Irish neutrality from the point of view of whether it is to their military advantage to regard Ireland as neutral, or to their military advantage to use Ireland as some part of the general field of warfare for their troops, ships or other arms.  That is the way I look at things, and that is what I would expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson seems to think that if we were disarmed and assured the other people that we were not going to fight against them they would leave us alone. I wish I could think that.  I think the position and attitude of the present Government and the whole tradition and mentality of the Irish people are such that we would never take part in any war at all.  We have perfectly friendly feeling towards every country and we do not conceive any situation <Col N="642" /> arising in which that friendly feeling will be altered.  The only thing that can alter that friendly feeling would be aggression on the part of other countries. Deputy Johnson's attitude in this matter is entirely different from mine. Although I do not think that there is any great possibility of any great war in these waters, or, indeed, in Europe, for a long time to come, I still think we should maintain an army.  Although I do not think this country is going to do anything aggressive to any other country in my lifetime, or in the life-time of my children, I still think we should maintain an army.  I do not think that war is governed by ethical rules, because I think war waves aside all ethics.  From the point of view of maintaining our neutrality and freedom it is a matter of making it worth while to other people.</P>
    <P>The country considering the advantage or the disadvantage of using Ireland as a jumping-off ground against England would be moved much more by the fact that they would have to face a fairly substantial resistance here than by any declaration of neutrality.</P>
    <P>In the late war Germany did not attack Belgium because they wanted to do it, but because they considered the military resistance made by Belgium would be more than countered by the military advantages which they would have in passing through Belgium to fight France.  I think these are the considerations that govern countries in warfare.  Deputy Johnson referred to a unified defence policy.  There is no unified defence policy or unified foreign policy as he understood it.  I think that the likeliest form of attack here&mdash;this is merely an opinion of my own&mdash;would be in the case of a general attack upon these islands.  I cannot conceive a situation arising in which there would be bad relations between the Irish Free State and another country without there also existing bad relations between Great Britain and that other country.  At the moment, standing here, I cannot think of bad relations between the Irish Free State and another country arising except through bad relations between Great Britain and another country.  As I said I do not conceive it is at all likely that our <Col N="643" /> army would be engaged in warfare without Great Britain&mdash;she is our nearest neighbour.</P>
    <P>You never know what orientation warfare may take.  This country may develop and Europe generally may change.  We are situated geographically very close to Great Britain.  Great Britain has many more seeds of warfare with other countries than we have or are likely to have for a long time to come.  It seems to me that in providing defence we should take into account the case of a country aiming ultimately and pre-eminently at attacking Great Britain, but proposing to attack Ireland, not with a view of regarding Ireland as an enemy but with the view of putting herself in a better position to attack Great Britain. Having gained our freedom, we should defend that freedom against any and every enemy no matter what object they may have in invading this country.  Therefore, I think the consideration of a defence policy between countries closely related either geographically or by treaty or by other means is not at all unheard of.  Our Army is very young.  Deputy Johnson read a great many things out of the defence resolutions of the Imperial Conference.  We were largely not parties to these&mdash;I am not saying that we disapprove of them or approve of them&mdash;it was largely because we had not reached the stage of considering them.  We are very young here.  Our Army was occupied largely with a domestic enemy and it is only recently that it was able to set about building itself upon a proper basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson seemed to think that I conceived an attack upon these islands, meaning that an attack upon one of these islands meant an attack upon all of them.  That is not what I was referring to and that is not the position.  When I said &ldquo;a general attack upon these islands&rdquo; I meant an attack upon these islands, not upon Ireland or Great Britain but upon both of them, which I think is more likely than an attack only upon this island.  In the case of an attack only upon the island of Great Britain we would have to come before the Dáil <Col N="644" /> and get the assent of the Dáil as to what the policy of the Government and the Army would be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson was very much concerned as to whether our Army forces counted as one with the British Army forces and the Australian Army forces, in the consideration of the relative strengths of nations.  I think if he looks up the Army Year Book of the League of Nations he will find that Great Britain counts as one and Australia as another.  They do not count as one, because they are not unified in the way Deputy Johnson seemed to conceive we had in mind.  The same applies to the minimum standard of naval strength. Long ago when some people seemed to think that we should leave our foreign policy unattended to, I said that if we did not attend to our foreign policy some other country would do it for us. The same thing applies to our defence policy.  We should maintain as great a military strength as we can fairly do, because our geographical position, apart from any other consideration, means that thought has to be given to the general defence arrangements here, and it is very much in our interests, nationally and otherwise, that whatever defence arrangements should be made for the defence of this country should be made for and by this country.  Deputy Johnson asked, &ldquo;Could we defend Ireland against an air attack?&rdquo;  If you look at things that way, the only country which can defend itself is the greatest and strongest country in the world. Obviously any country which has one ship or one gun less than another country cannot defend itself against that country, but it comes to the question of whether it is worth while.  It is less worth a country's while if we have 12,000 soldiers&mdash;it is likely to be a more serious matter for them&mdash;than if we have no soldiers, and if it is likely to be a more serious matter for them they are less likely to attack.  It may cause them to give more consideration to it, and it may be that they would not attack at all.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of an army is a method of defence.  Deputy Johnson said that the only reason for an attack upon us would be the conception that <Col N="645" /> our Army was part of the defence forces of these islands.  Our Army is the defence force of the Irish Free State.  It is part of the defence force of the world&mdash;of Europe and of the British Islands.  We are more likely to be concerned in a war which is in these waters than we are in a war that is in the Pacific Ocean.  Deputy Johnson quoted from the Imperial Conference report about the defence of trade routes.  The chief trade route of this country is across the Irish Sea.  I think so far the defence forces of the countries on the two sides of the Irish Sea are fairly adequate to protect that trade route.  I think we may as well face up to the position that we have a geographical position here next to a great Power.  We do not conceive any chance of a great war within any reasonable time, but this country should recognise that it is its business to defend itself.  Deputy Johnson quoted the fact that Great Britain has certain rights to ports here and that we should take steps to have that part of the Treaty withdrawn.  Obviously we, as part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, may be ruled out as an attacker upon Great Britain, may be ruled out as an enemy of Great Britain.  Very well, then she is not afraid of us, but under the Treaty she reserves her right to certain Irish ports.  The best means of getting rid of that part of the Treaty, it seems to me, is for us to show that we are in a position to defend this country against anyone and everyone.  We cannot do that in the absolute, but we can go as far towards it as possible.  We can show that we are able to make it not worth any other country's while to come here using Ireland in an attack against Great Britain.  That seems to me the best argument we can use for the excision of that part of the Treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has made a very interesting and very instructive statement, particularly in view of the approaching Defence Conference. He has pointed out the dangers of the present situation and the very serious vagueness in which we find ourselves.  I was not very clear on what he proposes as a solution of our present position.  I would like to ask <Col N="646" /> the Minister for Defence to tell us whether he or his partners have prepared definite plans to put before this Conference, whether they have any definite proposals to put before the British military authorities, or whether the British military authorities have sent to him any draft proposals with regard to the agenda of the Conference.  I do not wish, and of course the House would not ask that he should give, any details as to what the proposals are, but we would be glad to know that he would be going to the Conference with some idea in his head as to what is wanted by this State, and that he should not have to wait for the English to make proposals which we would have to accept or reject.  The Minister for Finance made a most significant statement about two years ago, about the position of the Army and the defence of the country.  It was pretty well echoed to-day by the Minister for External Affairs, when he stated that if we did not defend ourselves, then somebody else would.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, as far as I remember, stated that the purpose of the Army was to garrison this country in case of war, and that if we did not provide the garrison, then under the Treaty the British Government had got the right to do so.  He did not say it in those words, but Deputy Johnson has drawn attention to sub-section (b) of Article 7 of the Treaty.  He suggests that it is at variance with the Covenant of the League of Nations, and certainly there is a lot to be said for that view. I would urge that the Minister for Defence and the Executive Council at this coming Conference ought to insist on a definition of this Article.  The terms are that &ldquo;In time of war or strained relations with foreign Powers, such harbour and other facilities shall be afforded as the British Government may require.&rdquo;  The day after the Treaty was signed I immediately picked upon that Article as a very serious and dangerous Article in the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to participate in the defence of these islands in the case of a general attack, surely we have a right to know exactly what facilities the English will require, and what part of <Col N="647" /> the defence of the country will be left to us.  Under this Article as it stands to-day, the English could garrison every town and village in this country in the event of strained relations with even an Asiatic Power, and legally I do not see how we could object to it.  I think that if we are to participate in the defence of these islands we ought to have at least a definite understanding and a clear definition from the English as to what is the meaning of this sub-section.  If they refuse to give that definition, I think it is very necessary that we ought to consider, and if necessary, apply to the International Court for a ruling as to whether the terms of this Article are at variance or not with the Covenant of the League of Nations.</P>

We would prejudice our national development&mdash;socially, politically, and in every other way&mdash;if we agreed or if we allowed ourselves to be brought into the position of agreeing, that the geographical relation we have with Great Britain is going to cut across the track of our national outlook in any way. We have no more right to want to <Col N="648" /> send portion of our defence forces to Britain to defend Irish interests there than Britain has to send any defence forces, either military or naval, against our will to defend British interests here, because we have not yet got to that stage in the development of the new spirit amongst the Commonwealth of Nations that we can safely assume that in sending troops here the British are defending any other interests than the interests of Britain. For instance, the spirit in which we accepted the clause in the Treaty under which we assumed responsibility for portion of the Public Debt of Great Britain was different from the spirit in which Great Britain accepted it, as Lord Birkenhead subsequently explained in the House of Lords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not know yet in what particular spirit the British representatives suggested to our representatives that they would take all responsibility for the coastal defence of Ireland until such time as we took it on ourselves but we do know that it was not our intention to neglect to take any precautions or to make any arrangements that might be necessary for the defence of this country, that it was not our intention to leave any of these arrangements unmade and that it was not our intention to appeal to any other country for any reason whatever to get their assistance in defending our country.  Our position from the point of view of defence is complicated by the north-eastern position.  It will be complicated to a certain extent as long as that position exists, but as long as our defence position is complicated by either the north-eastern position or by any unlawful claim on behalf of Great Britain to any occupation of our ports, so long will the assistance of this country in the defence of Great Britain, be not worth having.  We ought not to allow ourselves in any matter of defence to slip into the position of speaking loosely about these islands.  When the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke about the defence of these islands the other day, my mind went back to a leading article in the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; shortly before the Imperial Conference when the Editor of the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; spoke of these <Col N="649" /> islands.  He said: &ldquo;but the old problems remain&mdash;more insistent than ever&mdash;unemployment and over-population in these islands, slow development, lack of population and the perpetual menace of an inferior population in such countries as Canada and Australia.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now it may be permissible on the part of the Editor of the London &ldquo;Times&rdquo; to do some of the blinking the Minister for External Affairs spoke about, and to talk calmly about the overpopulation of these islands when that population has been reduced, since 1841, as a result of our unnatural relations with Britain.  We are going to complicate our own social and defence development if we do not crystallise in our minds that we are a State here, that we are going to leave nothing undone to prevent our interests being prejudiced by the action of any other State.  We must take it as an axiom that, if our national interests are prejudiced in any way by any action, that it cannot be to the advantage of any country standing in the relation to us that Britain does: that is, that Britain cannot injure our interests at any particular time without injuring her own. There does seem to me to be a want of care in the general steps that the Executive Council has taken in the matter of guarding its defence position from complications from outside.  We have had experience of it at Washington. Deputy Johnson has had experience of it at Geneva, and, I am sure, different members of the Executive Council have had their experiences. It is worth quoting here, from the report of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Congress held at Washington in 1925. the opinion of the head of the British Delegation there.  Deputy Johnson raised a question in the consideration of international matters from the point of view of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Association which, in spirit, is the same point of view as that of the League of Nations.  When Deputy Johnson raised the point that it was necessary to keep in mind that Great Britain might, at any time, be at war in circumstances which one of the <Col N="650" /> Dominions might decline to be involved itself, the Chairman of the British Delegation speaking at the Congress said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Well, as it occurs to me, this would be an exceedingly convenient arrangement for Great Britain.  It would certainly leave us with far less territory to defend in the course of an important war.  But I cannot imagine any belligerent State which happened to be in hostility with Great Britain at the time agreeing to a plan by which their course of action and their power of injury to the country with which they were fighting should be so limited; in fact, I have never known of anything in my life which I could use as a possible analogy to the suggestion which has been made except in an old and somewhat primitive game, where you were allowed if you crossed your fingers, to say that you were out of bounds and nobody could touch you. No crossing of fingers on the part of any of the British Dominions is likely to mitigate the hostility of any enemy which she happens to have, and it seems to me that this is the most impracticable proposal which anybody could put forward for the consideration of the Committee.  I wish to tell the Conference quite definitely that Great Britain does not ask for this concession; nor do I know of any other part of His Majesty's Dominions which would ask for this eleemosynary aid in the event of a conflict breaking out.  If such a suggestion was to be made, I cannot imagine any place in the world&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The sting, perhaps, comes here at the end&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;which was less suitable for such a pronouncement, than this famous Hall of Congress of a nation which waged one of the greatest wars in history in order to prevent part of its territory from seceding from it and refusing to endure its obligations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While we are told that, of course, Great Britain would be delighted if you did not involve yourself in these things, you are told, on the other hand, that if you were in the hands of the United States what they would do with <Col N="651" /> you in these particular circumstances &mdash;that you were refusing to shoulder your obligations.</P>

      <P>Part of its territory, no doubt.  The report says: &ldquo;At this point there was an interruption by a remark from one sitting among the delegation of the Irish Free State,&rdquo; so that it is a habit of Deputy Johnson's.  All this discussion is very largely about a hypothetical business, but it reacts very much on our own internal situation here, and we can look very calmly towards the future if we settle rigidly in our minds our national attitude in regard to this State and with regard to Britain in case Britain is involved in war.  Except we do that, and except we do everything possible to remove outside of Ireland the kind of idea that Sir Robert Horne thus perpetuates&mdash;which exists and which is difficult to remove&mdash;that we are part of Great Britain for purposes of defence&mdash; we are going to leave ourselves in danger of war from outside, and in a position here internally in which we cannot concentrate on our own social and constructive work when all kinds of ghosts and shadows from outside will be thrown in to disturb and to disrupt us in that work.</P>
      <P>I would like to suggest, as an alternative to what Deputy Johnson has suggested, that our defence policy here ought to be based on our own foreign relations.  I would like to base our defence policy here on our own social policy in Ireland, so that our defence scheme would be much more related to conditions and affairs here than to any hypothetical enemy that you might want to meet from outside.  I think that such a policy would enable us to concentrate on our own internal development here which is not a hypothetical thing.  We might ultimately find that those things which strengthen us socially, industrially and economically as a nation are the real things that will help us to build up our people to do their own constructive work, and that will strengthen this nation in any defence policy which we might find it necessary to organise and later to apply.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister for External Affairs has made it perfectly clear that this country can scarcely escape being involved in the event of any attack upon Great Britain. He has told us that it is unlikely this nation will be attacked by a Great Power of itself, but that there are within Great Britain the seeds of disruption and disagreement, with the probability of a war with other Great Powers.  It is inconceivable if Britain is attacked that this nation can escape being attacked so long as it maintains an army.  If France, for instance, attacks Dover and some portion of the British Fleet pursues a French war vessel into Irish waters, or an Irish harbour, is the Free State automatically at war with France because of that action of the French Government? And does this nation automatically become the cock-pit in that war of Great Britain with France?  If so it would seem that an army instead of being a national asset would become a national menace, for the fact that we have an army would involve us in war with any Power attacking England, while we would escape that if we had not an army.  It would then be interesting to to consider the position of a soldier who joined the Free State Army in connection with his duty towards the Irish Free State.  His profession of fidelity is towards this country.  He swears:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And I further solemnly swear that I will bear true faith and allegiance to our country, and faithfully serve and defend her against all her enemies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Can it be said that if a great Power attacks England that Power automatically becomes the enemy of the Free State, and that the soldier who has sworn allegiance to this country only has automatically to fight the enemy of Great Britain?  That would seem to be what the Minister for External Affairs asked us to believe the other night when he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We need not blink the fact that it is quite possible in the event of a general attack on these islands&mdash;it is perfectly obvious&mdash;our Army must co-operate with the British Army.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> There is no question of co-operation with the British Army in the declaration of the oath that the soldier of the Irish Free State takes on entering the Free State Army.  I also ask the Minister for Defence, or the Minister for External Affairs, or some member of the Executive Council to clear up&mdash;if we are to place full reliance on the Army, and, after all, the Army is the most serious institution in the country and wields the greatest power because of the resources at its disposal&mdash;the point as to whether that pledge of fidelity and allegiance is sufficient and if that pledge is sufficient on the part of the Army, why should a pledge of a different kind be submitted to others who have less resources at their disposal to use against this nation?  That is a factor that may possibly give the Ministers food for thought.  The oath taken by the Army is merely to defend the nation, and while the Army is considered sufficiently pledged by taking that oath, others who have not the resources of the Army at their disposal are asked to take different and more binding oaths altogether.  That is a matter upon which some explanation may be given by the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Defence, or some Minister well up in high politics.  Another matter to which I would direct the attention of the Minister is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may construct, establish, maintain or contract for the establishment and maintenance of arms and ammunition factories and factories for the manufacture of military clothing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister what steps have been taken in that direction?  Are we to depend on this &ldquo;near and powerful neighbour&rdquo; for all these things, and if this &ldquo;near and powerful neighbour&rdquo; thinks that sometime or other these things should not be at our disposal, have we any resources of our own? Has he considered how useful, wise and, possibly, profitable it may be to put that section of this Act into operation?</P>

Would the Minister for External Affairs consider it an invasion if in time of war Great Britain took all the positions of vantage in this country, and would our Army then be an advantage or a menace to the country in involving us in Great Britain's war with other nations?  Probably the Minister will give us some explanation on these points.</P>

      <P>I would like to offer a few observations of a rather general nature on the discussion that has taken place, and particularly on Deputy Johnson's contribution to that discussion.  The Executive Council can do many things.  There are some things that the Executive Council cannot do. The Executive Council cannot alter the geographical relations between this State and Great Britain.  It is no doubt unfortunate, but it is true, that being unable to alter the geographical relations between this State and Great Britain we are unable to alter the strategical relations between the two countries. Deputy Johnson talked much as to neutrality and the desirability of neutrality in the abstract.  Neutrality is an excellent thing when it is observed; less excellent when it is infringed, as Belgium, for instance, found in the late war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said in his statement, and has said in statements hitherto, that he could conceive it being very much in the interest of Great Britain herself that this country would receive assurances that in the event of strife breaking out, in the event of war between Great Britain and any other country, the right of this country to stand neutral would be recognised so long as she did in fact stand neutral.  I think the Deputy is right.  I agree with the Deputy, and with Sir Robert Horne, that such a state of affairs would be advantageous <Col N="655" /> to Great Britain, that it would be in the interest of Great Britain if she could dismiss from her political, military and naval mind any apprehensions with regard to a menace from her flank, any apprehension with regard to the invasion and occupation of Ireland as the jumping-off ground against Great Britain herself.</P>
      <P>I repeat that neutrality from more than one point of view is an excellent thing when observed, and if Britain could, in fact, rely on any such assurances these assurances would be advantageous not merely to the Irish Free State but to Great Britain.  The only question is whether she could or not, whether she could rely on them any more than France could rely implicitly on the observance of neutrality of Belgium, any more than France could put aside as a thing unthinkable that she might be challenged through the territory of Belgium.  A great deal turns simply on that.  The Minister for External Affairs suggested that there was a tendency on the part of Deputy Johnson to apply a two-foot rule, as it were, to what is, in fact, international anarchy, to a war situation, a tendency to assume that everything will be done that ought to be done, as the legal maxim says, to assume that nothing will be done that, in the abstract, ought not to be done. It is not in that way that wars are, in fact, conducted.  War is the absence of law.  It is savagery between nations.  The individual communities and States bind their individual citizens by law, and build up rules of society by, if you like, licensing and other laws, but nations, despite the League of Nations and other factors striving for an assured world's peace, stand to each other very much in a condition of naked savagery and, occasionally, that latent savagery breaks forth in war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson's frame of mind seems to be that one nation can say:&mdash;&ldquo;I am safe on this plank because A. B., with whom I am at war, always said that I would be safe on it.&rdquo;  That is his fundamentals.  He builds on those and the Irish Free State is to go around the world canvassing assurances <Col N="656" /> from other States that, in the event of war with Great Britain and themselves, Great Britain would not be menaced through the Irish Free State. Such assurances might, or might not, be given but if they were given could they in fact be implicitly accepted by the Irish Free State or Great Britain? That is a question.  As I say, we are unable to alter the geographical relations between this State and Great Britain and we are unable to alter the strategical aspect of the matter.  The Minister for External Affairs gave offence by references to these islands. It is unfortunate, but true, that we are not yet in a position to state that we have responsibility for the defence of this island in its entirety.  That, surely, is a factor in the situation&mdash; that portion of this island remains within the political system of Great Britain.  I do not want to attempt to be doctrinaire about the matter; of all matters one cannot be doctrinaire about this.  I merely rise, as I said, to offer very general comment on the discussion as it has so far developed because of all matters this is the one that clamours for realism.</P>

      <P>I am fully at one with the Deputy in his attempt to get to definite conclusions upon it, but let the Deputy in his attempt to do so keep his eye on the stark facts of the situation. Geography is one of the facts and strategic relationship is another of the facts.  The question as to whether or not countries at war keep their assurances of the past, is another of the facts.  I am not speaking against the neutrality of the Irish Free State in the event of a world outbreak, or any outbreak of war.  It is a consummation devoutly to be wished for, but the question does not turn only on what we are going to do in time of war.  There is another factor.  What are other people going to do in time of war?  America at war with Great Britain, what is she going to do?  Will sentiment and old sakes' sake stand in the way of taking strategic advantage, if it offers? France with war with Great Britain, what is she going to do?  An assurance from either or both of these countries, <Col N="657" /> that in no circumstances would they endeavour to use the Irish Free State to further their attack on Britain would be valuable in proportion to each man's conception of the likelihood of their keeping it, and no doubt, if such assurances were given, the Government of the Irish Free State and the Government of Great Britain would act just in accordance to their judgment of that question.  We, as the Minister for External Affairs says, are lying close alongside a great Power, which, some day, might conceivably find itself in conflict with another great Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Great Britain finds herself challenged through the Irish Free State, would she wait until attacked on her own shores?  Would she look on while the Irish Free State was invaded and occupied by an active force?  Nobody believes that.  I do not, for one, and yet, for better or for worse, there is that geographical propinquity, and from that there arises particular strategic relations.  From that geographical propinquity there arises a certain interdependence, as we must all recognise, between the two countries, a certain mutuality of interests between the two countries.  There is an interdependence for certain defensive purposes, for naval defence purposes, and the two countries are essentially a strategic unit.  There is interdependence for trade, and if the short trade route between the two countries is severed, or menaced, both countries are injuriously affected.  There is need for hard thinking, and one would like to add, clear thinking, on the whole question. It is a complicated question, but one will not arrive at a just conclusion by ignoring any of the aspects that are, beyond question, there.  We are not in watertight compartments, one saying to the other that its fate is no concern of theirs.  &ldquo;What is Hecuba to me, or I to Hecuba, that I should weep?&rdquo; We are not in watertight compartments, and the Leader of the Opposition and of the Labour Party, when a class war broke out in a neighbouring country, was not slow to send his telegram, &ldquo;What can we do to help you?&rdquo;  He did not take the view then that affairs in one country were of no <Col N="658" /> concern to the people of the other country. No, he wired immediately:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If you consider there is anything we can do to help, let us know.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A certain interdependence there always will be, and from that interdependence there arises a mutuality of interests, and it will be for the Government of each country, according to the circumstances as it judges them, to decide at all times to what extent that mutuality of interest exists, and to what extent it is called upon to take action in recognition of that mutuality of interest.</P>

      <P>May I extend my cordial sympathy to the Minister for External Affairs.  He is the most misunderstood man, not only in this House, but in the entire country. Never does he deliver a speech without being required as a sequel to repudiate criticisms of it, because they are always misrepresentations or distortions.  It is very unhappy that an unkind fate should treat him in this fashion, and I dare say if I criticise his utterances this evening I shall find quite frequently that he is on his feet complaining of misrepresentation and distortion.  I regard his speech and the speech we have just listened to from the point of view of national interests as the most lamentable declarations that we have heard. The whole spirit and atmosphere of the Imperial Conference have been brought into this House.  Mutuality of interest! Interdependence!  Dominion over!  This is what the British Empire has and always will have.  It is echoed in the mutuality of interest, and the interdependence of interest, between this country and Great Britain and is to endure for ever.  These are the sentiments of Irish Ministers, speaking with regard to vital relations between us and the neighbouring country.  How cynical it is to tell us about geographical propinquity, as if we, and all our people for centuries, were not too painfully aware of that propinquity and what it cost us.  The Minister for External Affairs declared that it was inconceivable that we should ever be arrayed against the English Army. Inconceivable!  That is a considered utterance by our Minister for External Affairs, and though the rest of us, <Col N="659" /> members of this House, as private individuals, will not be reported, the outside world will be deceived, as he will be reported, and in all the Courts of Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Can it mean anything else but that?  It has been harped upon because of our geographical neighbourhood to a great Power that an attack upon Great Britain by a Power with which she is at war would come through our land. That is regarded as the only alternative to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice spoke of a war between Great Britain and the United States, and calmly assumed that we were bound to be allies of Great Britain.  What right has he to speak as a Minister of this House, or what right has any member of the Executive Council to deliver beforehand an undertaking like that?  These things <Col N="660" /> are too serious for light, flippant utterances from the Minister for External Affairs.  These are matters of life and death concerning the whole nation and all our people.  When Deputy Johnson raised this matter in the House before, attention was drawn by several Deputies to the significance of sub-section (b) of Section 7 of the Treaty.  The Minister for Justice has just drawn attention to the fact that such are the charming, friendly, fraternal relations between Great Britain and ourselves that if that provision were not there England would seize that advantage in any case.  That is the Minister's real mind on the matter in spite of his assurances of the newly-established relations of friendliness between the sister country and ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>It may appear very cheap.  Proof is sometimes very cheap.  All the concessions that have been made we now understand. Our Ministers go to a Conference of Ministers in London, always in that chastened spirit when dealing with one of the great Powers, always allied to some menace.  That accounts for their surrender.  The Minister for External Affairs said that in the Treaty Great Britain reserved her rights to the ports.  Am I misrepresenting him?  He used the phrase this evening that England reserved her rights to the ports.  What rights?</P>
      <P>What Irishman with any sense of the history of the Treaty and of all that preceded it would make such a concession, that England had any right morally to reserve?  She reserves that, as she made the Treaty and all the terms of it, under duress.  The Minister for Justice explained that even if it were not there advantage would be taken by England to secure the same result in case of actual war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I plead for realism and I have always called myself a realist in politics.  I am glad to hear the Minister for Justice discussing reality at last.  It is a plain fact that the Irish people should take note of, that if England goes to war, she will use us as a weapon in her war, whether <Col N="661" /> we like it or not.  That is the interpretation of co-equality!  Co-equality was the great message brought back to us from the London Conference&mdash; we were all co-equal members.  When I drew attention to the significance of the exception drawn by Lord Balfour in his report, it was ridiculed, that while there was co-equality there was not equality of function in the two great departments of defence and diplomacy.  Who says that now?  The Minister for Justice, the signatory to that unanimously signed document. There is no co-equality as regards defence. England claims the right&mdash;you may call it a right if you please, the right that might always confers&mdash;to occupy our ports and use all our natural facilities in case she goes to war, and she will use them.  Where is our co-equality if we can make no protest?  How cynical the Minister for Justice was when he talked about war and threats of war as if there were no League of Nations.  Does he disbelieve in the League of Nations?  If so let there be eliminated from the charges on this little State, all moneys by way of contribution towards the League of Nations.  He cannot have it both ways.  Either the League of Nations serves a useful purpose by the preservation of the rights of little Nations as against great Powers&mdash;great in military and naval resources&mdash;or it does not.  If it does not, and the Minister for Justice speaks about war with the conviction that it does not, then let us get rid of the humbug.  It is utter humbug to pretend that little nations can appeal to the tribunal of the League of Nations and that the equity of nations will prevail, if the Minister for Justice tells us correctly, as I believe he does&mdash;he is better able to interpret the mind of Great Britain than any of us, except perhaps the other Minister who hobnobs with British Ministers on terms of co-equality&mdash;that England reserved her right.  That is admitted by our Minister for External Affairs.  We shall not find ourselves ranged against England in any war that may break out, declares the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister for External <Col N="662" /> Affairs gives us an ideal in regard to the Army for the twenty-six counties, that it should be so great as to frighten off any great Power that might entertain the idea of occupying the harbours or ports.  The Minister for External Affairs never contemplated the inclusion of England amongst those great Powers.  We would have an Army big enough to frighten off the Powers. That does not mean that the Powers to be terrified include England.  I wonder does the Minister for External Affairs remember the song in the opera by Gilbert and Sullivan:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I should not be surprised if nations trembled</P>
    <P>Before the mighty troops of Titti Poo.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Titti Poo's army, in the ideal of the Minister for External Affairs, is to strike terror into the hearts of all invaders or would-be invaders.  What nonsense!  Is it not obvious to everyone that our army is an armed police force?  With the admission of the Minister for Justice, what do we want with an army of defence?</P>

      <P>If you join together the utterances of those two Ministers who belong to the Executive Council, and have therefore collective responsibility, what do you get?  If any country attacks Ireland, not meaning to attack Great Britain, will Great Britain remain neutral?  No.  If any country attacks Great Britain, Ireland is attacked, because of the strategic possibilities of Ireland in relation to Great Britain.  Therefore, in any event &mdash;war with us, or war with Great Britain&mdash;Ireland is at war.  Will any army that the Minister for Defence can organise be sufficient to defend us against one of the great Powers, or a combination of them?  Obviously not. What is our Army then for?  In the event of war it will be ranged with the British forces, and no doubt, as I said on a former occasion, under a unified command, and, as Deputy Baxter says, be used to fight for England.  In all other circumstances it is an armed police force.  The Gárda are not armed. We have a gendarmerie here with arms; <Col N="663" /> it is for the suppression of insurrection or revolution.  Let us understand that. The Army must be kept at such a strength and at such a pitch of efficiency as will make it useful for that purpose.  But the Minister for External Affairs wants it to be on such a huge scale and so terrifying in its aspects as to frighten off any invading force.  He knows himself that that is childish folly.  He knows that the country, even if it was desirable, could never bear the strain of the upkeep of such an army.  Great Britain itself could not maintain within the shores of Great Britain an army big enough to save Great Britain from a foreign force.  That being so why are these pieces of futile nonsense delivered in this House by the Minister for External Affairs?  That is good enough for a political meeting, good enough for a leading article in the Government organ, but not good enough to submit to a thinking assembly.</P>
      <P>Let us, in the language of the Minister for Justice, be realists.  Here is a country, as the President told us, taxed to the utmost limit of its capacity. Further taxes have been added to it since.  One of the biggest taxes is for this Army.  That Army is a heavy charge upon the people.  As a war force, according to the declaration of the Minister for External Affairs, it is merely as an ally for Great Britain.  Have we been reduced then to this, that while England professes, hypocritically, that we are co-equal members of the Commonwealth, and yet forcibly claims the right to occupy our ports and take whatever facilities she demands, while she forces upon our legislature the test that keeps out the elective representatives of the people, we are to burden ourselves with heavy taxation to provide what is really only a brigade to aid her in case she is at war with a foreign power.  If all the efforts of Ireland in all the centuries to emancipate herself from foreign control comes down eventually to this, let us hear no more about Irish ideals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think in any other country Ministers could be impeached for making beforehand declarations of policy of this kind that stimulate hostility and <Col N="664" /> animosity.  Is there any country in the world after hearing the declaration of the Minister for External Affairs, that would not realise that for good or ill, in dealing with Great Britain, they are dealing with Ireland?  We are supposed to have gone to the League of Nations to make our protest, to voice our rightful demand.  We were supposed to get the value for the money expended upon our Embassy there in order to have a forum through which we could speak to the whole world. What are all our declarations now made through every organ of publicity? That we are going to fight on the side of England in every conceivable case of England being at war.  There are many things for which the Executive Council of a civilised country would be impeached.  This is their latest performance. I protest against a second adjourned meeting of the Imperial Conference being held in this Chamber.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did.  If so, the Minister will be able to clear the matter up and remove that impression. It may seem trivial and frivolous.  To me it is nothing of the kind.  I ask myself the question&mdash;what was Ireland made for?  Were we planted in the Atlantic Ocean to ward off attacks upon Britain for all time, and even is the attitude that our Ministers are taking up an acceptance of that position&mdash;and are they to come to this House to make declarations that it is our responsibility and it must be our outlook that attacks on Britain in the future are to be made through this country and that we must be prepared to fight, and that that outlook must be handed down to our children?  In striking contrast to that is the statement made by Deputy Mulcahy. One must regret that the same outlook was not given expression to by either of the Ministers who to-day have so much to do with the conduct of our external relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> We are discussing this evening the question of our Army and its duty, and we are trying to get clear, in our own minds, how that Army is to be utilised for the preservation of the peace of this State and its usefulness; how it may be organised so as better to defend this State.  To defend the State means to defend it against attack from outside as well as internal attacks.  The policy of the responsible Ministers in this State should be such a policy, externally, as to develop relations between those peoples who might at any conceivable time be either prepared to attack this country or another country through this country, as would render that practically impossible.  Personally I can conceive no attitude of mind nor any attitude of ours that holds within it greater dangers for this country than that we should be too closely associated militarily with England.  There is the expression of opinion from the Ministers who spoke that if we are ever to be attacked the possibility of that would be entirely due to the fact that England may become involved in war. If we are to save ourselves, and this country, from war, it must be our objective then to try, as far as possible, to make foreign countries realise that militarily we are not too closely associated with England.</P>
    <P>In a few days or weeks our Ministers will have to meet the representatives of England to discuss the military relationship between the two countries as to what our attitude is to be and what we are to defend in case war should come to this country or to England.  Is the attitude our Ministers are to take up, at that Conference, the attitude of the Minister for Justice this evening? Are we to accept it that all possible attacks on England are to be made through this country and that foreign powers must first pass through here and fight with us in order that they may fight England?  I hope not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving you my impression of what the Minister conveyed to the House.  It seems to me the point of view very clearly put by Deputy Mulcahy ought to be the policy we should try to develop.  There should not be any acceptance on the part of our representatives that in case England is to be attacked we must accept the situation, that we will have to get involved in war and have to fight.  I think that many foreign powers, recognising the force that Ireland can be in world affairs, recognising the many millions of our citizens who are in other countries, and knowing the influence that these citizens can exercise in world affairs, might be very slow indeed to involve this country in war for the sake even of attacking England. Might we not point to the great war a few years ago and say that although the neighbouring country was attacked we were free from attack and our citizens were recognised as neutrals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If our attitude of mind is the Imperial aim for which the Minister for Justice stands then we come down to this, that an Irish Army should not exist and an Irish Army is only existing that it may be used to defend English interests when English interests are attacked.  If that is the purpose for which the Army is in existence in this country then I think the Nationalists in this country should make up their minds that not one penny of the people's money should be used in future for the maintenance of that Army.  I think that National sentiment will be strong enough to see that that is not the purpose for which an Irish Army was created or should exist. I have a very strong belief that the point of view given expression to here this evening by the Minister for Justice is not the point of view of the people of the country, and if it is the policy to be advanced by the representatives of this State when they meet their neighbours across the water a couple of months hence, then I say that that attitude of mind does not represent the feelings of our citizens and it is better that the policy that <Col N="667" /> they are going to pursue should be put before the country, so that they can get a mandate for it before we are let further down than we have gone already.</P>

      <P>I want, if possible, to get back to realities.  The basis of this discussion was the question raised by Deputy Johnson the other day, of certain officers of our Army having attended at the Imperial Conference in an advisory capacity.  We are linked very closely with Great Britain, not only geographically but economically. Deputy Baxter, I believe, the other day was in London trying to link us more closely economically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would do the same with France or America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure.  But he was actually strengthening these economic bonds when he was arranging for produce to be sold in London.  The more we build up a market for our produce in England the more we will be affected by her disturbances.  We were somewhat seriously affected by the coal strike, but a war causes greater disturbances than a strike, and surely then it is only common sense that we should know what Britain proposes to do in the case of a war, so that we may make our preparations for dealing with the matter on our lines.  Take, for instance, Birkenhead.  A great proportion of our cattle goes to Birkenhead. Supposing it is part of the mobilisation plan to make Birkenhead purely a naval port, we should have to take other measures to divert our cattle to some other port.  I do not want to discuss what the function of the Army should be, because I am not sure that this is the most proper occasion to do it.  It can be done on the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly I think it will require some consideration, because at present there is too much infantry and not enough artillery.  I really rose to have one word about what Deputy Magennis said about the League of Nations, because his remarks might possibly have a most important influence on the public mind.  The League of Nations is <Col N="668" /> not yet a perfect instrument for preventing wars.  Nobody can do a worse injury to the League of Nations than to set up such an extravagant claim that it can at all times and in any circumstances prevent war.  But we should not be wise to trust ourselves solely to the protection of the League of Nations.  We should be very much in the position of the man who because he had an umbrella divested himself of his clothes.  I hope that the League of Nations is going to develop, that it is going to extend its membership.  It does not at present include some Powers with great military potentialities. It has not yet impressed the League mind on all its members.  I suppose one ought not discuss the doings of other countries, but there was an incident which I am sure Deputy Johnson will remember at Corfu about three years ago when certain members attempted to use force rather than approach the League to settle a dispute by peaceful means.  We cannot rely on the League of Nations.  We need some army.  We cannot have an army without money.  The purpose of the motion is to provide money for the Army and therefore I shall support it.</P>

      <P>I have heard this discussion this evening with great relief.  After the speeches delivered to the Dáil&mdash;if they were delivered to the Dáil&mdash;by Deputy Magennis and Deputy Baxter, we can all congratulate ourselves that the country is safe.  If the people from whom these external dangers are apprehended are not trembling after hearing these speeches they are still more formidable than they have been represented to us to be.</P>

      <P>I do not understand this interruption, and I do not intend to try to understand it. What we are asked to believe is that the accredited representatives of this country are engaged in some sort of an underhand policy of throwing away the rights, the status and the dignity of this country at every possible opportunity. Those who use forms of words to convey those representations do not believe that for a moment.  They would <Col N="669" /> recognise if they did believe it that the position of this country would be very hopeless.  All this rhetoric, all this thumping of furniture metaphorically, does not set aside the plain fact that in any circumstances that may arise the Government of this country, by the very fact that it is the Government, is empowered to do all things that are necessary to protect the liberty and the well-being of the people of the country. That is a primary principle.  Nothing can set it aside.  Those few members here who were members of the Dáil when we were engaged in discussing the Treaty will remember that I proposed a resolution, before the ratification of the Treaty, stating what I have said now, that it was always the right of the Government of this country to do what was necessary to protect the liberty and well-being of the people. General Collins said to me that he considered the resolution unnecessary, that it was implied in the terms of the Treaty.  I said that I also held that it was implied, and necessarily implied, in the terms of the Treaty, but that there were a great many other people who did not seem to understand it.  It is always in the power of the people whom you appoint as the Government, no matter who they may be, to take whatever steps are necessary in any situation, military or otherwise, that may arise, to protect the country against any danger that arises.  That is the primary right of the people.  It is a primary right of the Government. Fears of how the country may be endangered in this situation and that situation are academic theories; they may appeal to certain elements of suspiciousness which is natural, more or less, in the conditions arising out of the conditions of the past in this country. It is, as a matter of fact, a weakness wherever it is found&mdash;that continual appeal to the people to suspect those whom they have put in authority. It is right to criticise them.  I do not object to the line of criticism that was taken up by Deputy Johnson.  It is right to criticise them, to challenge and ask for their views, but if there are certain enemies outside, and if you wish to encourage those enemies, get them to believe that you have people here who <Col N="670" /> are still in the slavish state of mind that they suspect everybody whom they entrust with authority.</P>

      <P>I wish Deputy Baxter would stop his habit of brooding over things.  It is gradually having a weakening effect on the House as well as on himself.  The Deputy seems to suffer from what can only be described as a form of political hypochondriacism; everything is going worse and worse.  The Deputy can sit there with that bearing that we so well know: &ldquo;What I have suffered nobody knows&rdquo;; and then stand up five minutes after other speeches have been delivered and be completely at sea with regard to what has been said.  I doubt if there is anybody in the House who believes that the Minister for Justice said anything like what was alleged by Deputy Baxter&mdash;that all nations are going to attack England through this country.  I even gathered the innuendo from Deputy Baxter's speech that it is the policy of the Executive Council to insist that every enemy of England shall attack England through this country, so that we may get an opportunity of deploying our Army against that country in defence of England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we get a new definition of things as we go along. Here is Deputy Baxter's phantom, this great phantom of his vast imagination, that this country is being prepared to receive an order to defeat all England's enemies.  That was his thesis.  That is the cause of all this sorrow to Deputy Baxter.  It was never said; it is not the intention.  There is no preparation for that type of contingency, and if that is all the Deputy can gather from the speeches made here, with regard to policy and in regard to the Army, he has not had a very good day in the House.  We have had one other speech which, as Deputy Professor MacNeill said, was not intended for the Dáil at all&mdash;the speech of Deputy Magennis, in which he referred to the League of Nations.  We are, apparently, to be forced into this dilemma&mdash;either to withdraw from the League of Nations and refuse to pay contributions towards it, or else&mdash;I do not know what the &ldquo;or else&rdquo; is, but I make the case to be to scrap the Army, or rather to increase the Army to the horrifying proportions that appears to have been put into the mouth of the Minister for External Affairs, and then be ridiculed by everybody else.  I think Deputy MacNeill has answered that sufficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The League of Nations we are subscribing to, and we hope it is going to be an element of peace in the world, but we are not going to rely on it to the exclusion of everything else.  Any attempt made by way of a quibble to make that as a point&mdash;that we should either have full faith in the League of Nations, and consequently destroy the <Col N="672" /> Army, or else keep the Army as it is and leave the League of Nations&mdash;is so much word-spinning.  There was another quibble made.  The Minister for External Affairs spoke of England asserting a right to certain places in this country in the event of war, and his statement was twisted into a form of moral right.  The Minister for External Affairs spoke of no moral right in regard to any country in this particular State, but he faced facts; he faced the Treaty; he faced what is there, and it is absurd to represent him as saying that there was a moral right on anybody's part to take control of the country here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Magennis is also afraid that there is not merely going to be an association with British troops in certain contingencies, but that there is going to be a unified command.  That he suspects; I do not know where that suspicion comes from, but I should think that anybody looking to the idea of command, how our Army is being trained, systems of control, how the troops are going to be employed in the field and everything else, might have noticed that there is a certain band of Army officers at present in America. If they are going to learn anything there that learning has to be passed on to the military men here.  It would be one of the first things that would cut straight across the idea of unity of forces in the field and unity of command, but that very important point is left out of consideration when a certain amount of hysteria seems necessary to be developed in the House.  One other point; it was the last distortion I heard made in the short time I was in the House.  We were asked by Deputy Magennis why should the Minister for Justice pass judgment ahead on what the attitude of this country is going to be in the event of war between America and Britain, but I heard no forecast of what side we were likely to be on in that struggle.  I heard the Minister for Justice saying that if war developed between the United States and Great Britain one of the main factors that should be immediately taken into consideration by us was the fact that America might see fit to attack Great Britain through us.  I do not think that <Col N="673" /> throws any light on a future judgment as to what part we are going to play when that struggle, if it should happen to come, does come along.  But these things are all taken and worked into a stream of hysteria about policy declared here and how troops are going to be used and what we are aiming at. Deputy Baxter has bemoaned the fact that the country has been so often &ldquo;let down.&rdquo;  Deputy Magennis has done likewise.  One of the things that must be noticed by everybody who listens to Deputy Magennis speaking on any matter of foreign relations is the envy that seems to be upon him that other people and not he are dealing with these matters in London.  I do not know how often I have listened to the phrase about &ldquo;hobnobbing with British Ministers.&rdquo; People are sent across from here to do their duty in particular circumstances, and the best that Deputy Magennis, with all his education and all his learning, can do is to throw out taunts and jibes about &ldquo;hobnobbing with British Ministers.&rdquo;  In the Boundary debate we had that even developed to the point of dinners, and we had the usual jibes&mdash;cheap jibes from a cheap individual&mdash;as to the effect of dinners.  It comes badly from anybody in this House to speak in that way, but it comes least of all well from the particular Deputy who most often uses the phrase, because it is a matter of history and a matter of notoriety amongst those who were acquainted with the Deputy that, as has been said, in addition to the supreme sacrifice he made during the struggle here of not paying his income tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is the big record he can put up, and I object to being taunted with regard to visits to London and what happened there by anybody, but I object more strongly when it proceeds from Deputy Magennis than I do when it proceeds from anybody else.</P>

      <P>It may save intervention at a later stage of this Bill if I were to say a few words in reply to this discussion.  I would like, if I could, to bring back the Dáil to the position that I desired to put before it.  I want to deal with it on the line that the Minister for Justice insists it should be dealt with&mdash;as a matter of realist politics.  I am not taking any exception at present to the existence of an Army in Ireland or to the function of the Army in Ireland to-day.  But I have insisted that in the course of the development of that Army, in its equipment, its method of organisation, we must have regard to the use to which we conceive it may be put.  I have sought to draw from Ministers what I think is their real view in the matter.  Notwithstanding the quotations I made.  I think they do intend that this Army in Ireland shall be for the purpose of defence in Ireland against any aggression from anywhere outside, as well as for the other purpose of suppressing insurrection or revolutionary action.  I believe that to be the position.  But I say that if we are going to let it go out to our people at home, as well as to the people in other countries, whether in the British Dominions or elsewhere, that we are parties to the scheme of things mentioned in the Imperial Conference report&mdash;which I admit were only recommendations, but, if not taken notice of, may well be considered as recommendations accepted&mdash; if these things, coupled with the statement of the Minister for External Affairs, go out, it may well appear to all concerned that we are part of the defence forces of the British Isles.  If that were to be the position&mdash;and I am speaking in terms of reality&mdash;every and any country which might be at war with Great Britain would be bound to <Col N="675" /> consider that we were also at war with them, because of the apparent unity of purpose and scheme of defence.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the position of Belgium in the Great War.  I take that as an instance.  Belgium suffered. Belgium was overrun by two contending forces.  I give way to the Minister to the extent that when you come down to brute primal forces, law gets the go-bye.  But that is not to say we must not attempt to build up a law or to try to attune the people's minds and the nations' minds in times of peace to the possibility that law may prevail and that there may be defences, even against attack, in having some kind of moral conception of the relations between peoples.  Belgium was over-run, notwithstanding its neutrality. But the very fact that Belgium was overrun roused an appeal, however sincere or insincere it may have been, which brought other nations into the war.  That was because of violation of neutrality.  If Belgium had been in league with, let us say, Germany on the one hand, or with France, on the other hand, as to its scheme of defence, and only in respect to one of these Powers, the other Power might well have been justified in saying this was not neutrality&mdash;that it was a definite siding with the other belligerent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the other illustration.  Take the case of Holland.  Holland was saved from being overrun by those Powers during the war.  There was the greatest temptation to Germany on the one hand, and to Great Britain on the other hand, to use Holland as a place from which to attack the opposing forces then in Belgium.  That was known to everyone.  But Holland was neutral.  Holland had not given occasion for attack to either side.  Had either Power attacked Holland in those circumstances, it would inevitably have brought America into the war long before she came into it.  There was at least moral protection in the fact that Holland was neutral, was not allied with either of the belligerents, had no scheme of defence particularly attuned to one or other of the belligerents. Because of that Holland had moral protection.  It might have been that <Col N="676" /> that protection was not sufficient.  It might have been that Germany might have used Holland as a means of attack or that Great Britain might have used Holland as a means of entering Germany, or attacking the German forces then in Belgium.  But neutrality did succeed there in saving Holland, despite great temptation.  It is because I realise that we cannot pretend to develop in this country really ample forces to withstand the aggression from big Powers by sea or by air, that I think we ought not to develop our defence forces with a view to that particular kind of defence.  In addition to that, we ought to minimise the risk of attack by making it as clear as possible to everyone concerned, and pursuing our defence policy with a view to it, that we are not part of the defence forces of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>That is my whole plea and it is because I felt that it was necessary to have the scheme of defence recommendations from the Imperial Conference, not repudiated but declared to be noneffective, as far as we are concerned, and that the statement of the Minister for External Affairs last week should not be taken as supplementary or complementary to that statement of the Imperial Conference, that I thought it necessary to raise this question.  It has not been stated in so many words by Ministers, and I am inclined to fear that the statement of the Minister for Justice will be taken as a statement which gives colour to the proposals of the Imperial Conference Report on defence as determining the views of the Ministry.  But I do not think that that does prevail with the Minister for Defence.  I do not think that idea has yet got hold, or that it has, in fact, coloured the defence policy.  My object is to prevent the possibility of that coming to be the case.  The Minister for Justice made reference, by illustration purely, of the possibility of a war between the United States and Great Britain and the position of Ireland in such a case.  That is another confirmation of my proposition. In such a case, if there was any evidence to show the United States that our defence scheme was part of the British defence scheme, we would be taken to <Col N="677" /> be at war with the United States, and Irish nationals in the United States would be subject to all the laws of war.  I want to prevent that.  I want to insure that Irish nationals in the countries of the world are not going to be liable to have their property seized, and are not going to be interned or to be considered as belligerents merely because Great Britain is a belligerent. I want to get some of the advantages that go with nationality and statehood. I feel that the view that the Minister has given expression to might well be taken as a complete renunciation of all that has been claimed for anything beyond local self-government.  I would take again in support of my proposition the reference to my action at the time of the British coal strike&mdash;to my action as an executive officer of the Trade Union Congress.  I should like that this country, in relation to Great Britain, would occupy a similar position to that which I occupy in regard to the British Trade Union Congress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move my amendment to Section 1.  The section, as it stands, reads: &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;minimum degree of disablement&rsquo; means eighty per cent. degree of disablement.&rdquo; I am moving to delete the word &ldquo;eighty&rdquo; and to substitute for it the word &ldquo;twenty.&rdquo;  As the Bill stands, the minimum is eighty per cent. of total disablement due to disease contracted in the Army.  I do not see why the figure should be at eighty per cent. It seems to me that a man who is eighty per cent. disabled is in the same position as a man who is a hundred per cent. disabled.  A man who was fifty per cent. or even forty per cent. disabled as the result of disease contracted during service would not come within the terms of this Bill at all.  I put down twenty per cent. in my amendment because that is the minimum for a pension for disability due to wounds.  If a man is twenty per cent. disabled as a result of wounds received during service he is entitled to a pension, but there must be eighty per cent. disablement before he is entitled to a pension in respect to disease contracted while on service.  I will be glad to hear what case the Minister has to make on this matter and why twenty per cent. was fixed as the minimum with respect to wounds, <Col N="680" /> whereas it is eighty in regard to disease.  I would also like to hear from him why a man who is seventy or seventy-five per cent. disabled as a result of disease contracted during service should not be entitled to a pension. If a man is disabled to the extent of seventy-five per cent. as the result of disease contracted or attributable to service in the Army or in the Volunteers, and is not to get a pension, will the Minister say how that man is going to live?  The man will have to live with his relatives if they are in a position to maintain him, and if not his only alternative is to go into the county home.  Does the Minister consider that a man who is disabled to the extent of seventy-five per cent. as a result of disease which he contracted during service that he rendered to this country must go into the county home for the remainder of his life?  I cannot understand why the minimum was fixed so high as eighty per cent., and I will be glad to hear what the Minister's explanation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes) Peter Hughes">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting this amendment.  The Deputy wants to know why a man should not get a pension in respect to disease contracted in the Army and who is disabled to the extent of twenty per cent.  There is a difference between the man who is wounded and gets a pension and the man who contracts disease, whether in the Army or outside of it.  A wound is a clear-cut thing that everyone can see. Everyone knows where it was contracted and the day on which it was contracted, and there is a record in connection with it.  It is another matter to detect when disease commenced.  If you had to find out whether a man was twenty per cent. diseased four years ago or not I would defy any Board, even one of experts, to decide on that. The Deputy wants to know if we are going to let our soldiers and volunteers go into the workhouse.  Certainly not, and that is the reason why this Bill is brought forward.  In cases where it is proved that hardship exists on account of disease that is attributable to services in the Army, we are going to give these people a pension that will keep them, and I say that eighty per cent. <Col N="681" /> is a fair minimum to fix.  The figure was not arrived at in a rough and ready fashion.  It got a good deal of consideration, and I believe that eighty per cent. is as far as we can go in the matter of disease.  You must take into account the incidence of the disease, how it might have been contracted, whether a man actually contracted it in the service or not, whether he had the germs of the disease before he came into the service, either in the Volunteers or in the National Army.  All those, I say, are matters that require very careful consideration. In fixing the minimum at eighty per cent. we believe that we are doing what is reasonable, and that this will meet the cases of hardship that will arise.  I do not know whether Deputy Morrissey would expect that we should give a pension to every man who might have got a cold during the trouble in the last five or six years.</P>

      <P>People who are disabled as a result of service and cases of hardship will be dealt with under this Bill, and I say that eighty per cent. is a reasonable minimum to fix, taking into account the manner in which they are bound to be treated by the Board that will have to examine them.  Take the case, say, of a clerk suffering from eighty per cent. disablement.  He will be able to do some work in an office. He might not be the best fitted man that you could get, but he would be able to earn a considerable amount of money.  The same thing would not apply to a man who had to earn his living with a pick and shovel.  Eighty per cent. disablement in one case would not be the same as eighty per cent. disablement in another.  In my opinion, and that of my advisers, the minimum that has been fixed is a reasonable one, and I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision on this matter.  Under this Bill you will be dealing with people who will have <Col N="682" /> returned to the districts in which they were reared.  The employers in their district will know that these young fellows may be suffering from a disablement that will not be quite as much as 80 per cent., and I think the Minister himself is old enough to remember the treatment that the British soldiers met with on account of disability. Employers, knowing that these young fellows will not be capable of giving a full output of work in ordinary occupations, will not employ them, and consequently they will be handicapped in that respect.  I would ask the Minister to look at the question from that point of view.  You have a graduated scale of pensions, and hence I think the Minister should accept Deputy Morrissey's amendment to meet the cases that he has in mind.  A man suffering from a slight disability will not be able to get employment in cases where employers require a fair output of work.  I am sure that the Minister himself would not employ a man whom he knew to be an ex-soldier suffering from a slight disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess the Minister has astonished me.  He talked about a minimum of 80 per cent. total disablement being very fair and reasonable.  Why, it is practically the same as if the Minister had put down 100 per cent.  We all know that a man who is 80 per cent. disabled as a result of disease has one leg in the grave. The Minister talks about such a man getting employment.  Surely the Minister knows that men who are 100 per cent. fit cannot get employment to-day. Does the Minister think that any employer, no matter how charitable he may be, is going to take a man into his service and pay him wages, knowing that that man is 80 per cent. disabled&mdash; a man who, in fact, is not able to walk? The Minister has made a point that a wound is something that is there and can be seen, that everybody knows how it was received, and so on.  He spoke about the incidence of disease, and said that it is very hard to ascertain when the disease was contracted, or what percentage of the disablement existed three or four years ago.  He seems to be forgetting Sections 30 to 35 of his own Bill, where it is laid down that a <Col N="683" /> man has to prove that disease was due solely to service.  The Minister cannot get away with it by saying that they are not going to allow any person disabled, as a result of service given to this country, to go into the county home.  Let the Minister consider the concrete case I put to him.  Take a man 40, 50 or 60 per cent. disabled.  If his relatives are unable to maintain him, I hold he has no option but to go into the county home, because men who have a clean bill of health, strong, virile young men, cannot get employment to-day.  As I have said, no employer would pay wages to a man 70 or 80 per cent. disabled.  Such a man would be a danger to an employer as well as to himself.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to support the amendment.  I know from my experience in dealing with British Army cases that a labourer 50 per cent. disabled owing to rheumatism, or diseases like that, is practically unemployable. He has to live on his pension. The Minister does not propose to give a pension in these cases; in fact, I am rather surprised at Deputy Morrissey's moderation in laying down 20 per cent. I suppose he was following the British precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it was also the British minimum.  The United States minimum is 10 per cent.  The Minister may say the United States is a very rich country.  France also has a 10 per cent. minimum, and France is not in a very satisfactory financial condition at present.  Germany, a defeated country, and paying reparations, can also afford a 10 per cent. minimum. In Canada, the minimum is only 5 per cent., I believe.  I am not asking the Minister to adopt that Canadian precedent. That may be carrying matters too far, but I do say that to insist on an 80 per cent. of disablement as a minimum for a disability pension is making the Bill a farce, and if Deputy <Col N="684" /> Morrissey carries this to a division I shall vote with him.</P>

      <P>I am rather surprised at the attitude taken up by the Minister in dealing with this amendment. With Deputy Cooper I also strongly support the amendment, which in my opinion, is reasonable and moderate. I wonder does the Minister know that employers to-day will not give employment to a man with the minimum of disablement he has laid down in the Bill, because such a man would not be eligible for insurance?  When he is not eligible for insurance, the employers consider him a danger and will not take him into employment at all.  With this 80 per cent. minimum no one is going to gain any benefit by the Bill, and it is only a sham to say that it is dealing with deserving cases. The Minister for Local Government, or anyone who knows anything about employment to-day, knows that men of the kind proposed to be dealt with by the Bill cannot get employment.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to follow the example of the Workmen's Compensation Act and give the men an opportunity of going before a Court and getting a Judge to decide what they are entitled to.  It is not fair for the Government to treat in this way men who are responsible for having us in this House, and for having the Minister in the position he is in&mdash; just throwing them on the scrap heap. While the country is crying out against over-taxation it wants no victims, and it can stand a little further taxation to avoid having victims.</P>

      <P>Before long the Deputy will be saying this country is overtaxed, and that the Government is responsible for the over-taxation.  I wonder why he did not tell me that he wants every man in this country to be <Col N="685" /> a pensioner.  It amounts to that.  We all want pensions if we can get them, and I think the best thing would be that another Minister should introduce a Bill providing pensions for everybody, including the Deputies, when their time expires.  We have done our best in this matter, but we did not bring in this Bill to give pensions to everybody.  Speaking from conviction, I say it would have been much better for the country if a Pensions Bill had never been brought in.  When these men went out as Volunteers or joined the National Army they did not do so for pensions; they never thought about pensions, but now that pensions are in the air everybody is looking for a pension.  I say, deliberately, that it is only the hard cases that we are attempting to cater for under the Bill.  We are not attempting to cater for everybody.  We do not say that.  We are attempting only to cater for the hard cases and no others.  Let us understand that.  We are not catering for the man who, as Deputy Morrissey said, may be known to have some disease and nobody will employ him.  It would be a good thing, no doubt, for an unemployed man to get a pension, but can the country afford it?  We have gone to the absolute limit as regards giving pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take the Minister on his own ground.  He said that the pensions are to meet cases of disablement due to military service, but he said that it is not proposed to give pensions to everyone.  Rather, he puts it forward and, more or less, charges us with saying that we are in favour of giving pensions to everyone, because we are asking that men disabled by disease due to service shall be treated equally as well as those who gave service but did not suffer disablement. The Minister for Defence will probably remember that his predecessors defended military service pensions on grounds such as these, namely, that men went into the national struggle, broke their professional careers, broke their hopes and expectations of life, their whole outlook was diverted and altered, and, as a consequence, it was due that they should be, in some way, given financial recompense.  That is the plea, and I am not criticising it in any way at present.  Here, also, these men went into national service, and they have come out of it unable to follow their projected careers.  They are not even able to take an equally remunerative career in another walk of life.  They are actually physically disabled to the extent of between 20 and 80 per cent.  That is the range that we say should be brought in.  I say it is only just, the barest justice, that these people who are disabled, through disease contracted in the Army, should be treated at least as well, on the same plane at any rate, as those whose career was diverted or broken, whose prospects in life were diminished by virtue of their national service, but who retained their health.  The Minister told us on the last occasion that 80 per cent. was practically total disablement, and, of course, we know that that is so; but for many men 50 per cent. is practically total disablement. At any rate, it is 50 per cent. disablement, and a man's ability to earn a living, if he got an opportunity of doing so, is diminished by 50 per cent.  I think the Minister's ground for refusal is entirely untenable except on one plea, and that is, the financial plea. Are we to take that plea as final and decisive?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not prepared to say that these men joined the Army for the purpose of getting awards.  No, surely they did not, none of them did.  The military service pensioners did not, but they got pensions, if they gave the required service.  These men did not, but they have come out unable to earn a livelihood owing to disease contracted on service.  Let us bear in mind that that is the provision. That is not the case of a man who went in, as the Minister said, with disease and came out with the same disease. The Bill provides for pensions in the case of disablement due to disease attributable to military service.  By every analogy, in every army, or in civil life where disablement is due to service rendered, we are bound, as a matter of justice, to consider these men as entitled to some benefit from the State because of their disablement due to the service they gave.  The Minister says that we all might talk about looking for pensions.  I, for one, would be prepared to say that if any Deputy, or Minister, suffered a 50 per cent. disablement due to his service in this House he is entitled to a pension.  If we cannot find the money, probably we will have to retrench somewhere else. We might have to revise our previous Pensions Bill.  We might have even to be driven to doing very distasteful things, but let us not say to this particular class of people who suffered disablement through disease attributable to service: &ldquo;You, at any rate, have to look elsewhere for pity, justice, and something like care in your disablement.&rdquo; I hope the House will support this amendment.  I hope it will take it as a matter of personal concern and, speaking on behalf of the State and the constituents they represent, say: &ldquo;We direct Ministers in this matter that they are to treat these disabled men with the same amount of justice as they have treated the undisabled men to whom pensions have been given.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson makes a great plea on behalf of these men.  Perhaps they have as much sympathy <Col N="688" /> from the Government as from any Deputy.  We must recollect that when those men joined the Volunteers or came into the National Army there was no system of medical inspection, or if there was a system, even in the Army, the majority of the men came in when it was very lax.  Men might have come in who might have been suffering partially from some disease that they are now suffering from, but of which no one knew at the time.  It is quite a different matter with men who joined the forces since October, 1924, when a proper system of medical examination was set up.  These men came into the Army absolutely healthy as far as medical science could guarantee. Where men joined the Volunteers in 1922 and 1923 it could not be said if they were physically fit or not.  A great many risks have to be taken, and I believe that under this Bill as it stands the really genuine cases will be catered for.  As I said, we are not catering for everybody.  We are catering for cases of hardship, and that is as far as the country can go at the present time.  I do not see that I could accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister and the mover of the amendment might be able to arrive at some compromise in this matter?  The Minister's percentage on the one side seems very high, and the mover's percentage on the other seems scarcely high enough.  Would it not be well if the Minister reconsidered this matter before the next stage, or give an undertaking that he would consider if some compromise could not be come to?  I think that would be the best way to deal with it.  Surely no one can expect that men suffering from disease can earn a livelihood?  If they contracted disease in the Army their case is a genuine one.  If they did not contract it in the Army, then they have no case. I believe that all these people who are suffering disability on that account will be thrown, as the mover of the amendment said, on the local rates and the County Homes if something is not done for them.  On these benches we are not out to advocate anything but economy. At the same time I think I see in this <Col N="689" /> question a remarkably fair claim. These people should not be thrown on the local rates.  They should be catered for by the Army where they contracted the disease.  I do not think the finances of the country have been so completely safeguarded in every other direction as in this matter by the Government.  The Minister makes the plea that the country cannot stand such a claim.  I say that we have very high taxation, taxation that in many quarters might be avoided if the Government was as careful in every decision as it was in this one.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to meet the Minister in this matter if he has any suggestion to offer.  Although I think the 20 per cent. minimum is moderate, still I realise that if the Minister is going to take up a stone wall attitude and say that it is to be 75 per cent.  I can do nothing, If the Minister is prepared to say that he will make the minimum anything from 20 to 50 per cent., say 30 per cent., I will be prepared to meet him if he will undertake to bring in an amendment to that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot undertake to bring in anything that would satisfy the Deputy.  I will undertake this much: I will reconsider the matter in all its bearings between this and the Report Stage if the amendment now before the House is withdrawn.  I want it to be clearly understood that that is not a promise that I am going to alter the minimum percentage in the section. I will reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>If I were to agree to what the Minister has said, I take it that the agreement would be conditional, and that I would have the right to move an amendment on the Report <Col N="690" /> Stage.  If the Minister is prepared to consider a reduction from 80 per cent. between now and the Report Stage, I am prepared to give him a chance of doing so.  That will be on the understanding that I will be in a position, if the Minister cannot see his way to come down from 80 per cent., to move an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect that the Minister might take into consideration.  He realises that this kind of thing is largely to be determined by the considered views of the House.  The only way to do that, as we are on the Committee Stage, is to let the House decide whether it would desire the Minister to make the change. If the House decides &ldquo;yea&rdquo; the Minister will know what the views are.  If the House decides &ldquo;nay&rdquo; the Minister will have no alternative but to bring in a new proposal on the Report Stage. The Minister has had an opportunity of considering this matter since it was raised on the Second Reading, but he has not had the views of the House.  As this is the Committee Stage, the decision has to be confirmed on the Report Stage, so that the best course to adopt is to let the House have an opportunity of intimating to the Minister what it desires.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), at the end, to add the words, &ldquo;and death otherwise than from a wound, caused by shock, strain or exhaustion due to active military service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is to amend an infirmity in this section.  There are some cases other than those described in the section.  For instance, people who died, not from actual wounds, but who, nevertheless, died in action.  They are very few, but they are of such merit and importance that they deserve to be considered.

      <P>The point I should like to call the attention of the Minister to is that it says &ldquo;due solely to disease.&rdquo; I should like to know if the Minister includes in the word &ldquo;disease,&rdquo;&ldquo;exhaustion or strain due to active military service.&rdquo;  If that is so, there cannot be much objection to saying so, and inserting it.  It would cover the case and make it perfectly clear and there would be no trouble.  This is a case not due solely to disease.  It is a case of exhaustion after active service.</P>

      <P>I might add, for the information of the Deputy, that the particular case he has in mind is brought within the Bill because the man is alleged, according to the certificate, to have died from heart disease. That will be clearly within the definition of disease.  There is no use in lumbering the Bill with wording that is not necessary.  This case is clearly brought inside the Bill.  It is a question afterwards for the Board to say whether the conditions are fulfilled, but the case is covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not quite correct, I think.  To begin with, there is a possibility of doubt as to whether such cases as those quoted by Deputy Hogan would be deemed to be persons whose death was due to disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it does put it beyond any doubt.  Even supposing the Minister's interpretation is right, the section in question deals with gratuities to dependents in certain cases.  But if the person had suffered death through a shot, I think I am right in saying that the dependents would be entitled to a pension. The proposition in the amendment is that the word &ldquo;killed&rdquo; is to include death by drowning and death caused by shock, strain or exhaustion, due to active military service.  Following upon the killing is a pension, not a gratuity. That is an additional reason why the amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to Deputy Cooper that we might take his amendment No. 5 as the deciding amendment and allow the decision on that to cover Amendments No. 3 and 4 and Amendment No. 6 also. I think No. 6 is part of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather object to that for two reasons.  Two issues are raised: the number of persons there are to be on the Army Pensions Board and the manner in which they are to be appointed.  Amendment 3 raises a distinct issue and is not merely consequential. In the same way Amendment No. 6 raises a distinct issue, whether persons appointed to the Army Pensions Board shall hold office during the pleasure of the Minister and are to be removable by the Minister, or whether they are to have a more permanent and judicial position.  Amendment No. 4 is consequential on No. 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I beg to move Amendment No. 3.  The Minister proposes that the Army Pensions Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members, one of whom is a member of the Army Medical Service <Col N="697" /> and the other an outside doctor.  I suggest that there should be two outside doctors.  Apparently there is to be one board and one alone dealing both with wounds and disability cases.  That being so, there should be a physician and a surgeon on the board.  It is to be presumed that these men will be of some eminence in their profession. The Minister will not go and get the cheapest doctor, nor will he get the ordinary dispensary doctor.  He will get men of some position, and these men are generally specialists.  They do not as a rule deal both with surgical and with medical cases.  Therefore I think he should have two ordinary members instead of one besides an officer of the Army Medical Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that amendment, because I take it that to all intents and purposes the medical officers that will be required will be physicians, not surgeons.  We know exactly the number of wound cases that we will have to deal with under the Bill.  They are those that occurred from 30th September, 1923, to October 1st, 1924.  They did not come under the 1923 Act, so that the majority of cases that will have to be dealt with under this Bill when it becomes an Act will be medical cases, not surgical cases.  I think from my experience in the past of medical boards that two medical members, with an independent chairman, will be quite sufficient.  If we were to overload this board we would never get through the amount of business that would have to be done.</P>

      <P>Are we to understand that the Minister's intention is to appoint a civilian practitioner who is a physician and an Army medical officer with some knowledge of wounds?  If so, that would probably make a practical board, and I would withdraw my amendment except that I <Col N="698" /> do not want to prejudice myself on my Amendment 5.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Amendment 6.  It is an attempt to alter the section by limiting the power of the Minister.  At present the Minister may, if he thinks fit, remove any member of the Pensions Board at any time that he likes.  They only hold office during the pleasure of the Minister, and I propose by this amendment to give them a more permanent tenure, and let them hold office on practically the same terms as judges.  They are, in fact, judges, judges of the degree of disability from which a man is suffering. While I think the Minister has some precedents for it, I think they are bad precedents.  He must bear in mind that in dealing with these men, who are suffering from wounds or disease because of service, he is not dealing with happy, cheerful men who think every thing the best.  You are dealing with men who have suffered, who have in many cases resented the delay in introducing this measure dealing with the question of disability pensions. You are dealing with men who, I know, are extremely suspicious.  As long as this power of the Minister to remove a member of the Pensions Board stands part of the Bill, a man who claims a pension will feel that the dice are loaded against him.  I do not suggest that the Minister intends to do anything improper.  I am sure, from my knowledge of his character, he does not, but it will be very hard to convince a man who is labouring under a grievance that the Minister has not brought undue pressure to bear on the board.  He will feel that he is going to law with the devil, with the court in hell.  So far as the ex-service man is concerned, of course I <Col N="699" /> would not compare the Minister to anything less respectful than a member of the Executive Council, but that is the belief the ordinary man will have. I propose, instead, that these members, when appointed, should hold their posts until they are removed by resolution of either House of the Oireachtas. I am leaving it open to the Minister to come to the Dáil if he has good cause to remove a member of the board.  I am sure the Dáil would be only too glad to give him power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be opportune on this amendment for the Minister to give some views as to the character of this board which he proposes to set up, and its work, because in one way that will affect the view as to the merits of this amendment.  For instance, we have to connect it with the proposal to delete sub-section (5), that there is to be no payment to these members of the Board.  I think the Minister ought to take this opportunity of explaining his intention regarding the composition of this board in a general way&mdash;whether it is to be an internal departmental affair, or whether it is to consist of independent medical men or women.</P>

      <P>In the first place, the board is to be a temporary board, and I cannot understand how it is that Deputy Cooper wants to place a board that is going to be in existence for a couple of years at the outside on the same plane as Judges of the High Court, so that in order to change a member of the board or to get rid of his services we must come to the Oireachtas and get a Resolution passed, to remove him from his exalted office.  I do not think the Deputy is really serious in that.  He did not advert to the fact that it is to be a temporary board.  If these men were being appointed for life, with the powers of High Court Judges, I would certainly agree with the proposal.  But for men in a temporary capacity, I do not think the amendment is at all in keeping with what is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson wanted information regarding the deletion of sub-section (5).  The object of the deletion is to <Col N="700" /> enable the Minister for Finance to advance money to members of the board for expenses.  One of the members will certainly be an officer of the Army, and he may have to travel on the business of the board.  If sub-section (5) remains he will not be allowed any expenses. The same thing could happen if the other member of the Board was in the service of the Government.  The deletion of sub-section (5) would enable the Minister for Finance to give any remuneration which he thinks may be necessary to either of these members.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be lured into discussing that part of the Bill, but I may tell the Minister that, in my opinion, this ought not to be a temporary board.  My experience in dealing with the British Pensions Act has convinced me that any amount of hardship has been caused by the British time limit.  A petition with, I think, nearly a million signatures, was got up for its removal.</P>

      <P>How can the Minister say that?  How can the Minister know that?  Sometimes these illnesses take a very long time to develop.  It ought not to be a temporary board, because cases may occur where a man may suddenly develop a disability or where his disability may become very much accentuated.  I think this board ought to be in existence until one House of the Oireachtas decides that it ought to cease.  The Minister makes the case for my amendment stronger than it was before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>The case that I make is that the man has four years from the date of his disability, or twelve months after the passing of this Act, to make application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a time limit for the disease to reach the minimum degree of disability.  If it does not reach the minimum the man is outside the Act.  I think he has a long time <Col N="701" /> from the date he first became disabled to reach the 80 per cent.  That does not give it the appearance of a permanent board.  A man must make his application within twelve months after the passing of this Act.  It is a question of how long it will take to hear the cases, and when the cases are heard the board must dissolve in the usual way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

      <P>The Minister says four years is a sufficient time limit, but in the case of the British Act seven years has been found to have been altogether insufficient.  There is a lot of other cases which I could quote to the Minister.  In France, where the time limit was five years, it has been extended to 1928.  That is to say, it was five years after the Armistice.  It has now been extended to nine years.  In South Africa there is no limit of any kind.  I reaffirm my point that this should not be a temporary board.  This board should be permanently in existence as long as there is a possibility of a genuine claim being put forward.</P>

      <P>The board will be in existence as long as there is a genuine claim to be put forward or to be decided, but to put the members of this board in the capacity of Judges of the High Court and to say that you must come to both Houses of the Oireachtas and pass a resolution to remove these gentlemen, either for misconduct or anything else, is a preposterous proposition as far as I can see it.  The only case in which it occurs is the Judiciary. I do not think we could attempt to put a temporary board&mdash;and this is a temporary board&mdash;in the same position as Judges of the High Court.</P>

      <P>I am not quite able to understand the point the Minister has made, but perhaps I did not quite follow him.

I do not know whether that is the explanation the Minister gave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather the position the Minister takes up is that if this sub-section (5) is inserted it will have the effect of excluding any fees or remuneration, or even an allowance for travelling expenses to a member of the board who is in receipt of remuneration out of public funds&mdash;that it will really have an exclusive effect rather than an inclusive effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>If the section is left in, it would prohibit the Minister from giving any additional remuneration to any person who receives remuneration from any public funds at present. Take, for instance, any of the doctors appointed by the Minister for Finance. If a doctor were holding any appointment under the Government for which he is paid a salary, and that it was desired that he should get additional remuneration for the duties he would have to perform as a member of the board, if that sub-section were left in the Minister for Finance could not pay him the additional remuneration.  We want to obviate that and we want to make it possible that such a payment can be made if necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">

      <P>Sub-section (3) states: &ldquo;The Chairman of the Army Pensions Board and the ordinary member of that Board who is not an officer of the Army Medical Service shall be appointed by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance,&rdquo; and so on.  It is absolutely essential that if you appoint a man you must fix a salary for him.  You must pay him for doing the work if he is not a member of some Government Department. Supposing you have some outside surgeon or medical practitioner and you put him on the Board, you must fix a certain extra remuneration for him. That does not affect sub-section (5).  It is where an officer is already an officer of the Government.  If he were appointed a member the Minister would not have power to give him any additional remuneration for services rendered on the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have picked up the argument of the Minister regarding the possible effect, though I am not quite convinced, of this sub-section, in respect of the member of the Board who is already a civil servant or a member of the Army.  I want to know whether there is in the Bill, anywhere, authority to pay a non-official member of the Board any remuneration because, as I read it, it seemed to suggest that the intention was to make the Board entirely an official Board. That is to say, you will have one member of the Army Medical Service and another medical man who is on the Civil Service pay list.  I want to make sure that there is provision made in the Bill that the non-official member of the Board may be paid, even though he is not a member of the Civil Service.</P>

I suggest his object would be achieved not by deleting the whole sub-section, but by taking out the words &ldquo;who is not in receipt of remuneration out of public funds.&rdquo;  That would not limit it in the manner suggested.  It would make it quite clear that others are entitled to be paid.</P>

I cannot see the object of deleting this sub-section except that it is to cut out all possibilities of appointing any independent man, other than the Army surgeon.  That is the object of this sub-section.  It is not the intention of the Minister to appoint anybody except a civil servant who will be favourable to the views of the Minister, and who will be partial to the Minister's view of these pension cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colohan has anticipated the argument that I intended to urge on this section, that the method provided for appointment of this Board is not a very satisfactory one.  As I said before, you are dealing with men who are both suspicious and &mdash;I am sorry to say&mdash;embittered.  They will not look with favour on a Board appointed solely by the Minister.  If the Minister could give any indication as to how he proposed to select the members of the Board, it might assist us.  Apart from an officer of the Army Medical Service, whom, of course, he must select, how will the others be selected?  Will he consult the Civil Service Commission or the heads of the medical profession?  I am not tied to any particular method of appointment, but I do say that all the members of the Board should not be directly appointed by the Minister, holding office at the Minister's pleasure and liable to be removed by the Minister at any time and a new member appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a member of the Board were removed, it would be almost impossible <Col N="706" /> to get applicants to believe that he was not removed because he was too liberal to the claimants and that the Minister proceeded to appoint a more complaisant substitute.  We all hope that this Bill is going to do a great deal of good amongst people who, I am sorry to say, feel that they have not been treated with that fairness or gratitude they expected.  Ex-Servicemen who have served with the National Army feel that they would have got disability pensions and more generous wound pensions if their wounds had been received in the European war and not in their own country.  I feel that the method of appointment set out in this section is wrong, and I hope the Minister will give some indication that, on Report Stage, he will be prepared to bring in at least one independent member of this Board&mdash;a man who will not be appointed by the Minister himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the view that the board should assuredly have one member at least who is not directly appointed by the Minister and who might be considered by the applicants as free from departmental pressure.  I have often said that I am not subject to the particular suspicion that attaches in many people's minds to the Civil Service.  But that suspicion is very widely prevalent. Amongst people who are likely to be affected, it would be well that there should be that mark of confidence in the board that would be secured by having at least one person who is not nominated by the Minister&mdash;who might be considered to be independent of departmental and Ministerial influence. I put forward that view, in support of Deputy Cooper, for the express purpose of securing, so far as it is possible, a greater chance of confidence in the board on the part of the applicants for pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the composition of the board, it is to include one officer of the Army who is a medical practitioner.  The other medical member is to be appointed by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Now, I do not at all admit that whoever is appointed to fill that position&mdash;whether he be a civil servant <Col N="707" /> or an outside practitioner&mdash;will be susceptible to departmental influence.  I should not like to tell the officer whom I will appoint on that board that he must act in a certain way or that he must do certain things.  I do not think I would be justified in adopting that course, nor do I think that the Minister for Finance would feel justified in ordering a member of the Civil Service to carry out his instructions as to the manner in which the work of this board was to be discharged.  The medical men appointed on this board will hear evidence and make examinations, and on the basis of these examinations and that evidence they will find whether an applicant will be entitled to a pension or not.  I do not think it is fair even to suggest that a member of the Civil Service would take from his Minister a hint or suggestion of the kind that has been thrown out.  I am sure the members of the Civil Service are above that.  I think that the provision made in this section for appointing the board is good and adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister admit that it is desirable that the greatest possible amount of confidence should be reposed in the board by applicants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is admitted, and we know that there does prevail pretty widely a feeling amongst the particular class concerned that Ministerial nominees will endeavour to reduce the amount of the pensions.  I do not believe that there is any likelihood whatever of civil servants being prejudiced against the applicants, but the Minister is probably as well aware of the feeling that prevails as I am.  My plea, following Deputy Cooper, is that every cause for suspicion should, if possible, be removed.  We should try and provide so that there would be no excuse for suspicion.  We should not agree, as I think is suggested by the Minister's reply, that the board should be wholly composed of departmental officials.  The question as to who will nominate is even less important than provision for at least one member who <Col N="708" /> is not a civil servant.  I fear that what is in the Minister's mind, judging by his statement, is that the whole of the board shall be civil servants.  If that is done, it will have an unfortunate effect on the minds of the applicants.  I do not think it would make any difference in my view in this matter or in the view of the Deputies here.  But that is not sufficient.  We may be all perfectly satisfied with the capacity of the board to deal fairly and impartially&mdash;even favourably&mdash;with the applicants, but we ought to do all we can to ensure that any excuse for suspicion shall be removed.  If the board is going to consist of civil servants exclusively, you are not going to ease the situation from the point of view of the suspicions of the applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must have given a wrong impression to the Minister.  I do not object to civil servants, and I do not suggest that civil servants would be improperly influenced by the Minister.  I said that we should do everything possible to ensure that there should be confidence in the board on the part of the applicants and that no board exclusively appointed by the Minister would give that confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister thinks it would be a good board.  Of course, he appoints it. Would the Minister think that a board appointed solely by the applicants for pensions would be a good board?  He would not, and I suggest that his feeling, when I put forward the idea that the board might be appointed by the applicants, though not as pronounced as the feeling of the Minister for Finance at the suggestion, was akin to the feeling of the applicants at the proposal that the board be appointed by the Minister.  There should be at least one independent member appointed by an outside authority on the board and not have every member of the board appointed by the Minister.  That is not an attack upon any member of the board.  I did not know whether the members were to be civil servants or not when I spoke.  I did not know until the Minister spoke that there was any idea of appointing civil servants. It is extremely important that the applicants should have confidence in this <Col N="709" /> board, confidence that they will get an impartial hearing.  There is the suspicion amongst them, which I regret, that if their cases are considered wholly from the departmental point of view, and solely by persons, whether civil servants or not, appointed by the Minister for Defence, the hearing will be a one-sided one.  I regret that suspicion exists, and I think the Minister should make some effort to remove it.</P>

      <P>I am supporting the idea urged by Deputy Cooper.  I think it is very important.  The demand he has made is very reasonable. The Minister said he would be very reluctant to approach any member of the board with a view to influencing him in any way.  I accept and appreciate that.  By accepting that, it does not follow that there is anything unreasonable in the present demand.  The Minister is anxious that this tribunal should be above reproach and that it should be entirely impartial.  He has now the best opportunity he can get of securing that that principle of impartiality shall be embodied in the Bill.  The Minister does not consider it quite fair that the question as to departmental influence should be mentioned by Deputy Cooper.  I think it is very desirable that that particular point of view should be raised here.  We are here moulding this Bill in the best way, and it is very desirable that a question like this should be raised and discussed with a view to making the tribunal all that the Minister desires.  There is no point at issue between Deputy Cooper, Deputy Johnson and the Minister on this question.  There is a general desire that this tribunal should be all that it can be made in regard to the administration of this Bill.  I do not know how the Minister, while maintaining and advocating that view and expressing his desire for an impartial hearing of evidence can resist a demand designed to ensure that the tribunal will be absolutely impartial.</P>

I do not think he would, but I think it is absolutely <Col N="710" /> necessary that this board should have the confidence of the men for whom the benefits of the Bill are intended. I think it is a mistake to say that there is no suspicion as to unfair findings, because there will be unfair findings, especially if the Minister appoints the whole personnel of the board.  I have had a good many complaints from soldiers who underwent medical treatment in some of the military hospitals.  Their statements were true.

It made him even worse than he was before.  They gave him a pension and also a gratuity. Does not that prove that they were wrong on all the previous occasions? That is one case in point.

The probability is that it will not.  I have not even thought of the officer of the Army who is to be appointed on it. I have not thought of the selection to be made, inside the Civil Service or outside the Civil Service, as to a second doctor.  All that I do know is that a very eminent gentleman in the city, who is not a civil servant, has sent in a &ldquo;feeler&rdquo; to know whether he would be appointed.  That is all that is known yet.  I am at a loss to think that the Deputies should be in such a state of excitement over the appointment of the members of the board.  I believe, when the board is appointed, it will have the confidence of the applicants.  I will try, as far as lies in my power, to get the best possible people to act on it, people who will extend fair play to the applicants and to the State.</P>

      <P>I must ask the Minister to take note of the evidence on which the suspicion in my mind arose that it was his intention, or the intention of the Minister for Finance, to appoint a person to this board either as an honorary medical gentleman or as one who was already in the pay of the State.  The proposal to delete subsection (5) seems to me to point pretty clearly to that as the intention.  That may be an unfounded suspicion, but one learns, in three or four years in this House, all the consequences of certain moves on the Ministerial benches in respect to Bills.  This looks very like a proposal to pave the way for the appointment of a fully State-paid service. I would still like an assurance from the Minister&mdash;notwithstanding his general guarantee that it will be the best board he can get&mdash;for the purpose of instilling the amount of confidence desirable in his own interest and in the interests of the administration of the Act, that one at least of the members of the board should not be a member of the Civil Service.  I think that would be an advantage in every respect. It is because I feel that there are pointers in this matter that I would like to have an assurance before the Bill is passed, that the Minister will concede the point that Deputy Cooper has made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the notice I gave this afternoon I am drawing attention to a matter of much importance, perhaps of more importance to the Gaeltacht than some of the eye-wash we have been listening to and reading about for the last few weeks. After consultation with my Party it was decided that I should raise this question of costs charged by the State Solicitor to defendants in Land Commission processes in Tirconaill.  This point on the question of these costs may be also applicable to other counties as well as Tirconaill.  It is of the utmost importance that the matter should be brought at once to the notice of the Dáil and to that of the Minister responsible. The first case I propose to deal with is that of Owen and Daniel Doherty, who were the defendants in a joint process.  Their joint names appear on the Receivable Order.  The amount processed for is £2 17s. 0d., payment in lieu of rent, and the cost as set out in the process is 10s. 3d. before entry in one instance, and 10s. 6d. in the other.  A copy of the process having been served on each defendant, this sum of £2 17s. payment in lieu of rent plus £1 0s. 9d. costs was remitted by the defendants to the State Solicitor about the 2nd of February.  The entry day mentioned in the process is the 5th February.  In the schedule of costs to <Col N="718" /> the District Court Rules the costs for the issue of a process which exceeds £2 and does not exceed £5 is 8s.  In a foot-note to a further schedule in the Rules it is specified &ldquo;In all cases the sum of 2s. 3d. shall be allowed in addition to the scales of cost hereinbefore set out for each copy of a civil process served after the first, which sum shall include service fee.&rdquo;  According to that schedule the legal costs payable before entry by these defendants for the two processes was 10s. 3d., and not £1 0s. 9d.  I hold that 10s. 6d. out of this sum of £1 0s. 9d. is, therefore, illegal and unauthorised.  The next stage as regards costs, that is after entry and before the hearing, is set out in these two processes as £2 10s. 9d.&mdash; £1 5s. 3d. in one copy and £1 5s. 6d. in the other.  According to the costs as set out in the schedule in the District Court Rules the costs authorised is 14s., which, added to the 2s. 3d. for extra copy&mdash;authorised by footnote on page 108 of the Rules&mdash;makes the scheduled cost after entry and before hearing 16s. 3d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost set out and demanded by the State Solicitor on these two processes against Owen and Daniel Doherty is £2 10s. 9d., which is an illegal and unauthorised charge to the extent of £1 14s. 3d.  The next processes are against a widow, Mrs. Annie Doherty, for £6 15s. 0d., for payment in lieu of rent in one process, and in another, £5 6s.  She has two holdings, and these are not joint processes. The cost before entry appeared to be correct according to the schedule of costs under the rules in page 101, column 1.  The costs set out and payable after entry and before hearing are, I submit, unauthorised.  The sum of £1 11s. 6d. is the amount of the costs in each process as costs after entry.  The woman was about to remit this amount until I looked up the schedule of costs and found in column 2 of the schedule that £1 is the authorised amount chargable after entry, so that an unauthorised overcharge of 11/6 in each of the processes, or 23/- on the two, was demanded from this poor widow and her four little orphan girls in Inishowen. According to my information, and after looking through these Rules, I find that <Col N="719" /> the State Solicitor is entitled to charge on the first five items, in column 2. page 101, a sum of £1.  The next three items: &ldquo;Attending and conducting case at hearing, 7/6; drawing and signing decree, 2/6; stamp on decree, 1/6: total, 11/6&rdquo;&mdash;are amounts which.  I submit, he is not entitled to charge, because it cannot be held that he is entitled to fees for a decree when the amount is paid before going into court. I desire to draw attention to a footnote on the process issued by the State Solicitor: &ldquo;This civil bill must accompany remittance, otherwise the matter will not have immediate attention.&rdquo; That is a very cryptic pronouncement. The defendant to the process is requested by the State Solicitor to send the process with the remittance.  That is done extensively by defendants, in my experience.  That destroys the evidence of the overcharges.  When these rules were being rushed through the Dáil, a member of our Party stated to the Minister that before twelve months serious flaws would be discovered in them.  Here is the first, and a very serious one for small farmers in my area.  An experienced District Justice in our county made the following remarks at Ballyshannon District Court on the 19th October last: &ldquo;I have been waiting three years for these rules, and if a law clerk had been paid a decent fee they would have had a decent set of rules in a week.&rdquo;  Now there is my whole case.  I am delighted to see that such interest has been taken in my remarks, both by the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, and I expect, from the serious manner in which they have been listening to me, that something will be done.  I ask both Ministers to investigate the overcharges that I have brought to the notice of the Dáil.  If they do so, I think they will find that I have reason to be correct in my allegations.</P>

      <P>With all respect to you, sir, I would point out that the unfortunate people who were processed have not the money to pay solicitors to go into court.  I also find that solicitors are reluctant to interfere in this matter, because it deals with a certain prerogative of theirs.  That is the reason I brought the matter before the Dáil, because some of the unfortunate defendants, in the first instance, are not in a position to pay solicitors to question the charges, and also in my area solicitors are reluctant to raise such a question against a colleague who is a member of the legal profession.</P>

      <P>With regard to this question, State solicitors are not in any way connected with my Department. Land Commission work is done by the State solicitors, but I have no control, of any kind, over them.  I am merely driven into the position of having to answer all sorts of questions in connection with their work.  This is not the first time matters of this kind have been raised on the adjournment, concerning the administration of their particular functions by State solicitors. As it is also connected with the Land Commission it seems to be taken for granted that I must deal with the matter. I do not know what my position would be, even if they were officers of the Department of Lands and Agriculture. As you, sir, point out, if an overcharge has been made there is a legal remedy.  I do not know whether cases of that sort ought, or ought not, be raised in the Dáil.  There is a legal remedy if an overcharge has been made.  I do not know whether it is within the Deputy's rights to raise it in the Dáil.  That is the legal position. Might I say one word as the question has been raised?</P>

      <P>I did not mind this particular matter being raised, but now that it has been raised there is a very important question at issue.  This is not a court in the sense that the Deputy can get up and say here that someone has been improperly and illegally treated, and that the Minister ought to find a remedy.  In fact, the remedy is a remedy at law. What I gathered from Deputy White was that certain fees were chargeable under the District Court Rules, that there was a certain legal maximum to be charged, and that in particular instances, which he mentioned, a State solicitor charged higher fees than he was, in fact, entitled legally to charge. That is the way I grasped the matter. If that is so, it must be possible to bring this matter into court and make the State Solicitor comply with the law if, in fact, he has infringed the law. As I understand the position, the fact that he is State solicitor puts him in no better position than if he were solicitor to a private person.  If the costs are defined by law the jurisdiction of the courts is the same for the State solicitor as it is for everyone else.  Can the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Justice determine the question as to whether the fees are excessive, or would the matter have to go before a court?  We cannot have Ministers asked questions that should be referred to a Judge.  Deputies on other occasions would, of course, be very strong on that particular point.</P>

If the facts are as mentioned by Deputy White, is it not a real case for investigation on the part of the responsible Minister, to discover whether or not the position is as he reveals it?  If so, does there not <Col N="722" /> immediately arise the question of the competence of that official to carry out the administrative work which he is appointed to carry out?</P>

      <P>I am not deciding this particular case, because I do not know all the facts.  I have not gone into them.  What Deputy Baxter says may be so in particular instances, but we could not have the position here that, because a person is a public official, a speech might be made here to the effect that he is acting illegally.  This is not the place to hear that charge.</P>

      <P>You must bear in mind, sir, that these rules were discussed and approved of by the Dáil.  The schedule of costs was also approved of.  I submit when that is the fact any Deputy has a right to come here and criticise the official who I allege has charged unauthorised costs, according to the schedule attached to the District Court Rules.</P>

      <P>I was only thinking of the point of procedure.  I think it is important, and that the position should be made clear.  Perhaps it would be inadvisable, until some thought has been given to it, to have any ruling now which might form a precedent.  I would suggest that the purpose of the Deputy has been effected even without any conclusion, and that the matter should be dealt with by you, sir, after thought and examination of the actual position.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact that is exactly what I have done.  I have allowed the Deputy to deal with the matter.  I have not prejudiced his rights, if he had any. He has had his rights in full, or perhaps more than his rights.</P>

      <P>I have very little to say.  I would like to query the use <Col N="723" /> of the word &ldquo;official&rdquo; in connection with State Solicitors.  State Solicitors are not formally appointed by the Executive Council or by a Minister. They are selected by the Attorney-General to do State work in their respective counties and instead of <i>ad hoc</i> fees in each particular case they are paid a bulk sum which represents, really, compounded professional fees. But there is no appointment by me, or by the Executive Council as a whole, nor any formal appointment, in fact, beyond that the Attorney-General selects a solicitor in a particular county who will do any work arising on behalf of the State in that county.  I was simply anxious to put a query mark behind the word &ldquo;official,&rdquo; in connection with these persons.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to comment, in view of what has been said, on the facts, and on the particular figures that were given here.  I want to say that, even if a State Solicitor were an official there is a question not only of the right of a Deputy to raise a matter of this sort, but the propriety of raising it, in view of the fact that a case may be established in court.  If the Deputy thinks it right to come and make a statement with regard to a matter of that sort, before the case is taken to court, and in an assembly like this, where only one side of the case is heard, and where statements are broadcasted, I do not know if it is proper in view of the fact that a case may come to court, to raise the matter in that way.  I daresay there would be some way of raising the matter in the House if, in fact, legal proceedings had been instituted against the solicitor, and the plaintiff succeeded in getting a decree.  I dare say there would then be, possibly, some way of raising the matter as to whether a State officer <Col N="724" /> did his work properly, and was a proper officer for the State to employ. That is all based on the assumption that he is an official, but I say it is hardly quite correct procedure.  The Deputy may have a right to raise the question before legal action is taken, and make <i>ex parte</i> statements that no one is in a position to deal with in regard to matters that may come immediately afterwards into court and have to be decided.  I say, as Deputy Johnson said, it is a matter for consideration. A distinction has been drawn between the amount of costs chargeable before entry and the amount of costs after the decree has been taken out.</P>

      <P>I did not raise that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the amount of costs properly chargeable after a decree has been taken out.  The legal question is whether a solicitor is entitled to charge, after entry, full costs of a decree, even though he gets paid the amount after entry and before the decree.  The question to be decided is, whether a solicitor who has entered a civil bill for hearing in court can charge full costs applicable to a decree, even though he got the amount sued for before the actual court day.  I do not want to go into that question.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice and the Minister for Agriculture have made elaborate statements about the State Solicitor being an official. When I raised that question about the State Solicitor on the Land Commission Vote last June the Minister for Agriculture endeavoured to prove that the State Solicitor was not an official, and he was very nearly successful in doing so, but for Deputy Johnson.</P>
