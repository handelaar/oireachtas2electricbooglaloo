      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHN KEATING</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if there is any reason why through-rate bookings for live cattle exported from Enniscorthy, Macmine, Killurin, New Ross, Chapel and Wexford to Birkenhead cannot be procured in view of the fact that such through rates are available as between Ferns, Gorey and Birkenhead.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Great Southern Railways Company that they have been engaged for some time in arranging a large system of through-rates for live-stock to Birkenhead.  Rates from Enniscorthy, New Ross, and Wexford are included in the proposals, but have not yet been definitely arranged with the other carrying companies concerned.  The Company state that they have not had any case made to them as yet for rates from Macmine, Killurin, or Chapel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Great Southern Railways Company has already refused to bring through rates into operation for the Wexford Harbour Board?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that rates from Wexford itself were included in the proposals made, but that the arrangements are not definitely settled yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEATING</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is necessary to have <Col N="768" /> through rates from Wexford and Enniscorthy? County Wexford is a cattle-raising and tillage county, and, that being so, Dublin is the principal route for the cattle.  The present arrangement is very unfair to the farmers and exporters of cattle in County Wexford. There should be through rates from all the stations in the county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The proper course is to have strong representations made to the railways company.  I am only answering according to my information. I have no great jurisdiction in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. KEATING Mr. KEATING">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KEATING</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if any steps have been taken, and, if so, what steps, to secure the re-opening of the Drinagh Cement Works, now owned by the Cement Marketing Co., and if he is aware that large quantities of cement are regularly required by public bodies in the Saorstát, and if steps will be taken to have their requirements manufactured in local factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has from time to time discussed with various parties the prospects of opening a cement factory, but has not so far succeeded in inducing any persons to do so under the present conditions in which cement can be produced elsewhere and marketed.  It was for the same reasons that representations made to the company owning the Drinagh Cement Works failed to induce that company to re-open these works.</P>
      <P>Until such time as there is a cement factory working in the Saorstát, nothing can be done in the direction of requiring public bodies to purchase cement made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. KEATING Mr. KEATING">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KEATING</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. KEATING Mr. KEATING">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KEATING</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a poor way to procure work for the unemployed. There were one hundred men engaged at the Drinagh Cement Works and, as a result of their closing, these men have <Col N="769" /> been walking the roads for the last two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>PADRAIG MacFHLANNCHADHA</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that in connection with the application of Margaret O'Sullivan, of Clonroosk, Feenagh, County Limerick, for an old age pension, an affidavit was signed by two old men in which it was stated that she was seventy years of age; and, if so, whether he will state the reason for the refusal of his Department to grant the pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This claim was disallowed on the 19th April, 1927, as it was not clear on the evidence submitted that the claimant had attained the statutory age.  The claimant stated she was 70 years of age, but she gave no date of birth.  She did not produce a birth or baptismal certificate.  She was first married in October, 1898, but no record of her age at marriage could be found in the General Register Office. Two affidavits were received in the case.  The deponents stated they knew the claimant since her childhood, and declared she was 72 years of age.  The affidavits were not, however, considered sufficient proof of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if his attention has been drawn to the evidence at the Road Traffic Committee of General Murphy, Assistant Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána, dealing with the necessity for providing playgrounds for children; whether, in view of the increased bus and motor traffic through Upper, Middle and Lower Gardiner Street, he will recommend to the City Commissioners the desirability of acquiring Mountjoy Square or portion of it, for a public playground for the children of the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to <Col N="770" /> the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  As stated in reply to a previous question from the Deputy on this subject last year, further consideration of the proposal must await a town planning scheme.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister take steps to carry out the suggestion contained in the latter portion of the question&mdash;that the City Commissioners should acquire portion of Mountjoy Square for the purpose of a public playground? I have reason to think that that proposal would be favourably considered.</P>

      <P>In consultation with the leaders of other Parties and Deputy Cooper, as representing the Independents, there was a strong feeling expressed that the Estimates should be allowed to pass without discussion.  It is evident to everyone in the House that the strain of the last few days, following upon the strain of the General Election, would not make useful discussion possible.  However we may desire to discuss items in the Estimates, it is clear, I think, to all of us that it would be unfair to Ministers to ask them to make up briefs in defence of their particular Estimates in present circumstances. We are bound to have the financial business concluded before the 1st August, and rather than have an item here and an item there picked out for discussion, I suggest to the House that the best plan would be to adopt the Estimates as they stand.  I am quite sure that there will be agreement on the part of Ministers that facilities be given for discussing Departmental business in the Autumn Session, rather more facilities than would be normally expected.  I would ask the House as a whole&mdash;Deputy Cooper, Deputy Baxter and Deputy Redmond have all agreed with me in this matter, and I am sure they have the backing of their colleagues in their respective Parties&mdash;to agree that these Estimates should be passed without further discussion. While doing that it is quite understood that we are not foregoing any of our rights and we are not making any precedents, but we are recognising existing circumstances.  I would, therefore, suggest to the House that this might be the course adopted, and that there would be general agreement to that end.</P>
      <P>Agreed&mdash;&ldquo;That remaining Estimates be adopted without discussion.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Perhaps this is a fitting time for me to announce that it is my intention to withdraw the motion regarding the personnel of the Economy Committee, which stands in my name on the Order Paper to-day.  This matter was discussed at the meeting of the Committee of the Leaders and Whips of Parties which met to-day, and at which I was present as Whip of my Party.  It was decided that I should withdraw this motion for the present on the implied understanding that we should get priority for private members' business on the re-assembly of the Dáil following the recess.  I do not wish in any way to minimise the importance of this motion, because I regard it as a very important motion. Seeing that the Dáil is overshadowed by the gloom of a terrible catastrophe, I believe the question could not be discussed adequately, and that the feeling of the House is not in favour of it being discussed now, as it would only be discussed in an unreal atmosphere. I would, therefore, ask leave to withdraw the motion, with the intimation that I intend to put it down for discussion at the earliest date on the re-assembly of the House following the Recess.</P>
      <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether, when the grazing sand banks situated on the Bingham Estate, Doohoma, Geesala, Co. Mayo, were acquired by the late Congested Districts Board, it was decided that compensation was <Col N="772" /> payable to Messrs. John Cronin, Emlebeg, Belmullet; Pat Manning, Emlebeg, Belmullet; Anthony Gaughan, Pat Ginty, Phelix Henry, Edward Gaughan, Pat McGuire, and Bridget Monaghan, residents in Doohoma, Geesala, Mayo, for their rights on these banks; whether such compensation has yet been paid, and whether he will say what is the present position of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The lands referred to appear to be a holding situate in the townland of Doohoma, held by the eight persons mentioned as tenants in co. on the Estate of Bingham, which was acquired by the late Congested Districts Board.  The Board also acquired the tenancy interest in these lands on 1st November, 1924, by means of resumption proceedings, but as the tenants were not at the time able to prove their title to the lands, the purchase money was lodged in Court. Title has now been shown and the purchase money, less a deduction for rent due, will be paid to the persons entitled in the course of the present week.</P>
