      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President if, having regard to the friction arising between local bodies and the Department of Local Government and Public Health because of the method of making <Col N="2203" /> appointments and the general demand for the abolition of the Local Appointments Commission, he will take steps to have that body abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence of any general demand on the part of the local authorities for the abolition of the Local Appointments Commission. Relatively few of the 1,750 positions filled on the recommendation of the Commission since it was established have led to any controversy.  A number of local authorities have shown their confidence in the Commission by referring to it the filling of positions to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, does not apply.</P>
      <P>I may add that during the last 18 months I have personally investigated complaints made by certain local authorities against the Local Appointments Commission, and I have in all cases satisfied myself that these complaints were unjustified.  I believe that the system is working fairly and well, and that its abolition would not be in the public interest.  The answer to the Deputy's question is, therefore, in the negative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch (for Mr. Seán Brodrick)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has sanctioned the appointment by the Galway County Council of a rate collector who had not one of the necessary qualifications set out in the advertisement inviting applications&mdash;namely, a competent knowledge of Irish; whether he had stated in the Dáil on the 2nd August, 1933, that he did not propose to sanction this appointment; whether he will instruct the council to issue a new advertisement inviting applications for the post and further instruct the council that Irish is not to be mentioned as a necessary qualification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of the person in question as rate collector was sanctioned on the 2nd ultimo subject to the condition <Col N="2204" /> that he will acquire a competent knowledge of Irish within a period of 12 months.  I am aware of the terms of the reply to a previous question by the Deputy in connection with this matter. I do not propose to take any further action until the 12 months' qualifying period has expired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that it is making a complete joke of the Irish language to allow advertisements to be inserted on behalf of a local authority stating that Irish is to be a necessary qualification, and then out of the number of candidates to select the one candidate who knew no Irish whatsoever?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. When I replied to one question put to me by Deputy Brodrick here some time ago I had representations made to me by a number of people from County Galway, some stating that this man had Irish and some stating he had not Irish.  I said if the man came up to me I would verify it myself and find out the truth.  I had the man here in the House and cross-examined him and I found he had some Irish.  I found he had not a competent knowledge of Irish, but he had, I think, enough Irish to enable me to sanction his appointment on condition that he would be able to pass a qualifying examination at the end of 12 months.  He accepted that condition.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that <Col N="2205" /> certain licensed traders in Dublin opened their premises for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor thereon between the hours of 1 and 6 o'clock p.m. and in some cases 7 p.m. on Sunday, 3rd September, 1933, on the occasion of the holding of the All-Ireland hurling final at Croke Park; if he will state whether permission was given to such traders by the Gárda authorities, and if so, if he will state under what authority it was given, and if not, whether any prosecutions have followed as a result of such sale of intoxicating liquor; and if he will introduce proposals for legislation to amend the licensing laws to permit of extended opening by all licensed traders in the city, after application made before and subject to sanction by the district justice, on such occasions as the All-Ireland hurling and football finals and like gatherings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made regarding the matters referred to in the question and I have ascertained that for some years it has been the practice to permit a certain latitude to licence holders in the vicinity of Croke Park on the occasion of important Sunday fixtures. This practice was followed on Sunday, the 3rd September last, when the All-Ireland hurling final was held at Croke Park.  A number of licence holders opened their premises from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m., but not, I am informed, in any case until 7 p.m.  The Gárda Síochána were aware of what was happening and no prosecutions will be instituted. There is, of course, no legal authority for the procedure followed, and now that my attention has been called to it, I have no option except to direct the discontinuance of the practice.  I shall consider the suggestion that provision should be made for such cases by legislation, but I cannot give any undertaking as to the introduction of such legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware (1) that at the last general election a number of persons were charged with and in some cases convicted of the offence of personation, and (2) if he is prepared to introduce proposals for legislation, at an early date, making the minimum penalty for this offence six months imprisonment with hard labour with out the option of a fine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the Minister so reluctant to introduce legislation to deal with this horrible practice of personation at elections?  Is his reluctance due to the fact that his Party is kept in office by reason of this abominable practice?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy knows the law on the matter or whether he has bothered to inquire into the law.  There is nothing to prevent a district justice at the present time imposing a sentence of six or even 12 months' imprisonment if he considers the offence warrants it.  I do not propose to interfere with the justice's discretion.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to give effect to the suggestion put forward on the Committee Stage by Deputy Norton.  He pointed out that the Bill, as introduced, provided that where a certificate was issued as a result of a <i>bona fide</i> mistake or misrepresentation and such was discovered, the certificate so revoked would be from the date of its first issue and, consequently, the person holding the certificate, and who might have received payment, would be liable to repay such benefit from the date of the issue of the certificate.

      <P>Does the Minister recall to mind that when we were discussing, in this House, the Control of Manufactures <Col N="2213" /> Bill, the question arose as to the penalties in the event of a certificate being obtained by a manufacturer by misrepresentation?  It was pointed out then that it was very desirable to differentiate, in the statute, between innocent and fraudulent misrepresentation. To this the Minister coolly replied that there was no necessity, and that surely anyone would know that.  It was pointed out to the Minister that it was not so simple as he thought it was.  Apparently these words have sunk in now.  Will the Minister tell us now why if it was unnecessary in the Control of Manufactures Bill and the Wheat Bill to make a distinction between fraudulent misrepresentation and innocent misrepresentation, it is necessary in this Bill to make that distinction?  Has the Minister discovered that the sections of the Wheat Act and the Control of Manufactures Act which do not make any distinction are bad sections?  If the Minister has discovered that will he tell us when he intends to introduce amending legislation to bring these Acts into line, on the question of misrepresentation, with the Bill at present before the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the explanation of the Deputy's speech is that he has not read this Bill or that he does not understand the two Acts to which he has referred.  They provided for the revocation of licences which had been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation.  This Bill equally provides for the revocation of a certificate if issued as a result of misrepresentation or fraud.  But the Bill as originally drafted provided that the revocation should be retrospective. There is no similar provision in either of the two Acts mentioned.  This amendment is designed to secure that the revocation shall only date from the date on which the mistake was discovered.</P>

I think the proposed amendment is a good amendment.

      <P>I quite understand; so it is described.  Normally if a man was working and fell ill he would be entitled to benefit under the national health insurance.  But he cannot get any national health insurance benefit if he is an unemployed person of the type with which this Bill is supposed to deal, that is men who suffer from protracted periods of unemployment.  I cannot see why a man who falls ill should be removed into another category, such as made by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to provide for able-bodied persons capable of working, seeking work, but who are unable to obtain work.  A person ill and in a sanatorium is not capable of working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The case the Minister made for the Bill is this&mdash;and I think it was perfectly just&mdash;that where a man is able-bodied and willing to work he is entitled to get either work or maintenance, and that is specially provided for here.  The reason is this&mdash; we do not want to put the stigma of pauperism upon men of that character. A special category is going to be created and the justifiable pride and dignity of the workman will be preserved by his statutory right here.  If a man falls temporarily ill and goes into hospital for a few weeks the wife may have to get out-door relief simply through the fortuitous circumstances that the man fell ill for a few weeks. I submit that that is a great mistake. You are allowing a passing, and a purely fortuitous circumstance, gravely to affect the man.  A great many men are proud of the fact that they never got out-door relief.  We all know what human nature is.  When playing in the streets young children can be very cruel and they are sometimes ready to <Col N="2216" /> point the finger of scorn at the destitute who have to get aid through the rates.  A number of people take pride in the fact that that cannot be said to their children.  Here is a case where, because a man has to go into hospital for a fortnight, his wife and children have to go on the rates. Surely that is wrong.  These cases are comparatively rare but one such case is going to break up the whole foundation on which this Bill is built.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question which it is very desirable to ventilate.  It is worth looking into it to see if that is so.  I am not so sure that circumstances might not arise in which a man would not get his national health insurance benefit in a case such as I adumbrate.  All I want to ensure is that whatever happens we should not allow a trivial flaw of this kind in the Bill to result in the underlying principle being broken in upon, that is that <Col N="2217" /> where a man is able-bodied, is looking for work and is unable to find it, he is entitled to work or maintenance.  I suggest that as the Bill stands at present the dilemma which I have outlined may arise.  If it cannot arise I am quite content, but I think this is a matter which the Minister should look into between now and the time this Bill goes to the Seanad.  That danger should be safeguarded against.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which has arisen since the Bill was introduced, and which has been fully discussed in the Dáil.  The Bill is designed to give assistance to persons who are capable of work, who are seeking work, and who, through no fault of their own, are unable to obtain it.  That rules out people who are not capable of work, such as the inmates of hospitals or infirmaries, or mental homes.  Whatever provision has to be made for them is not made under this Bill.  This Bill deals only with people who are capable of work, but who cannot get employment through no fault of their own.  If the husband is unable to work, and is dependent on his wife, the wife is entitled to unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask, in the case of a person who is in receipt of this unemployment assistance and who has to go to hospital for treatment, is it fair to turn around and take from his wife and children the assistance which they had hitherto been getting? Through the mere fact that he has to go to hospital is it right to deprive them of it?  I have listened to the debate, and that strikes me very strongly.  Because the man is unfortunate enough to have to go to hospital for three weeks or a month his dependants are deprived of the assistance which they would be getting under this Bill.  I do not think that is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point is that the obligation for making provision for the sick poor rests on the boards of assistance.  Some years ago the boards of assistance assisted only those who were sick and destitute.  It is only in recent years that home assistance has been given to able-bodied persons.  That obligation to provide assistance for able-bodied persons is being assumed by the State under this Bill.  That will presumably enable the boards of assistance to give assistance on a more generous scale to those who are thrown on their resources, because their condition arises out of the illness of the bread-winner.  This Bill is an Unemployment Assistance Bill.  It covers only those who are capable of work, who are genuinely seeking work, and who are unable through no fault of their own to obtain it.  The person who becomes ill comes out of this scheme, and goes under a scheme designed to deal with such persons. This Bill is designed to deal with able-bodied persons.</P>

If the boards of assistance do not carry out that obligation, then there is another story.  The difficulty which this Bill is designed to deal with is the recently acquired obligation of the boards of assistance to provide for people who are destitute through another cause than illness, namely, unemployment.  The old obligation to provide for the sick poor still rests on the boards of assistance, and no objection to their performing that function has ever been raised&mdash; certainly not by me.</P>

      <P>I am arguing that here is the intervention of purely fortuitous circumstances that will rarely arise, that can be perfectly reasonably provided for under this Bill, and that ought to be provided for.  Any person who knows the mentality of the ordinary labouring man will know that he will keep on his feet to the last minute in order to get the benefits under this Bill, rather than put his wife and children on the rates.  I think that is wrong.  It is bad enough for the man who is unemployed and who cannot get work to be in that condition, but it is worse if he falls ill that he should have the added anxiety of putting his wife and children on the rates.  It is unnecessary, futile and silly.  You have machinery under the National Health Insurance Acts for differentiating between a person chronically incapacitated, and a person who is temporarily ill.  You can reduce the period which for the purpose of this Bill will be regarded as a temporary illness, and <Col N="2220" /> say if a person is confined to the county home as a chronic invalid he should then pass into another category altogether, as a man who is not fit for work and could not take it if offered it, but you should not apply that standard to a man who is suffering from a temporary indisposition.  If you do apply that standard you will create a situation in which a man who ought to go to hospital if he is to get proper treatment and be rapidly cured will not go, and nobody will be able to make him go.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage the attention of the Minister was drawn to the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 16.  As drafted sub-section (2) of Section 16 provides that if a person leaves his employment without just cause he may be disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance for a period of three months. As drawn, the Bill gives the committee dealing with the matter absolutely no power to deal with border-line cases.  The Minister undertook to look into the matter and I should like to know if he has been able to do anything in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked into the matter and I can see no case for amending the Bill.  The Deputy's proposal would, in fact, put upon the court of referees or the umpire, as the case might be, the obligation of not merely determining whether the person had left his employment voluntarily or without just cause, but also the measure of punishment that should be awarded for that.  I do not think that that obligation should be put on either of the parties.  Their function is to find the facts and if their decision is that a person left his employment voluntarily or lost it through his own misconduct, I think it is much better that disqualification following on that determination should be fixed in the Bill and should be applicable to all cases.  Not merely would the Deputy's proposal involve an extension of the functions of the court of referees, not merely does it <Col N="2222" /> raise a grave constitutional issue, but I think it also would make the administration of the Act much more difficult. It is much simpler to have easily understood and generally applicable rules than to have rules which may be available in particular cases. I think it is undoubted that the possibility of securing some reduction would tend to encourage applications to the board of referees and the umpire, even in the case of people who are not likely to succeed, in the vain hope that they may through some defect in the evidence or otherwise succeed in getting away with it.  It will be understood that the only case in which the period of disqualification will be applied will be where a person has been held by the board of referees to have left his employment of his own free will or lost his employment through his own misconduct.  Once that fact is determined and the decision given, I think the penalty should be uniform.  If there is any doubt as to how an applicant lost his employment, then that doubt will be resolved by the board of referees and the umpire.  Personally I think that they will be inclined, in border-line cases, to give the benefit of the doubt in favour of the applicant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate the fact that he is really tightening up in this Bill the existing provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1920 in this regard? I do not think the Minister appreciates that.  At the moment, the position is that there have been cases on record where persons left their employment, contending that the circumstances under which they were employed prevented their continuing their employment.  Under the conditions obtaining normally, such persons might be disqualified for six weeks, but there have been cases where the court of referees have reduced the period of disqualification from six weeks to three weeks.  I had a case recently on that point.  All I want in this section is to give the court of referees the same power as they exercise in such cases, on any consideration of similar cases under <Col N="2223" /> this Bill.  I suggest that the Minister might look into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On general principles I think that the terms of the Bill should be made more rigid than those of the Act to which the Deputy referred, having regard to the fact that under the Unemployment Insurance Act those who received benefits got something towards which they contributed themselves, whereas under this Bill they are getting something to which they contribute nothing.  It is much more important to have under this Bill some provision which will deter people from voluntarily leaving their employment than it was under the Unemployment Insurance Act.  It is much more important to have rigid provisions in this Bill than in the case of the Unemployment Insurance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that there may be conditions imposed on an employee which would make his position intolerable or make it impossible for him to retain his position? I do not want the Bill widened to any greater extent than the existing Unemployment Insurance Act.  The Minister has copied the provisions of that Act in some sections of the Bill and he might well copy them in this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11, at the end of sub-section (16) (5), to add the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;provided however that a person shall not be disqualified for receiving unemployment assistance in any case in which he proves that he is not participating in or financing or directly interested in the trade dispute which caused the stoppage of work and that he does not belong to a grade or class of workers members of which are participating in or financing or directly interested in the dispute, or that the stoppage is due to an employer acting in a manner so as to contravene the terms or provisions of any agreement existing between a group of employers <Col N="2224" /> where the stoppage takes place, or of a national agreement to either of which the employers and employees are contracting parties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think on the Committee Stage the Minister promised that he would consider this amendment and I should like to have his views on the matter now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I told the Deputy on the Committee Stage was that he should consider the question of amending the Unemployment Insurance Act to meet the particular point which the Deputy raised.  In any circumstances, I think that the terms of this Act should be similar to those of the Unemployment Insurance Act and that we should not accept in this Bill an amendment of the kind suggested by the Deputy until an amendment of the same kind had been inserted in the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1920. I would ask the Deputy, however, carefully to consider whether the particular amendment he has on the Order Paper serves that purpose.  I have given some attention to the circumstances under which it was inserted in the British Act and the results of its insertion in the British Act have not been such as to show that it is a satisfactory solution of the difficulties there.  It was inserted in 1924 and it aroused considerable opposition at the time. In fact in the debates in the English House of Commons, certain trade union leaders, who were members of the House, appeared to hold the view that the pre-existing provisions were preferable to the amendment.  Certain cases that have arisen since the amendment was effected seem to indicate at any rate that no change had been made and that the persons who became disqualified from benefit, under the Act prior to its amendment, would have been disqualified under the Act as amended.  A committee was appointed in Great Britain after the amendment of the Act was effected to consider the matter and it came to the conclusion that no satisfactory solution of the problem had been found by the amendment and in fact admitted its own inability to find any solution for the problem.  They left the matter in the <Col N="2225" /> air.  Circumstances here of course are somewhat different to those in Great Britain and it might be that it is easier to find a solution here than in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>There is a problem to be solved and I think it is generally admitted that it obtains in Great Britain as well as here.  It is not at all clear that the solution of the problem lies along the lines which the Deputy advocates and which appear to have been a failure in Great Britain.  However, I am devoting my attention to seeing if we can devise some form of words which will meet the situation.  The British Minister expressed his willingness to accept any form of words agreed upon between the trade union leaders and the employers' organisation but apparently that did not lead to anything.  I am prepared to give a similar undertaking but in the event of no solution being forthcoming along these lines, I shall undertake to endeavour to find a form of words myself to secure that only those are disqualified from receiving benefit who are participating or assisting in some way in a trade dispute, and which will secure benefit for those who are the innocent victims of such trade dispute. What I undertook to do was to inform the Deputy if I conceived it possible to introduce a Bill to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act along these lines and if not, that he should bring the matter before the Dáil in the form of a Private Bill or by a motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Minister that it is very difficult to find a satisfactory solution of any problem, and pending the introduction by the Minister of an amending Bill to the Act of 1920, I think the Minister will agree with me that, since he thought fit to incorporate this particular section in this Bill&mdash;the section on which the umpire decided that the men on strike at that particular period were not entitled to unemployment benefit&mdash;at least men placed in a similar position in future should be entitled under this Bill to unemployment assistance.  I can quite see the difficulty that the Minister is placed in. I am with him 100 per cent. as regards the non-payment of unemployment <Col N="2226" /> benefit to men who go out on strike for no legitimate reason.  I am a strong supporter of the Minister on that point. I know that is one of his difficulties.  I never advocated paying benefit to any section of workers who deliberately, for some grievance, sometimes real and sometimes imaginary, refuse to go back to their work.  I have no sympathy whatever with them, but I have sympathy with a decent body of men, who were actually against the strike and had absolutely nothing to do with it, being debarred from receiving unemployment benefit, as those men undoubtedly were.  It was on the very section and on the very words incorporated in this Bill that the umpire based his decision in that case, namely, that the works of the Great Northern Railway in Dundalk were not commonly carried on as a separate business.  It may so happen that a dispute may take place in any other business, and if an appeal is brought to the umpire, against the decision of the court of referees, as was done in this particular case, he will naturally be compelled to base his findings on the findings on the previous occasion.  It is in order to prevent that that I put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give a case in point distinct from the railwaymen altogether.  The Minister must be aware that all over the country you have spasmodic strikes occurring in connection with road improvement works, and there may be 20, 30 or 40 men who, perhaps, did no work for the previous six months, promised a job on a particular road improvements work, such as are being carried out all over the country under the grant supplied by the Government.  Assuming this Unemployment Assistance Bill was in operation and these men went to the local labour exchange to apply for benefit, they would, I am sure, be told by the officer in charge that since there was a dispute they would not be entitled to unemployment assistance, although the men were prepared to work.  The Minister knows that owing to conditions prevailing, from fear or some other cause, the men will not go to work although there is no real <Col N="2227" /> grievance.  That is the type of case I want to safeguard against.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about another section now.  A person is not disqualified from benefit if he refuses work where there is a dispute on.  He is entitled to refuse work where there is a trade dispute and to continue to be entitled to receive assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand that, as far as sending men to a job where there is a trade dispute is concerned. I am speaking of a job that is about to commence and where men are promised work and a dispute takes place.  There was a case of that kind in Louth which, I am glad to say, has been amicably settled.  There were 20 or 30 men prevented from taking that job at the particular time.  Their places are filled and these men will not get work.  It is questionable whether, under this section as it stands, these men will be entitled to receive unemployment assistance.  It is for that reason, and pending the introduction of the amending Bill which the Minister has foreshadowed, that I am very anxious to have this amendment inserted to Section 5.  The Minister, I am glad to say, practically stated during the Committee Stage that the decision of the umpire was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give the Minister's own words.  He stated, as reported in column 2087 of the Official Report of 4th October last:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That where one firm carries on two businesses a stoppage of work in one of the businesses should not disqualify from insurance benefit a person employed in the other business if that person becomes unemployed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony interjected: &ldquo;But it does.&rdquo;  The Minister replied &ldquo;It does not.&rdquo;  The Minister then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The wording of sub-section (5) of Section 16 provides that &lsquo;where separate branches of work which are commonly carried on as separate <Col N="2228" /> businesses in separate premises are in any case carried on in separate departments of the same premises, each of those departments shall, for the purposes of this sub-section, be deemed to be a separate factory or workshop or separate premises as the case may be.&rsquo; The bar to the drawing of benefit or assistance applies only in the case of men actually employed in the factory or works where the stoppage takes place.  If another business is carried on in the same premises it is, for the purposes of these Acts, deemed to be separate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The umpire decided, although these men were employed in separate works, and also in separate departments, that those works were not commonly carried on as a separate business&mdash;&ldquo;commonly,&rdquo; the very word which the Minister has incorporated in this Unemployment Assistance Bill.  It is a matter of splitting hairs.  There is no doubt, from the Minister's own statement on the Committee Stage, that these men were, in justice, entitled to receive benefit.  I am sure that the men in Dundalk will read the Minister's statement with pleasure, because they will see that there is common-sense in it, even if it is not strictly the legal interpretation which was placed on the Act by the umpire.  The Minister should accept this amendment, because it will not place any undue difficulties in the way of determining whether benefit should be paid or not, as far as the officers at the exchanges are concerned. It is only to ensure that men placed in future in a similar position to that in which these men were placed will be entitled, if not to receive unemployment benefit, to at least receive unemployment assistance.  I need not put the case further, because the Minister knows that the men to whom I refer paid contributions since the inception of the Act in 1920, and it was only when the revenue of the railways began to decrease, and when the men were placed on short time, that they drew anything from the unemployment fund.  I think it was a great hardship.  It is agreed by men who are very eminent in legal circles that that decision was altogether wrong <Col N="2229" /> and contrary to the facts submitted on behalf of the men.  For those reasons, I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the contention of the Deputy that there is, in relation to the Unemployment Insurance Act, a case for the reexamination of that particular section and for its amendment, if we can get a more suitable form of words.  I want to draw his attention to the fact that successive British Governments, and committees appointed by them, have not succeeded in getting a more suitable form of words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Still they introduced a new section.  The amendment is almost exactly in the same words as the section introduced by the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, and in relation to that I may inform the Deputy that in the following year a British committee reported that the problem had not been solved.  There was a very lengthy report on it and, in effect, the committee announced after long consideration their own inability to find a form of words that would solve the problem.  Since the British Act was amended cases have been decided by the umpire which were on precisely the same basis as the decisions under our Act here, and in some cases apparently the effect of the amendment would be to give a narrower interpretation of the section, whereas it is now generally agreed that the second part of the amendment relative to the breaking of agreements by employers has proved to be completely inoperative.  There is a case for examination for amendment of the Insurance Act if suitable words can be found.  Suitable words have not yet been found.  I will undertake, if suitable words can be found, to inform the Deputy.  Whether we amend the Unemployment Assurance Act or not, I am strongly of opinion that this amendment should not be accepted.  Both Acts should be amended together, for if one is amended the same formula would need to be adopted in the case of the other so as to have the same procedure.  It would be an anomaly <Col N="2230" /> if we had different wording in both Acts with the possibility of conflicting decisions being given by the same umpire in relation to the same set of facts.  The only way to consider the amending of the Unemployment Acts is to leave both stand over until both Acts are amended together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that unfortunately he is interpreting exactly the same words in different ways.  In the Dundalk case the umpire decided against the men's case.  The umpire decided that this separate branch of work was not commonly carried on as a separate business in a separate workshop.  That was because of exactly the same words that the Minister is incorporating into this Bill.</P>
      <P>Further, it was pointed out to the umpire that this was a case very different from that existing in Great Britain, that it was a case where locomotive works and constructional works were carried on in practically the same workshop.  He was told that this case came under the Act of 1920 which applied that time to Great Britain and Ireland.  On that point he held that there was no such thing as locomotive and constructional works in the Free State.  I know the umpire acted strictly according to the interpretation of the law and he would do the same again if any disputes came before him of a similar nature to that of Dundalk.  The result is that men who have for years paid to the unemployment funds and who did not receive any benefit, will not be entitled to receive even assistance under this Bill if a dispute similar to that which took place last year were to arise again.  I hold that pending the introduction of an amending Bill, amending the original Act of 1920, the putting in of this amendment would not preclude the Minister from introducing an amending Bill at any time in the near future.  It is in order to safeguard these men, or men placed in a similar position so that they will not be denied unemployment benefits, that I am pressing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not wish in any way to prolong the discussion except to say that this Bill is the same as <Col N="2231" /> the Unemployment Insurance Act and I do not think that the Deputy's amendment would alter the position at all.  If the Unemployment Insurance Act had been amended in the manner in which it is proposed that it should be amended, there is every possibility of the same decision being given by the umpire on a similar occasion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish raised this point in Committee and I must say that I did not quite understand what he was getting at then.  I afterwards discovered that he was trying to drag me into an old war which was going on between the urban councils and the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  I must remain neutral in this war.  For a long time this bone of contention between the urban councils and the Department has been there.  The Department have always held that a poundage rate should be assessed and levied on the total valuation of certain urban districts.  The urban districts have urged that it should only be on what Deputy Corish called the effective valuation of the urban district.  The Department of Local Government refused to agree to this.  They do not know quite what it means.</P>
      <P>The position is that we are calculating, for the purpose of this Bill, on a certain annual sum from each urban district.  That sum would be produced by a rate of 9d. in the £ upon the valuation, under the Valuation Acts.  It is that sum we want and any proposal which would mean that a smaller sum would come would, of course, upset the financial provisions of the Bill.  Deputy Corish's amendment would tend to reduce the contribution which we calculate should come from the urban districts.  I may say that no objection to the provisions of the measure has been received in my Department from any of the other ten urban councils which are similarly affected.  To admit the term &ldquo;effective valuation&rdquo; would mean that we could never ascertain with any certainty what amount we would get because it would vary from year to year in consequence of exemptions under the Housing Acts, the facility with which rates could be collected, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2236" /> I do not think the amendment could be accepted.  When Deputy Corish was explaining the matter on the Committee Stage, I did not quite catch what he was driving at.  I was of the opinion that the amendment I moved met this point, but I find that is not so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this amendment the local authorities would have a definite idea of what the actual contribution would be.  Deputy Corish merely wants to have the calculation made on the effective valuation.  Since those who come under the Bill are not going to be completely removed from assistance through the medium of home help, I think it would be better if the urban councils were placed in the position of knowing definitely what their contribution would be.  They would be in a position under this amendment to say that they were going to pay upon the effective valuation for the year, and it would be within their own discretion to supplement the amount, if that course were necessary in hard cases.  The Minister wants to be on the safe side and Deputy Corish wants to put the local authorities on the safe side.</P>

      <P>There are two items in the Bill to which I wish to draw particular attention.  It astonishes me that the Labour Party has made no representations in regard to one matter.  If the Minister will refer to the Schedule he will see that the scale of benefit ceases to rise when you reach the man with the dependent wife and five or more dependants.  A man with five <Col N="2237" /> children is entitled to 20/- a week. What is the man with ten children going to get?  If the Minister will refer to column 1701 of the Parliamentary Debates, Vol. 49, No. 5, he will find that Deputy Briscoe said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is quite clear ... that where able-bodied men get relief under this measure, they cannot, at the same time, get relief from the city or from any other authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy intervened to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Is that laid down now?  Will the Minister lay that down?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe proceeded to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Deputy wishes to suggest that I am wrong in what I say, I will get the Minister to lay it down for him.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You must not expect perfume from cattle.  The difference between our attitude and the Minister's attitude is this.  The Minister brought in this Bill with the object in mind that it was necessary to oil the Fianna Fáil election machinery. His attitude towards proposals for the improvement of this Bill has made it perfectly clear that he cares nothing for the principle.  My view is that where a man is eligible for assistance under this Bill no situation should be allowed to arise which would drive him on to the rates.  Here you have a situation where a man is penalised because he happens to have more than <Col N="2239" /> five children.  He ceases to have the statutory rights conferred on him by this Bill in respect to any children he might have above five.  I am clear that is wrong and that he should have statutory rights under the Bill for each one of his children; that is on principle. Now let us view it from another point of view&mdash;that of expediency. You have a man with seven or eight children.  I have a case here, the details of which are before me, of a Dublin man who has a wife and eight children.  He gets unemployment relief in respect of five children.  But he then has to go and make application to another font for relief in respect of the other three children.  What sense or meaning is there in a position of that kind?  Either a man is entitled to maintenance or he is not. It is no crime in this country yet to have a big family.  I can see no reason on earth why a man with a large family should be differentiated from his neighbour who has a small family. The number of cases that would arise would be small and the burden that would be laid on the Exchequer would be trivial.  Nevertheless it was not open to me to put down an amendment in this sense because technically it would be an amendment designed to add a burden to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to introduce such an amendment in the Seanad.  I urge him also to consider and to give heed to the observations I made at an earlier stage of the Bill, because I think it is of prime importance that the principle upon which this Bill is founded should not be interfered with in any single case, and that we should give it to nobody to be able to say that where expediency dictates the principle has been abandoned.  I ask the Minister to introduce an amendment dealing with two things in the Seanad: (a) where a person in receipt of unemployment benefit is temporarily incapacitated by illness and is removed to hospital that he should not be deprived of the statutory right under the Bill; and (2) where a man has a family in excess of five children he should be entitled to unemployment assistance in respect of children <Col N="2240" /> over and above five at the same rate as he receives assistance in respect of the five.  That would be an addition of approximately 2/6 per week per child in excess of the five children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy has said much that needs to be replied to.  Before dealing with one or two points he raised, I would like to give him a little advice.  There was a great French philosopher who on one occasion paused from his labours to give certain advice to politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Italian one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This French philosopher's maxim was: &ldquo;Never attribute to your political opponent motives meaner than your own.&rdquo;  Deputy Dillon said that our motives are to bribe the electorate.  I suggest there may be another explanation for the introduction of this Bill, and he might think it over.  At any rate the Bill is here and what I am anxious to discover is the attitude of the Party opposite towards it.  I have not discovered that yet.  When the Bill was introduced at first the extern leader of the Party opposite declared that its introduction was an attempt to pauperise labour and evidence of the failure of our industrial policy and started to rally the country against such a measure.  The intern leader of the Party followed somewhat in the same strain.  When the Party came to discuss the Bill, on Second Reading, each one followed the other with some meaningless phrases about the principle of the Bill being good, and then proceeded to speak against the introduction of the Bill in terms that went to the very root of the principle on which it was founded.  They paid lip service to the principle but they did not want its implementation.  It was that conduct that made me say, on the debate on Second Reading, that there was deficiency of moral courage in the Party opposite.  It was quite clear that they were anxious to defeat the Bill as ordered by their leaders but they had not the moral courage to walk into the Division Lobby and vote against it.  I do not know what their attitude is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2241" /> This Bill embodies a sound principle. It gives effect to that principle. The lower the rates of assistance and the fewer the classes covered by the Bill the less the cost will be although the cost such as it is is very considerable.  It is easy for any Deputy to suggest that the scale of payment should be increased or that additional classes of people should be brought under the scope of the Bill, and that it should be amended in various ways to provide for larger payments and easier payments.  But if such increases in the scale rate or in the number of persons likely to be affected are made there will be a large increase in the cost, and a point could well be reached where the cost could not be met except by greatly increased taxation, which would have the effect of increasing the very problem that the Bill was designed to deal with.</P>
    <P>Deputies in opposition can escape responsibility, but some Deputies would be irresponsible in any event. Deputy Dillon might consider the effect upon the taxation of the proposals that he is making if they were adopted.  He talked with a sob in his voice about unemployed men who became ill and had to go to hospital, and about having their wives and families thrown upon the rates.  I tried to explain, as lucidly as I could, that the principle of the measure confined its application to able-bodied persons.  There are various schemes in operation in this State for providing for people who cannot provide for themselves, such as the blind, the old-aged, and the sick.  Heretofore there was no adequate scheme for providing for those whose inability to provide for themselves arose out of their difficulty in obtaining employment. This Bill is designed to fill that gap in regard to able-bodied men seeking work and who cannot get work through no fault of their own.  Once a person gets out of that category he is outside the scope of this Bill and inside the scope of some other measures, such as the National Health Insurance service, and home assistance service met by the local rates.  It is not to-day or yesterday that this principle of excluding from the scope of certain measures of this kind people who were <Col N="2242" /> unable to work was adopted.  It was always the practice under the Unemployment Insurance Act.</P>
    <P>Persons entitled to unemployment insurance benefit could draw it unless they were capable of working.  That practice must prevail, otherwise you would have not an unemployment scheme, but a scheme with general provisions for dealing with all classes of people in distress.  If distress arises out of illness it is not covered by this Bill.  If a man because of illness is dependent upon his wife that wife is entitled to get assistance under the Bill provided that the wife is not employed and is herself seeking employment.  If their destitution or poverty arises out of other causes, such as blindness or perpetual ill-health in the case of a person insured under the National Health Insurance Act, there is at the present time some other State provision for such people.</P>
    <P>The question has also been raised about the fixation of the maximum number of children.  That is not intended to penalise people who have large families, but some limitation must be there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the cost of the measure is to be kept within a reasonable limit.  Why do the boards of assistance fix a maximum payment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Pardon me.  If the Deputy will make inquiries he will find that every board of assistance in the country has drawn up schemes of assistance on the basis of usually four children as a maximum payment.  It must be done.  I explained here at length on the Second Reading that in a number of cases assistance provided under this Bill will be inadequate because of certain circumstances.  The case of a very large family is one which should commend itself to the local board of assistance so that the assistance provided under this Bill would be supplemented by assistance provided by that body.  In a national scheme you must <Col N="2243" /> have broadly defined and easily applicable rules, designed to cover the majority of cases but likely to leave out the odd cases that exist in every community.  You can deal with those odd cases only by some scheme which permits of personal investigation of the circumstances. The boards of assistance have machinery which permits of that personal investigation.  The Department of Industry and Commerce has not, at least not to the extent that would enable it to deal with individual cases on their merits.  They deal with all cases on a general plan, and the odd cases that cannot be adequately covered by that plan can be assisted by the boards of assistance following that personal investigation which they are prepared to make.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Bill can be criticised on the ground of fixing a maximum number of children, particularly having regard to the necessity of limiting the cost, and preparing a scheme in connection with which it will be possible to estimate with some reasonable accuracy from year to year what the cost is likely to be.  That is the sole reason why the scales were fixed and why the various limitations in the Bill were decided on.  If there were unlimited funds at our disposal, or if it were possible to effect economies with the co-operation of the Party opposite so as to make more funds available, we might be able to increase the payments, but until the Party opposite decides to co-operate with us in making those economies that cannot be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): I intended to wait until the Fifth Stage of the Bill to raise this matter, but as Deputy Dillon has raised it now I may intervene. My objection is not that people are asked to stamp unemployment insurance cards but that provision is not made by the people responsible for the stamping of those cards where they should be stamped.  Provision is made for the replenishment of that fund in Section 4 of the Bill.  My grievance is that people who are entitled to take some money out of those funds are not put in a position to get it; that is to say, their cards are not stamped.  I am referring to drainage and some such works, where there should be no submission to tribunals of any kind, but where in the ordinary normal operation of this Bill and the previous Acts those people would be entitled to unemployment insurance.  I want to ask the Minister if he thinks that a case has been sufficiently made&mdash;not now, because I am not making a case now&mdash;during the past twelve months to justify that in the case of certain people who have not had unemployment insurance cards stamped provision would be made now that their cards be stamped, and that the benefit which would come to them under <Col N="2247" /> Section 4 of this Bill will come to them in the ordinary normal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes I should like to ask him a further question on the same lines as Deputy Dillon's, that is, whether he is able to give us figures with regard to unemployment insurance, and whether he is able to distinguish between those employed by the State or other public authorities and those employed by private enterprise?  Naturally, that is very relevant to an understanding of the general unemployment situation, and as to the extent public employment is really taking the place of the private employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite certain the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance will have no hesitation at any time in informing any Deputy who wishes to know the number of persons employed on works conducted by the Board of Works in any part of the country.  Reliable information of the kind requested by the Deputy can only be ascertained by a census, and a census is not likely to be taken for a couple of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The figures in relation to sales of unemployment insurance stamps do not permit of any differentiation between types of employment.  The figures relating to the unemployment books exchanged do permit of a rough differentiation between types of employment, but not between types of employers.  It would not be possible, for instance, to say whether a man engaged on constructional work was employed by the State or was employed by a private employer.  But both sets of figures show that there has been a substantial increase in employment. That is apart from any work provided on minor relief works.</P>

      <P>Column 2110 in the debates of last Wednesday.  As to the point raised by Deputy Hogan, following a certain discussion that took place here, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance had a number of test cases submitted to me as Minister for Industry and Commerce for decision in accordance with the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  I do not know whether the considerable number of test cases that were submitted covered all types of cases that could possibly be contemplated in relation to minor relief works or drainage works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to all these cases I had to come to the decision that the employment was employment in connection with agriculture and that consequently the persons engaged in them were not insurable.  My verdict is open to review by the courts if anybody feels like bringing a case to the courts for final determination there.  In particular cases facts may arise which would permit of a contrary decision to that given in respect to the test cases to which I have referred but in relation to these test cases, which in <Col N="2249" /> the opinion of the Parliamentary Secretary covered all the types of cases which were likely to arise in relation to drainage works, bog roads and things of that kind, my decision was that these people were not insurable under the Act.  I do not think that we can properly debate the matter here now, nor do I think it could properly be debated here at any time.  If there is any organisation or any group of individuals who feel that they would like to have that decision more fully examined and finally decided in the courts, I suggest they should consider doing that.  It might be no harm if before doing that they would have discussions with me because I am as anxious as they are to have the matter finally decided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one that has been the subject of many questions in the House and considerable interest has often been displayed on the subject in the Press for, perhaps, the last four or five years. The Bill has been a long time under consideration.  Since the original draft was prepared it has been changed and altered many times and we think we have got a draft now that will be satisfactory to the House.  I formally move that the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The measure is designed to secure in the interests of the community greater control over the development of cities, towns and other areas and to confer further powers for the preservation and extension of amenities. The importance of planning is becoming more clearly recognised.  The present powers of local authorities to control development extend only to defining building lines, the level, width and construction of new streets, the quality and substance of new buildings and the materials with which the foundations and sites shall be laid.  There is no power of control over the development of land in their areas as regards the limitation of dwelling-houses per land unit so as to prevent overcrowding, or the regulation of the character of buildings in the various areas of a municipality.  The basis of good town design is the proper distribution of building development with suitable reservation of land for roads, public parks or pleasure grounds, playing fields and other public purposes. Greater control is also required against sporadic development throughout the country and for the preservation of road frontages against what is generally called ribbon development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill confers on the councils of counties, county boroughs and urban districts the necessary powers for the planning of their respective administrative areas.  A plan may be made by a planning authority for their own district or part thereof, or a regional plan may be made for a planning region formed by two or more planning <Col N="2251" /> authorities under Section 12 of the Bill. Control of undeveloped land within and around urban centres offers the greatest opportunity for constructive planning.  It is, in fact, essential that control should be exercised within such districts and for a sufficient distance outside to ensure harmonious development.  With this object in view, Section 15 of the Bill gives power to extend such planning districts.</P>
    <P>Where two or more planning authorities desire to act together, they may form a region comprising the whole or parts of their respective areas, and may appoint a regional planning authority therefor with or without restrictions on the matters to be contained in a regional planning scheme.  The power to make a district or regional plan is entirely permissive, and may be exercised at the discretion of the planning authority.</P>
    <P>I am all for voluntary association and co-operation in planning on a regional basis.  The Department will give its full support to bringing about the greatest possible measure of co-operation between planning bodies. Planning to be really effective should be carried out over the widest area possible.  The demand for planning powers has not, however, been very wide, and some time may elapse before agreement upon joint action is reached. Greater control over the development that is rapidly taking place in the Cities of Dublin and Cork, which comprise more than half of the entire urban population, is urgently required, and it is important that a regional survey of the needs of these areas should precede the making of planning schemes. For these two areas the Bill provides for the formation of special regions. The Dublin region will include the City of Dublin and the Counties of Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  The Cork region will include the City of Cork and the County of Cork.  The respective planning authorities for the two regions will be the Corporation of Dublin and the Corporation of Cork. The position of the local authorities within these special regions is amply safeguarded.  Apart from the provision <Col N="2252" /> in Section 14 of the Bill requiring consultation with the district planning authorities for the areas within the region, the regulations to be made under Section 18 and the First Schedule of the Bill will require that any local bodies that are likely to be affected by a planning scheme shall, as soon as possible after the passing of the resolution for the preparation of a planning scheme, receive notice of the resolution and also a copy of the scheme, and be entitled to be heard at any public inquiry held in relation to the scheme.</P>
    <P>The matters within these special regions in which the corporations of the two cities as regional planning authorities will be specially concerned can only be fully determined after careful survey of the respective districts from the social and economic standpoints, but there are obvious considerations which must merit close attention such as main road communications, the reservation of lands in connection with future water supplies; reservation of lands as sites for public buildings required in connection with the administration of public health services, and for other public purposes such as the provision of sites for aerodromes, for which municipal authorities already possess the necessary statutory powers.  The reservation of suitable sea-fronts and river parkways might also be considered. Dublin, with the rivers Liffey, Tolka, and Dodder and the two canals, has a unique opportunity for the development of river parkways. A wide radius of pleasure travel is opened up by the motor bus and motor car and it would be desirable to secure permanently for the public the facilities which exist for visiting places of natural beauty and to reserve other similar areas with proper access thereto and suitable parking accommodation.</P>
    <P>A planning authority before deciding to make a scheme should have their area carefully surveyed by experts both as to the needs of the district and the lines along which development should take place, with special reference to the sites of new roads to be constructed, open spaces to be reserved and the allocation of <Col N="2253" /> buildings for residential and industrial purposes.  Once the planning authority has passed a resolution deciding to make a scheme, all constructive and other works come under control and it is important that there should be no delay or check upon development during the period that will elapse before the scheme is confirmed and brought into force.  Control over development in the interim period is essential to planning.  The preparation of a scheme may take a considerable time, and it will be in the interests of the owners of land ripe for development and those engaged in industrial enterprises that there be no uncertainty regarding the cessation of control by any possible abandonment of the preparation of the scheme.  Provision is, therefore, made in the Bill that a resolution of the planning authority to make a scheme shall not be revoked.</P>
    <P>Under the powers contained in the Bill a planning authority may, while a scheme is in course of preparation, grant to any person applying therefor, permission for the construction, demolition or alteration of a particular structure, and they may grant on the application of some person interested, or without such application, a permission applicable to the whole of the area for the construction or alteration of buildings and other structures of a particular class or classes.  A planning authority may, therefore, take the initiative and grant where desirable the necessary permission for works to be proceeded with.  The planning authority may, where deemed necessary, prohibit the further proceeding with the construction, demolition or alteration of any particular building or other structure in the area to be planned. Where permission to carry out any work is sought from a planning authority and no decision is given within two months the permission will be deemed to have been given by the planning authority.  Appeal against the grant or refusal of a special permission or a general permission or by the making of a special prohibition will lie to the Minister who will have power to confirm, revoke, or give permission, <Col N="2254" /> or vary conditions imposed by the planning authority after due examination of all the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>When a resolution to prepare a scheme is passed the planning authority is required to proceed with all convenient speed to make a scheme. The procedure to be followed will be governed by regulations to be made under Section 18 and the first Schedule of the Bill.  It is extremely important to get the public generally to understand how the welfare of the community will be affected by the systematic regulation of the growth of a city or town and by the preservation of amenities.  The planning authority should, therefore, endeavour to secure the full co-operation of all interested parties, particularly the owners of land, those engaged in transport, in private building and in commerce and industry generally, and also organisations and agencies engaged in social welfare, education and the provision of recreational facilities.  In this way a wide circle of important interests will be enlisted and public confidence gained.</P>
    <P>A planning scheme may deal with matters relating to roads, buildings and other structures, amenities, public services, public transport and communications. The power to regulate and control the erection, alteration and use of buildings will enable planning authorities to define the space about buildings to be erected in the area and to regulate their character, height and frontage line, to limit the number of houses to the acre, and to allocate building sites for residential, commercial and industrial purposes.</P>
    <P>Every planning scheme, when made by a planning authority, must be submitted to the Minister for approval, who may either approve of the scheme without modifications or require a scheme to be modified or, if necessary, require a new scheme to be submitted.  A public local inqiry will be held in every case to ascertain fully local opinion on the provisions contained in the scheme and afford to all interests concerned an opportunity of putting <Col N="2255" /> forward any objections thereto before the scheme is confirmed.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Order approving of a planning scheme, together with the planning scheme, will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas with power to annul within three sitting weeks after the week in which the order is laid before each House or the notice of publication of the making of the Order in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, whichever is later.  The validity of a scheme or any provision contained in it may be questioned in the High Court on certain specified legal grounds.  The Bill thus affords ample protection for all interests affected by a scheme.</P>
    <P>When a planning scheme is duly confirmed and comes into force it shall be the duty of the responsible authority or responsible authorities named in the scheme to carry out and enforce generally the provisions of the scheme and to perform the duties assigned to them by the scheme.  A responsible authority may alter, demolish and, if necessary, remove any structure which contravenes any provision in a scheme.</P>
    <P>Due notice of any action taken by the responsible authority must be given in every case to the occupier of the date after which entry will be made on the lands and the powers proposed to be exercised.  An appeal will lie to the District Court.  A responsible authority cannot be assigned the duty of executing any public work, undertaking any public service, or acquiring any land unless such authority has or may procure the requisite power for the purpose under existing law.  An extended power in connection with the acquisition of land is proposed to be conferred where a planning scheme contains provisions for widening or straightening an existing road.  In such a case the responsible authority may acquire certain lands for the purpose with a view to facilitating development in harmony with the provisions of the planning scheme and also acquire any premises fronting to the road with a similar object in view.</P>
    <P>All expenses reasonably incurred by the responsible authority in securing compliance with the planning scheme are to be recoverable from the person <Col N="2256" /> or persons in default.  No expenses are recoverable where the contravention of a scheme arises out of any work done to a building or structure in accordance with a general or special permission, or by the completion of a work begun before the relevant date and still in progress on that date, and not specially prohibited by the planning authority.  In the case of a first scheme, the relevant date will as a general rule be the date of the resolution of the planning authority deciding to make the scheme.</P>
    <P>Any structure erected before the relevant date which does not conform to the provisions of the scheme may be removed by the responsible authority at their own expense.  In all cases the responsible authority will have the right to do the work themselves. Provision is made for the work being done by the owner, or occupier, but only after agreement with and to the satisfaction of the responsible authority.</P>
    <P>The provisions dealing with compensation are necessarily complicated dealing as they must with all the details and contingencies which may arise.  They can, I think, best be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I may say now, however, that it is my intention that owners of land and property shall be fairly treated and that protection should be given to all their legitimate interests.  The provisions of Part VIII of the Bill have been drafted with this object.</P>
    <P>On the other hand a responsible authority may make a claim for betterment in respect of property that is increased in value by the coming into operation of any provision in a planning scheme or by the execution by the responsible authority of any work in pursuance of any such provision in the scheme.  The amount of betterment will be calculated by reference to the value of the property at the time the application is made by the responsible authority.  The person to whom such an application for betterment is made may require the calculation of betterment to be made on the basis that the purposes for and the manner in which the property in <Col N="2257" /> respect of which betterment is claimed can lawfully be used is permanently restricted to the purpose for and the manner in which the property is being actually used at the date of the application by the responsible authority. There will be no obligation on the owner of land on which development may take place under the scheme to alter the existing use of the land, unless such use is prohibited by the scheme.  If it is being used for agricultural purposes it may continue to be so used, even if the scheme should permit of it being used for building purposes, but should the use of the land be substantially altered within a period of 14 years, or should it within the same period be sold or leased or let for a period not less than two years, the responsible authority may make a further claim for betterment if it appears that the use to which the property will be put will be increased by the operation of the planning scheme.</P>
    <P>At the time the second application for betterment is made the value of the property is then calculated as if there was no such restriction on the user of the property.  If the property is not sold or leased or its use not substantially changed within the period of 14 years the right of the responsible authority to claim betterment ceases. Therefore, as long as agricultural land continues to be used for agricultural purposes, no claim for betterment is likely to arise.  Claims for compensation and applications for betterment will be determined by arbitration at which all interests affected can attend and have their views fully represented.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in general terms with the main provisions of the Bill relating to the making and confirmation of planning schemes.  One other matter remains and that is the question of the cost of planning.  District planning authorities will be empowered to levy the necessary rate for the purpose.  In the case of a regional planning authority the expenses are to be met by the appointing bodies in such proportion as may be agreed upon, or in case of disagreement as may be determined by the Minister.  There <Col N="2258" /> are wide powers contained in the Bill for the allocation of the expenses of making a plan which relates to portion only of a county health district, while a planning scheme itself may contain provisions regulating the manner of raising any expenses of the scheme. A contribution may also be made by one planning authority to another. The expenses of the preparation and execution of a planning scheme including payment for compensation under the scheme may be met by borrowing and the repayment spread over a number of years.</P>
    <P>Each planning authority will be free to determine whether any expenditure on planning is to be incurred.  A reasoned plan of development need not place any great strain on the financial resources of a planning authority.  In every country where planning is carried out it has been found that it pays to plan.  Rectification of haphazard development in the past is always costly.  Planning will supply the corrective against a repetition of any such development in the future.  It will, moreover, go a long way to bring about those conditions which will make for social betterment and progress.  The Government is actively engaged at the present time in planning an industrial revival throughout the country and those charged with administering local government can help towards that end by the wise planning of the growth of their areas, in which suitable sites could be reserved for industrial purposes, and by providing proper sanitary services and improved housing conditions for the working-classes.</P>
    <P>I believe the Bill will give very necessary powers to local authorities for the control of the development of their areas and will enable them to plan public works ahead in a manner best suited to the public interest.  I believe, too, that the Bill will fit in with other measures promoted by the Government for the welfare of the country, and I can, therefore, confidently recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister will, no doubt, get a lot of advice and a lot of criticism as to certain shortcomings perhaps in the Bill&mdash;as to <Col N="2259" /> powers that are left untaken.  I think that the Bill, as it is put before the House, provides a very considerable amount of power and a considerable amount of useful and necessary machinery.  Town planners and town planning people have been confined to the drawing board to a very large extent, and while a considerable amount of very useful town planning work has been done in certain countries, much more has been done on the drawing board.  Recently, in Dublin, before the Royal Institute of Architects, a lecturer said that the planning that had been done in Great Britain was sufficient for the whole population of the whole of Europe. People who regard town planning in a detached way, with a drawing board before them, may feel that a very large amount of unnecessary work can be done.  Because of that, the Minister may get advice that will not be of much use to him.  Indeed it may be calculated to take him away from the practical aspect of the subject. While the Minister in this Bill takes very considerable powers for the revocation of planning schemes he takes no powers, so far as I can see, for the initiation by himself of schemes of planning in any place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say that these powers should be taken in the Bill, but I want to urge that the most useful thing that could be done now, before the Bill is passed, is that the Minister should enter into consultation with some definite local authorities, and invite them to look on the Bill and to say what they can use it for, first of all, to get rid of a certain amount of unsightliness which in recent years has grown up in certain places, to prevent it recurring; and then to take some towns of the size of Wexford or Kilkenny, that we hope are growing, and to get from these authorities some conception of the lines on which they were going to develop industrially.  I think nothing can be done until some of our local authorities, in co-operation with the Department, get down to a discussion of definite town-planning schemes.  At the beginning I think these schemes should not be ambitious.  It is only by <Col N="2260" /> the Minister encouraging local authorities to take an interest in it, it is only by local authorities getting down to schemes of a practical nature, and to works that require to be done, that there is going to be helpful public sympathy for town-planning, and any understanding of the amount of money that proper town-planning is going to save.  I do not know if the Minister has yet submitted the Bill to local authorities. If not, it would be well worth delaying the Committee Stage until he has done so, with some outline from him as to the type of problem local authorities might tackle immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that this Bill is badly needed, and is certainly overdue, but I am not so sure that it is going to bring about what the Title would seem to indicate.  While my remarks will be confined more or less to the City and County of Dublin, I have no doubt that people from other parts will find that similar difficulties have arisen there.  Looking at Dublin one asks, from the town-planning point of view, what is wrong with Dublin. Dublin is a very old city, and was at one time surrounded by walls.  Congestion that arose by reason of the walls of Dublin continued long after the walls had disappeared.  The traffic and planning problem in Dublin is complicated by the river that flows through the centre of it.  A river has to have bridges, and bridges are expensive items.  It is a law of town planning that a traffic artery is supposed to be laid on to each end of a bridge crossing a river.  Looking at Dublin from that point of view, it will be found that there is only one bridge and one street there, so that it might be said of Dublin as of Dromcollogher, &ldquo;There is only one street in Dromcollogher.&rdquo; That thoroughfare is already loaded to the point that it will not stand any more traffic.  Remember the problem that the ebb and flow of traffic across the river from one side of the city to the other creates.  Every city has its own town planning problem.  It cannot be said that as Dublin is about the same size as some other city what cured the traffic or the housing problem <Col N="2261" /> in that city will cure the problem if the same methods are adopted in Dublin.  The question is, what should be done?  In the past Dublin had some very far-sighted people, such as the Wide Streets Commissioners, who planned wisely and well.  I do not know whether it was because they went out of existence that Dublin passed through a period&mdash;I do not know whether it would be called decay or not&mdash;in which there was certainly no development of town planning.  I only hope that we are now going to enter upon a new era, in which the question will be considered in its proper relationship.</P>
      <P>Looking at the city at the present time, one asks what is the major problem.  As far as the business and manufacturing communities are concerned there is considerable congestion. Customers and traders have difficulty in getting their carriages or motor cars up to their premises.  Their vans have difficulty in getting to and fro, and workers, by reason of the badly designed traffic arteries, are looking for houses beside their work.  I am not sure if there is power in this Bill to make regulations which can be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to schemes that might be conceived on the blackboard but, when it is considered that the County Borough of Dublin and the Counties of Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow are included as one area, I am afraid by the time there is a comprehensive scheme for that area, and the cost is settled, a great many schemes might be passed over which would have gone a long way towards solving the difficulty.  There is no doubt that additional traffic arteries are required through the city, and when one looks at this Bill and asks who is responsible for initiating this, one begins to look through the Bill in vain.  If you ask yourself what happened in the past and what is happening at the present time and what is going to stop that, you look through this Bill in vain.  I should like the Minister to enlighten me if I am wrong.  Perhaps one of the worst blunders in town planning in this city <Col N="2262" /> occurred some years ago&mdash;I think about 25 years ago, or it might be 30 years ago&mdash;when the bottom of Grafton Street was rebuilt.  It was Corporation property and although there was considerable feeling that the thoroughfare&mdash;perhaps the worst bottle-neck in the city&mdash;ought to be widened, it was not carried through.  Now, I suppose, the Minister will say: &ldquo;Oh, yes, but that was 30 years ago; that was before the growth of motor-cars, and that could not occur at the present time.&rdquo; I do not know whether any body of ratepayers could appeal to the Minister at the present time.  For instance, I suppose everybody who is here present in this Dáil to-day will have headstones over them before the bottom of Grafton Street is again rebuilt, but you have only to go a few yards round the corner to see history in the process of repeating itself.  Nassau Street and Dame Street are very important thoroughfares and the connection between them, along St. Andrew Street and Trinity Street, is at present being rebuilt.  I know one body of ratepayers who are very anxious that the buildings should be set back, and I rather think that one of the prominent sites on that area is about to be occupied by the Post Office.  When this particular body of ratepayers appealed to the Corporation and appealed to the Post Office as to whether the Post Office vans left outside the Post Office would congest the thoroughfare unduly they were left in the position that they could not get any satisfactory answer. I would like to ask the Minister, if this Bill was passed, how that question would be remedied.  Could that body of ratepayers appeal to the Minister for help and guidance?</P>
    <P>To turn from the purely town-planning aspect as it affects Dublin, and to get to what is, possibly, more important, the provision of sites, what is taking place at the present time?  We have a very intensive campaign by the Government, through the Corporation, to provide housing or sites for the workers.  I should like to suggest to the Minister&mdash;and I do not know that it could be remedied under this Bill, although I see no way of remedying it <Col N="2263" /> under the existing Bill&mdash;that they have built too many house and provided too few sites.  There are two schools of thought with regard to housing for the working-classes.  When I say housing, I am not referring to houses, I am referring to sites for houses&mdash; sites as such.  One school of thought says that sites should be provided outside the city on virgin soil; that the houses will be easier to put up out there and the people can be housed more hygienically, and that if proper town planning conditions were adopted and proper traffic arteries made the workers could get much quicker to and from their work, and, in fact, that there would be very little in the contention that the workers were being housed too far from their work.  The other school of thought suggests that every ward in the city must have a housing site developed and houses for the workers erected in that area.  Now, what is the consequence of that?  The Government or the Corporation are unable to enforce their own public health by-laws because the feeling is &ldquo;where are the workers to be housed if these houses are pulled down?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another aspect of that question is that workers cannot be housed by hanging them up on hooks while houses are being built on the particular area which they inhabited.  I suggest to the Minister that under a proper town-planning scheme sufficient houses ought to be built outside in order to enable the Corporation to enforce their own by-laws.  It would produce several other beneficial effects because, when property has to be acquired in the centre of the city&mdash;possibly property that ought to have been condemned as being unfit for human habitation&mdash; there has to be a very high price paid for the acquisition of such property. There is another aspect of the question that I do not think is apparent to the ordinary person, in which certainly a great improvement could be brought about under this Bill.  Sites in the centre of the city are very difficult to obtain for manufacturing purposes. I think that everybody who has anything to do with the sale or transfer of <Col N="2264" /> property is aware that many factories and business places have been unable to acquire additional ground for the extension of their factories by reason of the fact that the sites were occupied by tenement houses, and that as there was nowhere to house their workers, there would be no chance of these houses which, in many cases, were possibly unfit to be used as tenement houses, being demolished and the extension made.  I think some of us are also aware of people who have offers for sites and who were anxious to obtain sites for the provision of houses for the working classes and were unable to obtain them.  I think, when the Government consider all these questions, they will see how closely related the Town Planning Bill is to the proper solution of housing for the working classes.  I think they would be easily convinced that they are not going to solve the housing problem on the lines along which they are proceeding at the present time, because of the delay that is occasioned by taking people from one site and having to find some alternative accommodation for them and getting the area cleared.  This Housing and Town Planning Bill, if it were properly administered and amended, points a way to accelerating the progress that ought to be made.</P>
    <P>Another question about which I am rather doubtful is the question of betterment.  We are all agreed that a property owner who suddenly receives a fabulous addition to the value of his property by reason of some improvement carried out at the expense of the community ought to contribute something, but is the Minister going the best way about it?  Theoretically, his idea is perfectly sound, but I have not been able to discover any instance of a property which was enhanced in value in respect of which the enhancement in value would not be recovered ultimately over a series of years by the increase in the valuation.  You are very anxious to get people to put up new houses and to develop property, and you have offered them remissions on the rates and all sorts of inducements to get them to rebuild.  Now you come along with this betterment <Col N="2265" /> clause which seems to me to be a clumsy way of dealing with a very few instances that will escape, owing to what I might call the flaws in the Valuation Act.  Supposing, for the sake of argument, that a sum of money is obtained from the owner or, as I should prefer to put it, from the site that has been enhanced in value. What is that to come out of?  Is the owner of that site to be allowed to deduct the interest on that sum of money as a permanent expense in calculating the profits accruing from that property?  I imagine that the Minister would do far better if he were to ascertain if there was any case that would escape increased valuation where an increase in value was brought about, and I would suggest to the Minister that that is the easiest and simplest way.  The Minister has mentioned that if a property is let for any longer period than two years&mdash;I think he said 14 years&mdash;they can come back on the people for betterment. I would suggest that that is a needless complication and might conceivably lead to people allowing property to remain undeveloped for 14 years.  Again, I should like to suggest to the Minister that an increase in the valuation of a property that had been altered or increased would, over a long series of years, bring back to the community, or ought to bring back to the community, an increase in the value that had accrued to that site. I suppose the more detailed remarks that I have made might have been kept until we had reached Committee Stage, but I should like the Minister to have an opportunity of looking into the points I have raised, so that when we come to a later stage he can consider how far some of these criticisms can be met.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister has brought in the Bill at last but I am very much afraid that there is a possibility of its becoming a dead letter.  As Deputy Mulcahy has pointed out, there is nothing very clear in the Bill as to who is to take the initiative in introducing these schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether that initiative will be used, I do not know.  One of the greatest drawbacks to democracy is its opposition to town planning so that it is generally necessary to get a dictator, or some other person, to take the responsibility of incurring the necessary unpopularity in carrying through a proper scheme of this kind. Deputy Mulcahy suggested that the Minister, before continuing with the Bill, might bring it to the attention of the local authorities and ask for their opinion on it.  I do not know how exactly that could be done.  Perhaps the Minister might be willing to submit the Bill to a Special Committee of this House, which could get into touch with the local authorities and sift their opinions and suggestions, together with the opinions and suggestions of bodies outside this House who have an interest in the objects of the Bill.  It is particularly advisable that municipal and local authorities should be consulted because of the cost that would be put on them.  At the present time, they cannot stand the great increase in the costs which they have to bear, and for that reason they should have some say in the preparing of the Bill.  In fact, the whole question of the cost of the schemes will require very careful study by the House before it is agreed to, because I think that the State will have to take more responsibility than appears in the Bill as it stands.  These matters, of course, would be matters for Committee, and I think that the best thing would be to submit the Bill to a Special Committee.  There are certain minor points such as have been drawn attention to by Deputy Dockrell. Certainly the Dublin regional planning seems to be very vast.  Towns like Arklow and Carnew, to the south of the Wicklow Mountains, and places like Nobber, in the north of County Meath, are included in the Dublin area.  They do not appear at first sight to have much connection one with another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter which I have referred to on a previous occasion in <Col N="2267" /> connection with the Land Bill.  It is the provision of municipal aerodromes and landing grounds.  I do not find anything in the Bill which in any way facilitates local authorities in providing these landing grounds under this scheme.  The Minister said, or seemed to suggest, that the municipal authorities already possessed the necessary powers to acquire and maintain land for such purposes.  I am informed by municipal authorities that they have not got such powers.  There is nothing in this Bill which gives them these powers.  In Part V of the Second Schedule there is reference to the establishment, extension or improvement of the system of public transport. I do not know that aviation could be included in such a definition as &ldquo;public transport,&rdquo; because it would be largely a question of privately-owned air-craft, and such aerodromes would not be used mainly by publicly-owned vessels.  For that reason there will be necessity for a clearer definition when the Bill goes into Committee.  I think that we would be well advised if we did not attempt to deal with this Bill across the floor of the House in general Committee of the Dáil.  I think that we should submit it to the more careful consideration of a Select or Special Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Deputies who have spoken, I welcome this Bill, and I am only sorry it was not introduced many years ago.  It is a Bill that will require a great deal of consideration. I should like to offer criticism of a few points of the Bill now.  The regional authorities which will have to administer the Bill cover too large an area.  In Section 14, the county borough of Dublin and the counties of Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow are, for the purposes of the Bill, to form collectively a planning region.  Anybody with any knowledge of planning would place that area under the control of, at least, four bodies.  I trust that before the Bill leaves the House that matter will receive consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the advantages of the Bill is that it gives greater powers to the <Col N="2268" /> local authorities.  Anybody who has had experience of local authorities knows that, in the matter of building and planning, they had very small powers.  As long as a building complied with the by-laws, the local authority had really no power over it. This Bill gives power to the local authorities, so that if monstrosities should crop up in the future as in the past we shall know that the local authority is to blame.  The power given to the local authorities is very wide.  They are to say what form a building shall take and whether or not a man shall build in a particular way.  If a man is prepared to pay for a particular form of building, it is very drastic to give the local authority power to tell that man that he shall not build in that way, but that he must build in some other way.  In that particular respect, I think that there ought to be some redress in the event of an unwise decision by a local authority.  In this country, as in some other countries, there are here and there unwise local authorities. On the average, their wisdom is very marked, but I know of one or two decisions that were anything but wise. In these cases it might be advisable to have a reference to the Minister, so that if a person feels aggrieved at the action of a local authority, he can have recourse to some superior authority and have his grievance redressed.  I hope that that matter will be adjusted on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The portion of this Bill that will give rise to the greatest amount of contention is that referred to by Deputy Dockrell&mdash;Part VIII, which deals with betterment.  Like Deputy Dockrell, I am not satisfied that the provisions set out here are the best under the circumstances.  Take a case of the betterment of property.  The man who owns that property may admit the betterment but he may not be able to derive advantage from it. It is well known that, in certain eventualities, where betterment arises, the owner cannot immediately avail of the advantages.  He cannot force a market.  He cannot sell his premises. Nevertheless, the local authority compels him to pay for the betterment. That, I think, is an unwise provision. <Col N="2269" /> I agree with Deputy Dockrell that the better way to provide for compensation for betterment to the local authority is through valuation and taxation.  If the valuation is increased, the betterment compensation will accrue gradually instead of in a lump sum.  I make these comments for the consideration of the Minister and we shall see whether we cannot advance along that line on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Town planning is a very big subject. The reason I am sorry this Bill was not brought in years ago is that there is a crying need for parking places. Business people object to having the front of their premises used for the purpose of parking.  Yet, there are no other parking places.  The streets are so lined with vehicles on both sides that you can hardly drive through them.  That is an injury that might have been righted if this Bill had been brought in some years ago.  But in any case, it is a matter from which we suffer at the present moment.  It is a grievance that would be remedied in the near future.  I hope that one of the first acts of a local authority will be to produce proper parking places for motors and to free the front of the different business premises in our city.  At this stage I do not propose to offer any further criticism of the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing it in even at this late hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst this debate was going on Deputy Good many times looked over at me expecting apparently that I was going to speak.  I think he has at the back of his head that I am opposed to town planning.  That I am opposed to town planning is right. If I had my way this Bill would get a very short shrift indeed because I do not know what town planning is. I have been listening to talks on it for 25 years but I do not know what it is.  I did not read the Bill because I trusted that the explanation that would be given to me here would be sufficient for my poor brain to grasp some intelligent meaning from it.  But I am an uncouth man, uncultured, a ward politician and a Dublin man who has no view apart from Dublin. <Col N="2270" /> Dublin is the town mentioned constantly here to-night and that is why I speak.</P>
      <P>It is certainly well over 20 years since the Dublin Corporation, of which I was a member, decided that they would try to attack the slum evil in this city.  As the Minister knows, for he was a member of the Corporation himself then, a very determined effort was made by the municipal council to do it.  We were immediately or almost immediately confronted with an agitation got up by town planning people and various literary men gave expression to the wonderful improvement that would be brought about in Dublin by town planning. Pictures were drawn of the boons and amenities that would be available for the working-classes if town planning were adopted.  What these were they did not say but the workers were promised garden cities where they could have their own orchards, two or three acres and a cow and all that business that at that time was popular in England in those days.  The working-classes were to have their own cocks and hens.  They were to have ham and eggs for breakfast and all that sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It came to pass that certain professors were brought over here from an adjoining country to instruct us as to what town planning was.  One of them came before the housing committee of the Corporation.  At any rate the result of all this was that the Corporation's efforts to deal with the slum evil were then hampered, interfered with and almost prevented.  To my mind certainly that was the result of all this talk about town planning. That was more or less the impression that was left in my mind by all that was spoken and written about it.  The Corporation appointed a committee to go over to Scotland so as to view there the wonderful improvements that these Scottish professors had brought about.  I was one of the deputation that went to Glasgow and Edinburgh in order to find out what was done by these professors in their own towns.  When we got there we were laughed at.  We were told they did nothing there, that what was done <Col N="2271" /> about town planning was done in London.</P>
    <P>In Glasgow they had a society called &ldquo;The Common Good&rdquo; Society.  That was a society that entertained visitors. As far as my experience went they did that remarkably well.  We had luncheons, excursion parties and all that sort of thing.  We had the same experience awaiting us in Edinburgh. In Edinburgh they had the &ldquo;Common Good&rdquo; Society too, but with no town planning, no garden cities and no magnificent homes for the workers. We asked the same questions in Edinburgh as we did in Glasgow.  Then in Edinburgh we met Professor Geddes and I think Professor Abercrombie. I think these were their names.  They had not done anything there.  When I saw the congestion that existed in that city I was astonished.  The modern portion of the city is beautiful but in the older portion of the city people can easily shake hands with their neighbours across the street for old lang syne's sake.  Where is the necessity in this City of Dublin for town planning?  Are not the streets, generally speaking, amply wide?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says they are not but my view is that they are wide enough, amply wide enough, and I was born and reared in Dublin.  The major reason I have for my opposition to this town planning is that I am afraid that it is going to do again what it did 20 years ago.  The slums still remain with us and now when another determined effort is being made to deal with them, we do not want this well-intentioned idea of town planning to interfere with our work again and we are not going to allow it do so if we can prevent it.  In to-day's paper you have an account of an inquiry held only yesterday by a Local Government inspector in connection with an alteration in certain sites or plots in what is called the North Lotts.  Seventeen years ago the City Council made an effort to deal with that and other areas.  They instructed their architects and engineers to prepare plans.  These plans were submitted to inquiries held by <Col N="2272" /> Local Government inspectors and they were turned down.  Now after 17 years these slums are 17 years worse than they were then and an effort is again being made to try to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know of the appalling congestion that exists at present.  From cases that have been disclosed very recently we had this confirmed.  Some time ago the City Manager put in advertisements in the city newspapers inviting applications for about 500 houses.  I think that was in March last.  These houses are ready for occupation in the Cabra district and in Clonliffe Road in the place known as Donnelly's Orchard.  To that advertisement there were responses from 11,000 families.  These have since been shifted and divided into separate areas.  I represent No. 1 area in the Dublin Corporation and this is the position&mdash;according to the answers received to this advertisement there are 169 tubercular families living in one-roomed dwellings.  There are 229 families living in one-roomed dwellings. These consist of grown-up people, young men and young women living with their fathers and mothers.  There are 1,340 other families living in one-roomed dwellings, with a number of young children varying from three to 10 or 11 years of age.  Then there are other families living in basement houses, dirty old kitchens, rat-ridden and vermin-ridden.  To all these people living under these appalling conditions the City Manager has assigned 77 houses as the proportion that ought to be allotted to them out of the houses at present ready for occupation.  Areas No. 2 and No. 3 are even worse than No. 1 area.  That is the result of the Corporation being interfered with 20 years ago by, as I said, well-intentioned people.  That is the reason I do not want any more town-planning.  If it in any way helps to do away with that appalling system of over-crowding it may be all right.  Having regard to my past experience, I do not think it is going to do so.  I am not going to vote for it.  I do not suppose I can vote against it because probably it will be accepted.  Anyway, I thought it my duty to put these figures before you. If it is going to be helpful in the direction of ridding us of the slum evil, it <Col N="2273" /> is all right.  The Minister knows as much about the slum evil as I do.  I hope he will see that this Bill is made effective in getting rid of the slums. Our humbler citizens deserve all the consideration that can be given them. The Dublin Corporation now mean, God willing, to do away with the slum problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill if it is to be operated reasonably and if it is to be operated with the thought ever present to the minds of the Government that the first desideratum is not red tape, but the getting of our people out of insanitary houses and placing them in decent accommodation.  When that problem comes to be examined the first difficulty that will arise is for the housing authorities to make up their minds whether they are going to accept what to me seems the rotten philosophy of the Viennese housing plans that have been carried through during the last ten years.  I consider that this system of taking the poor out of tenements in Lower Gardiner Street and putting them into bigger tenements in Marlborough Street is all wrong.</P>
      <P>If the evils of the slums are to be done away with, the first essential is to get our people into living accommodation where they will be able to raise a decent Christian family.  No tenement house, no matter how built, constitutes ideal surroundings for the raising of a decent Christian family. The argument will be made that there are plenty of people who could afford to live in houses but who chose to live in flats.  To my mind that argument carries no weight whatever.  I have always felt, and I believe it is a matter that ought to be examined forthwith in view of the introduction of this Bill, that the only effective way to remedy the housing problem in this country is to induce and facilitate the poor people who are at present living in slums to live on the outskirts of the city and to provide those people with decent houses and small gardens&mdash;a small garden for every individual family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware that I may be charged with a lack of orthodoxy when <Col N="2274" /> I say that I am of the opinion that no charge on the public funds should deter us from carrying that work to a successful conclusion.  I come to that conclusion for this reason, that if there were riots and revolution in this city and the people asked no more than the right to have a house in which a decent family could be brought up and the means of subsistence, there would be no man found in this country to refuse the mob either one thing or the other. When that is once established we ought to make up our minds that we are ready to do, without threats or terrorism or disorder, what we would be prepared to do if those threats, terrorism or disorder were upon us. I have adumbrated a scheme.  Some years ago I remember asking the present President of the Executive Council&mdash;he was then Deputy de Valera&mdash; to give us the benefit of his views upon a scheme for the solution of the housing problem in this and provincial cities.  I urged then that the poor should be provided with houses on the outskirts of the city and that, if necessary, free transport should be included in the amount of their rents.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the strongest opposition will come, in many cases, from the tenants of the tenement houses.  They do not want to go.  Many of them have got accustomed to living in surroundings such as obtain in Gloucester Street, Waterford Street and Gardiner Street and in other slum areas on the South side of the city. I will ask Deputies to remember that there was never any reform of a drastic character carried through that did not meet with violent opposition from the people who were going to benefit most from that reform.  I venture to recall to their memories the experience of Lord Shaftesbury when he succeeded, in the teeth of the opposition of all the great industrialists in England, in carrying through legislation which prohibited the employment of half-naked women dragging coal trucks through the mines in Northern England.  He went up to the area where this practice had been prohibited, to receive the adulation and gratitude of the women who were delivered from that slavery, and it took the militia to get him out! <Col N="2275" /> The women came out in their thousands and threatened to tear him in pieces for depriving them of their livelihood, that livelihood being to get down to a mine, strip to the waist and get harnessed with chains to a coal truck.  Lord Shaftesbury came back to London a disillusioned but not a discouraged man.  Many other great reforms in England were due to his activity, but he did not go back subsequently to receive adulation.  There is no use in imagining that if we provide decent houses on the outskirts of Dublin we should go down to the Gloucester Diamond in order to receive an ovation, because we will not get it.</P>

      <P>There is the whole hopeless argument that we have to come face to face with.  We are going to leave people in Gloucester Street, and other back streets, and plank them down under the shadow of a huge factory chimney again, and because that new building will be clean and fresh looking Deputy T. Kelly will not think what it will be like in 25 years' time.  If we are to follow a big industrial policy in this country&mdash;I do not see any sign of it yet&mdash;I have no hesitation in saying if we fail to get people out of the city we are certain to have a worse problem in 50 years' time than we have at the present moment.  If you went to America and suggested that the working classes should be housed under the shadow of their factories, they would laugh at you. The property in the neighbourhood of these factories is far too valuable, for one thing; perhaps that is why they <Col N="2276" /> move people out.  But from the point of view of the health and well-being of the people, I would not have any family housed in the shadow of a factory, because no matter what steps you take that settlement will in time degenerate into a slum.  Unless this problem is tackled with courage and vision, all this general planning and housing is going to do more damage than good.  The resources of this country are limited.  I would be prepared to strain them to the very farthest point to solve this problem, and to pledge the credit of the country to the last penny to solve this problem. It would be money well spent.  But for Heaven's sake, when we start, let us not throw the money away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are large tracts of land within a mile and a half of Nelson Pillar upon which we could plant every single individual in tenement houses to-day, and house them not two miles away from the centre of the city.  The same applies to the western side of the city. I am appalled at the possibility that while we are to pull down large blocks of tenements in the city and we are to build other blocks there, if we do that we will have in front of us, in 20 or 30 years' time, a far greater problem than we have now.  I welcome this measure, because I believe it will provide the Minister with the necessary powers.  I am glad to see that the Minister is possibly more sympathetic to my point of view than Deputy T. Kelly.  I think it is fortunate that at the moment the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is more particularly conversant with the appalling conditions under which our people in Dublin are living at the present time, than most people.  I hope he will have courage and that he will insist upon providing those people not only with roofs under which they can take shelter but with decent homes in which families can be brought up.  I consider this to be the most important social problem that our people have to face.  I believe Bolshevism and every form of abomination has had its origin and seed-bed in tenement houses.  And I say this, that if I were a man brought up in a tenement house and saw my father and mother living in a basement room, then <Col N="2277" /> if I was not a Bolshevist it would be by the grace of God.</P>

      <P>I think the people ought to realise this, and that when the necessary expenses are embarked upon, people ought to realise that the only place that Bolshevism could get an effective root in this country, and I am not sure that it has not already got root, is in the rotten houses to which our people are condemned. That, to my mind, is an important aspect of the question.  There is one other important aspect.  We have a number of great beauty spots in this country.  In England there was a similar situation.  In the most charming of these localities unscrupulous building speculators came out and built pill-boxes in those beautiful places.  In Ireland I have seen some in process of erection.  Take the case of the Vico Road!  But for the public spirit of a few people in that neighbourhood, who, out of their own pockets, bought up some ground in the Vico Road, you would have the whole of that glorious view of Dublin Bay disturbed by building speculators.  I trust the Minister will not hesitate to use the powers in this Bill to preserve areas of that kind.  I trust, on the Committee Stage, we will find that the powers he has taken in the Bill are ample to protect beauty spots of that kind.  If they are not, I trust he will accept amendments to provide him with all the powers he may require to that end.  But that is of minor significance.  The great thing in this Bill is an attempt to solve the housing problem in Dublin and provincial cities.  I welcome it because I believe it is the precursor of a really constructive effort on the lines of the British five-year plan which is proceeding at the present time.  It is, I consider, the best thing Fianna Fáil <Col N="2278" /> has done.  But my experience of Fianna Fáil has been of such a kind heretofore that hope is prone to wither in my breast.  However, I look to the Vice-President of the Executive Council to water the struggling plant and to give us the satisfaction of seeing his work develop and prosper. And I can assure him that so far as anything he may do towards the realisation and solution of the housing problem in this country is concerned he may depend upon the cordial support of everybody in this House.</P>

      <P>This debate, while not being unduly long, has covered a fairly wide field of subjects.  It developed largely into a debate on the housing problem.  I do not see why it need necessarily have developed in that direction.  Social reform, slave labour and Bolshevism, and I do not know how many other subjects, were touched upon.  It may be that the subject of town planning is one that gives the imagination something to work upon; it gives people with ideas something to talk about.  I do not object if it does stimulate people's imagination and ideas; and my hope is that out of the stimulation that has been given rise to something will come.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with a subject which is new in this country.  We have had a good deal of talk, for a number of years, on the subject of town planning but this is the first time that any effort has been made to bring the subject into the region of practicability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill that is here before us has not received much criticism.  Possibly many people in the House, like my friend Deputy Alderman Kelly, have not read it.  It is not a popular subject. I think it is a popular subject to write about, but not a popular subject to study.  However, I should like the Bill to be studied, I will not say by every member in the House because I know well that probably fifty per cent. of them will not read it, but I should like every member of the House who has any interest in the matter to take the Bill, study it seriously, and give us in amendments the benefit of his observations and criticisms.  The Bill is in no sense&mdash; and I think it is so accepted by the <Col N="2279" /> House&mdash;a party measure.  There is nothing political about it.  It is a measure brought into the House by me as the present Minister; it might have been brought in by my predecessor, because the matter has been under consideration in the Department for a long time.  I think my predecessor was interested in the subject; I am interested in the subject largely because I believe it will help to do the very thing which Deputy Alderman Kelly and Deputy Dillon suggest ought to be done, that is help to abolish the slums.  It will have, if properly used, a helpful effect in that direction.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that in the initial stages we ought not to be too ambitious.  It is a new subject.  We have not had any experience of it, and it is new to our local authorities.  The Bill in its whole nature is a permissive Bill.  I think it is wise to start in that direction rather than to bring in a Bill saying that the local authorities here, there or elsewhere must do this, that or the other thing.  If town planning is to be successful I think we must have the hearty and cordial co-operation of the local authorities in carrying it through.  If we have not got that I am afraid that town planning as a problem, like the housing problem, will be with us for a long time.  The initiative lies in all cases with the local authorities.  In regard to the cities which I know best, the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, I should personally like to take the initiative in urging bodies to make use of the powers which will be given to them when this Act is passed to get sites for housing, sites for parks, sites even for the aerodromes which Deputy Esmonde is interested in, and to get open spaces in their cities and around their cities to make them healthy and beautiful. I should certainly be glad to use my position and any authority I have to urge local authorities to take up the Act when it is passed here and use its powers for those purposes, but I think it would not be wise&mdash;at the present stage, at any rate, of the consideration of town planning&mdash;for the <Col N="2280" /> Government to bring in a measure making it obligatory on local authorities to use the powers which we intend to give them here.</P>
    <P>There are subjects, like the subject referred to by Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Good, the subject of betterment, which raise very technical matters and difficult problems, and where there are to be heavy expenses put upon the local authorities.  If there is to be a profit&mdash;a very big profit perhaps in some cases&mdash;derived out of the practical application of this measure, well, those who derive the profit ought to share with the local authorities the profit they make. There will unquestionably be difficulties in arriving at the amount of profit, and how that profit is to be divided.  We suggest a means.  I do not know whether it is the wisest or best means, but if the two Deputies who have spoken on the subject, or any other Deputies, can put up to us, by way of amendment, any other schemes for dealing with that problem we should be very glad to consider them.</P>

      <P>They will certainly have got the advantage, and I think people experienced in valuing property would be able to arrive at a figure.  The amount by which their property has increased in value&mdash;it might be by 100 per cent.; it might be by 400 per cent. &mdash;is worth so much in the market.  Any banker would advance so much upon it, not perhaps the 300 or 400 per cent. but a certain amount.  In the Bill we do not ask for the full amount.  However, that is a matter which we will, I hope, discuss in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say to Deputy Tom Kelly that I do not see any antagonism between town-planning and the housing problem.  I do not see any reason why the passing of a measure of this kind into law, and the giving of the additional powers that are proposed to local authorities to make better arrangements for wide streets, open spaces, parking places and matters of that kind, should in any way oppose or stand in the way of the quick <Col N="2281" /> dealing with the present housing problem in the City of Dublin or elsewhere. I think it ought to be a help rather than a hindrance.  If I thought it was going to be a hindrance I would not be here proposing a Bill of this kind.</P>

      <P>This Bill gives considerable additional powers to the Dublin Corporation&mdash;and every other local authority which cares to use them&mdash; for the advantage of the city, for the making of open spaces, parks, parking places, and helps them also more easily to acquire sites for housing.  I know the housing condition in the City of Dublin, which has been talked about so much this afternoon, and I know that a considerable amount has been done&mdash;particularly since this Government came into office&mdash;to speed up the provision of houses for the poorer classes, but I am sorry to say that I think there is not half enough being done even in the City of Dublin at present.  I should like to see building at least doubled in the City of Dublin and in the rural areas.  I am not at all satisfied at the rate of progress with regard to rehousing the people. If anybody has any practical suggestion to offer&mdash;I think it is out of order to discuss the matter on this particular Bill, but perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will allow me to make this remark&mdash;by which we can get a greater rate of speed we should be glad to consider it.  I do not think want of money is responsible.  No public authority in the country has yet suggested to me that the grants are inadequate.</P>

They are not as popular as are slates unquestionably but, after all, it is not necessarily a Government problem to provide slates. There is a big market for slates and where are our industrialists?  There are tons of material in the country and <Col N="2282" /> it only requires somebody with the necessary energy and money to go and dig the necessary slates out of the land.  You will pardon the digression, a Leas-Chinn Comhairle.</P>
      <P>I do not think any other point has been raised that need be dealt with now.  There is no very great hurry with regard to the Bill.  Though I should like to see it passed as soon as possible, I desire to give every member of the House an opportunity of going into it as thoroughly as his time and his knowledge will allow.  I suggest that we should not have the Committee Stage of the Bill for perhaps three weeks or a month.  Some Deputies suggested that we should submit it to the local authorities.  We have already done that.  We have sent it to the Council of Municipal Authorities, to the General Council of County Councils, to the chief public bodies of the country, to landowners' associations and to all sorts of other associations whose members' rights might be interfered with.  We have asked them for their opinions and we have not yet got any of their criticisms. That would be another reason for leaving the Committee Stage over for a long period.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to a matter that was under discussion in this House some time ago and that arises on this Resolution, that is the proposed tax on second-hand clothing.  As a result of a good deal of opinion in this House, not confined to any particular side of the House, the Minister some time ago agreed to some concessions in the matter of the importation of second-hand clothing.  I want to point out that the effect of the duties proposed to be imposed will be completely to wipe out that trade.  The amount of the duty imposed on some of the items will exceed the price at which the article is sold in the market.  A very large number of people in this country get a living out of the sale of this clothing.  It was previously pointed out, and I have even more information on that point now than I had then, that a very large number of people who engage in this business in Cork and other places are widows with <Col N="2285" /> no other means of living, or women who have to support unemployed husbands. I believe that there is a demand for this kind of clothing in the country and I suggest to the Minister that before the next stage of his proposals is reached he should consider a substantial modification of the proposed duties, or, alternatively, another method of dealing with the whole question. I want to be quite frank in this matter and to say that I believe that the Minister has met with very considerable difficulties in dealing with this problem.  There have been, I understand, attempts at evading the duty by means of certain subterfuges. I do not want to defend that here.  I would not defend it anywhere.  I want to make a plea for the people who are honestly endeavouring to make a living and who want to play the game fairly as between themselves and the State.  One suggestion of responsible, respectable and honest people engaged in this trade is that the Minister should tax second-hand clothing by weight.  That will obviate the difficulty that he has probably considered already of the reluctance of some of his officials in dealing with this class of clothing and, secondly, the other difficulties that arise in the same way. If the Minister could not sympathetically consider a proposal of that kind, at least I ask him to consider some proposal that will substantially modify the duties imposed.  The imposition of these duties means that a large number of people will simply get out of the business.  It is all very well to talk about the danger of disease arising from the second-hand clothing coming into the country.  I think that is all exaggerated and that there is really no foundation for it.  In parts of the country that I know well labourers in receipt of 7/- or 8/- per week, with food from their employers, have to return to their homes on Saturday night with only 7/- or 8/- in their pockets and very often they have a wife and three or four children depending on that 7/- or 8/-.  People in that position could not possibly afford to clothe themselves were it not for the fact that up to the present they have been able to buy second-hand clothing.  I believe we <Col N="2286" /> shall have another opportunity of dealing with this matter, but I suggest to the Minister that the representations already made to his Department in this connection should be considered and that when a further stage in the proposals is reached he should be prepared to indicate some substantial concessions in this connection.</P>

      <P>This matter has already been under discussion from one point of view, namely, the heavy burden it imposes on the very poorest of the population.  There are two matters especially that I want to refer to.  One has been referred to by Deputy Murphy from two angles.  For the moment I want the Minister to consider the effect of this tax on second-hand clothes on the poorer people in various parts of the country who cannot afford it.  I take it for granted that in this particular instance, and in the case of cotton socks, the Minister intends this to be a prohibitive tariff.  Am I correct in that?</P>

      <P>In practice, so far as cotton socks, especially children's cotton socks are concerned, it means a tremendous increase.  If the full value of the tariff is put on to cotton socks it will certainly mean a tremendous increase in price, especially of the cheapest class of cotton socks, which will be a great imposition on the very poor.  Now it may mean an increase of from 4d. for a pair of socks up to 10d. at the very least, or possibly 1/-.  The Minister says there is competition. Is the Minister prepared to make it clear that there is a supply of such cotton socks at the moment on the market for the poorer people?  It was definitely stated, in the course of the debate a short time ago, that there is no such supply available so far as the ordinary shopkeeper of this country is concerned.  Is the Minister in a position to say that there is a sufficient supply of such socks of a cheap character?  I gather that he denies my figures as regards the increase in price.  It was definitely stated in the House on the last occasion that there is not a sufficient supply available, that <Col N="2287" /> there will not be competition and that that being so, we must take it for granted that there will be an increase of more than the actual duty&mdash;an increase that will be a great deal more than the actual duty.  I think the Minister ought to consider the effect that this tax on children's cotton socks will have on very poor families, and whether he intends it or not it does seem, in this particular case, to be a prohibitive tariff.  I doubt very much whether there will be sufficient competition within the State not to prevent the full amount of the tariff being charged, and probably a great deal more as well.  I am afraid that in this particular instance the question of the clothing of the very poor has been left out of account, and that the imposition that will be put on them will be very considerable.  I doubt if the shopkeepers throughout the country will be in a position to supply to the poor people especially those socks at anything like the price that is being charged at present.  I think the Minister is not justified in putting such a tariff on the particular goods to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>The Minister does not like to expose his flank.  Fortunately, on an earlier stage he did do so. Speaking on this Financial Resolution when it was introduced, I asked the Minister if it was &ldquo;his intention to impose a duty of 6/- per dozen pairs on imported children's cotton half hose,&rdquo; and the Minister stated in reply: &ldquo;On imported hose only.&rdquo; I then asked: &ldquo;Does the Minister say that it is possible to get children's cotton socks manufactured in this country?&rdquo;  The Minister, in an indiscreet moment, answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Well, it is not.  The following evening &mdash;this is the kind of information the poor Minister appears to be getting and that I was waiting to get out of him the whole evening&mdash;the following appeared in the <i>Evening Herald:</i>&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We saw a notice in your issue of yesterday, October 2nd, stating that children's socks were not made in the Irish Free State.  This is not correct.  We have always made children's socks and ¾-hose in Balbriggan, and only this year we have brought out a large range of new numbers and we have put down additional machinery to cope with the increased trade.  We enclose you a couple of pairs of children's socks for your inspection.  When we saw the paragraph in the Report of the Dáil proceedings we wrote to Mr. Dillon, T.D., as per enclosed letter.  Yours, etc.,</P>
      <P Just="Right">Lewis Whyte,</P>
      <P Just="Right">Managing Director.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that while Lewis Whyte romped out into the open I did not bring him out.  He is rather a decent man, but he has brought this on his own shoulders.  In all my experience, and in all the Minister's experience, I do not suppose that he has ever heard of any person in trade publishing in a newspaper the details of a <Col N="2289" /> business transaction that he has had with a customer of his own firm.  That is bad enough, but where you have a gentleman who is supposed to be an authority in the hosiery trade romping into print and showing himself to be entirely ignorant of the most elementary details of the trade it is very much worse.  Now I have no doubt that the Drapers' Chamber of Trade will deal with Mr. Whyte in the proper way for his conduct.  I must say, to his credit, that I have a letter of apology from Mr. Whyte for doing what he did and explaining that he never meant the letter to be published. Mr. Whyte knows the value of publicity, and he knows the cost of advertising per half-inch in the <i>Evening Herald</i>, but he succeeded by this little <i>démarche</i> in getting nine inches on what he imagines through publicity.</P>
    <P>I raised the question of children's cotton hosiery, children's cotton socks. I want to tell the Minister and Mr. Whyte, incidentally, that he never made children's cotton socks and that he never alleged that he made children's cotton socks.  He does not make them.  Mr. Whyte went on in his letter to say that he sent me a range of samples of his products. Here is the list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you keep the samples?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I sent them back to him carriage forward.  This is a list of the commodities he had to offer, and mind you, this is for labouring people who are in the habit of getting a pair of children's socks for 4d.  The list begins at 101/- per dozen, and goes down to the modest figure of 48/- per dozen. On another page the prices range from 25/11 to 12/11 per dozen pairs.  I am discussing with the Minister cotton hose, the cost of which is 2/6 per dozen, and this is what he produces. That is the kind of information the Minister for Industry and Commerce is running a tariff policy on in this country.  Mind you, there are many phases of business that I know he knows nothing about, and that I do not expect him to know anything about, but unless I am very much wrong the <Col N="2290" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce had the distinction of belonging to a trade to which I have also belonged, the gentlemen's outfitting trade.  His name has been long and honourably known in the trade in this city, and he must know the difference between the variety of commodities to which I have referred in this debate.  I say this, that there was available to the poor of this city and the country generally children's cotton socks at 4d. and 5d. per pair for which they will now have to pay 1/- per pair.  I have known socks to be sold to the poor of this country for 3d. per pair.  These socks will now cost them 9d. or 10d. per pair, so that the woman who went out with a shilling to get four pairs of children's socks to put on her children on a Sunday morning, will now have to pay a shilling for one pair.  Take the case of the mother of a family in straitened circumstances who has been in the habit of wearing cotton hose.  She could have got a very good pair for a shilling.  I have no doubt Deputy Mrs. Concannon, with her knowledge of conditions in the City of Dublin, will be able to confirm what I said.  A woman was able to get a wearable pair for 6d.  That woman will now have to pay 1/- for a wearable pair, and 1/6 and 1/9 for a fairly good pair.  There was a type of foreign cotton underwear &mdash; perhaps the Minister has heard of it, No. 1100&mdash;which was extensively sold in this city at 1/- a garment.  There were thousands of dozens sold in Dublin to people who could not afford to pay more.  That garment will now cost 1/6 to 1/8.  It is not a question of these people going and paying something less; they will simply do without it.  They cannot afford it.  The Minister knows that.  The Minister's own experience of the trade in this city must have taught him that there are large numbers of people who cannot afford to go beyond these prices.  If prices rise above that, they have to do without.  I could go through a further list of commodities which are exclusively used by the poor of the City of Dublin and of the country, which will now be unobtainable.  To tell you the truth.  I do not know what they will <Col N="2291" /> do to get an alternative.  It is up to the Minister to say.  It is also up to the Labour Party to make up their minds whether they are going to stand for that.</P>
      <P>With regard to second-hand clothes, I raised the point mentioned by Deputy Murphy some time ago, about the danger of clothes being imported which were insufficiently disinfected. The question was fully investigated by the Department of Local Government and Public Health, by direction of the Minister, and the conclusion was that there was no reason for apprehension, that every reasonable precaution was taken and that, in fact, no evidence was forthcoming of a reliable character to confirm the suggestion that they could cause disease.  To-day the Minister stated that the tariff to be imposed now is not prohibitive.  That is absolute nonsense.  The tariff to be imposed under this Resolution wipes out that trade absolutely.  I am not so profoundly concerned as Deputy Murphy about persons engaged in the trade.  I am concerned about the people who buy the clothes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke about them, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  In the rural areas at the present time, conservatively speaking, 60 per cent. of the ready-made clothes people are buying are second-hand clothes.  An overcoat can be got at what is called a stall for 8/- or 10/-.  Anything like the same overcoat in a shop would cost from 30/- to £2 2s. 0d.  These people cannot afford to pay £2 2s. for an overcoat, because they have not got the money. From the shopkeepers' point of view this tariff will be welcome to a large number of people.  This tariff will be welcome to the ready-made clothes trade which has very largely gone from the shops.  There is some strange glut of second-hand clothes in Scotland which are sold in this country for half nothing.  I am told, although I cannot confirm the accuracy of the information, that last week a man went to Sligo to get a bale of clothes, for which he paid £28, and the customs officer demanded £129 duty, so he left it there.  Let the Minister make no <Col N="2292" /> mistake, the tariff which he proposes to impose on second-hand clothing is absolutely prohibitive.  That is bad enough from that point of view but Deputies would be amazed if they knew the quantities of ready-made clothing that go into country houses. Enormous quantities of ready-made clothes come to small farmers for their children.  When I say children, I mean growing boys and growing girls.  Duty will have to be paid on these clothes now and, of course, the country people will not pay it.  I do not think any tariff the Minister has ever proposed has less justification.  I will challenge a division on this tariff, and I hope I will have the support of Deputy Murphy.  He knows the conditions that obtain, and knows that this tariff is going to impose a real hardship on poor people.  I am sure I will have his support.  This tariff will bring home to the mind of every Deputy what unrestricted and irresponsible tariffs mean.  Tariffs can be usefully employed but, at the same time, they can do great damage.  I think this will be an object lesson to a great many people of the hardships that tariffs imprudently applied can inflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion concerning the second-hand clothing position is based, I think, upon a very definite misunderstanding.  In the first place the Deputy should take into account the fact that there is a very substantial supply of second-hand clothing in this country, that people who are engaged in the business have got in stock, and in stores here, huge quantities of second-hand clothing, which were purchased, and which cannot be disposed of because of the exceedingly dishonest tactics of those engaged in importing clothing.  The only &ldquo;poor people&rdquo; who are going to be hit by this tariff are a very small section of crooks who are at the present time exercising their ingenuity, with considerable success, in defrauding the revenue of this country, and driving honest people out of business.  A very large number of those engaged in the second-hand clothing trade, who tried to run their business honestly, have been driven out because of the activities of people engaged in importing this clothing, in <Col N="2293" /> faking invoices, and adopting various devices which have absorbed a very large part of the time and the attention of the Revenue Commissioners in checking, and which have been successful in a number of cases.  In the first place I want to emphasise that fact, that even if we stopped the importation of second-hand clothing there is still an adequate supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>For how long?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only our peculiar geographical position, being in such close proximity to another country, which has a surplus, for which there is no market in any other country, that has led to this peculiar position. There is no fear of a shortage of second-hand clothes as far as they are required.  The tariff is not prohibitive. That statement of mine is based upon the assumption that the values at which these clothes are imported represent the price paid for them, and taking that price into comparison with the price at which they are sold on the admission of the people selling them. Deputy Dillon talked about the overcoat being sold for 5/-.  The people engaged in that trade submitted various figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I said 8/- or 10/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are consigned here at 3d. and 4d.  I have an actual invoice, utilised in connection with this business, which gives women's costumes at 2d., robes at 3d. and various other garments at different prices ranging up to 6d.&mdash;obviously faked invoices.  If these people are really importing these goods at these prices and selling them at the prices which they admit, then they are making exorbitant profits, and if they are not importing them at these prices we have got to have some means of checking them and preventing them from defrauding the revenue.  If these garments are being sold at the prices which these people say they get and imported at the prices which they say they are paying for them, then the imposition of the minimum duty which we propose should not necessitate a rise in price if these people are going to be satisfied with, say, a 50 per cent. <Col N="2294" /> profit on their business; but if they are not buying them at the prices at which they say they are buying them, then there is the position in which it is our duty to intervene to prevent fraud, not merely on the revenue but on the unfortunate people who have to buy these garments.  If there are people, bona fide traders, as there are a number of them, engaged in the sale of second-hand clothing which has been patched and reconditioned throughout the country, who fear for their supplies, I refer them to the different houses in the different cities and towns where such clothing is likely to be obtainable and they will find there adequate stocks to maintain their supplies for a considerable time. I refer particularly to the South of Ireland, because definite information was given to me by pawnbrokers in Cork City, where it is no longer possible for them to make advances on second-hand clothing pledged with them because of the sheer impossibility of selling these garments afterwards in competition with the second-hand clothing coming in from Glasgow.  It all comes from Glasgow and from a very small number of firms established over here which ring the changes between themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were undoubtedly here in the City of Dublin honest firms doing the business of importing second-hand clothing and submitting genuine invoices to the Revenue Commissioners. Most of them have gone out of existence. I mentioned here when the Resolution was before us for the first time that after we reduced the duty of 25 per cent. upon second-hand clothing a meeting of these people was held in Glasgow to consider the new situation in which one foolish person suggested that they would submit honest invoices in future, and he was laughed at. There is no secret about it.  Anybody who knows anything about that trade knows that it is being conducted on these lines.  On the representations of the pawnbrokers alone, and knowing that they should be able to make advances on the clothing pledged with them and for the purpose of securing that persons engaged in this trade will engage in it in a bona fide manner, <Col N="2295" /> there is a case to be made out.  There is a case to be made on that alone, but the case is strengthened because it is necessary to impose an import duty on new clothing.  So long as we had only an ad valorem duty on clothing imported new, we could deal leisurely with the second-hand stuff, but when we have altered that by imposing a prohibitive flat rate duty on new clothing coming in from Poland, Russia and other countries, it is essential that we impose a small duty on second-hand clothing unless it is to be open to frauds of all kinds.  As a matter of fact, new clothing is coming in as second-hand clothing.  The coat of a suit comes in in one bale, the waistcoat in another and the trousers in another bale.  They are imported separately as second-hand goods and afterwards put together and sold as new.  The position is that the imposition of this minimum duty will protect the bona fide trader and secure for him the ability to continue to trade knowing that he will only pay the same duty as his competitor has to pay, no matter how clever his competitor may be or no matter what connection there is between the Saorstát importer and the Glasgow exporter.  They will all have an even break.  Supplies of second-hand clothing now available in the country will be cleared and the development of fraud will be prevented.</P>
    <P>As to Deputy Murphy's suggestion that a tax should be imposed not per garment but by weight, I can only say that the conditions under which the trade is carried on make the suggestion completely impracticable.  If garments were supplied in separate bales according to their contents, one bale, say, containing only men's overcoats and another containing only women's silk dresses or women's robes, it might be practicable, but, as it is, in one bale you get a man's overcoat and, say, a silk dress and it would be obviously unfair to levy the same duty by weight on a lady's silk dress and a man's overcoat.  A duty applied by weight could not be leviable at all. I have had the matter examined and I do not think it is practicable, nor do I think it would be right to levy the <Col N="2296" /> same rate of duty upon a second-hand suit, almost new, as would be leviable on a second-hand suit that is nearly worn out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, there are two kinds of cotton socks.  There is the fashioned sock and the seamless sock.  Up to recently only the fashioned sock was made here but now seamless socks are being made here. The position is that when machinery which is now being installed is in production we will have 1,200 dozen pairs a week of children's seamless socks being produced here at prices from 4/6 a dozen upwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that they are coming in from Japan for 2/6.  One can buy a pair of socks made in Japan for 3d. retail.  We cannot do that.  We can only do that by paying our workers the same rate of wages as is paid in Japanese hosiery factories.  I do not think anybody would contemplate that but if we are going to allow these goods to come in here in competition with the goods in our factories we can abandon the idea of manufacturing them here. These cotton socks are being produced here as cheaply as in England.  In so far as the English standard of life compares with ours, we can maintain ourselves in the hosiery trade against the English firms in respect of particular kinds of hosiery goods. In fact, production here in some lines is more efficient than in England and cheaper costs have been realised mainly due to the fact that the hosiery factories which have been <Col N="2297" /> developing here have been able to instal the very latest in machinery. No doubt, the English factories will instal the same machines and are at the present time installing them, but because of the fact that the industry here is, to a large extent, newly established, at any rate in respect of a large number of lines, the very latest in equipment and factory layout have been adopted and in certain lines a cheaper industrial cost has been secured.  I know that on the admission of directors of prominent English hosiery firms with whom I have been in conversation. In respect of the cotton socks, the price here is much the same as in Great Britain.  Seamless socks are being produced in at least two factories in the country; there are other factories producing children's socks but not necessarily all of cotton. In Balbriggan, at the present time, a new battery of machines for the production of 600,000 pairs a week of children's cotton socks is being installed.  In a factory in Cork a similar installation has in part been made, and is in part being made, to enable a similar production to take place and there is no doubt whatever that the hosiery manufacturers here are quite enterprising and will make anything for which there is a market.  They have shown no hesitation whatever to embark on any capital expenditure required for that purpose. These goods, however, can never be made here at all unless we are prepared to make up our minds that the Japanese goods which are coming in here at a very low price and disturbing not merely this but every European Government so that every European Government is taking action at present to exclude them, are kept out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, the general indication appears to be that the demand for cotton socks is falling off.  When the Japanese cotton socks came first on the market, they secured a very big sale but now traders say that there is a big falling off in the demand and, of course, that takes place particularly at this time of the year when the winter is coming on.  That is why this time of the year was chosen for the imposition <Col N="2298" /> of this duty because there is bound to be a certain dislocation of trade following it.  By the time the demand has again reached its maximum, there will be more than sufficient of these socks being produced in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All classes of hose are being produced here.  The only class of hosiery goods in respect of which there was a deficiency in production in relation to requirements was children's cotton socks and men's cotton undergarments.  The machinery for the production of these has been or is now being installed in a number of factories consequent on the imposition of this duty, and the production will meet the demand.  My reason for that statement is that I had these men in my office, and I got from them an assurance that the capital expenditure and the installation of machinery necessary to produce the full requirements would be immediately undertaken by them. They have, in fact, carried out that undertaking quite satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>Stuff is coming from the Continent occasionally at extraordinary <Col N="2299" /> prices, but it is mainly due to the disposal of surplus stocks and the getting rid of stocks of goods in lines that have been abandoned for new lines or something of that kind.  I had produced to me a lady's silk stocking with a clock down the side which is being imported here at 6/- a dozen, and it cost that to put the clock on in this country, so that obviously it was impossible for our firms to produce the goods in competition with that.  The clock has to be put on by hand.  There is no machine yet invented for doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputies can be quite satisfied that the hosiery industry in this country which is expanding very rapidly will expand to any extent necessary.  The various firms engaged <Col N="2300" /> in it have been purchasing and installing machinery at a considerable rate during the year.  To the extent to which there has been a delay in securing the full production required, it has been due to difficulties in the commercial situation and, perhaps, in some cases, to the fact that selling organisations were not properly developed or properly controlled. These are difficulties inevitable in an expanding industry and once they have been overcome, we can hope to get the entire hosiery requirements of this country supplied from our own mills and possibly, in certain circumstances, recover some of the export trade in hosiery goods which we had some years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be read a Second Time.  It is a purely formal measure.  Its object is to enable the continuance during the present financial year of the additional relief, mainly for small farmers, authorised by the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1932.  Pending maturement of proposals for the revision of the grants in aid of rates on agricultural land generally, it was decided that this special relief to the small farmers should be continued on the same basis as last year.  It is hoped in the near future to introduce legislation dealing with the general question, but it is impracticable for such legislation to operate in the present year.  This Bill provides as in last year for the allocation of £250,000 towards the relief of rates on the first £10 of the valuation of holdings of land on practically identical lines to the distribution made last year.  There is in fact only one difference, and that is in the method of distribution.  Last year owing to the advanced state of rate applotment throughout the country it was found necessary to arrange for the distribution of the special grant by the issue of credit notes to the ratepayers concerned.  This year the decision to continue the grant was taken in sufficient time to enable the apportionment in the ordinary way by abatement of the demands.</P>
      <P>Representations were received from a number of counties that the credit note system, whereby credit could only be claimed within the financial year, had proved a considerable inducement towards expediting the rate collection. It was accordingly decided to provide that local authorities might at their discretion either give the abatement right away from the deductions shown on the demand notes, or else issue the demand notes in full and on credit notes, for the abatement which, as last year, would only be valid within the present financial year.</P>
      <P>The usual provisions are also contained in the Bill to validate the necessary instructions given to local authorities for the distribution of the grant earlier in the year.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask a little information from the Minister. One would like to know something with regard to the limitation that was put on the receipt of this grant by the farmers last year under the heading of rates paid before the 31st March.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave us no figures as to the number of people who were debarred from receiving the benefits of this £250,000 through not having paid on the 31st March.  Could he, in addition, give us some facts as to whether he has received any complaints that people who did in fact pay before the 31st March and who neglected to give in their voucher when paying their rates did later on fail to receive what little relief was coming to them?  Some small farmers did not understand the matter and on presentation of these vouchers did not get the relief which was due to them. These are a few questions I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to answer.  The Parliamentary Secretary is making some small departure in the present Bill&mdash;that in future it will not be compulsory to pay before the 31st March.  Is that compulsory upon the local councils at present?  I understood the Minister to say that under the old Bill it was compulsory on the councils to have the rates paid before the 31st March or they would not get any benefit of any portion of this grant.  The House is entitled to further information as to whether the Minister is in a position to say whether people who have in fact paid before the 31st March on afterwards presenting their vouchers, found it difficult or impossible to get a refund of the amount of their vouchers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  In 1925 Deputy McGilligan when Minister for Industry and Commerce appointed a Departmental Committee on Workmen's Compensation.  The report of that Committee was published in the following year.  It reviewed very fully the law relating to workmen's compensation and made a number of recommendations for its amendment.  The Committee was re-summoned in 1929 and reconsidered certain matters referred to in the original Report. The Report of the second Committee <Col N="2305" /> was also published in that year.  The Bill now before the Dáil follows closely on the recommendations of the Departmental Committee although it departs from them in some particulars.  It is a codifying measure.  It embodies the provisions of the existing Acts which are being maintained and will in future represent the law upon workmen's compensation in this country.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will have noticed, it is a very complicated measure, but in by far the greater part its provisions are merely a re-enactment of the existing law.  I think it will suffice at this stage if I give merely a brief review of the main provisions of the existing law, the changes we propose to effect in it and to make a comparison between the provisions of the Bill and the provisions of the existing law in Great Britain which was amended since the establishment of the Saorstát.  The principal Act at present in operation is the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1906.  The amount of compensation payable under that Act to workmen who were injured in the course of their employment both fatally and non-fatally was based on the wage rates which prevailed in 1906.  Owing to the very appreciable changes in wage rates that took place during the period of the European War, an Act was passed in 1917 and another in 1919 which provided for an increase in the compensation in non-fatal cases, leaving the compensation payable in fatal cases unchanged.  The increase in the maximum compensation in non-fatal cases effected by these two Acts was to the extent of 75 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other Acts of minor consequence were passed since the principal Act, but it is not necessary to deal with them at this stage; any question arising out of them can be considered more fully on Committee Stage.  The principal Act and the amending Acts were amended and codified in Great Britain and the whole code was brought up to date both in respect of the general provisions and in respect of the amount of compensation payable to injured workmen.  No changes were made <Col N="2306" /> here, so that the law here since the establishment of the Saorstát has remained the same as it was in Great Britain at the time the Saorstát was established.  Since 1923 there has been a divergence between the law of both countries in consequence of the changes effected on the other side of the Irish Sea.  The principal matters in which changes are made by this Bill are, of course, in the amounts of compensation payable both in respect of fatal and non-fatal cases.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the War Addition Acts which increased the compensation in non-fatal cases were only of a temporary nature, but they have been continued here year after year in the Expiring Laws Bill.  They are being repealed entirely in this measure, which will be of a permanent character.  The class of persons covered by the Act of 1906 was defined in the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;Any person who has entered into or works under a contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer, whether by way of manual labour, clerical work, or otherwise, and whether the contract is expressed or implied, or is oral or in writing.&rdquo;  It did not include any person employed otherwise than by way of manual labour whose remuneration exceeded £250 a year, or any person whose employment was of a casual nature unless such person was employed for the purposes of his employer's trade or business, any member of the police force, any person engaged in out-work or any member of the employer's family dwelling in his house.</P>
    <P>The definition in the Bill before the Dáil is widened so that the exclusion of persons employed otherwise than by way of manual labour will operate only when such persons have a remuneration in excess of £350 as against £250 at the present time.  A casual worker will be brought under the provisions of the Bill but only when he is employed for the purpose of his employer's trade or business, or about the residence of his employer, or when employed for the purpose of any game and recreation, and engaged or paid through a club.  There will also be brought in certain other classes <Col N="2307" /> of workmen such as share-fishermen, crews of certain ships, etc.</P>
    <P>In the principal Act the dependants are defined as persons wholly or in part dependent on the earnings of the workman at the time of his death. The members of a family include grandparents, grandchildren, stepbrother or sister, step-son or daughter, half-brother or half-sister.  The definition of dependants is being extended so as to bring it into accord with the recommendation of the Inter-departmental Committee.</P>
    <P>The principal Act gave a statutory right of compensation to a workman who sustained injury or accident arising out of or in the course of his employment, or who contracts an industrial disease in the course of his employment. The person liable to pay compensation is in every case of accident or industrial disease the employer who, as Deputies are aware, as a general rule covers his liability by insurance. The employer was prohibited from contracting out of his liability except by way of an improved scheme under which the benefits to injured workmen could not be less favourable to the workmen or their dependants than those provided by the Act.  No portion of the compensation fell upon State funds.  Under the Act at present in operation in the Saorstát the amount of compensation payable in the case of injuries sustained by a workman resulting in his death was fixed at £150, or three years' earnings up to a maximum of £300.  The maximum compensation which will be payable under this Bill is £600 divided into two lump sums, one of which is called the adults' lump sum and the other the children's lump sum.  I will deal later in greater detail with the manner in which these sums are disposed of in various circumstances that may arise.</P>
    <P>The point to note, however, is that the position created by the introduction of the War Addition Acts is being removed, and the present maximum provision which has prevailed in this country since 1906 is being increased to the amount recommended <Col N="2308" /> by the Committee.  The Committee made recommendations as to the allocation of the amount between different classes of dependants, between adult dependants of various kinds and children of various kinds.  They appear not to have paid full attention to the fact that under their scheme it would be possible in certain cases for a payment in excess of the £600 maximum recommended by them to be made.  That error in their recommendation has been repaired.  Their recommendations have been departed from in one other respect to which I shall refer later.  There are other provisions in respect to fatal accidents such as those which provide for the deduction from the lump sum of any sum paid to the employee following the accident, and before his death. There is also provision for the calculation by the court of the degree of dependency and the allocation of compensation in accordance with the degree of dependency. If there are no dependants, under the present law there is a maximum of £10 to the person who undertook the funeral of the deceased person.  That sum is increased to £15.  Under the present law in non-fatal cases, the Act of 1906 provides for a weekly payment equivalent in amount to 50 per cent. of the average weekly earnings of the injured workman during the preceding twelve months, during the period of his incapacity.  There was a fixed maximum of £1 to the amount of compensation calculated on that basis but the War Addition Acts in 1917 and 1919 raised the maximum by 75 per cent; that is to 35/- a week.  The provisions of the Bill now before the Dáil depart from that method of calculation. Compensation will, of course, continue to be made on the basis of weekly payments based upon the pre-accident average earning of the workman.  The maximum payment is being fixed at 30/- per week but subject to that maximum the amount will be 80 per cent. of the weekly earning, where less than £1 a week, 75 per cent. in all other cases.</P>
    <P>The present position of the law in Great Britain provides for a 50 per <Col N="2309" /> cent. basis of calculation subject to a 30/- maximum.  The position will be that the payments in a case of partial injury made under this Bill, in the Saorstát, will, in all cases except the maximum cases, be slightly higher than at present is the position in Great Britain.  The present position in Great Britain has existed since 1923.  There is provision in the Bill which permits of the weekly payments being discharged by a lump sum payment, with the permission of the court, if they have continued for six months.  But if the incapacity lasts for two weeks no compensation is payable in respect to the first week.</P>
    <P>I referred to payments made in fatal cases and to the division of the total amount into two lump sums&mdash;the adults' lump sum and the children's lump sum.  The adults' lump sum is calculated at 156 times the average weekly earnings of such workman for three years subject to a minimum of £200, and a maximum of £300 and will be distributable among the adult dependants of the workman in such proportion as the court may think fit.  The amount of the children's lump sum will depend upon the number of children and the age of the children. The Bill provides that in the case of one child the payment shall be £2 1s. 8d. per month or £25 per year; in the case of two children £20 each; in the case of three children £15 each, in the case of four children £12 10s., and in the case of five children £10 per annum or £50 per annum in all.  In other words, these payments, set out in the Schedule of the Bill, in respect of each child, will be multiplied by the number of months the child has to live until it attains the age of 15 years.  One lump sum, in no case less than £200, will be paid and allocated amongst the children in proportion to ages.  Payments to a child will be made out of court at such time as the court may direct.  I mentioned the case where compensation is paid to the workman in the interval between the date of the injury and the date of death, and that it will be deducted from the compensation payable to his dependants afterwards.  Where <Col N="2310" /> the adults' lump sum and the children's sum exceeds £600 they will be reduced pro rata so that the total fixed in any case will not be more than £600.</P>
    <P>The compensation awardable to persons partially dependent upon the earnings of the deceased worker will be in proportion to the compensation that would be payable if they had been wholly dependent upon his earnings. The proportion will be determined by the court in proportion to the loss sustained by the dependants on the death of the workman.  Partial dependency is defined in the Bill: &ldquo;A person shall not for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be a partial dependant of another person unless he was dependent partially on contributions from that other person for the provision of the ordinary necessaries of life suitable for persons in his class and position.&rdquo;  I mentioned payment in fatal cases.  Where incapacity is only partial the amount of compensation is based on the difference between the pre-accident average weekly earnings and the post-accident average weekly earnings, where such difference does not exceed £1 the compensation is 80 per cent. and in all other cases 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>One recommendation of the Committee is not embodied in the Bill. That is the recommendation that the county registrar should have power to satisfy himself that the terms of an agreement between the employer and the workman were fair and equitable&mdash; that is an agreement registered with the county registrar&mdash;and that in any cases where the county registrar, or, on appeal, the judge, was satisfied that payment of a lump sum would not be to the advantage of the workman power should be given to have the lump sum allotted to the workman in such amount and at such intervals as might be considered advisable in the workman's interests.  The objection to the adoption of that recommendation was a legal one.  Under the Constitution the sole authority which may hear and determine disputes is the courts, and it was thought that it might be an infringement of the Constitution to give the registrar the powers which are vested expressly in the judge.  The Act <Col N="2311" /> also makes provision for an amendment of the law in respect of the jurisdiction of the courts.  The principle of arbitration is abandoned, and it is provided that the Circuit Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all claims for compensation arising out of the Act, with an appeal on questions of law from any decision of the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court, but subject to such appeal the decision of the Circuit Court to be final and conclusive.  The reason for making that change is that it was found in practice that practically all cases came before the Circuit Court Judge to hear them in his capacity of arbitrator.  The introduction of this legislation therefore has been availed of to enable the Circuit Court Judge to hear those cases in his capacity as judge, and to substitute that for the principle of arbitration which existed in the Workmen's Compensation Code heretofore.  The Bill provides for the registration, in a register to be kept by the county registrar, of any actual agreement in relation to compensation which may be made, and not a memorandum of such agreement as at present.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other provisions which might be more conveniently discussed in Committee.  In fact I think the whole Bill is one which lends itself to a Committee type of discussion more than to the type of discussion which we ordinarily have on Second Reading.  The various sections of it lend themselves to separate discussion, the principle of the Bill being one which of course is not merely accepted generally but has in fact been in operation for nearly 30 years in this country.  From time to time various suggestions have been made for the amendment of the law relating to workmen's compensation in a manner much more drastic than this Bill provides.  Those suggestions varied from State insurance to compulsory insurance, and various schemes of all-in insurance for workmen, associated with the Unemployment Insurance and the National Health Insurance Acts.  Whatever case can be made for the <Col N="2312" /> adoption of one or other of those measures it is obvious that it would take a considerable time to prepare and enact the necessary legislation. Certain undesirable consequences would follow from the announcement of a decision to enact legislation of that kind.  When I became Minister for Industry and Commerce I found a Bill relating to workmen's compensation in an advanced stage of preparation in the Department.  That Bill was, like the present Bill before the Dáil, based largely on the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee, although it departed from them in a number of respects, just as this Bill does.  The highly complicated and technical nature of the legislation made it desirable that we should adopt some device for improving upon the existing law in the manner recommended by the Committee which would be comparatively simple when contrasted with the changes which would have to be made if any of the more drastic schemes of reform were decided upon.  That is why the Bill before the Dáil is in form and in substance similar to the legislation which has heretofore been in operation, and that the only changes which are being made are changes of detail, changes in respect of the amount of compensation, the manner of assessing that compensation, the manner of awarding the compensation, and in the various administrative steps that have to be taken in relation to a measure of this kind.</P>
    <P>Some explanation is, of course, necessary as to the decisions which have been made, where those decisions depart from either the existing practice or the recommendations of the Committee. I take it that the principal matter which will be of interest, at this stage of the discussion, at any rate, will be the maximum amounts of compensation. In so far as we have changed the amount in relation to fatal cases we have adopted the recommendation of the Committee, and brought our law into conformity with the law which exists in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, subject only to the variation in the method of assessing and distributing the compensation <Col N="2313" /> payable in the case of children.  The present practice, of course, is that sums paid in respect of children are lodged in court, and accumulate for the benefit of the children until they come of age.  That method is not altogether suitable; in fact, the child might be in considerable hardship, might have need of the money, and unable to obtain it at some particular stage of its life. On the other hand, it would be feasible to provide that compensation would take the form of regular periodic payments in respect of the child, either to the child or to its guardian&mdash;monthly or quarterly or annual payments.  The procedure adopted in the Bill is to leave discretion in these matters to the court, so that the court can make those periodic payments in such amounts and in such manner as in its discretion seems to be best in the child's interest.</P>
    <P>In non-fatal cases, no doubt comment will be made upon the fact that the maximum payment of compensation is being reduced from 35/- to 30/-.  The present law permits of a maximum payment of 35/-, and the Inter-Departmental Committee recommended a maximum of 35/-.  Under the present law, and, of course, under the law in Great Britain, compensation is assessed by taking 50 per cent. of the earnings, subject to that maximum. We are proposing to take, where the earnings are more than £1, 75 per cent., subject to the lower maximum. A larger number of people will get the maximum payment, and, below the maximum, payment will, on the average, be larger.  Of course, at the top there will be certain workmen who in the future will get under this Bill a lower payment than they would have got under the existing law.  We must bear in mind, however, that the 35/- maximum was fixed at the period when prices and wages of all kinds were at their peak, in consequence of the disturbance in conditions produced by the war, and that the Inter-Departmental Committee which recommended the 35/- maximum met in the year 1925.  There has been a very sharp fall in the cost of living since then, and also in the general amount of remuneration of workmen of various <Col N="2314" /> kinds, with some exceptions, it is true. In Great Britain, the 35/- maximum was reduced to 30/- in 1923, and has been 30/- in Great Britain since.  We are now fixing the maximum sum as in Great Britain.  Apart from the consideration that 30/- to-day is equivalent to 35/- when that sum was fixed after the war, there is also the fact that we cannot afford to maintain in this country a standard of legislation of this kind at a higher point than the much more highly industrialised country close to us is able to maintain.</P>
    <P>In any circumstances, the enactment of this measure might possibly necessitate an increase in insurance premiums because of the increased payment now made belatedly in respect of fatal cases and because of other provisions of the measure but that increase will be off-set by the reduction in the maximum payment in non-fatal cases.  I think that in so far as the scale here will be better than the scale prevailing in Great Britain, it is not open to criticism on that score, but in any event the measure that now operates here was enacted as a temporary measure and was always regarded as such.  The difference in the method of calculation will have of course its effect on the amount awarded in particular cases so that for a number of workers, and particularly workers of the class that are remunerated on the lower scales, the amount of compensation which will be payable in future will be similar to that now prevailing and somewhat higher than that prevailing in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The various other matters dealt with in the Bill are minor matters. They are the type of provisions which suggest themselves to those who have been for a particular time associated with the administration of a measure of this kind.  I am quite willing to consider any suggestions or proposals from any part of the House in relation to them to amend the Bill, if it appears that it is capable of improvement by the adoption of any suggestion that may be made.  I do not suppose that it is a Bill that can be regarded in any sense as a controversial measure, seeing that one-half of its parentage <Col N="2315" /> rests with the Party opposite and the other half with the present Government. Even though it is not quite the child that the Party opposite left after them, it has a very strong resemblance to it and they cannot very well now disown it.  In these circumstances we can proceed to discuss it without advertence to Party differences.  I am sure that most Deputies are anxious that we should ensure that the law relating to workmen's compensation shall be put on a satisfactory basis, so that the changes, which everybody knew were coming, will be effected and that all necessary alterations in the practices of insurance companies and employers may be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>So far from repudiating, so far as I am concerned, the provisions of this Bill, I must say that I welcome the introduction of it and for two reasons.  In the first place, it codifies and therefore simplifies the existing law.  In the next place it introduces a principle about which I personally felt very keenly concerned &mdash;the increase of compensation, above all in the case of fatal accidents.  The maximum sum, as the Minister pointed out, that, under the existing law, can be received by the dependants of a workman who loses his life in the course of his employment is £300.  I remember more than one instance where, having regard to the number of dependants and the amount of wages the man was earning, that sum was wholly inadequate in the circumstances. I think that it was in 1929 I introduced a Bill containing that principle, that is to say, merely providing for an increase in the present amount of compensation in fatal cases to £600.  That was not proceeded with, because I think it was the desire of all Parties that the Bill should be withdrawn as it was proposed to have a general codifying Bill such as the present one introduced.  I reintroduced the Bill at the beginning of the present year but it was withdrawn for the same reason, that the Minister gave us an assurance that this Bill was being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to enter into any criticism of the provisions of the present <Col N="2316" /> Bill, but there is one part to which I desire to draw the Minister's attention&mdash;I think he touched upon it himself in the course of his speech&mdash; namely, Sections 49 to 51, which are the sections dealing with redemption of weekly payments by agreement, commutation agreements and agreement by way of compromise of a disputed claim.  Section 49 provides that where an agreement has been entered into between an employer and a workman as to the payment of a weekly sum, that sum may be redeemed by an agreement which is called a redemption agreement and that agreement is made effective by registration. Now, there was a similar provision in the Act of 1906, the Act on which we have been working up to the present. I noticed in reading this Bill the other night one very curious omission, that no provision was made for the case where the amount of compensation, the lump sum, was an inadequate sum.  In the Act of 1906 that provision was included.  The Minister no doubt has here in Section 55 a provision to set aside agreements of this kind within a period of six months afterwards, where they have been obtained by fraud, undue influence, or other improper means. I think it is highly essential to protect working men against another form of injustice that may be done to them.  Take a case where a man who has received serious or permanent injuries has entered into an agreement by which he is to get a weekly sum.  He is lured by the temptation perhaps to get a lump sum into his hands.  He may think it would be a great thing to get £100 or so to start a business or he may think he knows a horse that is sure to win a race and he may compromise for a sum that is wholly insufficient to compensate him for his loss.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1906 safeguarded against that danger in this way.  It provided in the Second Schedule, paragraph (9)&mdash;I shall only refer to the relevant portion of the paragraph&mdash;that where it appears to the registrar of the county court that an agreement as to the redemption of a weekly payment by a lump sum ought not to be <Col N="2317" /> registered by reason of the inadequacy of the sum or by reason of the agreement having been obtained by fraud or undue influence or other improper means&mdash;these grounds are covered here in Section 55 of the Bill but the earlier matter to which I referred, the inadequacy of the amount, is not &mdash;then the registrar is given power to refer the matter to the judge to make such order as under the circumstances he deems just.  I think that the Minister indicated that there was a constitutional difficulty about that here but I think after the recent decision in the case of Lynam v. Butler, that difficulty might be obviated.  The matter would be subject to the final decision of the judge and therefore there would be no infringement of the Constitution.  The system of delegating work to the registrar is better known in England than here for the reason that the mass of work there is so great that it would be impossible for the judges to deal with everything.  I am not saying that there is not a great pressure of work here also but you are not imposing any extra liability on our judges, if you provide in this Bill, that the Circuit Judge in every case where an agreement of this kind is made, has to be satisfied that the sum proposed to be paid is an adequate sum.  It will be a protection.  Workmen very often enter into agreements without taking advice at all.  I think it is an essential and necessary provision to put into the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter that I should like to refer to at this stage. The Minister suggested that there would be an increase in insurance premiums by reason of the Bill.  I wonder if he is sure that that is so because I might bring to the Minister's attention the fact that after the report of the 1929 Committee was produced, there was an increase in the insurance premiums for workmen's compensation in this country.  I think that increase was based on the assumption that legislation was pending which would raise the amount of the compensation.  I would suggest to the Minister that that is a matter that might be inquired into.  There is, <Col N="2318" /> perhaps, no danger of an increase in the rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that legislation designed to increase the compensation in fatal cases would no doubt have that effect, but that the other changes would offset the increase arising from that cause, or should offset it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that, in fact, by reason of the report being produced in 1929, and the assumption then on the part of the very alert gentlemen who look after workmen's compensation insurance&mdash;I think if the Minister will look into this he will find I am accurate&mdash;there was an increase at that period in the rates for workmen's compensation insurance in this country, and that that was an increase made in anticipation of legislation such as is proposed in this Bill.  These are the only points to which I wish to call attention.  I would, however, press on the Minister's attention the point I made as regards the supervision by the court of these agreements in which men agree to commute the weekly sums they are entitled to for lump sums. That is a danger that ought to be protected against.  I propose to leave the discussion of the Bill, as far as I am concerned, with that observation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>For the sake of information, I should like to know whether in a fatal or non-fatal case, where there is only an adult dependant, the Minister proposes to give £600 to the adult dependant, or is the maximum compensation in the case of an adult dependant £300, whether there are children or not.  I should also like to know does the aggregate compensation in the case of children increase with the number of children.  Is there not a danger that insurance companies will want to know what number of dependants the employees would have when accepting policies under this Bill? If that were so, would there not be a danger of giving preference in employment to single men or men with a few dependants?  Obviously the liability would be greater where the employees would be married or where they would have a number of dependants.  I must confess that I am not acquainted with the details of the Bill, but with the <Col N="2319" /> Minister's explanation of it I quite agree that it is a Bill pre-eminently for a friendly discussion and a Bill for Committee discussion rather than Second Reading discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The various matters raised can be more fully discussed in Committee.  I should just like to refer to one or two considerations, however, which I think Deputies might bear in mind.  As to the suggestion of Deputy Rice, that the county registrar should have power to refuse to register an agreement if he was satisfied that the sum payable under the agreement was unfair to the workman in the sense that it had been fixed too low and that the workman had been to some extent jockeyed out of his rights in the making of the agreement, I should like to say that we cannot altogether take responsibility from the workman to protect his rights, and, of course, in the majority of cases the workman has a trade union or society to look after his interests.  In some cases, of course, that would not be so.  At the same time, the provisions in Section 54, providing for objections to the registration of agreements in various cases, do provide a safeguard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am pointing out is that you are taking away from the workman now a protection he has under the existing law, namely, under the Act of 1906.  He has now this protection that the registrar can say: &ldquo;This is an inadequate sum.&rdquo;  You are taking that away under this Bill, and I suggest to the Minister, if he thinks there is any difficulty about allowing the registrar to deal with these matters, that it is a very simple matter to refer to the judge to see that in a case where a man is accepting a lump sum the judge will be satisfied that it is an adequate sum, having regard to the circumstances of the case.  That is a protection which he has under the existing law, and which this Bill proposes to take away from him in its present form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill in a sense puts on the workman the obligation of making an objection to the registration of an agreement if, between the making of the agreement and the notice that the agreement is to be registered, he discovers that he has been in some way deprived of his rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He has seven days from the date that notice is sent out by the registrar of the intention to register an agreement.  The agreement, if it may be so called, would have been made before that.  Of course, if in fact no agreement was made at all, that is one ground for objection and might be the more usual ground for objection, in so far as the workman would feel that he had been placed in the position of appearing to make an agreement when, in fact, he had no such intention, as might often be the case.  It seems to me that there is some necessity, perhaps, for assisting the workman to protect himself, but the main obligation must be on the workman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many cases where people are sent round to interview workmen immediately after accidents to procure a settlement and they ought to be protected against these negotiations.  The judge ought to intervene in a case where he thinks the sum inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We will consider the matter and have it again discussed on the Committee Stage.  On the points raised by Deputy Belton, the adult dependant's compensation in fatal cases is a maximum of £300 and a minimum of £200.  The total compensation is £600, but if there are no children £300 is the maximum.  If there are children, then an additional lump sum, calculated according to the Schedule to the Bill, is payable.  I think the danger the insurance companies might inquire as to the number of dependants of workmen and press employers to engage only men with few children is removed by the fact that the children's lump sum is in fact a minimum payment of £200.  There is a minimum <Col N="2321" /> payment in that case also.  That seems to ensure that that danger will not arise, because the amount to be paid will only vary by a small amount.  I think the usual practice of insurance companies is to calculate their premiums on the weekly wage bill of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the position not this: that in the case of a single man or a man who has only one adult dependant, that adult dependant would get a maximum of £300 compensation?  If there were an adult dependant and some children dependants, the maximum amount of compensation payable will be £300 to the adult and £300 to the children.  In other words in a fatal case of a married man with a family the liability on the insurance company would be twice what it would be if there was only one adult dependant. Will the insurance companies blindly accept the same rates for cases where there are a number of dependants or where there is only one adult dependant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the present position at any rate&mdash;that the amount paid depends on the number of dependants. If there are no dependants, the present law permits of a maximum payment of £10, and it would be obviously in the interests of the insurance companies that the injured workman should be a person with no dependants. At the same time, insurance companies as far as I know do not put pressure on any employer to seek out men with no dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience is that they do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the present law the total amount paid varies, within the limits fixed by the law, with the number of dependants.  It is the same in this Bill except that the limits are being extended.  Under the Bill one adult gets in any event a minimum of £200.  No matter how many adults there are there is a maximum of £300.  In the case of children there is a minimum of £200, and then there is a lump sum in accordance with the number of children in the manner set <Col N="2322" /> out in the Schedule.  If a man with dependants is killed, provided they are both adults and children, there will be a minimum payable in respect of each. If there are no children and only adults the amount will be less, and if there are no dependants at all the amount will be less still, but if there are dependants there are minimum payments which must be made.  The position in respect of children is that the amount increases with the number of children, not in proportion to the number of children but in accordance with paragraph 2 of the Second Schedule.  The Committee's recommendation was that there should be £25 a year paid in respect of one child, in respect of two children £20 a year for each child, and in respect of three children £15 a year for each child and so on up to £50 for the total number.  That is being varied somewhat in this Bill, although the general principle is being maintained. We had to vary the manner in which the Committee proposed the payments should be made.  There was in a typical case which could be contemplated the possibility of their own maximum being exceeded.  In order to ensure that that would not happen we provided for various changes.  We also put in the section which provides in all cases that where the total of two lump sums exceeds £600, each is written down pro rata so as to keep the total payment within the maximum recommended by the Committee.  The payment then in respect of each child is determined by the age of the child. It is the sum set out in the Schedule multiplied by each month which will have elapsed before that child reaches 15.  If the child is only one year the sum will be multiplied by twelve times fourteen: that is 12 months and 14 years.  If a child is 14 years the sum will be multiplied by 12.  These are all matters that we can go into fully in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like Deputies to pay particular attention to the Schedule, because it is probably the most important part of the Bill, the part that will be subject to the most meticulous examination on the part of those who will be engaged in the administration of <Col N="2323" /> the Bill&mdash;employers, insurance officials and lawyers.  It is desirable that the Bill should leave the Dáil as perfect as possible, providing as few loopholes as possible, so that the intention of the Dáil will be given full effect to.  Of course that applies to every section of the Bill, but more particularly to the Schedule.  It is difficult for people who have not got a legal training to master a Bill of this kind.  It is a very technical Bill.  In fact, I think there are people in the legal profession and also in the insurance profession who specialise in this type of legislation. No doubt this Bill will not present any difficulties to them, but to the ordinary layman it is a very technical measure. I would appeal to those who are interested in the matter to pay particular attention to the phraseology, because in a measure of this kind the phraseology is very often important. It has been found time and again that Bills which passed through a legislative assembly with the intention of effecting certain changes in the law have been found subsequently to do nothing of the kind: that the effect of the changes has turned out to be entirely different from what the Legislature intended, merely because lawyers were able to give the words in the measure a meaning which the draftsman did not intend.  I hope that will not happen in this case.</P>

      <P>The rates leviable at harbours controlled by bodies of commissioners or trustees are authorised by special Acts and Provisional Orders made from time to time in respect of these undertakings.  The number of enactments of this character is upwards of 100, dating from the year 1820 onwards, and though they do not all deal with the levying and collection of rates, most of them include provisions relating in one way or another to this particular matter.  The report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal published in 1930 made the following recommendation:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend that the present system of fixing rates by Special Act or Provisional Order should be departed from and that a simpler and more elastic system should be introduced. In our opinion the maximum rates on vessels and goods should be <Col N="2326" /> fixed by the Department of Industry and Commerce for each port, after due enquiry into the Revenue requirements of the undertaking and after hearing and considering any representations by the Authority, or by parties concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They further recommend, in paragraph 1087:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There remains the question of dealing with complaints by traders or shipowners who may consider themselves aggrieved by the rates actually charged in particular cases. The Department of Industry and Commerce should have power to deal with such complaints and, after due inquiry, to vary by order any rates charged by a Harbour Board which, in the opinion of the Department, operate unjustly or have been fixed as a result of prejudice or unfair partiality.  We look upon this power as a necessary part of the general oversight of harbour administration which we recommend should be assigned as one of the duties of the Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They recommend in paragraph 1088:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend further, that the Department should be empowered to move with a view to varying maximum rates and, in certain circumstances, to enforce the levying of actual rates without an application from an interested party.  This power would, naturally, only be used when an Authority was found unwilling to reduce charges even though the financial position permitted of this being done, or where additional Revenue was necessary in the interests of a harbour and the Authority failed either to increase rates within the statutory limits or to apply for an increase in the maximum charges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Bill gives effect to the recommendations of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal.  It will be asked why a measure of this kind is introduced prior to the introduction of the general Ports and Harbours Bill which is in course of preparation since the report of the Tribunal was published.  So far as I have been able to make any estimate, it is likely to be some considerable <Col N="2327" /> time before the general Bill can be produced.  The drafting of it is probably one of the biggest tasks undertaken, from the drafting point of view, in this State up to the present. It has occupied the entire attention of one person, with the necessary officials from my Department.  Judging by the rate of progress which has been achieved in that very difficult task, it will be some considerable time before the Bill will be produced.  In the meantime the complicated position with regard to harbour rates continues and various harbour authorities, anxious to secure powers and anxious to vary charges and rates, have been put to the cumbersome and expensive procedure of getting a Provisional Order, followed by a confirming Act.  Under these circumstances, it was decided to take these recommendations and to give effect to them in a short Bill, which would not in any way cut across or delay the introduction of the general measure, and at the same time provide means by which changes necessary in the rates of certain harbours, either on the representation of the harbour authorities, or the representation of aggrieved traders, or on the initiative of the Department of Industry and Commerce, could be made.</P>
    <P>The Bill embraces not only the harbours controlled by bodies of commissioners or trustees, but also harbours owned by railway companies, or by private individuals, as well as small piers administered by county councils. It is desirable that railway-owned harbours should not be excluded from the measure, in view of the proximity of these undertakings to the publicly-owned harbours, and of the possible reactions which might arise as the result of adjustments of rates at publicly-owned ports.  The piers controlled by county councils are not affected by the considerations which have led to the preparation of the accompanying Bill, but since the existing powers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect of the fixing of rates for such piers are obscure in certain respects, it is considered desirable that the opportunity presented by the proposed <Col N="2328" /> measure should be availed of to place the matter on a proper footing. The harbours under the control of the Commissioners for Public Works have, however, been excluded from the provisions of the measure at the request of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters to which attention should be drawn, particularly an amendment of Section 2 of the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, the effect of which is to permit of the transfer to the Department of Industry and Commerce of some or all of the powers and functions of any other Department in relation to any one or more particular harbours, docks or piers.  Under the provisions of Section 2 of the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, as they stand, it is not possible to transfer particular powers or functions, or powers or functions relative to a particular harbour, dock or pier, and the Minister for Finance has asked that this section should be amended so as to enable certain powers of his Department in relation to a particular harbour to be transferred to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, without the necessity of making a general transfer of all of his powers in relation to harbours.  The Bill can be regarded as a non-controversial measure.  It arises out of the recommendations of the tribunal, which have had, I think, general acceptance, and simplifies what is at the present time a very complicated legal position in respect of harbour rates and matters varying them.</P>

      <P>No.  At present harbour dues are fixed by a series of old statutes and by a number of orders, <Col N="2329" /> some of which have, in fact, been made by the Dáil.  Under the Bill all existing rates are maintained, but power is given harbour authorities to apply to very them, power is given to aggrieved traders to apply to the Department of Industry and Commerce to have an inquiry to vary the rates, and power is given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on his own initiative, to hold an inquiry where anomalies exist.  These are three of the things recommended by the tribunal.  The Bill provides a cheap and convenient method of effecting changes instead of the very expensive and cumbersome procedure in existence at present.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Relief of Rates on Agricultural Land.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil condemns the action of the Government in reducing the total of the grants payable for the relief of rates on agricultural land. &mdash;(Deputies Belton, O'Higgins and Minch.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>In resuming the debate on the subject matter of the motion standing in the names of Deputies Belton, O'Higgins and Minch, I acknowledge that it has dragged out at considerable length, but if it has I consider that that is a matter of necessity as it is a matter of very great concern for the farmers of the Free State.  On this question of derating it is unnecessary to go into its history, or at all events should be unnecessary. We know that at a certain period total derating was promised and there can hardly be any doubt in the minds of anybody as to what that meant. That promise was made at a particular time when it was necessary for those seeking office to try to hold out some bait to the electorate of the country.  I have a very distinct recollection of a certain proposal made here in 1931 by the Government then in office, the Cosgrave Government. That proposal was for a grant of £750,000 towards derating.  That proposal was opposed in the House by the then Opposition who are on the Government Benches now.  They maintained that it was not sufficient and that it should be £1,000,000.  It was put to a vote and the vote for £750,000 was carried.  Further than that, the goods were delivered and the farmers got the full benefit of that sum.  That sum was allocated on the basis of fifty per cent. on rates and fifty per cent. on population, and I say that it worked out very equitably in the <Col N="2331" /> sense that it brought fair play and justice to the people in congested districts where there was a large population but poor land and small valuations. I can say for my own county that it brought a reduction in the rate of 3/2 in the pound.  In the adjoining county, that can boast of good land and high valuations but with perhaps a smaller population, it brought a reduction of 2/5 in the pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could look at this matter very lightly were it not that when it was being debated here the other night I could hear Deputies on the other side of the House joking about this matter in such a callous way as to bring home to one's mind that the present position of the farmers in the Free State was a joke and nothing else.  Very few people have any doubt, or at least none should have a doubt, as to where the responsibility for the present position of the farmers lies. The consequences of the action of the present Government are now within the recollection of every member of this House and, I think, should be well within the recollection of every member of the general public.  In 1931 they wanted to insist on a million pounds for the purpose of derating. The farmers got £750,000.  In 1932 they gave an additional £250,000 and in 1933 they took away from the farmers, at a time when they were most in need of any aid that could be given to them, the sum of £448,000. That meant to the ratepayers all over the Free State an increase in the rate of 1/4 in the pound.  Apart from that, at what time were the local councils given to understand that they would have to meet this additional rate of 1/4 in the pound?  I know that in Mayo it was when they had their estimates already made out and when they were just ready to strike the rate that this bombshell was thrown into them and that they had to look for this additional 1/4.  There were complaints with regard to the attitude of the county councils in such matters.  Is it to be wondered at that there should be such complaints?  The county councils were considered then <Col N="2332" /> to be unreasonable because they resented the treatment meted out to them.  Without any indication or warning this demand was made on them for an additional 1/4 in the pound when their estimates were already made out.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister here last week that this is immaterial and, in fact, that it is infinitesimal as compared with the land annuities; but what is the position with regard to the land annuities?  They were going to collect only one-fourth of the land annuities this year, but what about how the land annuities are being paid to England?  Is there any Deputy or Minister on the other side who can deny that the land annuities and a sum of £2,000,000 in addition are being paid by the farmers?  Instead of three million odd pounds they are paying five million odd pounds.  That is their responsibility, as they say themselves, in the front line trenches.  But perhaps they will be told, and we have been told without a blush, that they are well off.  Listening to Deputy Corry last week in this House it would appear that things must be all serene with the farmers in Cork.  In fact, listening to him, one would imagine that the farmers there were in such a position now that they were inclined to get out with bands and banners to show how well off they are and how much they enjoy it.  We are told they are not paying the land annuities. Are they not paying them twice over? Of course, things will be much better in the future since the Attorney-General has embarked in the cattle trade through his agents, Patsy Killeen and John Brown.  Fourteen pounds was the price paid for these cattle and £15 duty on the other side.  What is the value of these cattle?  If 40 per cent. was the duty what is the value of the cattle?  That is all over now, but I think it is right and proper to refer to it here so that people should get a proper idea of what is happening and what treatment is being meted out to the farmers at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which perhaps it is no harm to refer.  I think it is right and proper to refer to it.  I speak for my own county.  I <Col N="2333" /> know that we are going to have sugar beet and the privilege of contributing to the expense of establishing sugar beet factories in other places. I am not trying to take a narrow view of that situation but we were told by a Deputy&mdash;and a Mayo Deputy too&mdash;that we were to have the industry established in Mayo.  These hopes are blasted but we will have the advantage of contributing to the establishment of these beet factories in other places.  I do not mind so much about that but I think that it was the Minister for Finance, in introducing his last Budget, who said when imposing a tax on tea, that it was a luxury.  In the very recent past, the President himself said &ldquo;tea is a luxury and we should not use it, but the farmers can get light beer for their breakfast.&rdquo; If that is the position and if, in military parlance, tea is to be out of bounds for the farmers in the future, what is the necessity for us to have sugar beet or to invest millions in setting up factories?  If we are not going to have tea, what do we require the sugar for?  It seems extraordinary that men occupying the positions occupied by the Minister for Finance and the President of the State should make these statements.  In face of all that, the farmers and everybody else are asked to make a contribution to the establishment of these beet factories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>It might even be muddled and it could not be more muddled than some of the statements we have heard. We have also heard with regard to the cattle trade that the English market is not worth having and that looking for the English market to-day is like a child crying for the moon.  If that is so, it is passing strange that the President should recommend that the farmers' produce should be sent into <Col N="2334" /> the British market and that they should accept £60 for every £100 worth of stuff that goes in there.  That is a tariff of 40 per cent.  I wonder where is the logic in that?  Is it not very logical, very convincing and very honest?  We are told that it is of no use to us and in the next breath, we are told that the farmers are getting bounties.  Who is getting the bounty? Let us assume for the sake of argument that the farmer is getting the bounty. Who then is paying the bounty?  Is the farmer to have his hand in his pocket for ever contributing to the payment of that bounty?  Who else is paying it?  He has contributed his share over and over again to this bounty, to this great favour, to this £1 15s. out of £6 that is being conferred on him.  We have cattle sent across with a tax of £6 per head on them and the farmer then is getting fair play! He is getting a return for everything he has.  I suppose the Minister for Agriculture has particulars now as to the areas in which 4½d. per gallon is being paid for milk.  He had not got them at his disposal last week but I take it that he will now be able to give particulars of these areas.  I think it was contended by the Minister for Lands and Fisheries that this price was being paid in 12 places.  It is really unnecessary and tantamount to a waste of time for anybody in this House to be referring to these matters at this stage at all and I am sure that in anything I am saying there is little hope of convincing Deputies on the opposite side.  That is completely out of the question and I would be a very foolish man if I tried to do anything of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the other aspects of the situation and see what the farmer is getting to-day for his sheep and for his wool, what he is getting for his potatoes.  He has oats on hand and is scarcely able to dispose of them at all to-day.  The Minister has his hands full and I sympathise with him in the circumstances.  The farmer is not able to dispose of his oats and notwithstanding this, he was told to till more.  What does this tilling more mean?  It means that the more they till the more they lose but still they are advised to <Col N="2335" /> continue.  I knew of a farmer the year before last who sold his potatoes grown the year before at £8 a ton last spring, and he sold them this year at 15d. per cwt.  Deputies can laugh and they can be as callous as possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>Let them think of the position the farmer is in.  He has practically nothing to get for everything he had to sell, and everything he has to buy from the hat on his head, to the boot on his foot is taxed.  He is paying 5/- a sack more for flour to-day than its proper price.  I say that and I know what I am talking about; as a businessman and as a farmer, I know the position of the farmer.  There is not an item which the farmer requires in respect of which he has not to pay an extra tax to-day, and not an item which he has to dispose of which has not to be disposed of at a sacrifice, and then we are told that the farmer is not badly off.  They must be indeed an extraordinary class of farmers down in Cork, judging from the very happy position they are in according to Deputy Corry.  In the other parts of the country, the farmers will give you an account of the great favours that have been conferred upon them.  You will have to face the farmers some other day, and I think you will be very slow to face them, and, in my opinion, you would be wise in not facing them in a hurry.  They will give you a very proper account of how they have benefited.  You have brought them to the verge of absolute financial ruin. About that there can be no dispute. You know it well and it is unnecessary for me or for anybody else to tell you. The farmers themselves can tell you and your own supporters can tell you, and many of them will tell it to you <Col N="2336" /> privately.  Notwithstanding all that, you laugh and scoff at the position into which you have dragged the farmer&mdash;a position which he never occupied before in my memory, at all events.  We are told that if the farmer does not pay he will not get even the six days' notice, but that the sheriff will be sent in to him.  That is very kind of you.  We have heard about the payment of rates and annuities, as if the annuities have not been paid already, and are not still being paid. They have been paid many times over to the farmers' detriment.  They adopted, foolishly for themselves, certain advice and they have to abide by the consequences.  They have my sympathy, and I hope, when the opportunity arises again, they will take better counsel, and give their verdict in such a way that it will bring home with a bang to Deputies opposite the responsibility they have had in bringing about what I might describe as the absolute ruin of the farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on a former occasion that I only hoped that Deputies opposite would try to brighten up somewhat.  I repeat that. If they tried to brighten up a little and were not overcome with tragic feelings over the death of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and the sacking of its leader, they might see some little hope, politically, even for themselves in the future.  Seeing some little hope for themselves, they might begin to realise that there is some hope for the country even from their point of view, but this policy of decrying everything round about and giving way to this feeling of despair because they are in opposition will neither help themselves nor help the country.  The motion on the Order Paper was not put down to help the farmers they talk so much about.  It is not a proposal to give anything to the farmers.  It is not a proposal to come to the relief of the farmers, to help in the agricultural or industrial sphere or to reduce taxation. It is a motion to give Deputies opposite a chance to talk, to create a political atmosphere throughout the country and to create uncertainty in both the agricultural sphere and the <Col N="2337" /> industrial sphere.  It is a carrying on of that political propaganda that was launched by Cumann na nGaedheal just before it died.  It is an attempt to carry on the play in some guise or other.  Through the medium of this motion, Deputy Belton is endeavouring to carry the Cumann na nGaedheal propaganda into the veins of the new Party and to launch the members of that Party on the country again as the saviours of the farmer.  It is hoped that by talk of this kind, and by motives of this kind the people&mdash;even those farmers associated with Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;may forget that Deputies on the other side were ten years in office and that they never said as much about the farmers in that time as they did during the three or four hours that this motion has been under discussion.  If they said as much about the farmer then as they are saying now and if they had been half as active then as they pretend they would be now if they got a chance, they might not be in Opposition to-day but here in these benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion condemns the Government. We were told that it should not have been put back as far as it was on the Order Paper, that it should be given special time.  It condemns the Government, but what has the Party opposite been doing since they came in here but condemning the Government in respect of every proposal brought in?  Could they not try some kind of helpful criticism?  Even from their point of view, there might be something good at times in measures brought forward by the Government and, by helpful criticism, they might improve the Government measures and raise their followers out of that slough of despond in which they are at present. They introduced this motion for no other reason than a political reason. They want to make the Party boundaries throughout the country wider than they are and to create Party feeling, bitterness and animosity. These were fast dying out.  They want to bring back a feeling of despair amongst the people.  That is not alone the attitude adopted by the Opposition on this motion but it was the attitude adopted on other motions.  Deputy <Col N="2338" /> Belton, when talking on this motion, said a great deal, as he always does. He talked about the farmers.  He always talks a lot about the farmers.

That would be proved very effectively if I were to go into individual cases of Deputies I have in mind who come in here and talk about themselves as farmers.  With all the nonsense he talked&mdash;amounting, I suppose, to 95 per cent. of his entire speech&mdash;Deputy Belton made one very laudable statement.  I give him credit for it and I should like to see it carried into effect.  He said that there never was a time when there was as much need for unity and co-operation amongst all political Parties and all sections of the Irish people as the present time.  That is Deputy Belton's opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall take it that Deputy Belton is the leader now.  We shall take it that this revolving bench has placed Deputy Belton at its head for the moment and that when he makes a statement of that kind he is speaking for his whole Party.  I should like to know what that Party has done, or is prepared to do now or in the future, towards putting that very laudable proposal into effect.  There never was, according to Deputy Belton, <Col N="2339" /> a time when the unity of the Irish people was more needed.  If the Irish people are to unite, whom are they to unite behind if not their elected leaders?  Whom are they to unite behind if not those to whom the vast majority of the Irish people have declared their allegiance?  Are we to scrap the elected majority and unite behind the new dictators on the plan of the man who is, at turns, the leader of the Party opposite, Mr. O'Duffy? Whom are the people to unite behind? I should like to have that question answered by the Deputies opposite.  I, for one, am prepared to meet them on that suggestion of Deputy Belton which, we are told, is the united wish of the Party opposite.  I should like to know, however, before meeting them, what is to be the basis of the unity which is to be established.  Is it to be unity behind the majority of the Irish people?  If it is, there should be no need in the future for continuing on political lines here.  There should be no need for irritating speeches on platforms by this Party, that Party and the other Party.  There should be no need for vast expense in organising Parties and decorating the members with blue shirts and berets to fight against another Party if all are to go forward as a united people to do the best for the country.  There would be no need for these things if that suggestion, made by Deputy Belton, were seriously made and accepted by the Party opposite&mdash;that is, that they stand behind the majority of the Irish people, help the Government when doing the right thing, encourage the people to follow them and, on any other issue on which they think they are not doing the right thing, to criticise them in a helpful manner, but not try to drag the people into a slough of despond, as they have been doing for the past five or six months.  I should like to eliminate everything that Deputy Belton said and to concentrate on that phrase and say: &ldquo;We are prepared to meet you on that&rdquo; and cut out all this cheap political talk that has been going on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have been out of order Deputy Belton is the last man in the House who should call me to order.  I am talking to the motion and to the statements made in connection with the motion and I think I am entitled to do so.  According to Deputy Belton's own statements, the farmers are not as badly off as other Deputies in his Party would say.  Instead of the farmers opposite and Deputy Belton proposing to reduce the farmers to the poverty line out of which we raised them, let them take a step forward now not to reduce the standard of the non-agricultural portion of the community but to raise the standard of the agricultural portion of the community. That is the essence of this motion.  It purports to leave the agricultural section in as good a position as the present Dáil found it last February. That is the purpose of Deputy Belton's motion.  Look at his statement here. He says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The proposal which creates the essence of the motion is that the farmers should be given the £450,000 that was taken from them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He is protesting against that.  Are we to take it that if they got that £450,000 now, the farmers would be quite satisfied, that they would be, as he said himself, in the same position as they were in 1931?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other speakers followed Deputy Belton, and I went carefully over their speeches because I was anxious to see if they had anything new to say, anything that one could go on definitely and say that they were in earnest in putting down a motion of this kind. We find Deputy O'Higgins speaking and he is, of course, one of the men who sponsored this motion.  Deputy O'Higgins is very much perturbed owing to the position of the farming <Col N="2341" /> community.  The farmers are very badly off.  I think if he were in earnest about all these statements he would face up to the facts much better than he tried to do when speaking on that occasion.  He told us that things are so bad that within the next two months no Government Department will be able to carry on, that the local authorities will be unable to carry on and that they will have completely broken down.  In column 2147 of the Official Debates, 4th October, the Deputy is reported as having said that secretaries and others responsible have reported to the Government Department that the country is absolutely in a state of poverty and that they cannot see their way around the next two months, that the people are in a state of bankruptcy and poverty and that two months is the longest time they can hold out.  I do not think that Deputy O'Higgins is very worried over that or that the farmers are as badly off as that.  When you consider the amount of money spent on excursion parties and paying their fares to all these meetings and in the purchase of uniforms to wear on these occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>We find that the leader of the Party opposite that evening when talking about this matter harped back of course to the economic war as they all do.  That is the whole trouble. The speeches they made before the second last general election were made by them at the last general election and the speeches made at the last general election are being made here now and throughout the country.  They go on in that way regardless of the fact that the people have completely turned them down and regardless of the fact that they are a discredited political Party.  Deputy MacDermot said that these are questions that can be settled perfectly well and perfectly honourably and with great advantage to the people of this country by making up our minds as to what we want and by going and entering into negotiations in a business-like manner.  That is Deputy MacDermot's contribution to the debate.  He was pressed several times as to how that could be done in <Col N="2342" /> an honourable way in the interests of the people of this country by settling with the British.  He did not give us any idea at all of how it could be done. When a Deputy spoke about the prosperity of the farmers in England and in the North of Ireland, which is as badly off as here, Deputy MacDermot said: &ldquo;You cannot make an end of the economic war until you put your cards on the table as regards your attitude to the whole question of constitutional relationship with Great Britain.&rdquo;  Now, that is another side of the question.  What is Deputy MacDermot prepared to do on that matter? Is he prepared to put his cards on the table on that question?  He followed that up by saying that all that was required by the British was not so much a matter of money as between this State and the British but the acceptance of the great principle of the sanctity of agreements.  Agreements with the great British Empire, which is noted for the great regard they have for the sanctity of agreements!  We are now to go on our knees to the great British Empire and say that any agreements made by anybody, whether the people here signify their will or not, were agreements that we must keep.  We must keep these sacred agreements with the British because the British always kept every agreement sacred.  They kept them sacred until they found it convenient to break them.  Deputy MacDermot followed that by saying that the Minister pointed to the bad condition of the farmers in England and Northern Ireland and added:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;When he suggests that our highest ambition would be to make the Irish farmer no worse off than the English farmers or the Northern Ireland farmers are at present he is saying something that is not so, because much more than that could be accomplished.  As I pointed out to him on a previous occasion there ought to be joint action by the farmers in the Free State, the farmers in Northern Ireland and the farmers in Great Britain by which the farmers of these islands would get protection as against the foreigner and that is what could <Col N="2343" /> have been accomplished at Ottawa, if our case had been properly fought there, and that is what will be accomplished at some time in the future when there is a Government in office here with courage and intelligence enough to make a decent trade agreement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the policy so far as the Party opposite is concerned.  They are not only going to raise the standard of living here but they are going to tackle the question in England and to make England a prosperous country. They are going to tackle the question in Northern Ireland, and every farmer in these three countries is to be brought to a very high standard of living by the Party opposite.  They are going to tackle the British Empire and Northern Ireland, as reported in column 2169 of the Official Debates for the 4th October.  That is the new Empire Party for you.  That is the statement of Deputy MacDermot, who is going to make a success of farming in England, who is going to make it a success in Northern Ireland and in the Free State.  We would like to know a little of his plans.  I think the Government are entitled to know what are his plans and how this great success is to be brought about.</P>
    <P>Is it fair on the part of Deputy MacDermot to keep all that valuable information at the back of his head?  Is it fair that these plans should be left there in cold storage until some future day?  We have this very dishonest thing of dragging in a footy little motion of this kind dealing with £450,000 all the time that that great plan is there in secret at the back of his head.  That is absolutely disgraceful and dishonest.  We found later on that a speaker in talking about that motion, Deputy McGovern from Cavan, the most popular man there according to his own statement, said that what the farmers there wanted were higher prices for their production.  They wanted better prices for cattle, pork, beef, eggs and butter.  He wants high prices for them and nothing else. He wants higher prices for cattle, pork, beef, eggs and butter.  He stated that <Col N="2344" /> the position of the farmers was that they wanted cheap foodstuffs to enable them to finish their live-stock products and to get the best price they could get for these.  The Deputy did not tell us whether they would get a big price for the finished products even if the economic war were settled.  Deputy McGovern said this: &ldquo;It is admitted that the more they produce&rdquo;&mdash;the farmers&mdash;&ldquo;the more they lose and the sooner they will be bankrupt.  I know farmers who employed labourers before the economic war started at all.  These progressive farmers could not make ends meet.&rdquo;  That is before what is alleged to be the result of Fianna Fáil policy came into operation, that is before the economic war started.  The progressive farmers were becoming bankrupt.  The Deputy's advice is to produce very little in the way of grain; till very little but rear cattle for the British market.  That sums up the attitude of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Then we have the statement of Deputy Brennan who is, I think, the first practical farmer on the Opposition Benches who has yet spoken, possibly with the exception of Deputy McGovern.  Deputy Brennan lives by farming, he confines himself to it.  His summing up of the situation is: &ldquo;We are living on a policy of subsidisation from beginning to end.  How long is it going to last?  How long can it last?&rdquo;  He protests against subsidising everything.  If the Opposition were to get into office would they stop subsidies? Do they protest against the subsidising of butter?  If they do, and if the price of butter goes back to what it is in other countries and the price to the consumer similarly goes back, what hope is there for the dairying industry?</P>
    <P>The Opposition should endeavour to speak with one voice and have some definite programme.  If it is Deputy MacDermot's programme of having an Empire Party let us have it in black and white.  As it is they do not know where they stand; they are hitting out in the dark, shadow boxing, trying by various means and in divers tongues to say everything that will catch on and become popular with the people.  Then <Col N="2345" /> they will placard themselves as the saviours of the farming community. After ten years of office they succeeded in bringing the farmers to the edge of bankruptcy.  The last speaker sneered at beet growing.  His idea of using hundreds and millions of tons of sugar was to put it into tea.  I know many people who do not use sugar at all in their tea.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the Deputy who talked about sugar if his idea is that it is only used in tea.  He sneered at the idea of money contributed by way of taxation in County Mayo going into the erection of a sugar beet factory.  When County Mayo helped to subsidise to the extent of many thousands of pounds the erection of a beet sugar factory in County Carlow, Deputy Davis did not protest. He made no protest because that was Deputy Cosgrave's factory.</P>

We have now got a sugar beet factory for the West of Ireland and if Deputy Davis and the other Mayo Deputies over there have any interest in their constitutents they will tell them to grow all the beet they can so that they will make a big profit.  Every acre of beet will be taken by the Tuam factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that in certain Cumann na nGaedheal quarters although they talk a lot about the farmers they are very definitely trying to create the atmosphere, particularly in Mayo, that beet should not be grown.  According to Deputy Belton it cannot be grown at a profit.  That type of argument is being used in order to try to dishearten the people. The same tactics were used on another occasion in regard to wheat.  Cumann na nGaedheal told the farmers that <Col N="2347" /> wheat could not be grown.  Now the farmers who grew wheat are arranging for its sale at a profitable price and the men who took the advice of Cumann na nGaedheal are scratching their heads.  The same thing can be said of the farmers whom they discouraged from growing barley.  In the circumstances I do not think that the people they are trying to discourage from growing beet will take their advice.</P>
      <P>According to Deputy Davis, County Mayo has suffered a lot.  This much can be said of the county: the people have paid their rates as well as in other years.  There are good farmers there and they are not the type of people who keep their money in the bank and will not pay their debts until the bailiff comes to the door.  There has been talk of poverty in County Mayo.  I know that there are difficulties there, not because of the present Government's policy but because emigration is not allowed as it used to be and because migration to England is not as profitable as it was. If the Deputies opposite were in power there would be in County Mayo what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney prophesied would exist under Fianna Fáil and that is dead bodies on the roadside from hunger.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's illuminating statement a few weeks ago was that in a few months President de Valera's way would be barricaded&mdash;that was not the word, but it is something like it&mdash;by the dead bodies of people who had died from hunger because of Fianna Fáil tactics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the statement made by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  I would like to put this question to Deputy Davis.  He talks about the increase of rates owing to a £250,000 reduction in the agricultural grant this <Col N="2348" /> year.  He said that amount had to be added to the rates.  I would ask him which would the people of Mayo prefer, that slight increase in their rates or the reduction of the old age pensions made by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>Would they prefer an increase of 1/4 or a reduction of 3/2? The Deputy knows little about the Mayo farmers now.  The Deputy does not pay much rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should realise that even if Fianna Fáil reduced the amount of the Agricultural Grant by £250,000, or £500,000, that for the poor and in the houses of the farming community there has been a gain of a little over £500,000 in increased pensions.  I would prefer to see an increase of 1/- in the pound in rates, which would necessitate a reduction of the Agricultural Grant by £250,000 and at the same time would give £500,000 to the aged poor.  There are moneys being distributed among the poor in many ways.  There is money given to provide the homes of the poor with fuel and to provide destitute families with more milk. There are large amounts given, at frequent periods, for the relief of unemployment and for important works in various localities.  The amount given in that way far outdistances the reduction made in the agricultural rate.  I would prefer taking an interest in the small working farmers like the Mayo farmers who are paying their rates.  I would prefer to see the moneys given in that way than given through the medium of the Agricultural Grant paid in the way the Cumann na nGaedheal Government used to pay it, where the large ranchers reaped the largest amount paid.  It is a better way of balancing the burden, with the result that, as we see, the Mayo and Galway farmers are better able to pay their rates.  There are many other matters I could deal with.  This motion in no way tends to help the farmers and it is not intended to help the farmers.  It is meant as propaganda.  It is meant to give a chance to Deputies Belton and Davis to air their views before the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton can always exaggerate so far as he himself is concerned.  We are so used to hear him that it does not matter. He exaggerates at times and I believe at times he under-estimates himself, as when he goes back to the second bench opposite.  I say there is no earnestness on the part of Deputies opposite who profess such concern for the farmers.  If there was they would tackle the good things Fianna Fáil have done for the people and they would try to make the beet, and other proposals, made by this Government, a success, and not try to smash the machinery of government by going on with this propaganda and this crying out that the country is going into bankruptcy.  That would be a better type of patriotism than the spiteful system which is adopted by Deputies opposite at the present time.  Deputy Belton should realise that what the country wants is a united front at the present time and that that would be the best thing that could happen and the best policy that could be adopted to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention at all of following the line of argument adopted by Deputy Cleary.  It is evident to anybody that Deputy Cleary knows very little about the subject under discussion because he scarcely referred to it at all.  He talked about wheat, beet and sugar, and everything, except the motion in connection <Col N="2350" /> with the problem of rates and which at the present moment raises such a very important question.  It is interesting to read some of the speeches or some of the statements made by the Fianna Fáil Party when in Opposition in 1931.  I shall read briefly one or two statements made by Fianna Fáil Deputies in 1931.  I am quoting from volume 37 of the Official Debates, column 2179.  On that occasion the President said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The position really is that while the farmer has to sell his produce at something like 15 per cent. in advance of the prices which obtained in pre-war years, he has to pay something like 68 per cent. more for the goods he buys.  Therefore, the position is telling against the farmer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the argument of Deputy de Valera, as he then was, in 1931.  It would be illuminating&mdash;but I am not much good at figures&mdash;to give the prices of agricultural produce in 1931 and compare them with what they are now.  Does any Deputy opposite tell the House that the condition of the farming industry in 1931 was anything like what it is now?  Will any Deputy opposite stand up and say that?  That was the President's contribution here in 1931 when he was asking for £1,000,000 in relief of rates.  The statements of Fianna Fáil Deputies on that occasion would be very illuminating for anyone who cares to read them.  I do not propose to read many of these statements.  Deputy Ryan, as he was then, on that occasion said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to make this point as to the necessity for relief.  As an agricultural country we are dependent greatly upon the export market for the sale of our produce and we compete there with many other countries.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what does he think about the export market now.  Has he changed his views in connection with the export market?  There is a whole lot of interesting reading in this.  I was not a member of the House on that occasion, but I well remember&mdash;and I think every farmer in the country will remember&mdash;the case which the then Fianna Fáil Party made <Col N="2351" /> on behalf of the farming community. That was in 1931.  He continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the Vote on Account last week I mentioned certain rates that are being inflicted on counties.  While the President was talking in Dunlaoghaire about the intentions of the Government in regard to derating and while other Ministers were talking about the intentions in regard to derating, Bills were brought before this Dáil which put additional rates on counties.  The consequence is that the counties are now paying at least a shilling in the £ more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on in that strain:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Formerly, if the farmers who were on the county councils found they could no longer bear the burden of the rates they could, at least, knock off that 2d. rate for the time being, but now it is mandatory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So much for Dr. Ryan in connection with those problems.  They were great advocates of the farming community in those days.  Deputy Corry had something to say on that occasion too when they were looking for a million pounds in connection with relief of rates for the farmers.  I will not go at any length through any of his statements because I do not want to delay the House.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hope the House will not approach this matter in the light of &lsquo;we are giving something for nothing to the farmers.&rsquo;  If we give him this relief we are only restoring to him a very small bit of what has been taken from him, grabbed unjustly from him, since the Dáil came into operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was Deputy Corry's contribution to the debate in 1931.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Government has this year taken £450,000, or something approaching half a million pounds off the Agricultural Grant.  Will anybody say that in this year there was a justification for that reduction in the Agricultural Grant?  Deputies have made statements here from time to time about relief in annuities and so on, and suggested that everything <Col N="2352" /> was lovely, but I cannot help referring those Deputies to the position of the farming community.  I said on many occasions, and I will repeat now, that the vast majority of the farming community depended on livestock to meet their obligations.  The dairying industry in itself was not a paying proposition except for the rearing of young stock.  Members of the Government in this House and outside it have been talking about what they have done for the dairying industry.  Even the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash;whom I admire as Minister for Industry and Commerce, but I am certain that when he talks about agriculture he is referring to something he knows very little about&mdash;said very recently in a speech down the country that only for the Government subsidies the farmers would be getting only 2d. a gallon for their milk; that butter was only 8d. per lb. in the British market.  On the very day on which he made that statement butter in the British market was from 105/- to 110/- a cwt.  If we had no economic war, and trade was going on in the ordinary way, the farmer would be getting a ½d. per lb. more for his butter, and the consumer would be paying 5d. per lb. less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has laid it down here, and I think quite rightly, that the cost of production of milk is about 5½d. per gallon.  I know something about the production of milk, and I know that the average price which I got during the last three or four months was 3¾d. a gallon.  That is what I have been getting, and I am sure it would be the average for a good many others.  That would give the farmer about 9½d. for the raw material&mdash;for as much milk as would make a pound of butter&mdash;although the consumers are paying 1/3 for it.  Even though the consumers are paying for it the farmer is not getting it.  It is immaterial to him whether the consumer pays a shilling or two shillings if he is not getting it himself.  It is the farmers themselves who have been paying the subsidy in connection with butter, and they are getting little or no benefit from the whole transaction. They are getting 9½d. for the raw <Col N="2353" /> material.  I would ask city Deputies like Deputy Kelly to realise that position. They probably think because they are paying 1/3 or 1/4 for their butter in Dublin that the farmer is getting the benefit.  He is not getting the benefit.</P>

What can the farmers produce?  Oats is practically unsaleable; wheat is not yet a product which the farmers have gone in for.  I grew wheat myself this year; I will grow it next year, but I can tell you it is very far from being a substitute for the live stock industry, which has been ruined by the policy of the present Government, and it never will be.</P>

      <P>I can tell you that I am as good a worker as anybody in this House or outside it.  I can look back and say that I have made a good living out of farming in the past.  I am unable to do it now owing to Government policy.  The demand at present on the agricultural community for rates in the county I represent is £138,000.  In 1919-20 the demand made on the agricultural community was £94,000, and in 1914 it was £54,000.  It is £138,000 now, and that at a time when the President stated that the prices which the farmer was getting were so much lower as compared with <Col N="2354" /> two years ago.  Does anybody in his senses believe that those obligations can be met by the farming community? That is the problem which is before the country.  Deputies think that the farming community can turn around and make money out of nothing.  They are now promised a beet factory.  I do not object to it in the least; I will be a grower of beet myself.  I am one of those fellows who have a try at everything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never delayed the House very long, but I would suggest that this is a very serious matter and that the debate should be conducted as befits such a serious question.  This question of the ability of the farming community to pay rates is no laughing matter at all.  The farming community are as honest and as hard-working as any other class. <Col N="2355" /> They are anxious to pay their way and to meet their obligations, if they are in a position to do it, but the economic war and the tariffs which have been imposed on their produce prevent their doing so.  I hope I shall not hear any more about what the tariffs on our agricultural exports amount to.  It was sufficient when John Brown had to pay over 100 per cent. on his few cattle. We say that not alone are the farmers paying their annuities through these tariffs, but they have paid their rates and everything else as well.  The British Government have been collecting the annuities from the Irish farmer and you are not able to prevent their doing it.  I, myself, on a certain transaction was charged £140 by the British Customs Authorities.  You were not able to stop them collecting that off me.  I say that in that respect I, and those like me, have not alone had to pay our land annuities, but we have had to pay a sufficient sum to cover our rates and everything else as well.  We cannot find the money for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One statement made by last speaker was referred to before in connection with this motion.  He states that from the particular creamery to which he is attached he is only getting 9½d. for butter fat.  That is news to me, I must say, because I spent part of my holidays this season visiting creameries in the south and I made it my business to ask, among other questions, what they were paying for butter fat.  The lowest price I heard from any creamery was 11d.  Some of them were paying 11½d. and some 1/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned 9½d.  It takes two gallons and a half of milk to make a pound of butter.  Make it out that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not take two and a half gallons to make a pound of butter. I have also noticed in this debate that farmers on the opposite benches generally commence their speeches by saying that they know all about farming. They generally challenge members on this side whether we have any farmers to compare with them.  Deputy Belton, according to himself, is the only farmer who knows anything about <Col N="2356" /> farming.  He has left the House but Deputy Curran got up to make a similar claim, that he was an adept in the business and that we could not teach him anything about farming, that he knew all about it.  The strange thing is that, while these accusations are made against members of this Party, the farmers in this Party do not appear to make any bones about paying their rates.  They appear to be able to pay their way all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Question.  I know some of them who have not paid their rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, they are not making this propaganda against the payment of rates which the Opposition Party have tried so unsuccessfully. This motion is simply asking the Dáil to censure the Government for reducing the Agricultural Grant.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking here about a week ago, asked some of the speakers on the other side to give us some indication as to how we could restore the reduction in the Agricultural Grant.  We should be very glad to have it.  The Minister pointed out on that occasion that when we try to make economies, we are opposed on every occasion by the Opposition Party.  We have never brought in a motion or a Bill since we came into office that would mean economies in any way that we were not opposed.  On the other hand, when we bring in Bills to increase expenditure in any way we are never opposed. These Bills always go through.  There is never any opposition.  The Party opposite is always prepared to support the Government in these Bills and to take any credit there is going in the country for the spending of money on extra services.  Yet they are never prepared to join the Government in making economies.  They bring in a motion censuring the Government for reducing the Agricultural Grant and when they are asked, as they were asked by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to give us some indication as to how the money can be obtained, there is no reply to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first claim made in support of this motion is that the farmer is badly off.  A considerable amount of play has <Col N="2357" /> been made with reference to speeches from this side regarding the condition of the farmers.  It has been said that we have made out that the farmer is rolling in riches, and so on.  I never heard any member on those benches make that claim.  The claim made was that the farmer was not any worse off as a result of the economic war.  We know the farmer is badly off, is probably worse off than he was two or three years ago, but what we do not agree with is the statement that that is due to the economic war.</P>

      <P>Now, we shall take Great Britain.  In Great Britain, taking the same dates, fat pigs increased from 10/- to 11/6 per score lbs., which works out at 8/3 per cwt., so that we had an advantage of 9d. per cwt. there&mdash;a slight advantage.  Of course there are big disadvantages.  Do not get alarmed that your whole case is going to be beaten.  It is not.  Porkers were 50/9 in this country on 16th September, 1931, and in 1933 they had gone down to 47/3.  We had a reduction there of 3/6.  In Great Britain porkers increased from 12/- to 12/6 per score, which is about 2/3.  Taking fat pigs and porkers together, there would be a reduction, if they were half and half, but they are not, of 2/6 per cwt. this year, as compared with 1931. Then as to eggs.  Between the 16th September, 1931, and 16th September, 1933, there was a reduction of twopence per dozen and in Great Britain a reduction of a halfpenny per dozen. We are down 1½d. per dozen there. As to farmers' butter.  In the Free State there was a reduction of ¾d. per lb., and in Great Britain a reduction of 1d. per lb.  We gained a farthing per lb. there.</P>

      <P>Fat sheep in the Free State from 1931 to 1933 went down from 37/- per cwt. to 20/- per cwt., a reduction of 17/-, which is practically a little over 50 per cent. of what they were getting then.  When we come to Great Britain what do we find?  We find that they went down from 10½d. per lb. to 8½d. per lb.  That is 18/8 per cwt., which is a worse drop than we had in sheep.  Really the farmers in Great Britain, who have no economic war, have more to complain of as regards the drop in world prices than the Free State farmers.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister for Justice to-day whether any prosecutions were pending in connection with the disturbances which took place at Tralee on October 6th, and if so whether such prosecutions would be before the Military Tribunal.  The Minister for Justice replied that sufficient evidence had not yet been accumulated to make possible the formulation of any charges, and that the Government would do their best to bring the offenders to justice.  He made no allusion to the Military Tribunal.  Now I have felt obliged to revert to the matter on the motion for the adjournment of the House this evening because the problem of intimidation which has long been a serious one throughout the country has become especially serious during the last few weeks since the formation of the United Ireland Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The occurrences at Tralee would be serious in any event.  They involved personal injury, quite severe personal injury, to General O'Duffy and to Deputy Lynch, an ex-Minister.  They involved personal injuries to other <Col N="2362" /> individuals and danger of much more severe injuries and, perhaps, death to a large number of delegates who assembled at Tralee on that occasion. But what happened at Tralee is not an isolated occurrence and must be considered in conjunction with what has been taking place elsewhere during the last few weeks.  The first outbreak of importance was in the City of Limerick some weeks ago.  On that occasion the police did their duty and, as a result of their doing their duty, I understand that there were protests afterwards against the Civic Guards in which, to their shame, certain Fianna Fáil Deputies took part.  These occurrences at Limerick were followed up by paragraphs in the official organ of the I.R.A. headed: &ldquo;No free speech for traitors&rdquo; and congratulating the persons concerned in the Limerick disturbances on their public-spirited conduct and inciting persons in Cork to do likewise.  At the meeting held by the United Ireland Party in Cork, attempts were made along similar lines, but they proved unsuccessful, and then we had these occurrences in Tralee.  Now the situation in the County Kerry seems to be especially bad because, as far as one can judge from the reports, the Civic Guards in County Kerry have been reduced to a condition almost of helplessness. On that occasion at Tralee there was a force, I understand, of somewhere about 75 Guards in the town.  It appears to me very remarkable, in view of the threatening attitude of the crowd that had collected, that General O'Duffy and his companions were permitted to walk along a narrow street&mdash;Bridge Street&mdash; with lanes leading into it, without an escort of Guards on either side of them.  They had no such escort and the result was that a number of hooligans were able to run up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and kick Deputy Lynch and deliver a number of blows on the person of General O'Duffy.  Finally, one of them hit him on the head with some sort of instrument&mdash;I understand a hammer.  Subsequent to that, when the delegates reached the hall there was stone-throwing at the hall.  A mills bomb was thrown at the sky-light and was only prevented from falling in by some wire and prevented from exploding presumably by the fact that the contents had got damaged in some way.  When the convention had concluded the delegates were unable to leave.  The Guards would not let them leave until troops arrived.  The mob who were demonstrating all the time outside, insisted that one of the delegates present at the convention was armed.  To such an extent were the Civic Guards apparently acting at the behest of the mob that, while they had failed to arrest any of the people who made these assaults, they went into the hall and brought out at the behest of the mob the delegate who was accused of carrying arms and searched him outside. It was found that he had no arms.  I think it appropriate to say at this juncture that it appears to me that the fact that, going into that hostile area (as they knew it to be), none of the people attending that convention carried arms&mdash;it is not suggested now that any of them was armed&mdash;is a tribute to the spirit in which the Young Ireland organisation is conducting its activities.  It appears to me that if ever there was an occasion on which they were likely to be tempted to break the law by carrying arms, that would be the occasion, but there is no sug gestion that they did anything of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There had been another considerably less important incident a week previously at Caherciveen where a young fellow on coming out from the Sunday evening devotions was attacked by a group of hooligans because he was an active supporter of our Party.  He escaped by getting on to a 'bus.  A friend of his ran to his assistance. Each of them got hold of a spanner out of the 'bus tool box and defended the doors of the 'bus with the spanners. <Col N="2364" /> Once again some Guards appeared on the scene.  They made no arrests among the people who were attacking these men.</P>

      <P>What they actually did, again at the behest of the attackers, was to search one of the attacked young men to see if he had any arms, and he had no arms.  And so it goes on.  <i>An Phoblacht</i> is allowed to continue to publish paragraphs on the lines I have stated: &ldquo;No free speech for traitors.&rdquo;  Yesterday at Limerick I had a minor experience of the same kind myself where after a private convention where no sort of provocation was given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, with great respect, that I am not going in any detail into what occurred in Limerick, and I was not going to mention any other places.  I submit with great respect that the object of putting the question, and raising this matter on the adjournment, was to draw the attention of the Government to the administration of justice throughout the country, and that what occurred at Tralee is not to be taken as an isolated case.  I am not trying to draw an explanation and a defence from the Government about each of the <Col N="2365" /> places where disturbances occurred.  I merely want to show that there is a danger of a general breakdown of order throughout the country.  Something very significant happened at Limerick yesterday, and it throws a strong light on what happened in Kerry, and on what may happen elsewhere. My motor car was stoned by a crowd of people who were demonstrating, generally with good-humour, shouting &ldquo;Up Dev.&rdquo; and harmless things like that.  But there were perhaps half-a-dozen youths whose faces were distorted with hatred and passion, who were obviously out for real mischief, who behaved in such a way that I consider they should have been arrested, because their conduct was calculated to provoke a breach of the peace.  However, they were not arrested.  They stoned my car and broke a window in it.  Fortunately they did no personal injury to anyone, but it was not for the want of the will to do it.  According to the newspapers to-day two of the stone-throwers were afterwards arrested and were brought to the barracks by the Guards.  A mob assembled and demonstrated outside the barracks, and a town councillor, named Angley, intervened and the men were released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Government that intimidation is going to be absolutely rampant throughout the whole country if that sort of thing goes on, that the Civic Guards cannot be expected to perform their duty, unless Superintendents everywhere are given definite instructions by the Government, that will prevent that kind of thing.  I have not brought this matter forward in order to make Party capital.  I told the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General a week ago, after our debate on the Public Safety Act, that if they could indicate to me illegalities, provocative conduct, or militarist conduct going on on our side, in any part of the country, I offered my full co-operation to stop anything of the kind.  This is a matter upon which we ought to co-operate on both sides of the House.  Something <Col N="2366" /> was said earlier in the evening, on another matter, about national unity. National unity, of course, is only possible where we can agree on a national policy.  Surely in this matter of intimidation we can all agree, if we have any decency or any sincerity in us at all.  I suggest that it is up to the Government to take this thing seriously, and to take serious steps to see that it is stopped.  Of course it is no good shutting one's eyes to the fact that it is not merely a matter of administration, that besides sound and strong administration there has to be a certain political attitude, that does not give rise to the sort of intimidation we are dealing with here.  These things spring up from irrational hatred. I could do far more to bring that home to the House if it were possible to have a cinematograph show here to reproduce the faces and the voices of the people who took the leading part in these demonstrations.  They looked as if they were on the border-line of insanity&mdash;if not over the border-line. These unfortunate people were worked up to a condition of absolute madness. I do not want to be vindictive for one minute towards these poor people, but the country cannot afford to have that sort of thing going on.  It cannot afford to have people indulging in orgies of hatred.  As long as hatred is the atmosphere in which we live, move and have our being politically, no doubt intimidation will occur, even with the best administration in the world, but I really appeal to the Minister, and to the Party opposite, in general, to discourage the sort of propaganda that makes hatred inevitable.</P>

      <P>It takes very little investigation to find out the truth.  I charge that people are being intimidated and kept away from the meetings of our Party.  I charge that definitely, and I charge that the Civic Guards have not been given such instructions &mdash;whether that is the fault of the Minister for Justice or of the Chief Commissioner, I do not know&mdash;that the protection that should be available from the Civic Guards is in fact available in an ineffective form.  I think that when the Minister for Justice stood up to-day and said that no arrests had yet been made for the appalling occurrences at Tralee and when he left us so very doubtful whether any would be made, he was confessing something absolutely disgraceful, not only to this Government but to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The question addressed to me and to which I gave a reply earlier to-day was in very explicit terms:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Justice whether it is the intention of the <Col N="2368" /> Government to bring any charges of assault, wounding, possession of arms, intimidation, unlawful assembly, conspiracy or riot in connection with the scenes at Tralee on October 6th, and to have such charges, or any of them, tried before the Military Tribunal under the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act.</P>
    <P>I informed the Deputy that inquiries into the matter were proceeding.  What fuller reply, while inquiries are still proceeding, I can give to the Deputy in the circumstances, I do not know. When those inquiries have got to the stage that I would be in a position to submit the entire matter to the Attorney-General all this question of a Military Tribunal or otherwise would then arise.  It is a matter for the Attorney-General to decide on those circumstances whether the charges, which we may be in a position to prove, are charges that fall within the Constitution Amendment Act or not. I see Deputy O'Sullivan smile.  Well, if the Deputy would care to look up the Act which he, as a member of the Government, helped to pass here he would see that there was such a thing as an appendix to that Act in which certain offences are set out and that there are a great many offences which might be committed even in Kerry which would not fall within the appendix to that particular Act.</P>
    <P>I do not dispute what Deputy MacDermot said, that extraordinary scenes did take place and extraordinary happenings occurred in Tralee on this particular day, but what I do resent is the suggestion that appears to be bandied about the House&mdash;it was a suggestion very thinly veiled, I would suggest, to-night and particularly thinly veiled in Deputy Anthony's interjections&mdash;that some sort of secret instructions have been sent out to the Guards which more or less tied their hands in the execution of their duty.</P>

When we are dealing with a situation like this and when Deputy MacDermot gets up here and points to the responsibility <Col N="2369" /> of the Government, one would expect at least that Deputies, if they think they are responsible either to themselves or to anybody else, should not be interjecting about certain matters about which they have no specific information.</P>

      <P>With regard to those incidents in Tralee, I have interviewed the Chief Superintendent in that area, and I challenge any of the Deputies of Kerry on the once Cumann na nGaedheal Benches to ascertain if the Superintendent had not and has not at all <Col N="2370" /> times received definite instructions to preserve the public peace in that area. He had no instructions, good, bad or indifferent, that would in any way curtail his activities in preserving peace and order at that meeting on 6th October, and he acted as best he could in accordance with his own best judgment in procuring the forces he considered necessary to preserve peace and order.  Any instructions he has got have been to that effect, and any instructions that any officer or member of the Civic Guards has got from my Department since I came into office or any instructions they got while my predecessor, Mr. Geoghegan, was in office were at all times to preserve the right of public speech for all political Parties in this country.  No member or officer of the Civic Guards has been interfered with in any way so far as the carrying out of instructions is concerned, or called to task afterwards for carrying out those instructions.  We have made it perfectly clear to the officers of the Guards and to the Guards as a whole that this Government is behind them and prepared to back them up fully in the carrying out of their duties to ensure the right of free speech for political Parties in this country.</P>
      <P>I cannot make to this House any more definite statement on this particular matter.  I am not in a position to deal with the Tralee business to the extent that I should deal with it if I were to give an adequate reply to Deputy MacDermot's question, for the reason, as I have already said, that inquiries are still proceeding.  The Government has the responsibility of preserving peace and order at public meetings for all political Parties.  It has also the right and the duty to prevent, so far as it can, provocative displays, and in the prevention of provocative displays and in the preservation of peace and order the Guards will continue to do their duty and will have the Government behind them.</P>
