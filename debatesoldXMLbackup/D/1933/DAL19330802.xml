      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After paragraph (3) (f) to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(g) that except under licence from the Minister, all fuel used in the company's factories shall be of Irish origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will find no difficulty about accepting this amendment. This company is going to be the spoilt darling of the Government. The State will supply the company with capital, guarantee its debentures, give it absolute power to acquire land and will increase the price of sugar for the benefit of the company. I think we may fairly ask in return that a company for which everything that can be done is being done should, in the ordinary course of its business, develop the resources of the State.  I think it important to raise this matter of fuel now in the Bill itself, and not, at a later stage, as a matter of administration, because if it is understood that it is to be the policy of the Government to secure that when possible Irish fuel shall be used in the company's factories, it is best that that should be known now before the sites of the factories are fixed. <Col N="1080" /> For example, one of the places claiming the privilege of having a factory is the town of Boyle in my constituency. It is eminently well situated for taking advantage of the fuel resources of the Arigna area.  If it is known now that as a result of the acceptance of this amendment the Government will expect, within reason, that this company should use Irish fuel that will obviously have an effect in determining the places where these factories will be put up.  I hope, as I said, at the start, that the Minister, in view of his general outlook on the question of the development of our internal resources, will make no difficulty at all about accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The only principle involved in this amendment is one which has the most sympathetic acceptance by the Government.  The question that arises is whether this is a type of thing which ought to appear in the Articles of Association of a company.  I am very doubtful as to whether, if the House did decide that a condition of this sort should be exacted by legislation, this is the particular Bill in which such a condition should appear.  It would seem to me that it ought to be, if anything, a part of a measure which would generally apply to industrial undertakings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Because this particular undertaking is not an ordinary competitive undertaking.  It is, as I said at the beginning, one of the spoilt darlings of the Government.  If the Minister dislikes such a condition being put into the Articles of Association, I have no objection to the matter being dealt with by putting a new section into the Bill itself, instead of putting in an addition to the Schedule.  But one way or another the thing is perfectly practical if the Minister wishes to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter may be perfectly practical, but whether a proviso of this sort should be inserted in an Act of the Oireachtas is another <Col N="1081" /> matter.  I take it that, as the Minister will have power of appointment of the board of directors of the company, and as they will be very largely administering public funds, they will endeavour to conform in that administration to the general policy of the Government with regard to Irish industries, and particularly in regard to Irish fuel; that they will have regard to the considerations which have moved the Deputy to put down this amendment, when they were considering, first of all, the sites; secondly, the type of furnace which is to be installed in the factory; and thirdly, the amount of local employment which would be given indirectly by the establishment of the sugar beet factory.  For that reason, I would suggest to the Deputy that the amendment is unnecessary.  I think it would look out of place in the Articles of Association.  I think a Bill of this nature is not the proper instrument in which to impose this condition upon any industrial undertaking, and particularly upon industrial undertakings which are established under Government auspices, because in connection with those undertakings there is less fear than there is in the case of concerns which are privately owned and managed that the considerations which have moved the Deputy to put down this amendment would be disregarded.</P>
      <P>Once again I should like to emphasise that in considering the situation in which these beet factories will be placed one very important consideration will be that there should be native fuel supplies in the vicinity, but it cannot be an overriding factor. I think the Deputy will agree that it should not be an overriding factor. It will be a consideration to which due weight will be given by the technical adviser who will select those sites on behalf of the Government.  I, therefore, suggest that the Deputy should not press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I seem to have entirely misunderstood the situation if what the Minister has said is true. He talks of the technical adviser selecting the sites on behalf of the Government.  From the beginning to the end of the Bill I have understood <Col N="1082" /> that the sites would not be selected by the authority of the Government at all; that they were to be selected by a committee of experts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the company, not on behalf of the Government.  What would they care about Irish fuel?  Nothing at all. Quite possibly they would actually select sites away from Irish fuel districts, because they would know that if there were Irish fuel in the vicinity public opinion would force them to use it; that they would be more independent if the sites were not near Irish fuel districts.  It seems to me that when the Minister says no such condition as this should be imposed on an industrial company he is, in the words of his colleague, taking the accountant's point of view; he is not looking at the men and women behind this problem. Here is his chance to show he has a heart, and, apart from showing he has a heart, to show that he has a head.  Unless this condition with regard to fuel is adopted in the Bill, in time for those experts to see what is expected of them, I maintain that the chances of Irish fuel resources receiving any development as a result of this company's activities are extremely small.  I certainly intend to press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in possession of any information from the experts regarding this matter?  Has it been put to them?  Has he any information in regard to the use of Irish coal in the Carlow factory?  Will furnaces suitable for the use of Irish coal be installed?  If not, obviously the directors will be almost compelled to use other fuel.  If there are furnaces installed in which the experts advise it is possible to burn Irish fuel, then a different situation arises.  From what the Minister has said I did not gather that he had examined the experts on the subject.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies I should like to say that I think the amendment is a little bit indefinite <Col N="1083" /> with regard to fuel.  I should like to ask Deputy MacDermot what he means by fuel.  Is the fuel used in a sugar factory necessarily coal? We have heard a great deal in this House about the possibilities of peat. There is also oil fuel.  What does the Deputy mean by fuel?  I should also like if the Minister would give us some idea as to the quantity of fuel used in the manufacture of sugar.  I believe that at the present time there is nothing used but coal, and I should like to know how much coal is used per ton of sugar produced.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Deputy has any business experience.  I gather that he has not.  If he had, I am quite certain he would not have put down this amendment.  The Deputy asks that the company should be compelled by legislation to use Irish fuel. From his remarks I gathered that he had coal mainly in mind.  He is concerned to ensure that the factory must be located adjacent to the coal mines. As the Minister for Finance has said, the availability of Irish coal or other suitable fuel will be a factor taken into account in determining the sites of the factories.  I should like the Deputy to consider the position of the company if his amendment placing on them a statutory obligation to use Irish fuel were carried, and the Government were unable to guarantee a supply of Irish fuel, or unable to guarantee it at a price which would be regarded as reasonable.</P>

      <P>The mere insertion of this phrase in the Articles of Association does not give the Minister power to prevent the company from getting other fuel.  The Deputy must consider this as a practical proposition. If it is intended as a demonstration in favour of his own constituency we will <Col N="1084" /> leave it at that.  If it is intended as a serious contribution towards the establishment of those factories it does not count for much, because it obviously shows lack of consideration.  At the present time the Carlow factory is using Irish coal to a large extent.  The experiment which the Carlow factory embarked upon involved certain capital expenditure in the alteration of its boilers.  It appears to have been quite successful, but I cannot say that with absolute certainty, because no reports on the experiments have reached me.  The fuel which the Carlow factory is using is of a low grade quality which was formerly regarded as unsuitable for the firing of boilers.  From the information which is available it would appear that it is being used successfully there, but until we have definite evidence that that is so I think it is a mistake to put in a condition of this kind.  I gather that Arigna coal is quite suitable for use in boilers, and is so used in a number of institutions. We have, however, to take into account not merely the suitability of the coal but the quantity available, and the cost of transporting it to a particular factory.  It is proposed to establish three factories under this Bill.  County Roscommon will consider itself lucky if it gets one of them.  Quite certainly it does not anticipate getting the whole three.  It is possible that one of them might be a big distance away from Arigna or Castlecomer, or any other centre where Irish coal is available. Despite the desire of the Government and the directors of the company to utilise Irish coal it may not be possible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are all circumstances which have to be taken into account.  I think the Deputy may be satisfied in his own mind that the desire of the Government to foster the development of the coal mines here and encourage the use of Irish fuel is at least as strong as his own, and that they will be able to transmit that desire to the directors whom they appoint on the board of the company.  If the Deputy will accept the Government's assurance on that matter I think he will realise that it is unnecessary to put in a binding clause of this kind&mdash;a clause <Col N="1085" /> of a most unusual description&mdash;into the Articles of Association of the company, bearing in mind that it would require legislation to enable effect to be given to it, legislation conferring on the Minister powers which would enable him to exercise the functions which the Deputy proposes to give him.</P>

      <P>If this is an unusual condition, it is only appropriate that there should be an unusual condition, because this is a most unusual company and a most unusual Bill.  I am not at all prepared to accept the assurance of the Government, because though they may, no doubt, in theory, wish to develop Irish fuel resources, the preoccupation of the moment is not with that but with the sugar company.  I want to see that the other matter is brought to a point simultaneously.  The Minister talks about business experience being inconsistent with this proposal.  I venture to say that my business experience has been at least as long and as wide as his.  I am not to be put down by talk of business experience though we may be drifting back again to the accountant's point of view which the Minister has himself scoffed at.  If it requires legislation to empower the Minister to give such a licence, or to force compliance of the company with this article of association, I see no obstacle in the way of such legislation.  It could be included in this Bill.  If the Government had any real desire to operate the principle of this amendment, they could perfectly well make the necessary changes in the Bill.  At present I regard their attitude as thoroughly unsatisfactory.</P>

It is proposed in the amendment that no fuel shall be used in the company's factories except it is of Irish origin or is imported under licence by the Minister.  It does not seem to me that there is anything in the principle of the Bill or in the Long Title of the Bill which would empower the Minister to issue a licence for the importation of fuel.

      <P>As one who comes from a coal-producing area and who has had experience of Government policy translated into action in respect of the importation of coal in the case of one particular industry, I would seriously suggest to Deputy MacDermot the advisability of withdrawing this amendment and of not insisting on it.  The Government's policy in regard to the use of Irish products generally, particularly in respect of fuel, is, I think, very well known.  We know that Irish fuel is used to an increasing extent in all our public institutions, particularly where the Minister can influence public bodies.  In regard to the Minister's licensing power, I know that he will not give a licence for the importation of fuel for one factory that I know where the native product is available.  Licences have been absolutely refused where a strong case was put up to the Minister to allow the importation of a small proportion of foreign coal so that it might be mixed with the native product to ascertain if better results might be obtained. That answers Deputy MacDermot's suggestion that the Government are not really as serious as they profess to be in advancing the use of Irish products generally.  We have had <Col N="1087" /> experiments carried out in a factory in the South of Ireland regarding the comparative merits of foreign fuel and native fuel for the production of steam power.  These experiments have been recently carried out and I am very glad to be able to inform the Minister that it has been ascertained that the native coal is much more economical.  The factory itself has turned over from using 100 per cent. foreign fuel to using 100 per cent.  Irish fuel and with very much better results. With regard to the question of freight, there may not be very much difference in transport costs, but I would suggest that in view of the Minister's statement Deputy MacDermot might withdraw his amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion the real root of this matter has only been very lightly touched upon.  Some speakers seem to think that there will be a choice as to whether people can use foreign coal, Irish coal or turf when the factory is erected.  As I understand the problem, if Irish coal is going to be burned, a furnace of a certain type will have to be installed. I do not say that that furnace is greatly different from the furnace that would burn foreign coal, but it requires more air.  We could not burn Irish coal in certain furnaces and probably the majority of furnaces have been put in with a view to the use of foreign coal.  If a type of furnace&mdash;I suppose such a one could be designed&mdash;that would use Irish and English coal or turf, were installed, the engineer when he saw the efficiency of that boiler would probably commit suicide.  The problem comes down to this, that some time before the precise specification for the boiler is drawn up, somebody will have to make up his mind as to what fuel to pin his faith to, and will have to decide that anything else that may be used will only be in the nature of a second best.  The Minister has pleaded for a free hand for the experts to put up the factory <Col N="1088" /> according to their own requirements and he has urged that the location of the factory will have a bearing on the cost of the fuel.  Naturally, it will.  It would also have a bearing on the cost of the foreign fuel so that some time before the factory is erected plans will have to be drawn up as to what is the most efficient type of boiler.  The sooner that calculation is made the better.  I do not see why the Government could not get some facts made out as to what they consider the relative merits of the various fuels with the type of boiler which they consider necessary.  The last speaker has referred to the fact that Irish fuel is used in certain institutions.  That is perfectly true, but it can only be used where the boiler is suitable or has been altered to suit the Irish coal.  That is the point that I really rise to make in this discussion, namely, that you cannot have a type of factory designed which will use turf, Irish anthracite, or foreign coal just according as the whim suits or as the price varies or as the supply is available.  Somebody will have to make up their minds as to what type of boiler they want or what type of fuel they are going to look for, and the installation will have to be made accordingly. From that point of view, I should like to see Deputy MacDermot's amendment brought to the point where the Government will say &ldquo;We favour Irish fuel&rdquo; or &ldquo;we do not favour it.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether, on this matter, Deputy MacDermot allowed his heart to be ruled by his head or whether he allowed his heart to run away with his head.  As has been already explained, an experiment has been carried out in Carlow which indicates <Col N="1089" /> that Castlecomer coal may be economically used in manufacturing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the boiler to be altered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it had to be altered.  The boiler was altered.  The experiment indicates that Castlecomer fuel can be used economically and advantageously in the particular type of boiler which was installed for the purpose; but the experiment has not been conclusive.  The experimental stage is not yet concluded. Are we, before the experiment has been finished, to compel this undertaking, every time it wishes to import coal, to secure a licence from a Minister?  The amendment does not say which Minister.  As the amendment is drafted, it would be the Minister for Finance because he is the Minister referred to in the definition section of the Bill&mdash;the Minister who has, at the present moment, no powers to prohibit the import of fuel and no powers to compel this company, as the Bill stands at present, to use fuel of any specific type.  If Deputy MacDermot meant this amendment seriously as, I presume, if he presses it to a division, he wishes to hold himself out as doing, surely, some more consideration might have been given to it.  I will read the amendment to the House.  It says that &ldquo;except under licence from the Minister, all fuel used in the company's factories shall be of Irish origin.&rdquo;  There is nothing in this Bill giving the Minister for Finance power to issue a licence in respect of anything. It concerns itself solely with the formation of a company.  If the Deputy had given all the thought to this that he pretends to have given, it would immediately have struck him that the Minister for Finance is not the proper person to issue a licence and that that is more particularly the duty and responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In that case, he would at least have added the words &ldquo;Minister for Industry and Commerce&rdquo; and he would have provided earlier in the Bill for an amendment of the Bill in such terms as would have given the Minister for <Col N="1090" /> Industry and Commerce power to issue licences under this Bill in respect of this particular company.  He has not done that.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that, speaking frankly, the Deputy has put down this amendment merely as a political demonstration and that he is not single-hearted or single-minded at all in this matter.  This is not going to help to put a factory in Boyle.  Whether Boyle gets a factory or not will depend entirely on the report of the technical adviser who will be instructed to take into consideration the question as to whether the factory will be advantageously situated for using Irish fuel. Whether or not the Deputy succeeds in forcing us into this, the technical adviser would still be given that as one of his terms of reference.  Again, I suggest that, if the Deputy is concerned at all in this matter for the success of the company and does not wish to impose upon it an undue handicap which is going to increase eventually the cost of sugar to the State, to the consumer and to the farmers whom he claims to represent, he would not attempt to put what anyone would consider a thoughtless provision of this kind into a Bill like this to which it does not belong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That, certainly, beats any speech I have heard from any Minister in this House for a long time. For the last 18 months anything that could possibly be done to increase the cost of the production of goods here has been done.  Here we have a very intelligent amendment put down by Deputy MacDermot with the object of achieving a definite purpose.  How is it received by the Ministry?  Deputy MacDermot is criticised in all the moods and tenses for the terminology of his amendment which has been in the possession of the Ministry for, practically, the last week or fortnight. If they were in earnest about Irish manufacture and Irish produce and Irish industry generally, would they not have sat up with wet towels around their heads in order to think this out? Would they not have avoided all these social functions which they have attended during the last week or so and devoted some of that time towards <Col N="1091" /> providing for the miners of Castlecomer or Arigna or anywhere else? Not at all; they leave it to the House, and I doubt very much if the Minister read a word of this amendment until he came here to-day.  He never told us that he consulted the experts, and they are now in force behind him.  You could almost &ldquo;form fours&rdquo; with them, to use military phraseology.  Apart from these, he has reserves outside. Not one of them has been asked nor has a single communication passed from the files to get information on this, and yet he criticises the Deputy for having put down something which may, possibly, be impracticable.  This Government is the greatest licenser of everything that anybody ever heard of. Since they came into office scarcely a single measure has been passed that has not given them authority to give licences to somebody in connection with something or other.</P>
      <P>The amendment is a practical one. It gives an opportunity for the development of Irish coal.  If the Minister had made the statement that having examined his experts and consulted the Carlow Sugar Beet Factory he found that the coals produced here were unsuitable for use in a beet factory I would have accepted it at once.  If there is one word more than another that can be applied to this measure it is the word extravagance. The plutocrats who are spending our money lavishly in every direction gave a microscopic examination to the proposal put forward by Deputy MacDermot, a proposal, the acceptance of which would ensure some employment in the district which he represents. This amendment has not been examined good, bad or indifferent by the Government.  The second speech of the Minister showed that clearly when he put a question to the Ceann Comhairle as to whether the amendment was in order.  He was racking his brains to see if possibly there was a way out of escape from the division lobby so that he would not have to oppose the use of Irish fuel.  Do the decent thing, if it is possible at the end of your political days to do the decent thing, and accept the amendment.</P>

At all events he offered no new argument himself.  Deputy MacDermot says that he wants this inserted in the Bill because the Government, as he said, have been romantically generous to this industry. The Government are going to protect this industry.  That is all.  They are going to give it the same measure of <Col N="1093" /> protection that they have given to many other existing industries.  Therefore, according to the arguments of Deputy Cosgrave and of Deputy MacDermot any industry to which the Government gives protection should be required by law to use Irish coal, except when they are licensed by the Minister to use other classes of coal.  Deputy Cosgrave accepts that.  The policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, it now appears, is that in no protected industry should any fuel be used except Irish fuel, otherwise than under licence.</P>

      <P>The Deputy wants to go further.  I have been trying to find out what is the policy of Cumann na nGaedheal.  I know that they act on the general principle that they must vote against any Government proposal. Their policy is fairly determined by that consideration and none other.  I would like to know if they are supporting this amendment in consequence of any particular plank in their programme, and if they regard it as right and proper that all protected industries should be required to use Irish fuel, except under licence, if Irish fuel is available. Do they, or do they not support that?  If that is their policy, I am inclined to agree with it, but the necessary steps to implement that <Col N="1096" /> policy cannot be taken in this Bill. They may be taken in another measure. I hope when that measure appears before the Dáil that Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Cosgrave will use precisely the same arguments as they are using on this amendment, and I hope that Deputy Dockrell will be able to muster the business community of this State into one solid and enthusiastic phalanx behind such a measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The same measure of protection.  The only reason which might induce Government capital to be invested in this industry is that private investors may not be wide awake to the magnificent opportunity to make profits that is being offered to them. I hope the public will put their money into this industry so that Government capital will not be required.  If Government capital has to be invested the taxpayer is going to get a return in abundance, because the industry will be as secure as any industry that was ever established, and the shares in the company will be gilt-edged securities of the best kind. If Deputy Cosgrave has any spare money available he will take my advice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider the amendment, which asks &ldquo;that except under licence from the Minister, all fuel used in the company's factories shall be of Irish origin.&rdquo;  It is the purpose of the Government to ensure the most extensive use of Irish fuel. The House knows that the Government is doing its best to implement that policy, and will continue to do so.  In so far as that is the Government <Col N="1097" /> policy, it will be given effect to, and these companies will be required, as far as possible, to use Irish fuel.  If Irish fuel is available the company will be required to use it, and the directors appointed by the Government will have instructions to that end.  If Irish fuel is not available they cannot do so.  The insertion of an amendment of this kind gives the Government no extra power whatever.  It merely means that if we decide that Irish fuel is not available, and that under the circumstances the company should not be required to use it, instead of saying: &ldquo;Go ahead, and do what you think best,&rdquo; we will have to issue a licence.  That is the only difference. Deputy MacDermot has not given the only reason why the amendment is on the Order Paper.  He realises that his political stock in Roscommon is falling rapidly, and that it is necessary to do something to revive it.  Deputy MacDermot referred to a statement I made in criticism of the Centre Party, in which I said that they always examined matters with the accountant's mind, looked at the figures, but not at the human beings behind them.  Deputy MacDermot is beginning to look at the human beings now just because they happen to be voters in his constituency.  If Deputy MacDermot resided in some other constituency, in which there did not happen to be the coal resources that there are in the constituency which he misrepresents, I do not think he would be the least interested in the amendment, or have taken any steps whatever to initiate a discussion of this kind in the Dáil. Deputy MacDermot may be quite satisfied that at the moment the Government is carrying out an examination which may result in a considerable development of the fuel resources he has in mind, and if he visits the constituency, and makes inquiries from those who know something about the matter, he will realise that the Government has been working while he has been talking.</P>

      <P>A fellow feeling may be making us wondrous kind.  I am rather surprised that the Minister's fellow feeling for Deputy <Col N="1098" /> MacDermot has not made him wondrous kind.  He said that Deputy MacDermot is tottering in his political position in his constituency.  But the Minister for Industry and Commerce is tottering far more.  He is not only tottering in his constituency but tottering in the whole country.  If Deputy MacDermot is tottering, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is tottering and the Government is tottering.  The Minister ought to be moved with the very kindliest sympathy for Deputy MacDermot, because he is in the same position. We saw beautiful little play acting on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He wanted to know about the protected industries of Cumann na nGaedheal.  I would like to point out that in spite of the vigorous speech made from the Fianna Fáil Benches by Deputy Gibbons which the Minister very strongly contradicted, the Minister told the House that Deputy Gibbons had been talking nonsense. He said that if the amendment was carried these unfortunate industries would be handicapped by having to bear an undue burden in burning Irish coal and that in consequence there would be an increased cost of sugar on the poor ratepayers.  If the Minister for Finance is right it would certainly be very unfair to ask the ordinary individual to pay an increased cost.  Let us have a try out where Government money is involved as there will not be any private money.  If it happened that Deputy Gibbons is right, that the Minister for Finance is wrong, and that Irish coal, under certain circumstances, is just as efficient as fuel from any other country, that there will not be an undue handicap by using it, and no undue increase in the cost of sugar to the taxpayer, I think that a chance ought to be given to Irish coal and that it should be tried not at the expense of the private individual but in a company which is entirely Government financed.  It will be practically Government managed so that that Irish industry could be used to make an experiment of this kind, rather than a private manufacturing company.  I think the Minister for Finance absolutely surpassed himself <Col N="1099" /> by the speech he made.  He seemed to be under the impression that the amendment sought to compel the use of English or foreign coal.  It does nothing of the kind.  The Minister stated that he had no power to issue a licence.  Why should he issue a licence if he has no power to introduce fuel into this country?  Is it not a pretty argument that if coal cannot be got, after the Minister for Industry and Commerce has prohibited the coming of foreign coal, then they would have to use Irish coal, whether they can use it or not?</P>

Is it compulsion of the Minister to introduce coal which is going to be produced in the country whether the Minister for Finance has or has not power to issue licences for importation?  The Minister was speaking extemporaneously and obviously without consultation as to what the amendment meant.  It appears to me that the Minister for Finance has run himself into an awkward position by the very funny speech he made.  All the chivalry, kindliness, brotherly love, as well as the ability of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which we have seen expended in the last few minutes, in a brave effort to extricate his unfortunate colleague was, I am afraid, absolutely to no purpose.  With all the nice little jokes the Minister in his lightest vein cannot keep the real question hidden.</P>

The amendment would make this definite difference, that it serves to bring it to the notice of all concerned that Irish fuel is expected to be used.  Whatever either Minister said, it would undoubtedly influence the choice of sites for the factories and, as Deputy Dockrell pointed out, the preparations regarding the boilers.  I cannot too emphatically declare that this amendment is absolutely genuine and that I would support it if my own constituency was not concerned at all. For the Government's sake I only wish they were half as secure in the country as I am secure in the County Roscommon.</P>

      <P>Shut up!  I accept Deputy Cosgrave's statement fully&mdash; the statement that he had nothing to do with the fact that East Cork was first selected and the sugar beet factory happened afterwards to be changed to his own constituency.  I accept that fully.  Now, to come back to the amendment, it was put in for one definite purpose.  If Deputy MacDermot had any knowledge of farming he would not have put it in. He certainly would not have submitted the amendment if he had any knowledge of the factors which induce manufacturers to put up sugar beet factories.  People first look for land suitable for growing beet and secondly for tillage farmers prepared to grow it.  They will not look to a ranching county where nothing is grown but bullocks.  Where farmers are prepared to grow beet, that is where you will see the factories being established.  No considerations as to whether Irish fuel is near or far will move a factory from a tillage to a bullock ranching area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this amendment is ridiculous, inasmuch as this Party has given the most definite guarantees by their own actions in regard to the use of Irish fuel.  Some people might say we have gone so far as to force the use of Irish fuel where it may not at the moment be suitable.  I think the action of this Party in regard to Irish fuel should be sufficient guarantee for any man, except the type of man who comes here with a bee in his bonnet, like Deputy MacDermot to-night.  His attitude here is &ldquo;I will do something now that will let the Roscommon <Col N="1102" /> people see that at last I have remembered that I represent Roscommon and that I do not represent Paris or London.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was concerned to know why we are supporting this amendment.  This Bill deals with sugar, for which a considerable sum of money leaves the country every year. The manufacture of sugar here is going to cost the people a very considerable sum annually.  We were told that the fact that we are going to make sugar ourselves, even though it costs a considerable sum, means the saving of a large amount of money that ordinarily goes out of the country and that was a primary consideration.  If Ministers had come in here to-night, having examined this amendment, and proved to us that the use of Irish coal would entail a heavier proportionate cost in the manufacture of sugar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It does not matter what the item is, whether it is sugar or coal or silk hats or anything else brought in here.  I am talking according to the Minister's own psychology.

      <P>The amendment reads:&mdash;&ldquo;(g) that except under licence from the Minister, all fuel used in the Company's factories shall be of Irish origin.&rdquo;  Badly drafted!  I would agree to let the two Ministers go outside the House and spend until 9 o'clock drafting an amendment, and a better one if they could, and I would be prepared to guarantee that they would not produce as good an amendment as this, or that the intelligentsia <Col N="1106" /> that they have behind them on the Fianna Fáil Benches would do it either.  What is wrong with the amendment?  Badly drafted!  It was out of order a few minutes ago.  It was going to increase the cost.  That is what we were told in the beginning, and now we are told that the Irish fuel is cheaper.  I hold we have as good a right to help the Irish coal industry as to help the Irish sugar industry.</P>

      <P>When I first read this amendment on the Order Paper I was of opinion that it was an amendment which would not be accepted by the Minister.  But after hearing the speeches of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce I have come to the conclusion that this is an amendment which on the Minister's own admission can and ought to be accepted.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce waxed eloquent on the fact, as he said, that this would create a hardship at the very initiation of this industry.  He showed great solicitude, if I might so call it, in asking the Deputies not to place any undue hardships so far as these three beet factories were concerned.  I would like to ask the Minister this straight question: What concern has he ever shown for the industries like the railways which at the moment are giving employment to anything from 15,000 to 17,000 men?  What concern have they shown by placing upon the railways by their tariff policy an imposition of something like 5/- a ton on coal?</P>

      <P>When the Minister answers that question he will get some little consideration from me, but when he makes the statement here and endeavours to draw a red herring across the trail and to impute dishonest motives to the Opposition, I would like to remind him that during the last General Election all the dead <Col N="1107" /> walls of the country were covered over with bills saying that they were the only Party who were out for protection and the use of Irish industries.  We had a statement from the President himself, a very emphatic statement, that we should not import anything from outside.  We were told that we were to employ all the means and all the resources at our disposal in the way of native materials, to erect our own houses, to make our own clothes and boots, and every other thing that the Irish people use.  Now here is coal, an article that can be procured in Ireland, on the Minister's own admission.  The amendment only asks the Minister to see before these factories are set up that a clause will be inserted in the Bill having for its purpose the use of Irish coal in the beet factories which are going to be set up in this country.  I do not know what is the objection to the amendment and I do not know why that objection is coming specially from back-benchers like Deputy Corry and the rest of them, except that they regard it as an impertinence on the part of a West Britisher and an Imperialist like Deputy MacDermot to introduce an amendment.  According to Fianna Fáil he is a West Britisher and an Imperialist.</P>
      <P>Is it the considered view of the Fianna Fáil Party, including the Executive Council, that a man like Deputy MacDermot, or as I suppose myself, is not entitled to put down such an amendment?  We must wait on the pleasure of Fianna Fáil to do anything in the way of protecting Irish industries and advocating the use of Irish minerals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Cosgrave said, if the Minister had any little particle of moral courage in dealing with the amendment and stated that this would unduly handicap those in charge of the factories in carrying on their business in a proper and efficient manner, I, as one who knows a little about business, would be the first to adopt the Minister's viewpoint.  Instead of that, a childish attitude is being adopted.  It seems that nothing good can come from the Opposition in this House, according <Col N="1108" /> to the Government.  It is about time that we were a little more broad-minded, a little more sympathetic towards the views of our opponents, whether we are Cumann na nGaedheal or Centre Party or Labour Party or any other Party.  It would be better for all concerned and for the interests of the country.  I would remind the Minister that it is the considered policy of his Party to do all they possibly can to promote the use of articles of Irish manufacture.  There is no use in the Minister saying that this is an irritating amendment and that its acceptance would mean consequential legislation.  The Minister showed very little concern in connection with the irritating provisions that he put in before he issued licences to people in this country.  I enumerated many of them here, especially in connection with the importation of materials used in the building of houses and on matters of that kind.  I got very little sympathy from the Minister when I raised such a question.  I think the Minister could accept the amendment in all good faith.  If, in his opinion, it will not be in the best interest of the factories to use Irish coal, that it would place an extra financial burden upon the factories, he can, under the amendment, if he so desires, allow coal to be imported under licence.  I do not see any difficulty in accepting the amendment. It will be a gesture to the Opposition and to the mover of the amendment, Deputy MacDermot, who, in my opinion, no matter what he may be, is here to do the best he can in the interests of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coburn wants the Minister to accept the amendment as a kind of peace offering, because Deputy MacDermot, as he said, has a West-British tinge.  He wants the Minister to accept the amendment simply as a peace-offering in order that we might all become good friends here.  I suggest that it is absolutely waste of time and ridiculous to put such an amendment on the Order Paper.  In the first place, a few weeks ago when the Government brought in a measure to provide for the more extended use of Irish peat we were sneered and laughed <Col N="1109" /> at by the Vice-President of Deputy MacDermot's Party.  He said it was all nonsense, it was all a joke, it was all politics, and we should not take it seriously.  Simply because the Government are making provision for the more extended use of peat in this country, it was absolutely all nonsense to say that this country was going to come down to the burning of Irish fuel. Deputy Dillon said the thing was going to be an absolute failure.  The members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party looked at it in the same way and made practically the same statements.  They laughed and sneered at the idea of the Government providing for peat being used in a more extensive way in the country.  That was one thing that was not feasible, and was not acceptable to the Cumann na nGaedheal or Centre Party.  Later on it was suggested to extend the beet factories in this country so that we should manufacture all our own sugar rather than import it. Even that was not acceptable to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or the Centre Party.  We had the suggestion from Deputy Mulcahy that the whole thing should be postponed for the present.  Now because the Government have gone ahead with a big scheme for the furtherance of the use of Irish fuel, and for the provision of factories for the manufacture of sugar, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and the Centre Party unite and say: &ldquo;We will see that nothing is used but Irish fuel in these factories.&rdquo;  It is marvellous how leopards can change their spots.  There is a suggestion by some individuals that certain people should wear blue shirts.  Will they make the proposal that these people should wear nothing else but blue shirts?  That would be something similar to the proposal in this amendment.  This Government has promoted the use of Irish material in every part of this State.  An atmosphere has been created for the use of Irish goods that we had not in the country since 1919.  Cumann na nGaedheal had never attempted to create such an atmosphere when they were in power.  &ldquo;Buy English goods, buy Scotch whiskey,&rdquo; is the suggestion of Deputies opposite.  That was suggested <Col N="1110" /> in this House by a Deputy who is now sitting on the opposite benches. Simply because this Government has created an atmosphere for the buying of Irish goods the leopards change their spots and come forward with the proposal that these factories should use nothing else except Irish coal.  By using the methods of the sulky schoolboy they are going to prove that they stand for Irish industry at long last. The Minister has assured the House that Irish fuel is at present being used in the Carlow factory.  He assured Deputy Cosgrave of that.  That did not satisfy the well-bred Deputy, of course.  He wanted to get his speech in.  He wanted the taunt to be thrown. He wanted Deputy MacDermot and himself to unite in this for the common good, and in the interests of Irish fuel. He assured the House that it could be used in a more economical way than foreign coal.  The Minister pointed out that it was the policy of the Government to have Irish coal and peat used as far as possible, but these Deputies want it in black and white.  It is well known to everybody that the use of Irish manufactured goods is one of the first planks in the programme of the Government.  It is not necessary to insert such a provision as this here, as if the Government were weak on the point, as if even Cumann na nGaedheal and the Centre Party were weak on the point&mdash;that it should be put down in black and white that nothing else is to be used.  We should expect in this country, once and for all, that Irish manufactured goods, wherever possible, will be used by the people of this country.  That is what this Government has made possible.  That is what is enshrined in this Bill for the manufacture of sugar from beet, and that is the policy that the Government is going to pursue despite the attitude of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.</P>

He said: &ldquo;Let us assume that we imported coal for these factories to the value of <Col N="1111" /> £80,000.

      <P>Very well.  It is no harm to have some sympathy for the use of whatever Irish fuel in production of sugar can be used, when the Bill before us provides, not for subsidies, as the Minister said, except indirectly, but for a constant tariff of 130 per cent. Now Deputy Gibbons is, apparently, against the use, or is against the stipulation that we should use, Irish fuel, notwithstanding the fact that the factory is going to be given a tariff or subsidy to the extent of 130 per cent. He seems to have no sympathy for the use of Irish coal.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy says my figures are wrong, all he has to do is to make a little calculation.  If we produce sugar at 23/- a cwt., and could buy imported sugar for 10/- a cwt. and, in order to protect our own manufacture or to keep out the cheap sugar, we put on a tariff of 130 per cent., then <Col N="1113" /> we are taxing the consumers of this country to the tune of 130 per cent. We cannot put up a sugar beet factory in every constituency, like the factory in the Deputy's constituency, nor are we expected to grow sugar beet in the bogs or in the moors of the midlands.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to what his colleague, Deputy Hogan from Clare, referred to yesterday, when he discovered there was gold there.  We are not rambling down there at present.  Places where we produce Irish fuel will not, as a rule, be centres for the production of Irish beet, but they will have to pay the 130 per cent. on their sugar.

The meaning I took from Deputy Gibbons' interjection was that in the production of sugar from beet, the utilising of Irish fuel, or making mandatory the use of Irish fuel, would so put up the cost that you could only give the farmers 21/- a ton for the beet grown.

      <P>Here is the official publication from the Department of Agriculture, showing those who grew beet experimentally under the orders of the Department of Agriculture, from four or five different kinds of seed, in the year 1925.  On the basis of those experiments the sugar factory in Carlow was started, and sugar production in this country began its career.  I have said, and I repeat, that not a member of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1117" /> Party gave any assistance in that experiment.

      <P>To use a sporting expression, that is definitely below the belt.  It is not worthy of any member <Col N="1118" /> of this House.  Deputy Belton was not paid for it.  Deputy Belton grew another acre that year at his own expense; he sent to Germany and got special seed.  A supporter of the Deputy's own Party, Con Donovan, now Instructor for Louth, can verify that. I got no use for that beet.  I offered it to dairy men to feed their cows, and they would not take it.  Deputy Harris has not helped in the development of sugar production in this country.  He was rainbow chasing.  He would not take an oath that became an empty formula afterwards.  We followed the substance while they followed the shadows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we take the Land Bond Bill, it seems to me that some reference should be made to what I think was an abuse of the privileges of this House. Certain public servants, who are immediately concerned with the preparation of legislative proposals and with the subsequent administration of such proposals as become law, are required, as part of their official duties, to be present here during the debates&mdash;very much against their own inclinations, I am sure.  That was the position under the last Government, as it is under this.  These officers attended just as frequently and in as great numbers then as now.  For the purpose of this attendance, special accommodation has been provided for them and provided in such a way as clearly demarcates them from the rest of the House and excludes them from the ambit of the debates which take place here.  They do not participate in these debates directly or indirectly. They have no part in them and should not be made parties to them.  They are compelled, as I have said, by the duties of their official position to come here and, when they do come here, they should have the assurance, which hitherto has not been necessary, that they will be treated with ordinary good manners and not be treated as an exhibit or held up to the public gaze as a spectacle.  That should not be done on any occasion whatsoever, and, least of all, it should not be done in order to score a cheap debating point.</P>
      <P>In the course of his speech, Deputy Cosgrave, who, as President of an Executive Council, occupied these Benches and was first responsible for bringing these officers here, referred to their presence in this Chamber and, with his habitual ill-manners, pointing to them, used such expressions as: &ldquo;Look at them!  There they are&mdash; enough of them to form fours!&rdquo;  I am submitting to you, a Chinn Comhairle, that those observations of Deputy Cosgrave were grossly improper and should be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>By virtue of established procedure expert advisers from Government Departments are here for the convenience of Ministers dealing with legislative and other matters.  That custom has the sanction of the years behind it.  As the officials are not technically in the House, they take no part in the business of the House and, as the Minister stated, should not be referred to.  Reference was made to them to-day.  It struck me that the reference, while, perhaps, somewhat frivolous, was not meant to be offensive.  The Chair, certainly, did not interpret it in that sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No person in this State has a greater appreciation of the value and of the dignity which should attach to public officials than I.  I have had a longer association with officials of State than any other person in the State.  I have had very great assistance from them.  I have had nothing to complain of in connection with that assistance and my attitude towards them during the time I was in office was exactly the same as my attitude is when I am out of office.  I had no intention whatever of scoring a cheap debating point at their expense.  Quite the opposite.  In the course of my remarks, which were certainly not intended to be frivolous and which dealt with the subject matter before the House, I rather resented that their expert advice was not availed of, and it was as an objection to that course <Col N="1121" /> on the part of the Minister that I mentioned the matter at all.  These officials come here after office hours.  Those of them who assemble in the Gallery which is provided for them are of invaluable assistance to the Ministers. They were invaluable to the Ministers during my time of office, and, certainly if I am any judge, they are of very much more assistance to the present Ministry.  I am not, sir, one of those who has any appreciation of the manners of the Minister.  That is all I will say on that subject.  In so far as the officials are concerned, it is not necessary for me to make the statement I have made because I am convinced that, after the association I had with them for so long when I was in office and the courtesy I have had from them and that they have had from me since I left office, it does not require any explanation in the House.  If the Minister had done what I advised him to do, that is, if he had availed of the assistance of the officials, there would have been no necessity for the debate having gone on so long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Land Bond Bill.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the issue of land bonds to finance all land purchase transactions pending at the date when the British Government guarantee expired.  Pending cases are defined in the Bill, as regards tenanted <Col N="1122" /> land, as meaning holdings of which particulars have been lodged with the Land Commission before the passing of the Act and sub-tenancies on such holdings, and also holdings held under fee farm grants, etc., in respect of which applications have been received before the passing of the Act. The pending cases of untenanted land are those in which the price has been fixed or agreed on before the passing of the Act.  It is, therefore, clear that this Act covers all cases which were pending at the date when the British Government guarantee expired, whether the lands were tenanted or untenanted.  It is estimated that about £700,000 of land bonds will be required to finance these pending cases, but in order to allow a margin for safety the figure of £1,000,000 has been inserted in the Bill.  The Bill in all other particulars follows closely the lines of the Land Bond Act of 1925, and provides that separate accounts shall be maintained for the new land bonds, and that the provisions as regards sinking fund, redemption, etc., shall be the same.  I should like to make it clear to the House that this Bill deals only with pending cases and gives us power only to issue bonds to such value as would be required to finance those pending cases.  With regard to the Land Bill now before the House, special proposals will be introduced in due course to provide for the issue of land bonds, and for the general provision of the finances required to operate that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is fairly clear. I do not know whether it is necessary to give any very detailed explanation of it.  Section 1 is the usual definition section.  I have already pointed out that this covers all the lands tenanted and untenanted in respect of which transactions were pending before the passing of the Act.  Section 2 provides for the payment of the purchase moneys in new land bonds in respect of these pending transactions.  This follows the lines of Section 2 of the Land Act of 1923, and provides that the purchase money in respect of any tenanted or untenanted land which is pending shall be payable to the vendors in new land bonds, and that all claims <Col N="1123" /> against the purchase money shall be payable in like manner.  Section 3 provides for the making of advances in new land bonds, and stipulates that these are to be made by means of the issue of 4½ per cent. new land bonds. It further provides for the application of the provision in the Land Purchase Acts to the advances made under the present measure so far as redemption and advances, etc., are concerned. Section 4 follows the lines of Section 1 of the Land Act of 1923, as amended by Section 3 of the Land Bond Act, 1925, and provides for the creation and issue of new land bonds.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the issue under the present Bill is limited to £1,000,000, while the Land Commission estimate is that only about £700,000 will be required to deal with pending cases.  The section also provides for the redemption of the new land bonds by means of periodical drawings.  It further provides that all or any new land bonds not previously redeemed may be redeemed at par at any time after the expiration of 30 years from the date of the passing of this Act.  The usual provisions are inserted for charging the interest and capital of the new land bonds upon the Central Fund. Section 5 provides for the redemption of new land bonds and follows the lines laid down in Section 3 of the Land Bond Act of 1925.  Section 6 provides for the payment by the Land Commission to the Land Bond Fund of interest and sinking fund on the new land bonds, and follows the lines of Section 11 of the Land Act of 1923 and Section 6 of the Land Bond Act of 1925. Section 7 makes provision for setting up a costs fund in connection with the issue of new land bonds.  The amount of the costs fund, as previously, is 2 per cent. of the total advances.  Section 8 provides that the payment of new land bonds shall be calculated to the nearest pound.  Section 9 provides that in the accounts of the Land Bond Fund the transactions financed by the new land bonds shall be kept distinct from those financed by the bonds issued under previous Acts.  Section 10 amends sub-section (3) of Section 1 of the Act of 1923, as amended by Section <Col N="1124" /> 3 of the Land Bond Act of 1925.  These sections provide that land bonds may be redeemed at any time after the expiration of 30 years from the date of the issue of the bonds.  The operation of this provision casts an undue burden upon the administration in so far as it would be difficult to keep track of the date of issue of all bonds.  The holders and the purchasers of bonds it is felt are entitled to know the date at which the bonds may be paid off.  The certificates issued at present are no guide as to the date of issue.  In considering this matter it is felt that the simplest procedure is to provide that all old land bonds should be redeemable at par 30 years from the cessation of the British guarantee, that is to say, 30 years from the 18th day of December, 1932, which is the date that is specified in the section.  Section 11 is merely a section empowering the Minister for Finance to make regulations for carrying the provisions of the Act into effect, and Section 12 is the short title to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is almost identical with the Land Bond Act of 1925, except that in this Bill there is a single guarantee, whereas in the other Act there was the dual guarantee of this Government and of the British Government.  I do not intend to make any comment on that.  The machinery in the Land Bond Act of 1925 except for a few minor alterations is embodied almost in entirety in this Bill. The Minister stated that this Bill would require £700,000 to finance the completion of pending cases. I do not understand how the Minister arrived at that figure. The Acting-Minister for Lands and Fisheries when introducing the Land Bill stated that he had schemes ready for the distribution of 100,000 acres.  At the conclusion of the Second Reading debate the Minister stated that he proposed in future to distribute land at the rate of 100,000 acres yearly. Surely the Minister for Finance does not mean to suggest now that £700,000 is going to finance the operations of the Land Commission, in so far as untenanted land is concerned, in a period of one year.  I understood the Minister to say that the £700,000 would <Col N="1125" /> cover the operations of the Land Commission in regard to tenanted land, sub-tenancies, fee farm grants, and lease holds, under Section 44 of the Land Act of 1931, as well as untenanted land and various other classes of land which the Land Commission has to deal with in a normal way.</P>
      <P>Am I to infer from the Minister's statement that he proposes at a later stage, probably at the beginning of next year, to introduce another Land Bond Bill, to provide a further sum of money to complete the operations under the Land Act of 1923?  Quite obviously, this Bill has no relation to the Land Bill of 1933.  The Minister has not given any indication whatever of what is to be the rate of issue of the bonds, what is to be the rate of interest, and what is to be the rate of issue of bonds under the Land Bill of 1933.  I think Deputies anticipated that the Minister would give some indication of what the rate of interest would be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount which the Minister is asking is apparently only intended to cover a very short period, presumably a few months.  Whilst no period is mentioned in the Bill, I anticipate that it is the Minister's intention to introduce another Land Bond Bill, sometime towards the end of this year, because the amount which he proposes to raise by this Bill will scarcely finance land operations for more than a month or so.  I invite the Minister to avail of this opportunity to indicate what the rate of issue of the bonds to finance the Land Bill of 1933 is to be. A great deal of insecurity and uneasiness has been caused in the country by some of the very drastic provisions of that Bill, and naturally owners of land anticipated that when he was introducing the Land Bond Bill, the Minister would make some statement regarding the nature of the compensation which is to be paid for the various interests which the Minister for Lands and Fisheries proposes to acquire under the Land Bill of 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> It is due to the country and to the Dáil that the Minister should make some statement now with regard to the bonds, the rate of interest, the rate of issue, and the amount of bonds proposed to be issued under the Land Bill of 1933.  I assume naturally that operations under that Bill will be postponed for a very long time, in order to complete the operations initiated under the Land Act of 1923, which will occupy at least three or four years.  If the Minister is to finance these operations, and if it is his intention to introduce Land Bond Bills periodically, I can easily imagine, and the Minister must realise, that he will have to introduce at least three Land Bond Bills every year for the next three or four years, if land acquisition and land distribution is to be carried on at the rate mentioned by the Acting-Minister for Lands and Fisheries when concluding the Second Reading debate. I assume from the Bill that no proceedings whatever under the Land Bill of 1933 will be undertaken for three or four years.</P>
    <P>From the Minister's statement when introducing this Bill to-day, I take it that it is the intention of the Government to complete all the operations started under the Land Act of 1923 and subsequent Acts.  If that is so, I do not see any possibility of starting any operations whatever under the Land Bill of 1933 for three or four years.  I am rather glad of that.  If the Minister can make that position clear to the House, there are many people who will be very pleased with such a statement.  This Bill is merely a rehash of the Land Bond Act of 1925, with the exception that we have one guarantee now, instead of a dual guarantee under that Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected that the Minister for Finance should have dealt with the security he is offering in order to borrow £1,000,000.  The Minister certifies for £1,000,000 of paper bonds, pledging the credit of the State to redeem them.  That is equivalent to borrowing, as the country will be £1,000,000 the poorer when the bonds are issued.  We are going to pay 4½ per cent. for them, and it is not <Col N="1127" /> indicated when they will amortize themselves.</P>

      <P>The Minister should have dealt with the economic position, on the strength of which depends his capabilities of borrowing money or incurring a debt.  Many people will learn for the first time that the old land bonds were withdrawn from the 18th December last.  These bonds are now issued on our own security.  The Minister did not tell us that 30 years from 18th December last the Government here can exercise the option of redeeming those bonds.  He has not told us in what currency those bonds will be redeemed.  I take it the bonds will be negotiable.  Will they be redeemable in sterling or in some currency the creation of the Minister for Finance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not balderdash.  So far as I can see the Minister's knowledge of finance extends to the changing of a pound.  He has not told us if the economic condition of the country is going to be clarified, so that we will be able to incur periodical borrowings. Stripped of all its padding, this means the borrowing of a million which we must pay at the end of 30 years.  In the meantime we undertake the obligation of collecting from certain people interest on the guarantee at the rate of 4½ per cent. and sinking fund at ¼ per cent., making 4¾ per cent. in all. We undertake the obligation of paying whether we collect it or not.  We are giving credit to people from whom we <Col N="1128" /> take land, where we redeem rents or carry out pending purchases under the 1923 Act.  The Minister has not dealt with the country's capacity to incur more debts.</P>
      <P>A million is nothing to our distinguished Minister for Finance.  A few millions a year would put the people back on the soil doing productive work. It will be interesting to know in what currency he proposes to redeem the bonds.  He has undertaken this obligation for 30 years and if the bonds are to be redeemed in sterling it must mean that the famous Republic is postponed for 30 years.  We surely cannot be a Republic and use British currency.  If it is not sterling, in what will the bonds be redeemed?  We should be told.  I remember it was a cardinal plank in the policy of the Minister&mdash;he was most eloquent on the subject on famous occasions&mdash;that we should have our own currency.  Now he is afraid to mention it.  This is the new brand of Republicanism. Where is there a Republic without its own currency?  The Minister will not mention it.</P>

      <P>And Deputy O'Briain found a mare's nest.  Deputy O'Briain probably does not know that it was put in the forefront of the Party he is a member of to establish our own currency.  He is not aware of that. Of course, Deputy O'Briain is true to the traditions of the Party.  When the official head of the Party says it is raining, the Party say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; if he says it is snowing, the Party say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; and if he says it is Christmas Day, Deputy Donnelly would probably say &ldquo;Yes, it is.&rdquo;  It is a very material thing for those getting the bonds to know in what kind of currency they will be redeemed.  I suppose the Minister is aware that foreign insurance companies operating in this country will not grant policies guaranteeing people in sterling; they will pay them only in Free State currency, whatever it is.  Does the Minister mean Free State currency or sterling in connection with these bonds?  I am afraid we can only conjecture. <Col N="1129" /> We will still shout &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo; while we carry the British sterling unit of currency and accept the gold standard as our standard of value. We will carry British sterling in our pockets, shout &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo; and fool the people down the country. At £5 a week Deputy Donnelly will organise that foolery.</P>

It is not correct to say and one would be wrong to believe that the Land Act of 1933 will not come into operation for three or four years.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide the finances which would enable pending transactions under the 1923 Act to be quickly disposed of.  As soon as the Land Bill of 1933 becomes law it will be immediately put into effect.  It has nothing to do with the Act of 1933 to indicate what the Government's proposals will be with regard to the financing of the Act of 1933.  It is enough to say that these proposals will be fair and equitable, both to those from whom the land will be acquired and in respect of those to whom the land will be distributed.  I do not propose to follow Deputy Belton into the realms of rameis.  He has a licence to talk nonsense about currency in this House, because he has been half of everything in Irish politics.</P>

      <P>It will be noted that the original definition in the Bill has been amended just now by the House and, accordingly, I think that the point which these amendments were originally designed to meet has now been met.  I think that they would cause delay to the Bill whilst absolutely accurate and exhaustive information was being obtained from all the Departments.  Secondly, I think they would introduce unnecessary delay under the Bill; and thirdly, and this is an important point, they would make the Bill inapplicable to the funds or moneys which might come into the hands of Ministers during the currency of the measure.  Accordingly, I suggest to the Deputy that he should not press the amendments.  I really do not <Col N="1135" /> think there is any point in them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really a question of how far the committee are going to be allowed to express an opinion if they are appealed to.  It appears to be undesirable, having set up a committee of experts to examine the value of securities for the investment of State funds, to place them then in the invidious position that they can only express an opinion when expressly asked by the Minister.  It seems to me that it would be the regular procedure for anybody who had an investment that he thought ought to be approved to apply to the committee, and I should like to ask the Minister what he thinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Dockrell, possibly because he is not as interested in it as I am, has misconceived the purpose of this.  The committee is to advise the Minister when he thinks he requires advice. <Col N="1137" /> The purpose is not to veto, as it were, all investments that might be submitted to them by outsiders, but merely those securities in which the Minister contemplates making an investment, securities which may be novel in so far as Government funds have not been previously put in them, but which otherwise might be sound enough and as to which the Minister, because the investment is within the limited terms of that definition a novel one, would wish to have the advice of the competent body.  That body is not an executive body at all, but merely an advisory one, and quite obviously the only person who should have the right to approach that committee is the Minister who has established that committee for his own guidance and not for the guidance of anybody else, except in a limited way those who are entrusted with the investment of funds in the hands of the court.  Therefore I think the Minister, first of all, when people approach him and say here is an investment in which Government moneys might be reasonably placed, should relieve the committee to some extent of an undue burden by having that proposal examined in his own Department; and having it examined there if those who are competent to advise him feel that it is an investment upon which the committee might be asked to express an opinion and feel that this application is not a superfluous one and not an unsuitable one for investment of Government funds that then and only then should it be referred to the committee for investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that those who constitute that committee will be people occupying very important positions such as the chairman of the Currency Commission, the chairman of the Dublin Stock Exchange and members of the Dublin shareholding banks. and the demands upon the time of these people will be very considerable. It is the duty of the Minister in asking the members of this committee to advise him, and asking them to advise him in a purely honorary capacity, to see that their time is not wasted and is not unnecessarily taken up by consideration of evidence which he knows <i>prima facie,</i> without any examination <Col N="1138" /> whatever possibly, would be unsuitable for the investment of Government funds.  It is for that reason power is reserved to the Minister to refer proposed investments to the committee for consideration.  Therefore, I think that this amendment of Deputy Dockrell is unnecessary.  He may feel quite satisfied that if an investment which appears on the face of it to be a suitable one is suggested to the Minister, and if he has no capital already invested in it and not already referred to the committee it will be referred to them for their advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one aspect of the situation.  Can there not be another in which the Minister will ask the advice of the committee about one particular investment and they will not be able to review the limited industrial field, because their terms of reference will be too narrow.  I quite realise there is something in what the Minister says.  But that is the case in which the Minister asks their advice about particular investments.</P>

      <P>(a)  whether and how far the safety of the capital and the income of money invested in such security is ensured by investment therein;</P>
      <P>(b)  whether, having regard to the normal price of such security in the market, such security provides an adequate return on money invested therein;</P>
      <P>(c)  whether a free and convenient market exists for such security and whether such security is readily purchasable and realisable in such market;</P>
      <P>(d) whether such security is redeemable or otherwise liable to compulsory repayment of capital at an early or a distant date or not at all;</P>
      <P>(e)  whether the market price of such security is and is likely to continue free from frequent or violent fluctuation.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment because it is considered desirable to give some indication in the Bill of some of the matters to which the Investments Advisory Committee might have regard when considering the matters referred to them under the Act.  This amendment has been proposed after consultation with the Currency Commission, the shareholding banks and the stock exchange.</P>

    <P>(1)  The Minister may, whenever he thinks fit, withdraw an approval previously given by him under this Act in respect of any security.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever the Minister proposes to withdraw under this section an approval of a security, he may request the committee to advise him as to such withdrawal and thereupon the committee shall with all convenient speed prepare and submit to the Minister their advice in regard to such withdrawal.</P>
    <P>(3)  When an approval of a security is withdrawn under this section, such security shall forthwith cease to be an investment suitable for the investment of Government funds or Government moneys and all holdings of such security representing any Government fund or Government money shall, unless the Minister otherwise directs, be sold forthwith.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 4, line 37, to insert after the word &ldquo;fit&rdquo; the words &ldquo;either on his own motion or in consequence of advice given to him under this section by the committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment, I would like to call the attention of Deputy Dockrell to amendments 22 and 23, which are designed to carry out the objects set out in amendments 19 and 21. The suggestion in these amendments is acceptable to me in so far as it confers initiative or withdrawal of a trust upon the committee.  But I cannot properly allow this initiative to rest solely on the committee, and, accordingly, if the section is amended on the lines suggested in amendments 22 and 23 while it would permit the committee to withdraw approval upon its own initiative, it will also permit me upon my own initiative to withdraw approval.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That this Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was properly described as a noncontroversial measure.  On the 9th April, 1930, on the initiative of the Government then in office the Dáil ratified three international conventions; one dealing with unemployment indemnity for seamen in the event of loss or foundering of ships; the second <Col N="1142" /> dealing with the employment of young people on vessels as trimmers or stokers and the third dealing with compulsory medical examination of children and young persons employed on ships.  It was originally intended that the legislation which would give effect to the terms of the conventions would be embodied in the General Merchant Shipping Bill which is in course of preparation.  As the preparation of that Bill has been delayed, it is considered undesirable that the legislation giving effect to these conventions, which were ratified so long ago, should be held up.  That is why this Bill has been introduced.  It is desirable that the legislation of the State should be brought, as quickly as possible, into conformity with the international conventions that we accept.  Clause 1 is the one of main importance.  It provides that where seamen lose employment through the loss or foundering of a ship they would be entitled to continue to receive wages for two months from the date of the loss.  At present, a seaman's right to draw wages terminates upon the date of the loss of a ship.  The original convention has already been ratified by nineteen States, and the enactment of this clause merely brings our law into conformity with the law of other States.  It is considered necessary to make the section retrospective to the date on which the convention was ratified.  It was on that date we undertook the obligations of the convention, and as certain Saorstát ships were lost in the interval it is, I think, desirable that this section should have retrospective effect.  The absence of legislation giving effect to the convention, having regard to the fact that those ships were lost, was the subject of adverse comment at the International Labour Convention.</P>
    <P>Clause 2 is really of no importance to us.  We have ratified the convention, and consequently our law must be brought into conformity.  The practice is that young persons are not employed as trimmers or stokers upon Saorstát ships.  The other clause gave effect to the compulsory medical examination of persons employed on ships.  That is consequential <Col N="1143" /> upon the second one, and as the second one will not be involved, in practice, in respect of ships here, the third is in the same category.  The general merchant shipping legislation will be available at some date in the future, and the passage of this Bill will not necessarily interfere with it in any way.  This Bill would then form part of our general merchant shipping code.</P>

      <P>It appears that the order of Parliamentary business to-morrow would make it very convenient that the Report Stage of the Beet Sugar Bill be taken to-morrow instead of Friday.  If that were possible, there is every probability that the House would not have to sit on Friday.  Accordingly, I would ask the House to discharge the order made that the Report Stage of the Sugar Beet Bill be taken on Friday, and that it be taken to-morrow instead.  I understand that if any objection is taken to-morrow to that procedure the Bill would be taken on Friday.</P>
