      <P>addressed the following Questions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce:</P>
      <P>2:  If he will state the owners or the names and the town or other district of location of each of the three new factories for mattress making stated by him in his statement of the 13th January last to have been opened since March, 1932.</P>
      <P>3:  If he will state the owners or the names and the town or other district of location of each of the four new factories for hosiery stated by him in his statement of the 13th January last to have been opened since March, 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2234" /> 4:  If he will state the owners or the names and the town or other district of location of each of the four new factories for shirts and collars stated by him in his statement of the 13th January last to have been opened since March, 1932.</P>
    <P>5:  If he will state the owners or the names and the town or other district of location of each of the fourteen new factories for ready-made clothing stated by him in his statement of the 13th January last to have been opened since March, 1932.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to Questions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 together.  The position of some of the firms referred to in these questions is being examined in the light of the Control of Manufactures Act.  Apart from this consideration, I am of opinion that the publication by way of answers to Parliamentary Questions of the information required by the Deputy is undesirable having regard to the interests of the firms concerned and the interests of other firms in the same industries.  A Directory of Irish Manufactures is being prepared by my Department and I suggest to the Deputy that he should await its publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am not in a position to give definite information on that point, but we are speeding up the collection of information for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not in a position to give the House any information with regard to developments in manufacturing industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a position to give information, but I do not think <Col N="2235" /> it is desirable, in the interests of all concerned, that the particular information the Deputy asks for in this question should be made public by way of reply to Parliamentary Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to give us the limited information that he gave us in reply to a question similar to this: that while he does not want to give the names of the factories on account of whatever he has in his mind, is he in a position to say that these three factories are situate in such and such a place as far as the mattresses are concerned; that the four factories with regard to hosiery are situate one in Cork, one in Limerick and two where-ever they are?  Surely, the Minister without any trouble could let us have information that would give us an idea of the localities in which these industries are being developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that in relation to a number of these industries the greater part of the development has been in the form of an extension of existing concerns. Partial information published in the form in which the Deputy asks would, I think, create a false idea of the situation in regard to these industries. I would much prefer to give a general view of the position in respect of any industry than to give this partial information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that in October last he gave certain information with regard to the number of new factories that had been put up.  As the result, perhaps, of a more critical examination, he stated in January last that there were 149 factories and classified them under different headings.  Is the Minister not able to give us now the geographical distribution of these firms?  If there is any importance in putting them all together and telling us that there are four new factories set up for hosiery, and so on, surely there is probably some additional importance in telling us where they are located.  If the Minister has a difficulty in giving us the names of <Col N="2236" /> these firms, can he offer us any sound reason why, in addition to telling us, as he has told us, that these have been set up as new factories, he would not say where they are located?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained that I would much prefer to give&mdash;I think it would be much more desirable&mdash;a review of the position, say, in the hosiery and in some of the other industries.  That review of course will appear in the Directory.  I doubt the wisdom of giving in this form partial information in relation to an industry which would create a false idea as to its geographical location, or the degree of development that had taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister doubts the wisdom of letting us know where they are located, can he say what is the wisdom of making a general statement to the effect that four new factories have been started for hosiery, that four new factories have been started for shirts and collars and three new factories for this, that and the other, with a whole long string of numbers and classes of industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all convinced of the wisdom of making such a statement, but the Deputy will recollect that the statement was issued for the purpose of contradicting an incorrect statement which appeared elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy refers to the duties imposed on the imports of flowers, etc., under the Act mentioned.  As part of the general arrangements to meet the situation created by these and other duties, a bounty is payable in respect of exports of horticultural and nursery products exported from this country up to the 31st March, 1933, and subject to these duties.  I should add that the matter of continuance of the bounty arrangements to meet this situation is under consideration.</P>

      <P>(1)  In this section&mdash; the expression &ldquo;the existing capital stock&rdquo; means the respective amounts stated in the second column of the Schedule to this Act of the several denominations stated in the first column of the said Schedule of the capital stock of the company;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the reduced capital stock&rdquo; means the capital stock <Col N="2240" /> of the company as reduced by the operation of this section;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the appointed day&rdquo; means in respect of each denomination of the capital stock of the company the day which is appointed by the Minister under this section to be the appointed day for the purposes of this section in respect of such denomination of the said capital stock.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister shall by order made as soon as conveniently may be after the passing of this Act appoint, in respect of each denomination of the capital stock of the company, a day to be the appointed day for the purposes of this section in respect of such denomination of such capital stock, and different days may be so appointed in respect of different denominations of such capital stock.</P>
    <P>(3)  On and from the appointed day the several denominations of the existing capital stock shall (subject to the operation of the provisions of this section relating to fractions of a pound of stock) become and be reduced to the several amounts respectively stated in the third column of the Schedule to this Act opposite the mention in the first column of the said Schedule of each such denomination of capital stock.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every person who is on the appointed day the holder of any portion of any denomination of the existing capital stock shall, for every hundred pounds of such denomination of such stock so held by him, become and be the holder on the appointed day of that amount of the same denomination of the reduced capital stock which is stated in the fourth column of the Schedule to this Act opposite the mention of such denomination in the first column of the said Schedule, and so in proportion for amounts of stock greater or less than one hundred pounds, but subject in every case to the provisions of this section relating to fractions of a pound of stock.</P>
    <P>(5)  No person shall by the operation of this section become the holder of a fractional part of a pound of the reduced capital stock, and where, but for this sub-section, a person <Col N="2241" /> would so become the holder of a fractional part of a pound of the reduced capital stock on the appointed day, such fractional part shall be treated as one pound and the amount of the reduced capital stock of which such person becomes the holder by virtue of this section shall be increased accordingly.</P>
    <P>(6)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, the respective amounts of the several denominations of the reduced capital stock stated in the third column of the Schedule to this Act shall be deemed to be increased by such amounts as may be rendered necessary by the operation of the next foregoing sub-section of this section, and this section shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>(7) On the appointed day every certificate of a holding of any portion of the existing capital stock shall, without any alteration of such certificate, become and thereafter operate as a certificate for that amount of the reduced capital stock of which the holder of the amount of the existing capital stock stated in such certificate becomes the holder on the appointed day by virtue of this section, but any holder of any portion of the existing capital stock shall be entitled, at any time after the appointed day, to have the certificate of his holding of that portion of the said stock altered by the Company free of charge in such manner as may be necessary to show on such certificate the effect of the operation of this section on the holding which is the subject of such certificate.</P>
    <P>(8)  Sections 10, 11, and 12 of the Great Southern Railways Amalgamation Scheme, 1925, shall apply in relation to the reduced capital stock and the several denominations thereof respectively in like manner in all respects as they apply in relation to the existing capital stock and the several denominations thereof respectively, and accordingly the words &ldquo;every hundred pounds of such stock&rdquo; contained in the said Section 12 shall be construed as meaning every hundred pounds of the reduced <Col N="2242" /> capital stock, other than debenture stock.</P>
    <P>(9)  Where under any agreement made before the passing of this Act the Company is under a legal obligation to pay or make to any other company (whether registered within or outside Saorstát Eireann) a share of or payment out of the receipts or the net receipts derived from any particular part of the railway or the undertaking of the Company, the reduction of the capital stock of the Company effected by this section shall not operate to increase the amount of such share or payment beyond the amount which would be payable under such agreement if this section had not been enacted.</P>
    <P>(10)  Nothing in this section shall entitle the holders or any of the holders of any debenture stock of the Company to appoint a receiver or take any other steps for enforcing the payment of the capital moneys secured by such debenture stock or for enforcing payment of interest for any period subsequent to the appointed day on a greater capital sum than the capital amount to which such debenture stock is reduced by this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>2.  Before Section 3, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Subject to the provisions of this Act, the undertakings of the Irish Omnibus Company, Ltd., and of John Wallis and Sons, Limited, shall, on the 1st day of July, 1933, or such later date in the case of either of such undertakings as the Minister may by order appoint, be transferred by virtue of this Act to and vest in the Company.</P>
      <P>(2)  The transfer effected by this section shall extend in the case of each of the said undertakings to the whole of the undertaking and all the property, rights, powers, duties and liabilities belonging thereto or affecting the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  As from the 8th day of February, 1933, each of the said Companies shall be deemed to have been <Col N="2243" /> carrying on its undertaking for the benefit of the Company, and shall accordingly account to the Company for all assets, benefits and moneys received by it, and shall be indemnified by the Company against all expenses, duties and liabilities whilst so carrying on the same.</P>
    <P>(4)  No stamp duty shall be payable in respect of the transfer to the Company of the said undertakings or of any of the property, assets, or liabilities belonging or attaching thereto.</P>
    <P>(5)  So soon after the 1st day of July, 1933, or such later date as the Minister may by order appoint, each of the said Companies shall by virtue of this Act and such order of the Minister be dissolved, except for the purpose of anything to be done in pursuance of this Act.</P>
    <P>(6)  The provisions contained in the Third Schedule to the Principal Act as amended by the Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Act, 1926 (No. 25 of 1926), shall, with the necessary modifications to adapt them to the circumstances, apply to the officers and servants of each of the said Companies and of the Company as if they were officers or servants of an amalgamating Company and the Company was the amalgamated Company:</P>
    <P>Provided that references in the Third Schedule to the Principal Act and in the said Amending Act to the &ldquo;3rd day of April, 1924,&rdquo; and to an amalgamating Company or the amalgamated Company shall be construed respectively as references to the &ldquo;8th day of February, 1933,&rdquo; and to that one of the said Companies or the Company by whom such employees were so employed; and that the period of seven years after the passing of the Principal Act mentioned in Section 4 of the said Amending Act shall be construed as the period of seven years after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is one, if not one of two, of the most important amendments from our point of view put forward either to the Railways Bill or the Transport Bill, and it is to be hoped, therefore, <Col N="2244" /> that Deputies, before making up their minds as to what they are going to do on the matter, will realise the significance, importance and meaning of this amendment.</P>
    <P>First of all, we are, of course, positively assured by the Minister that his policy and that of the Government is the unification of the transport services of the country either now or as soon as that can be possibly achieved, either by a voluntary or compulsory amalgamation or unification. If that is the considered policy of the Minister and his Party, surely it is desirable that transport services owned by the same shareholding body should be amalgamated under the terms of this Bill.  Deputies, no doubt, are aware that it is some considerable time ago since the Chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company at a meeting which was held, I think, last year, fairly admitted that the firms of John Wallis and Sons, Limited and the Irish Omnibus Company, Limited, were owned by the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways Company. There has been a good deal of opposition, even at the recent meeting, as to why there should be three separate sets of directors, three separate headquarters and headquarters staffs, three separate sets of offices involving all this additional overhead charge, and it was held that it was in the interests of the future prosperity of the company that the services owned by the same shareholding body should be under the central management of the Board of the Great Southern Railways Company controlled by the general manager of that board of directors.</P>
    <P>It might be argued, possibly, that at one period there might have been some necessity or some justification for having the three road services separate from the running of the railway as such.  I think, and I believe it is the opinion of experienced railwaymen, that if the present board of directors, or the directors that have been running the railway for the past eight or nine years, had foreseen, as they should have foreseen, the development of road transport, they would have <Col N="2245" /> made proper provision to endeavour to hold the traffic which has gone to the roads as a result of their failure to make that proper provision for serving the public during the past five years. I know working railwaymen, servants of the Great Southern Railways Company, ordinary workingmen, who suggested some years ago that with the development of uncontrolled road transport there was a great danger of the railway company's losing some of its traffic, and that it would be good business to institute a system of collection and delivery, to make provision for collection and delivery rates, and to meet the threatened road competition which was coming on at that particular period.  The board of directors, of course, were unable to see that the monopoly they held for such a long period&mdash;the monopoly of traffic &mdash;could be taken from them by any means, with the result that two, three or four years ago they were driven into the position of having to purchase the firms of John Wallis and the Irish Omnibus Company in order to hold some of the traffic which had been lost through their own mismanagement and lack of vision.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making provision for the amalgamation or unification of road services other than those owned by the Great Southern Railways Company.  If there is any case for the making of an order by the Minister for the absorption or purchase of a non-railway owned road service, surely there are very good grounds for supporting the unification of those owned by the same shareholding body.  What are the grounds on which the Minister justifies the existing unbusinesslike methods of management and control?  Speaking on the Second Reading of the Bill, the Minister, in answer to a question addressed by Deputy Norton and myself, said that it was his opinion that the same general manager who directs the operation of the railways should also direct the operation of the buses and lorries, so that there should be unified control and definite co-ordination of all the services.  Our amendment, which is very carefully prepared and drafted, is put forward for the sole purpose of assisting the Minister to <Col N="2246" /> bring about that very desirable result. I said in this House before that the road services owned by the Great Southern Railway Company&mdash;both the I.O.C. and the firm of John Wallis and Sons&mdash;were, and are still, taking traffic from the parent company by unfair methods of competition.  Evidence has been produced by persons, whom I accompanied on deputations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and to the President, and previously by deputations to Deputy Cosgrave when he was President, and Deputy McGilligan when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;and that evidence is in the Department and was quite conclusive&mdash;showing that in certain areas the I.O.C. and the firm of Messrs. John Wallis are competing unfairly with the parent company.</P>
    <P>At the recent meeting of the Railway Wages Board in Dublin statements were made, and not contradicted by the company's advocate, the general manager of the company, that between Cork and Cobh there were ten trains each way; but nevertheless the I.O.C., owned by the same body, were running sixteen buses.  Between Cork and Macroom there were four trains and twelve buses; and between Cork and Bandon three trains each way and eleven buses each way.  I doubt if the Minister for Industry and Commerce has any information at his disposal that would justify him in challenging the accuracy of these statements. These statements were made by the union advocate before the Railway Wages Board, in the presence of the general manager of the Great Southern Railway, who was the company's advocate. At any rate reference to the time tables of the I.O.C. and the G.S.R. Company will prove my statement.</P>
    <P>It is said, on the other hand, that there is no competition between Messrs.  Wallis and Sons and the Great Southern Railway in regard to their respective routes for goods traffic.  I shall quote one case.  The representatives of Messrs. Wallis and Sons, some time ago, waited on the firm of Messrs. Gilbey and Co. and pointed out that the railway company were charging Messrs. Gilbey and Co. for certain classes of goods 79/- <Col N="2247" /> per ton between Dublin and Ballina, whereas his firm were willing to quote 34/- per ton by the same route, and thus secured all that traffic which was previously carried at 79/- per ton by rail.  I should like to hear Deputy Good upon that particular matter.  I contend that the figure of 34/- per ton is an uneconomic figure, but whether it is or not, what justification, I ask, is there for one section of the G.S.R. Company working against the other to such an extent?  I wonder do the people of Ballina who buy Messrs. Gilbey's wines and whiskey or other goods they send from Dublin, secure any benefit by way of reduced retail prices for the commodities carried by Messrs. Wallis by road.  Is there any Deputy from Ballina who could tell us that reductions were made in the retail prices of Messrs. Gilbey's wines and spirits?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I forgot that; probably that is the explanation.  With regard to the operations of the I.O.C. and the denial made by the general manager of the railway company, in reply to a statement made by me some time ago, I have given proof that Messrs. Wallis and the I.O.C. are still competing for traffic, which should not be the case according to the policy laid down in these Bills.  The I.O.C. are running a service from Ballina to Dublin and from Dublin to Ballina. A bus is scheduled to start from Ballina to Dublin at 7.45 a.m., and a train is scheduled by the railway company to start for Dublin at the same time.  Of course the bus fare from Dublin to Ballina is cheaper than the railway fare, with the assurance that a person who goes by bus will get well shaken, while a person who travels in a railway carriage will experience no such inconvenience, and no change during the journey.  If there is any necessity for me to quote any other case to prove this suicidal competition that is going on between the I.O.C. and the parent company I am in a position to quote it.  Anybody who may have any doubt about carrying <Col N="2248" /> an amendment of this kind can find the time-tables of the I.O.C. and the G.S.R. in the library and can satisfy himself of the accuracy of the information I am quoting.  The same kind of case can be quoted all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I interested myself some time ago, as I was obliged to, by going to Kings-bridge and making a case for continuing the railway service from Dublin to Edenderry by Enfield.  The railway officials met us very courteously and said they would do all in their power; but what did they do?  They put on a bus from Edenderry to start at the same time as the train with the object of killing one of the services or the other, but really with the object of killing the passenger train service in order to substitute the bus service. Several other Deputies have spoken to me on this matter affecting branch lines in their own areas, and they can confirm from what has happened in their own areas that what I am saying is perfectly true.  What is the justification for the continuance of this cutthroat competition and the continuance of this treble service of management in the Great Southern Railway services? Under the Northern Counties Committee the rail and road services are run by the same body of directors and a general manager.  I am certain there are Deputies listening to me who have large shareholding interests in the Great Southern Railway, and who are naturally interested in seeing that these Bills are made real pro-railway Bills as the Minister intends them to be.  I should like to hear from any of those Deputies, and especially Deputy Good, who is I know in a position to speak in this House on behalf of a large section of shareholders, why there is any necessity or justification for three separate sets of directors.  You have directors on the board of the parent company, and the same or some of the same directors on the board of the I.O.C. and on the board of Wallis and Company, receiving separate fees for controlling in this unbusinesslike way the business of the railway as a whole. Is there any justification why the three services should not be brought under the same board of directors and these <Col N="2249" /> different separate headquarter charges saved?  I shall listen with a good deal of interest, before I say anything further, to what the Minister has to say to this amendment.  I can assure him it was a very difficult amendment to draft, and that in the drafting of it we had the advice of very able lawyers who know something about the industry which has to be dealt with in this measure.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear, first of all, if there is any reason from a business policy point of view, why the services should be separately conducted and controlled, with all these overhead charges which would be unnecessary if the business was under the control of a central management.  I know that disputes have been arising from time to time between the headquarter staff of the Great Southern and those in control of Wallis's and the I.O.C., as to why certain things were done which, in the opinion of the people responsible, the management of the railway, were injuring the railway.  Can anybody imagine a clerk or a stationmaster, who is paid directly from the headquarters of the railway company, being called upon to accompany an agent of Messrs. Wallis and Company to canvass for traffic for Messrs. Wallis by road which, otherwise, could be held for the railway company?  I know that happened.  I know the railway workers who were called upon to do that did not like it, because they knew that unbusinesslike methods like that are likely to lead to the closing down of the railway in the areas which they are serving.  I know the Minister has certain cases of that kind on his file given to him by the representatives of the unions at certain conferences at which I was present.  I hope to take another opportunity of dealing with the amendment after having heard the Minister, and especially after having heard the spokesman for the shareholders, as to the desirability of the amendment and as to the justification for the carrying on of Messrs. Wallis and Company, the I.O.C., and the G.S.R., under three separate boards of directors with the unnecessary overhead charges which that involves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one matter that really requires to be decided in connection with this amendment, and that is whether this amalgamation should be brought about as a result of this amendment, or by the railway company in their own time and at the most convenient season.  Deputy Davin has made a great deal of capital cut of the competition that is going on between the I.O.C., Messrs. Wallis and the railway company, and the dreadful thing that was involved in three sets of directors and various headquarters that were superfluous. But there has to be a beginning to everything.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but there is no doubt I think that the railway company are sincerely anxious to put an end to this state of affairs at the earliest possible moment.  Some of the competition that Deputy Davin has mentioned is, I think, more apparent than real.  While I do not for a moment doubt the accuracy of his statement in the case that he instanced, I can give him instances where Messrs. Wallis's charges are 50 per cent. over those of the railway company.  If you assume that the same sets of directors are controlling the three bodies, you can, at any rate, say that they have lucid intervals. There is no doubt that they are working towards amalgamation, and from that point of view I would much prefer to see the railway company doing this themselves.  There are certain financial difficulties as well as administrative difficulties, and they ought to be given some little time to compose these and bring this amalgamation about in their own time.  I agree with a lot of what Deputy Davin said, but it is much better that the railway company should manage their own affairs than that the State should step in and that on an appointed day and at an appointed hour something should take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment.  May I take this opportunity of congratulating my friend, Deputy Davin, on the very good case he made for it.  He has proved conclusively that the present system is absolutely wasteful, and I think it will be admitted by all Deputies that the <Col N="2251" /> first step which must be taken to put the railways on their feet is to cut out any waste that there is.  If anything was required to drive home the case which Deputy Davin made it was supplied by Deputy Dockrell.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin told us that Messrs. Wallis were quoting rates 50 per cent. less than were quoted by the Great Southern Railway.  Deputy Dockrell, on the other hand, stated that he knows of cases where Messrs. Wallis quoted rates 50 per cent. higher than the Great Southern Railway, and he said that that went to show that the directors of these particular companies had certain lucid intervals at any rate. It seemed to me that it went to show that there was no intelligence displayed in the matter.  The statement of Deputy Dockrell showed that the wasteful competition was much worse than was set before the House by Deputy Davin.  I should like to hear from the Minister, if he is opposing this amendment, or from any Deputy, the reasons against accepting the amendment. Surely if we are trying to put the railways in a position to cut out, as far as possible, outside competition &mdash;whether we say so or not that is the intention in the mind of every Deputy who is in favour of the Bill&mdash;it is absolutely ridiculous to have the railway company's own omnibus and lorry services competing against the railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to cut out unfair and wasteful competition I suggest that the railway company ought to start to set their own house in order.  At the moment I believe that there is a necessity for the closest co-ordination of these three services and that if they are to be worked in an economic and useful way they should be under the same board of directors and the same management. I think the Minister will agree that if you have two separate boards, two separate sets of officials and two general managers in any service, there is bound to be wasteful competition and there is bound to be inefficiency. We ought to aim as far as possible at getting 100 per cent. efficiency on the railways and that cannot be done unless all services owned by the railway company are brought to the point <Col N="2252" /> that the railway company own Messrs. Wallis and the I.O.C., just as they own the rolling stock on the railways. Deputy Dockrell said that it ought to be left to the railway company to do that in their own time and at their own sweet will.</P>
    <P>We know very well what the railway management has succeeded in doing with the railways for a number of years.  We know quite well that unless this House in the interests of the country&mdash;I will go further and say in the interests of the shareholders as well as in the interests of the company, and in the interests of the employees&mdash;gives a direction that at a date, whether it be the 1st July or some time fixed by the Minister&mdash;and if there is one part of the amendment with which I am entirely in disagreement it is that which leaves it to the sweet will of the Minister to fix the time&mdash;these companies shall be absorbed, conditions will become worse.  I agree that there must be a transition period during the bringing together of the three companies and that the question of adjusting finances may take some time, but I think we should state some definite time.  I think that Deputy Davin will agree that putting this matter on the long finger means putting some of the employees in danger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason I stress the point.  I cannot see any reason for the suggestion made by Deputy Dockrell except to give the companies a grip on the employees which they should not have.  Those who were members of the House during the passage of the 1924 Act thought that it was fairly watertight, so far as the employees were concerned, but we know quite well that afterwards the company was able to drive a coach and four through the sections that purported to safeguard the interests of the employees. These are a few of the points I should like to make.  In my opinion if there is any point in this Bill, it is to cut out waste and wasteful competition. To do that I suggest it is only fair that this amendment should be inserted and that the railway competition <Col N="2253" /> panies should start to cut out waste and clear up their own house before they start cutting on the outside.</P>

Deputy Morrissey let the cat out of the bag, I think, when he said that they were disappointed over the 1924 Act and that it had not been at all as watertight, in regard to employees, as the Deputy expected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall hear that in a moment.  I was interested to see Deputy Davin shed crocodile tears over the condition of the railways.  Of course, as usual, he blamed the unfortunate directors for the present financial plight of the railways.  We have heard that on many occasions in this House and I have heard it on many occasions outside the House.  I would attach some importance to it if the financial position of the Irish railways was quite different and distinct from the financial position of the railways in Great Britain or in other parts of the world.  I find that the plight and the difficulties of railways in Great Britain and in other parts of the world are very similar to what I find here in regard to our own railways.  Yet the directors here are blamed.  I hold no brief whatever&mdash;I have been told that I am a shareholder, but I think Deputies might have prefaced that with the word &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo;&mdash;for the directors, and if I were satisfied that the directors were to blame certainly I would have no hesitation in blaming them.  Let me take the case of one very large company in Britain, one of the largest companies which has at its head one of the most celebrated <Col N="2254" /> economists of the present day, a man whose reputation is world-wide, whose name and views we all respect.  That man is head of one of the largest railways in Great Britain, and reading through their balance sheet the other day I was brought face to face with precisely the same difficulties as our railways are confronted with.  Therefore we must get some other solution, and I think it is time we did, for the economic plight of our railways rather than blaming the directors.</P>
      <P>Whatever may be the cause of the trouble in connection with the railways, there is no doubt in my mind at all as to the reasons for putting forward this amendment.  This amendment is not aimed in any sense at benefiting the railways.  The whole object of the amendment is an attempt by the Labour Party to get, for the trade unions, complete control of transport in Southern Ireland.  The position at the moment is that the employees of the railway company belong to one or other of the three big unions, either the National Union of Railwaymen, the Association of Locomotive Engineers or the Railway Clerks' Association. Our railways are controlled by these bodies.  These are English unions having their headquarters in London. Recently there has been a strike on the railways, and it has been brought home to these three big unions that it is absolutely essential if they are to exist in future that they must not alone have control of the railways but also have control of the buses and other forms of transport competing with the railways.  That is the object, so that when they say there is to be a stoppage, the stoppage shall be complete. There is the whole object of this proposal in a few words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, Deputy Davin shed crocodile tears over the condition of the railways, but that is all camouflage. The real object behind this is to get complete control of these particular forms of transport.  If the Minister supported a proposal of this character I would be greatly surprised.  He has been at some pains in this House during the last three months or more to explain to us how necessary it is that the control of industry should be <Col N="2255" /> in the hands of nationals.  He waxed eloquent on many occasions on that proposal.  He has passed through this House and through the Seanad a Bill known as the Control of Manufactures Bill.  The whole object of that Bill is to ensure that the control of industry will be in the hands of nationals.  The whole object of this amendment is to ensure that the control, from the trade union point of view, of the transport industry shall be vested in the three unions which control the railway industry at the moment.  That is the proposal the Minister is asked to support.  If the Minister gives his support to that proposal, with that knowledge before him, I shall be greatly surprised and a good many other people in this country will also be greatly surprised.</P>
    <P>We have heard from the two Deputies who have just spoken that it is utter waste to have these three companies carrying on business that might be better done by one company. I have not sufficient information about the businesses controlled by these three companies to know whether it would be advisable to amalgamate the three of them under one board of directors.  I would not, however, carry that principle too far.  In what we know as mass production at the present day that principle has been carried too far on many occasions.  Efforts have been made to unite too many businesses under one control, and it has been found that instead of increasing efficiency, the standard of efficiency was lowered.  In my opinion it is a matter that should be decided by the boards and their advisers.  They have all the information, all the data, before them, and it would be unwise and unjust for a Parliament to interfere with the discretion of a board as to whether its business would be more efficiently managed by one central board or by a series of boards.  Supposing I were to say to the three big unions which control the transport industry of the country, and which make this small poor country of ours the cockpit for fighting big principles affecting large numbers on the other side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to deal with that problem at all, but it is well known to everybody here that a principle was at issue in Great Britain affecting reductions of wages and if that principle had to be fought in Great Britain it would mean involving and paying 750,000 employees.  That same principle could be fought here&mdash; an effort could be made to establish it here&mdash;at a lesser expense.  That was why the trouble was brought about in the North of Ireland.  It was even cheaper to settle it in the North of Ireland than it would be in the South of Ireland, where there are larger numbers.  It is exceedingly unwise, no matter from what point you take it, to give this additional power to these particular bodies.  I will go further with the analogy.  Supposing I were to put down an amendment to the effect that these three unions should amalgamate under one central board and pointed out that it was gross waste to have three staffs and three headquarters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was merely giving a typical illustration.  The purport of this amendment is to amalgamate these three boards under one central management. As an analogy I am taking the three Labour unions.  Every argument that Deputy Davin put forward could be applied with equal force to an amendment suggesting the amalgamation of the three Labour unions.  I know something of Deputy Davin and the House knows something of Deputy Davin and other Labour leaders and we have experienced their attitude when proposals were put forward dealing with labour matters which they considered should be left entirely to the Labour unions.  I cannot imagine Deputy Davin waxing more eloquent on any subject than he would on that <Col N="2257" /> subject, had I put forward a similar amendment to the one he has submitted, specifying the three unions instead of the three boards.  I am quite satisfied that the railway company, notwithstanding all the abuse that is being poured on the members of its board, is the best authority to deal with this particular question.  It is only on their authority that I would rely.  They have all the data and experience and it is for them really to settle the question. I would make exactly the same remark with regard to the three labour unions. Deputy Davin, no doubt, would say to me: &ldquo;This is an intolerable interference with the rights of the trade unions.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If we were to take serious notice of the utterances of Deputy Good, I think the Minister would do well to withdraw completely from the legislation he is advocating, seeing that the management of transport generally in the country is being carried out in a sufficiently magnificent manner and to the abundant satisfaction of everybody.  Deputy Good believes that the directors of the railways are the best people to do their own job in their own way.  He tried to draw an analogy with respect to the unification of the railway unions.  If such an amalgamation were necessary, the labour unions would be quite satisfied to bring it about; but they are not going to seek for State aid in doing their own job.  Deputy Good conveniently forgets that we are making a present of £285,000 to cover up the ineptitude and mismanagement which have brought transport into the chaotic condition in which it is to-day.  It is because of that ineptitude and inefficiency on the part of the management that we are enacting this legislation to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2258" /> We are asked to perpetuate that menace to transport, that origin of all chaos, by keeping three sets of nonentities, styled boards of directors, who are drawing fat salaries and who are carrying on an insane, cut-throat competition, one with the other, with money belonging to the shareholders of whom Deputy Good is one.  Deputy Davin has quoted instances where they are not working in co-operation, but in direct competition with each other. Such instances could be quoted <i>ad lib.</i> without challenge.  Is Deputy Dockrell prepared to produce one scintilla of evidence that these boards will be more sensible in their attitude in the future? We are asked to give them a prolonged lease of life in order to allow them to continue to do the mad, chaotic things they have been doing.  We are asked to give them a subsidy in order to permit them to carry on for a further period.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Minister that we can secure the unification which he himself has admitted to be desirable. The Minister indicated quite recently, and the President also indicated that unification was one of the things that must be secured if chaos is to be eliminated from the transport industry. The Minister says he can secure it by a stroke of the pen.  Deputy Dockrell says it must be brought about at the sweet will of the boards of management and in their own time.  Deputy Good denounced the principle entirely and declared that it was tending towards control by the unions.  I cannot see the relevancy of that.  Deputy Good says that this proposal is a direct attempt to secure control of the transport industry by the railway unions.  I will leave that to his own imagination. The amendment speaks for itself.  It asks that these three contracting parties who are benefited by this amalgamation be brought under one control in the interests of the transport industry of this country.  Let us have the other side.  Deputy Morrissey has made a suggestion on this matter.</P>
    <P>Is there something sinister behind the reluctance of these three contracting parties to come into the amalgamation at once rather than to come in at their own sweet will?  I <Col N="2259" /> suggest there is.  The Minister is handing over this Bill to the companies allowing them to bring about amalgamation at their own sweet will.  If he is callous enough to do that we will find later on that there will be a very attenuated staff, and many of the servants of these companies will be dismissed rather than have dismissal take place after the amalgamation.  That I suggest is the policy that is in opposition to this amendment.  These men will be thrown away, as a disused writing pen when it has served their purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good has been at great pains to bring in something about Deputy Davin's crocodile tears.  I wonder if there have not been greater crocodile tears on the part of the Deputy.  We have heard from Deputy Dillon about the poor old ladies with a few railway debentures.  There is no sympathy in the heart of Deputy Dillon for the men who are now to be victimised in addition to the thousands of men who are at present walking the streets of this country and who are drawing outdoor relief as the only means of keeping them from starvation.  In the opposition to this amendment there is the very same fell purpose on the part of the management to get rid of its redundant staff without compensation.  They want to get rid of them in advance without any compensation.  I ask anybody who is interested in the progress of the transport industry and who wants to see it run on successful lines to say that the principle enshrined in this amendment is essential to the success of that transport industry.  In order to have that industry run on right lines it must be run under the control of one body.  I say that the railway company, having got advantages on the one hand, they ought to take the risk on the other hand by giving legitimate compensation to those men who may be found redundant.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keyes who is carried away by the flood of his own eloquence, made reference to the fact that I mentioned that debenture holders and preference shareholders were not bloated plutocrats.  He then went on to <Col N="2260" /> say that I had great sympathy for these people, but not for the faithful servants of the railway companies.  Will Deputy Davin repeat that statement, or will he tell this House that when some members of his union were being dismissed and their homes being broken up, I went to the management to make a case for them, and I was told by the members of the Labour Party that the rule of the railway unions was &ldquo;last in first out&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>In my opinion this amendment has no merits.  It is divided into two sections:&mdash;(1) to make amalgamation compulsory, (2) to get conditions appertaining to the railway service prescribed for all services under the road transport companies. As regards the first part of the amendment, my view is that it is like a bull in a china shop.  The Minister said on the Second Reading that he saw that these three companies must be amalgamated.  He said that he would see that they would be amalgamated and that the directors are given a full and adequate undertaking that they would be amalgamated at the earliest possible moment.  Deputy Davin should know that in an amalgamation of this kind a variety of complicated and elaborate considerations come up for review. These things cannot be done like that. They may take time.  They require a certain amount of negotiations.  It is absolute folly to attempt to rush operations of this kind by ill-informed and ignorant legislation.</P>
      <P>There would be something to be said for this amendment if the Minister for Industry and Commerce had not made it perfectly clear on the Second Stage of the Bill that this aspect of the situation had his attention and that adequate safeguards would be in the Bill to ensure that the three companies would be amalgamated and that one board of directors would suffice.  At the moment it is calculated to be anything but helpful to drag complicated financial matters of this kind into a public discussion here.  The Minister's speech on the records is quite sufficient guarantee that the amalgamation will be carried out at the earliest possible moment.  If the amalgamation were not carried out that speech might be made the basis for raising the whole matter here again and taking him to task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such an amendment as this can do nothing but injury to the transport industry.  If the Minister wants to make a defence of his Bill as it at present stands it is by rejecting this amendment.  That amendment must go out.  It is highly inconvenient for everybody.  As far as the second part of the amendment calling for certain <Col N="2262" /> action is concerned, it will eventually result in the three big railway unions getting the transport industry in this country into their hands.  I was gratified at seeing the move made by Deputy Good to the left.  I was glad to see Deputy Good's move to the extreme of angry nationalism.  I was glad to hear him give whole-hearted support to the principle incorporated in the Control of Manufactures Bill.  In that matter I am in sympathy with Deputy Good.  I think it is a monstrous thing that trade unions with their headquarters in England should be in a position to dictate to the community here and to paralyse the entire transport industry of this country whenever they take it into their heads.  I agree with Deputy Good that the strike at present in the North of Ireland is largely due to the fact that the National Union of Railwaymen wanted to try out here the strike on the principle of a more economic balance-sheet.  Our men in the North are suffering because of that strike.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may rest assured that I seldom simulate ignorance.  In fact, the Minister for Industry and Commerce tries to make out that I simulate omniscience.  When dealing with this amendment there was criticism of the directors.  I presume Deputy Keyes was in order in referring to the directors as nonentities and persons anxious to victimise the servants of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that criticism was largely unjustified and was of no value for the purpose of this amendment. The directors may be fairly criticised for many things, one being that despite their combined efforts they have been able to clean the railway carriages, which one would imagine would be a comparatively easy thing to do.  If there is to be criticism of the directors I do not think we should forget, when considering the amendment, that the railway unions have insisted on conditions in this country which, in some cases, result in it being necessary for the directors to employ two engine drivers to do the work of one, and that on many branch lines it will be found their uneconomic condition is largely due to the conditions insisted upon by the railwaymen's union.  Perhaps there are two trains running in the day to some of these places, one at 9 o'clock in the morning and one at 6 o'clock in the evening, but two engine drivers must be kept there, because these men cannot work more than eight hours, although their work consists largely of bringing two trains there daily.  The same applies to railway porters and to <Col N="2264" /> other officials who are not allowed to work broken hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw the word &ldquo;gang.&rdquo;  In face of criticism of that kind it is difficult to restrain one's language carefully, because one is driven to generalities which are as indefensible as the statement made by Deputy Keyes.  Deputy Keyes went on to say that legislative amalgamation is literally asked for in exchange for a subsidy from the nation for the railways in order to restore them to a position of solvency, as a result of incompetency.  He forgot to add that there is a subsidy in an indirect way given by this Bill, which will possibly <Col N="2265" /> be more than balanced by the liabilities which we are giving to the railway company in Section 7.  I do not wish to prejudge the issue in any way.  I have no desire to be told later on that I am making the enemy's case, that I am instructing Sir Josiah Stamp in railway matters, or that I am giving wrinkles to the law agent of the L.M.S. Company.  But I am suggesting that there is a possible liability which may conceivably arise.  Deputy Morrissey detected some sinister purpose in the resistance to this amendment. I have now entirely forgotten what the sinister purpose was, so that I am not in a position to deal with it.  It was something quite as preposterous as the reference by Deputy Keyes to the Board of Directors.  I submit that the first part of this amendment is drafted in ignorance of all the circumstances surrounding the case, that it is calculated to do nothing but damage, and to achieve nothing that will not be achieved if the amendment were not passed.  The amendment is directed towards making the employees of the road company subject to the same conditions as the employees of the railway company, and to bring them within the ambit of the three big railway unions.  I am not so extremely national on that subject as Deputy Good, but I am prepared to go this far and to say that, in my opinion, the English unions have quite enough power in this country without getting more.  I would prefer to see these men in the secondary branch of the service operating under conditions where they would ordinarily turn to Irish unions for the usual trade protection that workmen are entitled to. On these two grounds I think the Minister should reject the amendment and stand fast in his rejection.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having settled the question of the railway directors and the strike I would like to get back to the case for the amendment.  The members on the Labour Benches say that they heard quite a number of cases made against the amendment.  Deputy Davin was suffering some time ago from blushes brought on him by congratulations from Deputy Morrissey on <Col N="2266" /> the case made for the amendment.  I do not think Deputy Davin made such a case for the amendment.  In fairness to what was in the mind of the Deputy, and in fairness to a certain section, it would be well if the position was cleared up somewhat.  As I understand it the amendment would secure that the two companies mentioned would come under the control administratively of the railway company, that there would be an amalgamated company consisting of the railway company, Messrs.  Wallis and the I.O.C., and that as a result of the amalgamation we would have administrative control by a single company, so that such duplications as the Deputy considers absurd would be in time eliminated. The second point that arises on the amendment is in regard to the capital of the two companies&mdash;the Irish Omnibus Company and Wallis and Sons.  I should like to hear what the intention of the Deputy is with regard to that capital.  Under the schedules of the Railway Bill, the existing capital is being written down, and it seems to me that, under the amendment, the capital of the Irish Omnibus Company and Wallis and Sons would be taken and thrown into a general pool without any arrangement being made as to how the present railway shareholders or the shareholders of these two companies would stand, either in relation to the capital of the two companies or the general amalgamated capital that would eventuate from the passing of this amendment.  I should like to hear the Deputy on that point.  The third point is with regard to the right to compensation of employees of these companies who, as a result of any economy in organisation, may be deemed redundant.  The intention of the Minister, I take it, is to have a situation brought about here in respect of transport that will result in the amalgamation of these two companies with the railway company. In any such amalgamation, I see no reason why the employees of these two bodies should not be made as secure as the employees of the Dublin South Eastern Railway Company were made when the amalgamation of the railways took place.  I am given to <Col N="2267" /> understand that in neither the Railway Bill nor the Transport Bill is there any promise of security for the employees of these two companies.</P>
      <P>I ask the Deputy again to develop the case for this amendment, because I take it that he accepts it as the intention of the Minister to bring about in time the amalgamation of these two companies, and that he is particularly interested in the position in which the present employees of these bodies will find themselves after amalgamation&mdash; what security they will have with regard to further employment or what compensation will be given them if they are dislodged.  The Deputy thought it well to inform the House that this was not a common or garden amendment, that it was put together by a lawyer or lawyers, about whom at other times the Deputy is supercilious.  I should like to know whether the Deputy was really concerned with sub-section (6) or whether the professional draftsman coming up against the point involved in No. 6, said: &ldquo;We will simply have to make a complete job of this; we cannot set up the position of these employees satisfactorily except we bring about the amalgamation of the companies.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Deputy that, when he thinks the matter over, he will find that he is not concerned with the arrangement of the capital of these two companies, that he is prepared really to leave the settlement of that aside for a while&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the Deputy is talking, apparently, with some information, perhaps he would tell us more about the capital of the company and how the company was purchased.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything about it.  I am talking without any information at all.  When, as in this amendment, we are asked to amalgamate three companies, I suspect that two of these have some capital, that there are people with shares in these companies, and that there is some money behind them.  If you take these two companies and amalgamate them with another&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Deputy Mulcahy aware that the chairman of the company <Col N="2268" /> stated at the shareholders' meeting last year that the two companies were owned by the shareholders? The question of capital should not be brought in at this stage to confuse the issues raised by the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not introducing the question of capital to confuse things.  I am introducing it to get matters clarified.  If the Deputy can assure the House that there will be no capital complications in the carrying out of the amalgamation of Wallis and Sons and the I.O.C. with the railway company, then my path will be somewhat smoothed.  I am interested in seeing that the employees of a firm like Wallis's, who have been more or less official carriers for the railway company for years and years, should have some security as regards their future if amalgamation is brought about.  This firm has a large number of employees, some of them with very long service. We should be certain that these employees will get the same conditions as were extended to the employees of the Dublin South-Eastern Railway Company when the railways were amalgamated.  I am not introducing the question of capital to confuse the situation at all.  I think the Deputy will appreciate that what is involved here as regards capital is a serious obstacle to every Deputy in casually accepting this amendment without any explanation of the difficulties by the proposer.  I feel that sub-section 6 of this amendment is what the Deputy is really concerned about.  That contains a principle that I, and most of our people here, would be prepared to support. But I think that the lawyers or lawyer whom Deputy Davin spoke about told him that they would have to make a complete job of it.  I think the Deputy, for the purpose of having a completely rounded amendment, has been led into stretching his net much wider than it would be useful to go.  I support the Deputy as regards sub-section 6.  I do not think he himself knows what is being done in this amendment as regards capital and I am not disposed to support the Deputy in that respect. I should like to hear what the Minister <Col N="2269" /> has to say as regards bringing about the control that the Deputy seeks at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no knowledge whatever of the business administration of either of these companies, but I know a little of the administration of the railways.  On the question of amalgamation, as embodied in this amendment, there is one point which I support to the full. I ask the Minister's consideration of it. It is common knowledge that these two carrying companies, the Irish Omnibus Company and John Wallis and Son, Ltd., have been carrying on a co-operative business with the railway in the carrying of goods.  From information that we have, the position is that if people tender goods to the railway they find themselves charged a certain freightage and, on going to either of the other two companies, they find that they can get their goods carried at a cheaper rate.  That seems extraordinary. There was one case some time ago in which a bicycle was tendered to the Great Southern Railway. The freight charged was exorbitant and it was brought to the Irish Omnibus Company and taken by them at a reduced rate, and the Irish Omnibus Company sent it to the railway company, who brought it to its destination.  That is a small instance of what is going on and which has caused a good deal of the contention that arises regarding these two companies.  I think there is a strong case to be made for their amalgamation.  If they have been working together and co-operating with the railways they ought to be combined in one company.  There are other things in the amendment which need a good deal of consideration before they could be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with Deputy Davin as to the necessity of securing unification in the direction and management of the three transport undertakings owned by the Great Southern Railways Company.  In fact, I think that there are very few people who have given any consideration to the position of transport in this country who are not of the same <Col N="2270" /> opinion.  The only question on which difference might exist as between Deputy Davin and myself and other Deputies who have spoken on the matter is as to the means by which that unification is to be secured.</P>
      <P>I stated here, on the Second Reading of the Bill, that the only reason why amalgamating clauses did not appear in the Bill was the assurance I had received from the railway company that amalgamation would, in fact, be carried out.  It would be exceedingly difficult to draft amalgamating clauses. There are difficulties associated with the ownership and liability of these other road undertakings which could not be easily resolved.  No doubt, if we set out to resolve them, we could do it, but, in view of the fact that they are going to be resolved for us, I see no reason why we should attempt it. I have been definitely assured again by the Great Southern Railways Company that the amalgamation which is possible will be achieved within six months from this date, and I assure the Dáil that, if, in fact, amalgamation is not achieved by then, I will introduce here the necessary proposals for legislation to effect it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties I have referred to, however, justify the course of action I am recommending.  By unification, I take it, Deputies mean the bringing under the direction of one board the activities of the three companies and the appointment of one general management to control them.  It may be necessary, because of the legal and financial difficulties to which I have referred, to maintain in theory the existence of three separate companies for a while longer than six months. On that I am not in a position to express an opinion, but the assurance I have received is to the effect that there will be one board of directors and one general manager for all the activities now conducted by the three companies within six months from this date, and the assurance I give the Dáil is that, if, for any reason, such action is not taken, I will have the necessary proposals for legislation before the House for its consideration.  I think that statement on my part would justify the withdrawal of the amendment.  Even <Col N="2271" /> if the amendment were passed, I doubt very much if the amalgamation which it proposes to achieve could be carried out within less than six months.  The amendment by itself has a number of flaws in it which arise naturally from the lack of information which those responsible for its drafting laboured under&mdash;a lack of information which would constitute a considerable difficulty even if the amendment were being drafted officially, but which could be overcome, no doubt, in time, if official proposals have to be brought to the House.</P>
    <P>The other points that arose out of the debate I do not think will cause very great concern.  The statements made by Deputy Good, which have been made quite recently by other ultra-nationalists like himself are, I think, of no consequence whatever.  The idea has been created in certain quarters that, by amalgamating road and rail services, we are producing a position in which one union or one group of unions would be able to effect a complete stoppage of transport services at any time if they desired to do so.  I do not see how that position is going to be created or prevented by any action we take in a matter of this kind.  So far as I am aware, most of the employees of the Irish Omnibus Company, at the present time, are members of the National Union of Railwaymen, so that, if the National Union of Railwaymen wanted to stop these omnibus services now, they could do it and they could continue to do it in the future if the Irish Omnibus Company disappeared and the services were run directly by the Great Southern Railways Company. On the other hand, so far as I am aware, most of the omnibus services which are owned and controlled by the Great Northern Railway Company are staffed by men who are not members of the National Union of Railwaymen and yet the services stopped, so that no change in the management and direction can possibly affect that position.  If an amalgamation of unions takes place in respect of one trade dispute sufficient to stop services then the services, presumably, will be stopped no matter who is <Col N="2272" /> responsible for the management or who owns them.  If, on the other hand, the unions are not in a position to do that, the position will be reversed, no matter what the management or the ownership is, so that I do not think there is any point to be made in that connection at all&mdash;certainly, no convincing point.</P>
    <P>There is one question that arises out of the amendment and that is the possibility of redundancy in the staffs of the road transport undertakings in the event of their being amalgamated with the rail undertaking.  I have gone into that, however, and I am quite satisfied that there need be no redundancy except amongst the directors and in the management and I am sure that Deputy Davin will accept my statement that anybody rendered redundant amongst the directors or in the management of the companies will, probably, be amply provided for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  If this amendment is not passed, in bringing about unification by legislation, will the shareholders of the company be in a position to give large sums by way of compensation to the directors and highly-placed officials, and to ignore payment of compensation to ordinary workers who may become redundant?</P>

      <P>My point is that as far as the ordinary clerical or outdoor staff are concerned there is going to be no redundancy.  Instead of there being redundancy, I rather contemplate that the staffs will have to be increased, because of the provisions of the Road Transport Bill and the other provisions of this Bill.  The services which will be operated by the new organisation will be the sum of the services now being operated by the separate organisations.  At least the same staff will be required, and, as the services <Col N="2273" /> will probably be increased arising out of the elimination of other services, increased staff will probably be required.  If I thought there was any real danger of redundancy I would say that there was a case for a provision of this kind, even though it would off-set considerably the waste to the elimination of which Deputy Davin referred, because waste would arise out of duplication and redundancy would be the consequence of that duplication.  I do not think the danger exists at all. On the contrary, I think the position will be that the staff will have to be increased, in order to provide for the new services and the new traffic that will arise when the Road Transport Bill comes into effect, and that the amalgamation does not effect any overlapping apart from the management and the boards of directors.</P>

I do not see what type of legislation we could devise to prevent things of that kind happening, except we take power to say that no man shall be dismissed without Ministerial sanction or an act of the Dáil.  I can assure Deputy Morrissey that in the matter of enforcing certain conditions which should apply where redundant employees have to be dismissed the trade unions have shown themselves quite strong enough to ensure that their point of view will be considered, and as far as I am aware they have&mdash;if not a definite agreement with the Great Southern Railway Company&mdash; secured what is tantamount to a regular practice in the matter of dispensing with employees for whom there is no work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it, in the first instance, the organisations responsible for safeguarding the interests of those employees will act; I am quite certain they will act.  It would be only in the event of injustice arising out of something we effect on grounds of public policy that the question of insisting on compensation would arise. Undoubtedly in such circumstances I would insist on compensation.  That is <Col N="2275" /> why compensation provisions are in the Bill in relation to the closing of branch lines.  The act would take place with the permission of the Government, or in consequence of the fact that changes had taken place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In those circumstances I think there is a case for compensation, but where there is no ground for assuming that redundancy is likely to arise the introduction of compensation provisions would be unnecessary, and would in fact impede rather than facilitate the position we want to bring about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister and the House to safeguard the position of the men.  If the Minister says redundancy will not arise, what is his objection to putting in the clause?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Definitely, the reason why it is not going in is, first of all, because we are not enforcing amalgamation. We are taking the view that amalgamation is something the railway company should undertake of its own accord as a step towards sounder management.  We may be in the position&mdash;I do not think it is likely&mdash;where we would enforce amalgamation.  The main reason why we are anxious to see amalgamation brought about is not for the purpose of saving whatever comparatively small sum of money will be saved by it, but to ensure that there are going to be in charge of the transport services in a great part of this country men who are not merely railway directors, but men who will regard themselves as in charge of a transport organisation obliged to provide the type of transport which the public convenience necessitates.  I do think that <Col N="2276" /> the development of transport on sound lines has been retarded by the fact that we had controlling a large part of the transport organisation men who were purely railway directors, considering every question from the point of view of effect on the railways, and other men who were interested in road services and not in railways.  We want a board of directors that is not going to be a railway board or a road transport board, but both combined, charged with the responsibility of ensuring efficient services.  That is the reason for the amalgamation.  That is why we are taking certain steps to ensure that it will come about.  That is why I say that if it is not achieved within six months legislation to compel it will be introduced.  I want to say that I have found that the persons responsible for railway management have exactly the same point of view, and have given me an assurance that amalgamation will in fact be achieved before six months have elapsed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are difficulties, arising out of the manner in which those enterprises have been financed, which would make it exceedingly difficult to draft legislation that would cover every point.  It is much better that amalgamation should be effected by the company itself in the manner in which it is proposed, because it would mean that those difficulties would be met by people who have full knowledge of the facts, which otherwise it would be very difficult to obtain.</P>

There are, I know, these difficulties.  These will be overcome.  You will have within <Col N="2277" /> six months the position that most people consider necessary, and that the railway companies are prepared to achieve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister certainly showed admirable adroitness in getting away from the point about safeguarding the rights of the men.  Is the Minister prepared to put into the Bill a section which will safeguard their position?  He says that he is quite satisfied that there will be no redundancy; that they will want extra men.  If that is so, then surely he ought not to have any objection to putting in a saving clause such as I suggest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not taking it upon myself to say that there will be no redundancy in transport.  I am definitely of the opposite point of view. I do not think that we can take upon ourselves the obligation to direct matters of that kind.  These matters are arranged between the companies on the one hand and by the unions on the other.  I am quite satisfied that if any question of that kind arises it will be adjusted.  We are not taking the position that this is necessarily going to result in redundancy.  Quite the contrary.  Nothing that we are doing, or that will arise out of this amalgamation, will necessarily mean redundancy. I would say the result may be quite the contrary.  My expectation is that the staffs responsible for the services now being conducted by this and the other organisations will have to be increased because the services are going to be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Minister's opinion.  The Minister, in the course of his remarks, talked about what happened between the trade unions and the railway companies prior to this.  We had experience of what occurred under the 1924 Act, and that is why we want to try to safeguard the position.  We know that the trade unions were not able to secure justice for the men who were rendered redundant as the result of the passing of the 1924 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about a different thing altogether. <Col N="2278" /> Under the 1924 Act the railway companies were amalgamated for the purpose of creating redundancy and reducing the costs of administration. This is an entirely different operation altogether.  This is not the amalgamation of two railway companies, but the bringing of a road transport organisation and a railway transport organisation together for the purpose of getting unified management.  That need not necessarily mean redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister visualises a continuance of the services referred to by Deputy Davin, services which are generally considered to be wasteful, and that his hopes with regard to redundancy are based on that, then I am afraid he is unduly optimistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a railway and a bus service between Dublin and Limerick.  I do not think that the bus service between these two cities should be stopped, although I do not imagine that very many people travel all the way by bus from Dublin to Limerick. I imagine the railway company would adjust its rates so as to attract people to travel by rail, but it has to be remembered that the bus service between these two cities connects up a lot of fairly large towns and serves the public need.  What we contemplate is that the road and railway services are going to be brought into closer relationship with one another.  We contemplate the road service gradually growing as the transport needs of the country grow.  It is hardly necessary to emphasise the point that people to-day require far more transport than they did fifty years ago.  We think there is going to be a very definite increase in the road services operated by the railway companies, because of the provisions in the Road Transport Bill. That is why we contemplate an increase in the number of people employed on the road services operated by the railway companies.</P>

      <P>I do not see why there should be any dismissals.  There is no advantage to be gained by the railway company in dispensing with anyone whose services are required.  The Deputy may take it as certain that there is no one in the employment of the Great Southern Railways, of Messrs. John Wallis or of the I.O.C. at the present time whose service is not required.  I think that every person who could be dispensed with by these organisations has been dispensed with during the last few years because of the tightening of the financial position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This projected amalgamation of the I.O.C. and John Wallis and Co. with the Great Southern Railways seems to rest on the Minister's view of what is likely to happen, plus what some railway director or directors told him.  On the last occasion on which he spoke the Minister appeared to be much more definite about the projected amalgamation than he is to-day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I have not the reference at my hand.  I was listening to the Minister's speech, in which he certainly implied that a railway director told him the amalgamation could be achieved by a stroke of the pen.  At all events, the Minister's Second Reading speech and his declaration to-day make it clear that he believes that the amalgamation of these companies with the Great Southern Railways is desirable from the transport point of view.  It was clearly to be inferred from what the Minister said that if there was any obstruction to that amalgamation, either on the part of the directors of the railway companies or of the other services, he would take power within six months to effect the amalgamation in a compulsory way.  It was clear that he desired to have the amalgamation carried out on a voluntary basis rather than be obliged to use compulsory <Col N="2280" /> powers, his view being that a voluntary amalgamation would obviate certain difficulties which might arise under compulsory amalgamation.  But, in the end, the result is the same; that he is either going to have voluntary amalgamation if the companies agree, or compulsory amalgamation if they display any opposition.  At all events, we will have a position created where these three companies will function in the future as one.  If there was to be compulsory amalgamation the Minister could not possibly resist the claim for compensation for those disemployed as the result of it.  The Minister prefers voluntary amalgamation, and, because he does, he justifies it only to get rid of certain legal difficulties.  He does not propose to make provision for compensation for the staff now employed by those services who may lose their employment as a result of this voluntary amalgamation.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in resisting the claim for compensation either in the event of voluntary or compulsory amalgamation, tells the House that he cannot see how redundancy or unemployment is going to result.  But the Minister is not infallible in these matters.  He has frequently given expression to opinions in this House that were not justified by subsequent developments.  He has frequently painted rosy pictures of the industrial development that was going to take place by building the tariff wall higher and higher.  The rosy promises made by the Minister have certainly not been fulfilled, as the unemployment position in the country will surely indicate to him.  Now we are told, because the Minister at this stage cannot see that any unemployment will result from this amalgamation, that therefore it is unnecessary to make any provision by way of compensation for those who lose their employment.  I would ask the Minister to call together a meeting of the employees who will be affected by this amalgamation and ask them whether they are quite satisfied to rely on his promises in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the position is that the amalgamation, voluntary or compulsory, will not bring about any unemployment, then, there will be no financial burden put upon the amalgamated company, <Col N="2281" /> in which case the Minister, if he put in a compensation clause, would be putting in a safeguard which might not be used and, if not used, would impose no burden on the company. I suggest to the Minister that, if his only objection to providing for compensation is a fear that the compensation clause will not be adverted to or invoked in order to secure compensation in the event of dismissal, the Minister can afford to dispense with that excessive sense of legislative tidiness and might go to the extent of putting in a clause to provide for compensation for any unemployment which might be caused as a result of amalgamation.  From the point of view of the employees, it is poor consolation to know, if they are dismissed, that the dismissals have surprised the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If they lose their employment as a result of the amalgamation, it is poor consolation to those who lose that employment for the Minister to say that it is something he did not anticipate.  At any rate, the Minister's surprise will not pay many bakers or grocers.</P>
    <P>I think it is very desirable that if this amalgamation is to be brought about, whether by pressure through compulsion or by representations to the railway company, that compensation should be provided for these people who may lose their employment as a result of the State's bringing about amalgamation of the three competing services.  The Minister said yesterday to Deputy Morrissey that if amalgamation does bring about redundancy or unemployment&mdash; which is another name for it&mdash;it is a matter for the men's unions to make representations to the company.  The Minister says that the railway unions have agreements at the present time covering that point.  It is a pity that he did not say what kind of agreements they have on that point.  The Minister ought to know that they are legislative agreements.  The railway unions can make representations in case of redundancy because they have legislative agreements, but if they went making representations without <Col N="2282" /> these agreements, would they get the same hospitable reception as the Minister imagines?  What reception does he think they will get if they go to the railway companies or the amalgamated company with no legislative agreement but merely on the moral ground that they ought to be compensated, having regard to the circumstances in which they did lose their employment?  They can do it only because they have legislative agreements on the point of redundancy.  If they had no legislative agreements, I am afraid that the results of their negotiations would be very poor.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to make sure that the amalgamated company would pay adequate compensation to those employees who lose their employment as a result of the amalgamation, then he ought not to object, if he pretends to stand at all for the interests of the employee, to put in a provision in this Bill to secure that the same legislative agreements will be there which will enable the unions in this case as well as in the case of the railway companies to go to the amalgamated company and secure compensation for those who have lost their employment as a result of amalgamation. The Minister has made no provision whatever for compensating those who have lost their employment as a result of amalgamation.  It will not be a financial burden and, if it is not a financial burden, what is the objection to putting in a safeguard to make sure that these employees will get compensation?  If the safeguard has to be availed of then it is proof that the Minister, when he said there would be no unemployment, clearly was talking without any precise knowledge of the possible developments of amalgamation.  What the Minister is doing, or is seeking to do, is to bring about a voluntary amalgamation to enable the amalgamated company to do what it likes with the staff&mdash;to dismiss the staff who, in many cases, have given considerable service to them&mdash;and to make no provision whatever to give any compensation to the people who have lost their employment.  This is the <Col N="2283" /> pro-railway Party; this is the pro-railway Minister; this is the pro-workingman Government; and yet the Minister resorts to all kinds of debating dodges to avoid the safeguarding of compensation for these people who may lose their employment as a result of this amalgamation, and who will derive very little consolation from the fact that the Minister did not know that unemployment would come about through amalgamation.</P>

      <P>In listening to the speeches of Deputies it appears to me that we are forgetting one side of the problem altogether in talking about amalgamation.  This is a private concern in which there are 27,000 shareholders. 7,795 of these have holdings of less than £500 in value.  When the Deputy talks about compensation, he considers only the question of labour. I have stated here before that as far as I am concerned one likes to see that labour gets fair play, but I should like to see all the people concerned getting fair play.  Let us contrast the position of the two at the moment.  Labour in the Great Southern Railways Company, at the moment, has, according to the statement of the Chairman, wages 140 per cent. more than pre-war.</P>

There are 27,000 shareholders in the railway company with which it is proposed to amalgamate Wallis's, and the shares of these unfortunate shareholders have been reduced in value from £100 to £5. There are Deputies in all parts of the House who can tell of families who are <Col N="2284" /> absolutely starving as a result of this reduction in the value of their capital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to show that when you are dealing with problems of this magnitude you must not only consider the injury done to one particular section.  We must be fair and I would ask the Deputies, while I have a certain amount of sympathy with their side of the matter, to consider also and sympathise with the unfortunate shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised that Deputy Good and Deputy Dockrell, the President of the Chamber of Commerce, could not and did not face a discussion on the merits of this amendment as to whether it is in the business interests of the Great Southern Railway Company and the 27,000 pauperised shareholders of that concern to allow competition of that kind to be carried on even for another six months.</P>
      <P>Deputy Good and one of his new recruits, Deputy Dillon, endeavoured to show that the object of the amendment was to try to secure control over the amalgamated company by unions with headquarters in England.  I am not going to stress the undesirability of giving control to members of unions with headquarters outside the State in matters of this kind, but none of these objections were raised in 1916, in 1918, or in 1921 when the members of the same unions were in the front line trenches fighting for this country and when Deputy Dillon's voice was not heard in this House or out of it on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed my voice was raised loud and long on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate whether the headquarters of those concerned were in Ireland, or elsewhere, the policy of the Irish Railway Union is set by the Irish members of the union.  It will not be news to Deputy Dillon to know that the Irish Party up to a certain <Col N="2285" /> period, and until the Irish people prevented them, sought their advice and lived in surroundings of British imperialism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin will not draw me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to engage in discussion, or public debate, at any time on the merits of the point raised by Deputy Dillon as to whether or not it is the Irish members of the union that control the policy here or whether that policy is dictated by people outside. It is on the same footing as the statement made by the Deputy's leader in Enniscorthy, when he said that the members of this Party were financed by a British union.  It is quite untrue; there is a British law that prevents that.  If the Deputy wants further evidence to prove that it is untrue I will produce it.</P>
      <P>Now let me come to another point. The Minister challenged Deputy Norton to produce the record showing that he said that unification of these three services could be brought about by a stroke of the pen.  On the 8th March he is reported, in the Official Reports, column 360, in reply to inquiries from these benches, to have said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have been assured that unification can be achieved by a stroke of the pen, and that a stroke of the pen will be made when we ask for the making of it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that is so, and if there is no insuperable obstacle in the way, and no destruction of capital is involved, why not use the pen and bring about that unification the same as the unification of the other transport services?  But I am somewhat troubled about another statement which is rather in conflict with that made by the Minister on the same day in column 404.  Some Deputy, whether Deputy Norton or another, got a letter addressed by the Minister to an individual who lost his employment in the service of the Great Southern and Western Railway Company without getting compensation; and this is what the letter said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister further wishes me to state that it is not proposed to secure the amalgamation of the Great <Col N="2286" /> Southern Railways Company with the Irish Omnibus Company and John Wallis by legislation, but in the event of such amalgamation being effected by the Boards of those Companies the position of the employees is a matter for discussion between the Companies and the Trade Unions in the first instance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the use of a Trade Union official going to John Wallis &amp; Co. after this Bill is passed, and some of the employees lose their employment as a result of voluntary unification, and making a claim for compensation if there is no provision for compensation in the Bill?  Would it not be foolish for the directors not to argue that there is no provision made for compensation? The union's representatives would be only justified in making representations if employees lose their employment, and do not get compensation, which the Minister provides in other sections of this Bill.  If unification can be secured by a stroke of the pen, and no real obstacles are in the way, then there is no real difficulty confronting the Minister.  If unification is not secured under the terms of this Bill it will mean, as Deputy Good knows well, though he will not admit it, that many of the directors of the Great Southern Railways and John Wallis &amp; Co., who are the same directors, are going to get large sums in compensation.  The Deputy knows well that directors, and high officials, will be bound to become redundant and will get compensation while it would be the right of the Company to dismiss other employees without compensation of any kind.  Does the Minister deny that?  He cannot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the right of any employer to dismiss employees for some reason but, where the workers are <Col N="2287" /> highly organised, the employers will not do so except for good reasons.  The Minister knows, and Deputy Good knows, that if a man is dismissed, either in the building trade or in the railway industry, or from the staff of John Wallis, for good and sound reasons, the unions are not the first to make representations on behalf of members dismissed for obviously good reasons.  If a man, for instance, is dismissed for drunkenness, after repeated warnings, the unions do not make representations to the employers to take back that man.  They do not generally make unreasonable demands like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the building industry which I know something about.  Supposing an employee loses his employment there by reason of slackness of work, would the Deputy argue that he should be compensated by the employer?  That is what he wants the Minister to do.</P>

      <P>If workers engaged in an industry, for reasons of good sound public policy, lose their employment and become redundant as the result of the passage of legislation, it has always been the custom of the British Parliament, and of this Dáil, on previous occasions in connection with legislation passed, to make provision for compensation for those who become redundant as the result of such legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have here a combination of good old Tory Deputies, Messrs. Good and Dockrell, and that super-patriot, Deputy Dillon, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, taking the same side in opposition to the Labour Party without any reason whatever.  It will be very interesting to read in the Official Reports in the interval of the holidays which begin next Friday, and end on the 26th April, some of the remarks made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce during these debates.  The only persons he convinced were those who are absent from the House on the debates on this amendment, and other people, like Deputy Good, who naturally speaks for the Chamber of Commerce, and the interests he represents and who never sees, and never will see, any justification for making reasonable provision for people who lose their employment as a result of the passing of legislation of this kind.</P>
      <P>They will take all that is good in the Bill; they will take the taxpayers' money provided for them in certain sections of the Bill, but they will refuse to take the responsibility of making reasonable provision for those who may lose their employment as the result of the passage of legislation which, I contend, is in the interests of the shareholders of the railway company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2289" /> It has been suggested by Deputy Dillon, and, I think, by Deputy Mulcahy, if not with the same eloquence, that the only thing we are concerned about in this amendment is the section which makes provision for the payment of compensation to redundant employees. That is not so.  We are concerned, and I, particularly, am concerned, that the railway company should be put on a proper and firm financial foundation; that it should be enabled to carry on all sections of its business in fair competition with those who are competing with it.  If that end is a desirable one, it is very desirable that the three services now working in competition with each other should be brought under a central management, and that that should be done as quickly as possible in the interests of the shareholders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Good suggest to the Minister that it is desirable that they should have three separate boards of directors, while at the same time realising that these three separate boards consist of some or all of the same individuals; that they should be allowed to draw on an average £1,500 a year as directors of the railway company; that they should be allowed to be appointed, while it is unnecessary that such a thing should be done, as directors of Messrs. Wallis, and receive in addition £1,000 a year as directors of that concern, and perhaps another £1,000 or £800 as directors of the I.O.C.?  Is that desirable or necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Good, as a businessman suggest that he would divide the business which he controls into sections, put one section under one body of people drawn from the general board of directors and put another section in charge of another body of people, paying them three times for doing the work of the same concern? Is that desirable or necessary?  Is it necessary to have separate headquarters and to pay rent and rates and <Col N="2290" /> other necessary overhead charges for these establishments, when all the work could be done with one board and one headquarters under the same central management?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Deputy Good defending that?  Will Deputy Good tell Deputy Mulcahy what is the present position of the I.O.C. and Messrs. Wallis, so far as capital is concerned, and how these two concerns have been purchased; that they have been purchased indirectly out of revenue earned by the railway company?  What is the difficulty in the way of bringing about this unification?  What is the necessity for continuing the cut-throat competition between the two services owned by the same share-holding body? I have quoted certain cases for Deputy Good, and I shall quote additional cases to show that this cut-throat competition is being carried on in areas where it is not necessary.  Why should there be omnibuses starting from certain towns at the same time as trains start from these towns to other places?  Buses are starting from Ballina to Dublin and from Dublin to Ballina at the same times as trains are starting from the same points.  You have eleven buses running between Cobh and Cork at the same time as trains are running to and from these places.  I believe it would be necessary, as the Minister pointed out, to have bus services running from Dublin to Limerick, but I think that under a proper system of central management it should be possible, with less expense, to have an inter-changeable system between the rail and road services, so that persons could, if they wished, travel by road from Limerick to Dublin, and return by rail if it suited them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I at first proposed to move, or had in mind to move, certain amendments affecting the Minister's scheme in detail, but I thought it was perhaps more useful, and certainly wiser, to appeal to him on very broad grounds to withdraw these reconstruction proposals altogether.  I submit in the first place that they are not essential to the Bill. The reconstruction proposals put forward will not increase by one penny piece the actual value of the company.  I submit that the Minister has really nothing to gain by these proposals.  I hope to show him that he is doing something which is most dangerous in itself and likely to lead to consequences which even he will regret.  I suggest that instead of this section he should introduce a section which will enable debenture holders by, say, a three-quarters majority, to accept reconstruction proposals and thus get over the difficulty with which he has been faced&mdash;that as at present constituted, one single debenture holder could put a veto on a proposal.</P>
      <P>The Minister is trying to do something which vitally affects the interests of property holders.  He is proposing to do something which, if it is in the interests of the company, should be done, and I suggest can be done and, when it is found advisable to do it, will be done, by the shareholders themselves.  If he introduces a section giving the power which I have specified to the debenture holders to gain by body, everything he hopes to gain by his proposals can be done by the shareholders themselves.  I submit that in justice and in equity it ought to be done by the shareholders and not by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first reason I give the Minister for the appeal I make to him is that this is an arbitrary interference with the rights of property holders and that he is taking this step without regard.  Which the State has had up to the present, for those rights.  He is doing it for some purpose which is <Col N="2295" /> quite beside the mark compared with the magnitude of the step he is taking.  One can analyse that statement from various angles.  First, I take the debenture holders.  They are in quite a different position, as was rightly pointed out on the Second Reading debate, from the ordinary stockholders.  They lent their money at fixed rates in order to enable the company to use its own capital in certain ways.  It was a loan to the company, and it is a debt now owed by the company.  The State proposes to cut down the magnitude of that debt arbitrarily.  It is to be the will of the State to say that the person who lent that money shall not get back all the money which he lent, but only a fraction of it; he shall not be allowed to get the full terms of the bargain he made when he lent the money.  I submit that the debenture holders are in a special position when this proposal is being considered. Their money is not the capital of the company at all; it is simply money borrowed by the company and used for its own purposes.</P>
    <P>Now I will take the guaranteed preference stocks and put those two together.  I will draw the Minister's attention to the fact that up to the present trustees have been justified in regarding such stocks as trustee stocks in which it was safe for them to invest money entrusted to their care, and in which they were allowed by the State to invest money without fear as to State interference with the particular stock the trustees decided to invest money in.  If the Minister goes through with these proposals, he will be striking a blow at the security that trustees have felt they could rely upon hitherto in their dealings with moneys entrusted to their care.  If the Bill in this form becomes law, no trustee will feel justified in putting money entrusted to his care in any trustee stock in the Free State.  There will be no guarantee by a later Bill, brought in by the Minister or some Minister succeeding him, that stock shall not be further reduced both in value and in interest-bearing power.  Anything that <Col N="2296" /> can be done with one stock can be done with another.</P>
    <P>The Minister, on the one hand, is rightly anxious to do all he can to secure that Free State money is kept in the country.  By this proposal he is undermining and undoing every step he has taken hitherto to keep a large proportion of the money invested by the public within the bounds of the State.  It is a distinct inducement to go outside the bounds of the State, because there stocks can be found to which the element of insecurity brought in by this Bill does not apply.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that point earnestly.  He is doing real harm to the security that trustees have hitherto felt in trustee stocks in this State.</P>
    <P>The proposals outlined in the Bill are harmful to a section of the community which is worth considering and which we have spent two hours or more in considering on behalf of the Labour Party.  I am anxious that the interests of those for whom Labour Members are zealous should be preserved. I submit that this interference with trustee stocks is going to harm that very section of the community which is most deserving of our sympathy and appeal, the poorer section.  It is not a case here of striking at large capital holders.  I cannot give the Minister information as to the magnitude of the stocks that are held by the section of the people for whom I am speaking, but I know they are very large.  Charities spend their money very largely for the benefit of the poorer sections of the community and these charities are the largest holders of the trustee stocks. As Deputy Good mentioned a short time ago, there are almost 8,000 holders of stock in this company, the value of whose stock is £500 or less. That will give the Minister some idea of the wideness of the blow he is dealing by these reconstruction proposals.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which entirely concerns the company.  The Minister's proposals do not raise the market value of the company's assets by one penny.  It simply takes the money from the debenture holders and from <Col N="2297" /> the guaranteed preference holders in order to give the preference shareholders and the ordinary shareholders who are the largest stockholders, a chance of getting a dividend.  This proposal in the Bill is redistribution rather than an improvement in the condition of the accounts.  I think the Minister hardly realises that a step like this, once taken, which goes to the root of State interference with private property, is a step which will carry him in a direction in which perhaps he does not want to go far. But there may be others who may succeed him, who may be ready to go a very great deal farther.  I appeal to the Minister as strongly as I can to withdraw this reconstruction proposal altogether.  Let him take any one step he likes to get the railway company to consider whether it is in their interest or not; let him leave it to the shareholders and to them alone to make this decision.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that I have got to resist Deputy Thrift's appeal. At any rate, I feel that the grounds on which the appeal is made are not sound.  We have taken the point of view that reconstruction of the finances of the railway companies is necessary.  We put that point of view to the directors of the railway companies who agreed.  The manner in which reconstruction was to be effected was discussed from time to time between the directors of the company and myself, but no positive action was taken by the directors of the railway company to give effect to what they agreed should be done.  As we were proposing to bring to the Dáil legislation designed, not merely to organise the finances of the railway companies, but to reorganise the whole transport industry of the country for the benefit of the railway companies in general and of the Great Southern Railways in particular, we felt that we could not wait indefinitely until the railway directors agreed amongst themselves as to what form this reorganisation should take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>How will this <Col N="2298" /> reconstruction of the finances affect the transport question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was one of the points made by Deputy Thrift, but it is a point that was discussed also on the Second Reading.  In discussing this matter we must bear in mind the whole provisions of this Bill and the whole provisions of road transport.  A new scheme of transport is being devised. It is being brought into effect by legislation regardless of whether certain interested parties want it or not.  It will operate to the detriment of a number of individuals in the country. That scheme is being brought about because of the precarious position in which the various railway companies find themselves.  If the sole purpose of that scheme in the minds of the railway directors is to enable them to pay a return upon a very large amount of dead capital, then the scheme&mdash;apart from the fact that it would be defeated from the beginning &mdash;would be entirely unjustifiable.</P>
      <P>The only grounds on which we could justify the scheme and the only grounds on which we could justify the very drastic action we are taking in the reorganisation of transport here is that the new situation is going to be availed of in a reasonable manner for the benefit of those who are the owners of the railways operating in the Saorstát.  It is easy to contemplate the railway directors anxious to pay some return on their ordinary stock.  It is the natural desire of the directors of any company to so organise it that they will pay a return upon its ordinary capital. They are usually directly the representatives of the owners of the ordinary capital.  In the case of the Great Southern Railway I admit that the owners of the other capital also elect the directors.  But the owners of these other classes of capital have not got a return this year and there is no prospect of a return next year.  It is reasonable to understand that the directors of the railway company would exercise their powers to ensure that a return would be paid.  If that capital is to remain at the present figure any attempt to pay a return under present circumstances would wreck the whole transport organisation in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2299" /> It would destroy the prospects of any economic revival and do irreparable damage to external and internal trade. We cannot allow that.</P>
    <P>If the railway owners and the railway directors are taking the point of view that they must maintain their holdings at their nominal value, then the rest of the scheme goes by the board and we will let them go along that road.  If we do, it is obvious that they will come to bankruptcy in a few years.  In that situation it would be possible for us to come in and reconstruct transport here with no question of this kind arising to trouble us.  We would much prefer that this reorganisation was undertaken by the directors themselves, but there are legal difficulties to prevent them.  In fact they have taken no step beyond consultation to get powers to produce a scheme.</P>
    <P>That scheme may not be a perfect scheme.  I admit that no scheme can be perfect and must be largely guesswork. It is not possible for anybody to-day to look forward for ten years and to estimate what the companies' position will be at the end of that time. To be able to estimate with any degree of accuracy, a person would have to know what the prospects and the earning capacity of the company were likely to be for ten years ahead, otherwise there would be no basis for preparing a reconstruction scheme.  It may be that a better reconstruction scheme was possible.  We asked the directors to give us advice and assistance in this matter.  They have known for a long time our views on the necessity for reconstruction.  They had information for a long time past that it was our intention to embody this particular reconstruction scheme in the Bill.  They were asked to give us all the information they had on the subject. They were asked to suggest any alternative which they thought in justice should be suggested and they have not done so.  They might have consulted other financial experts than those they consulted already and let us have the benefit of the advice they got.  They did not do so.</P>
    <P>There is a scheme now before the House.  I am not happy about the minor stocks.  I think we are acting <Col N="2300" /> unduly harshly about the minor stocks. I was waiting to get information and representations which would permit of a review of our proposals in that respect and we have not got them.  It is I think entirely incorrect to argue, as Deputy Thrift argues, that we are prejudicing the possibility of the debenture holders getting their loan back. They cannot get their loan back.  The debentures are irredeemable.  The only way they can get their loan back is by selling their stock.  It is not at 85 they would sell it but at 30 or 35, which is the present market quotation. If there was any serious attempt on the part of any number of debenture holders to get back their capital by selling their stock the price would be much lower than 30 or 35.</P>
    <P>Of course, the same thing applies with regard to Guaranteed and Preference Stocks.  The Deputy based a number of arguments on the point that trustees were charitable organisations authorised to invest money in guaranteed and other stocks.  Section 1 (g) of the Trustee Act of 1893 authorised them to invest in debentures, rent charges, guaranteed or preference stock of any railway in the United Kingdom if the dividend paid during the last ten years had not been less than 3 per cent. on the ordinary stock. That was changed by a Rule of the Supreme Court of Ireland and they became entitled to invest if any dividend had been paid on the ordinary stock for a ten years' period.  The fact is that the absence of any dividend this year, not on the ordinary but on the guaranteed or preference stocks, has settled that question for trustees. This Bill proposes to carry on the trustee status during the period of reorganisation.</P>

      <P>If for ten years next before the date of investment they had paid a dividend on ordinary capital. There was no question of 3 per cent. there.  I think Deputies must realise that the position of the railway company is such that there is no prospect, subject to reorganisation of its finances, of any dividend being paid on the ordinary stock at any time in the future.  So far as we can estimate it on the figures available for this year, even the amount of the interest on the reduced debentures is not likely to be earned, unless some substantial improvement takes place.</P>

      <P>The reserves are going bit by bit.  The company cannot continue, if each year it is not earning sufficient profits, to pay the amount of the fixed charges on the different classes of capital.  These are the facts.  It <Col N="2302" /> seems to me that there can be no question about the necessity and the desirability of having a reconstruction of the company's finances.  I say that if the railway directors had been acting in a prudent manner they would have attempted to effect that long ago.  The directors of other companies faced with similar conditions carried out reconstruction. There were difficulties in this case, difficulties about conferring certain legislative powers upon them. These would have been provided.  Apart altogether as to what would be good policy for the railway board to undertake in any circumstances, the fact that these Bills are before the Dáil, and that the changes are for the benefit of the railway company, in the main, makes it essential that there should be a reconstruction of the finances.  I argued this at considerable length on the Second Reading, and I do not think Deputies are likely to have had their opinions changed by anything that has been said since.  I would like them to feel that this is not a reckless interference with what is regarded as private property.  It is an essential part of a well-considered scheme to put the transport industry on a sound economic basis which it cannot reach unless the changes contemplated in the Bill are made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I explained that we were, in fact, improving the position of the debenture holders.  A person might hold a nominal £100 in debentures.  The stock was irredeemable.

      <P>The Minister makes the point that these debenture stocks are irredeemable.  He therefore suggests <Col N="2303" /> that this is really not interference with property, and that the debenture holders' only remedy was to sell them in the open market for what they could get.  The Minister has forgotten two things: (1) that while debenture stocks may be irredeemable, they carried with them what was a guarantee of a permanent 4 per cent.  As a matter of fact, that aspect does not appeal very much to me.  The Minister knows as well as I do that there is something inherent in debenture stock other than its irredeemability.  The position of the debenture holders to-day is that if on the next dividend day they went to court these people could put in a receiver and seize the company's entire revenue for their dividends.</P>

      <P>The point is that there is an element in debenture stock which does not exist anywhere else.  I entirely agree with the Minister, and I think he is perfectly right to bring the strongest possible pressure to bear on the board of directors to reconstruct the capital of this company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I said to bring the strongest pressure to bear on them, but I say that it is gravely imprudent &mdash;I will not say he is not entitled to do so&mdash;to reduce the capital by legislation. Let me put the case in this way.  These debentures were in fact a loan to the company by the original subscribers.  They are creditors of the railway company.  What we are saying to the railway company is: &ldquo;Take thy Bill and write £85 off.&rdquo;  Take the other case where a farmer came along fifteen years ago and borrowed £3,000 from a bank, to which he added £3,000, in order to buy a farm. The farm has depreciated in value and the earning capacity has gone down, but the bank wants to take land that cost £3,000 and sell it to pay their debt.  That farmer can come along and say that the railway company was in the same position and were told to write off £85.  The farmer <Col N="2304" /> will ask: &ldquo;Why did you not tell me to write down the bill I owed the bank? It is less my fault that I have got into this trouble that I am in than it is the railway company's fault.  There may be a case made against the railway company that they were inefficient, or one thing or another.  There is no question about me.  I have worked as hard as I could, with all the skill and industry that could be put into my business, but world conditions and high State policy&mdash;which is involving an economic war with England&mdash;have reduced me to a condition in which my assets have depreciated independently of anything I could do, apart from anything I have actually done.  Surely I have a stronger case for the legislature to come to my assistance and cut down my liability than the railway company has?  My answer to that is that you cannot do that, because if you interfere with securities of that kind you may derive temporary advantage, but in the long run your power to borrow, the whole credit of the trading community of the country, your security on a bond, will be so much injured that the temporary advantage you will get by that interference will be far outweighed. So long as we are in a position to say: &ldquo;We would not do it for the railway companies; we would not do it for an individual; we will not do it for anybody,&rdquo; we are on sound ground, and I think unassailable ground.  On the other hand, the moment we make an exception and interfere by legislation, in a somewhat casual way, we break through that principle, and open up the whole economic structure of the country to very serious dangers which I know the Minister or anybody else does not want to incur.  I see the difficulty that one debenture holder could hold up the whole scheme as the law at present stands, but everywhere else we are conferring democratic rights on communities&mdash;the right of self-determination; there is nothing wrong with conferring democratic rights on a body of debenture holders; there is nothing wrong in bringing the old-fashioned, archaic debenture instrument of the railway company up to date, bringing it into line with the modern debenture deed, and giving the debenture holders the <Col N="2305" /> right to decide by majority&mdash;two-thirds or three-fourths or whatever the Attorney-General may advise&mdash;as to common form of modern debenture deed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that having taken that course he should publicly tell the railway companies that the debenture holders have got to make up their minds now to take their remedy or to reconstruct their capital; that if they are prepared to do neither one thing nor the other, then they are not going to be allowed to cut across State policy; that the legislature will not allow them to refuse, through pure cantankerousness, to exercise their rights, or to refuse to make it possible to carry on the transport of the country. A different situation then arises, because their rights have been secured to them and they have been given an opportunity of realising their security if they want to do so.  If they do not choose to do so, and say that the legislature can take any steps they wish, then no principle has been broken in on.  Their rights have been maintained, the whole fundamental principle upon which credit is founded has not been disturbed, and nobody has been injured.  That is my objection to the way in which debenture stocks are being dealt with in this Bill.  I do not disguise the fact that if the Minister had put it up to the debenture shareholders to do this job themselves I would have asked the debenture holders to do a more radical job than is done by this Bill.  I would have asked the company to reduce their capital perhaps even further than has been done; I would then have invited them to accept from the Government a guaranteed loan of a very substantial sum to bring the transport system of this country up to date; and I would have placed them under obligation to create a sinking fund for the redemption of that loan within a reasonable time; because in my opinion capital reconstruction proposals for this company that do not provide for liquid assets to bring the existing railway system up to date and rehabilitate it are going to fail. What is really wrong with the railway company at the moment is that it has got itself down into a slough of despond and cannot get itself out.  Its <Col N="2306" /> carriages are rotten; its rolling stock is decrepit; its permanent way requires extensive repair; the industry is honeycombed with unemployment; and what the company really wants is liquid capital to set it on its feet.  To my mind a very different proposal might be voluntarily accepted by the company if the Minister were prepared to say that he would make funds available to them on loan, with terms of repayment, which would really open up a new horizon and give them a chance to make a constructive and fresh start.</P>
    <P>With regard to the equity of this proposal, the Minister proposes to reduce the City of Dublin Railways' guaranteed stock to 50.  That guaranteed stock is 100.  I think I am right in saying&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that this is stock in respect of which the Dublin Steam Packet Company was one of the guarantors; I think the L.M.S. was a guarantors, as well as the Great Northern Railway and the Great Southern Railway. There is lying in the bank at present a sum, I think, of £65,000, which the person who was appointed to wind up the Steam Packet Company was ordered by the court to leave in court in order to sustain their guarantee of interest on this loan.  If I am not much mistaken, the guarantees which the Great Southern Railway Company and the Great Northern Railway Company each gave take precedence over every other charge on their profits.  Before they can pay interest on their own stocks they are obliged to redeem their guarantee. There is no equity in cutting down the stock to 50.  Then take the City of Dublin Junction.  I think at the moment the City of Dublin Junction is a paying proposition, earning its dividend. Why on earth should shareholders in that concern suffer a reduction of 35?  Here, questions of real equity enter in, and I think it is a mistake to incorporate proposals in this scheme which are manifestly unjust. The Minister himself showed his hand. He says when pressed: &ldquo;I make no disguise of it.  I would much sooner the railway company carried through this reconstruction themselves,&rdquo; but the Minister has forgotten that on his Second Reading speech he gave us the <Col N="2307" /> reason why they could not do it, because he pointed out that as the law stood at present&mdash;while they could negotiate a reduction in preference or ordinary stock&mdash;they were absolutely powerless in face of the debenture holder.  What I suggest to the Minister now, for the various reasons I have set out, is that he should introduce a section into this Act altering the original debenture instrument and bringing it into line with the ordinary debenture deed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the justification for that?  What difference is it going to make to the public credit, or to the debenture holder who disagrees with the reduction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very fundamental difference because any experienced person, notably the Attorney-General, will tell the Minister that the earlier mortgage instruments of this character had this peculiarity&mdash; that one mortgage debenture holder could hold up a big scheme.  I think the Attorney-General will confirm me when I say that modern mortgage instruments usually have not. The modern trend of legal draftsmanship is that a mortgage instrument is provided with certain safeguards so that a majority of the mortgage holders can carry through a scheme by a majority of two-thirds or three-fourths as the case may be.  All you have been asked to do here is to bring this deed&mdash;as a matter of fact it is a Statute not a deed&mdash;into line with modern mortgage debenture practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But what difference is it going to make?  You are simply altering the basis upon which you agree to make a loan.  I am certain that if the Bill had that proposal in it we would have had precisely the same speech from Deputy Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, providentially, it had not.  There is nothing unusual in asking for the withdrawal of the provision and of modernising and bringing up-to-date the debenture instrument.  There is nothing unjust in that.  It does not go to the root <Col N="2308" /> principle upon which credit is founded. The Minister said, when introducing the Bill, that he did not want to discuss it in a party spirit, or to ram it down the throat of anybody in the hope that we might arrive at something approaching unity.  I am not objecting to the general principle of capital reconstruction, but I am drawing the Minister's attention to the things I have mentioned because I believe they contain pitfalls that may have escaped his notice.  I am drawing his attention to the absence of equity, first to some of the proposals for reduction.  I do not think that he can challenge me on that ground.  He admits himself that he would prefer in principle that the company would do this reconstruction work themselves.  In fact, in principle he agrees with it.  I put it to him that if he will restore freedom of action to the railways and get authority from the Executive Council to propose to the Dáil a Government guarantee for a loan&mdash;I would go so far as to say of two million pounds&mdash;to the railway companies that the railway companies would be prepared to accept a more stringent capital reduction than is proposed here, and as a quid pro quo for a Government guaranteed loan they could set about modernising the transport system of the country, and put the railways back into the position they were in some years ago of becoming profit-earning concerns.</P>
      <P>I very much doubt, unless you do that, that this resolution will achieve very much for the shareholders at all. I invite the Minister to empower the debenture stockholders to act in the way I suggest.  Put it up to the railway companies to put forward their last word, what they are prepared to do in the way of capital reconstruction in exchange for a Government guaranteed loan.  If they do not put forward an adequate proposal then I invite the Minister to say to them: &ldquo;Very well, go ahead to bankruptcy and when you burst yourself we will take you over as scrap iron.&rdquo;  I think that along those lines the Minister would secure a better arrangement of the whole situation, and establish the transport system of the country on a secure and enduring basis.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that amendment 11 has been incorporated in the section and on that I want to put a preliminary point.  Has any consideration been given to the phrase &ldquo;Every holder&rdquo;?  I presume it is intended to mean every bona-fide holder.  As set out, it might mean that any man, no matter how he came to buy certificates, would be entitled to demand and get certain things from the railway companies.  I start off in my consideration of this section with this: that this country has got to have a big transport undertaking either as it was in the past, almost entirely a railway business, or, as I think it will be in the future, a mixed rail and road business. Envisaging that as the future, I think we have got to take into our consideration two items which characterised the railways previously: (1) in relation to their employees, and (2) in relation to the capital employed in their construction and working.  The employees were regarded as being more or less of a permanent type, and because of that they were exempted from the provisions of the unemployment insurance code and so on.  A stockholding in the railway was also marked out as being of a peculiar type.  The quotation given from the Trustee Act, as amended by the Supreme Court rules, showed the special position that railway capital was regarded as having.</P>
      <P>Now we are setting out towards a new transport system so far as this measure and the other measure can do it.  We are attempting to cater for the railway employee being preserved in his rights as far as possible under the changed circumstances, and further, that if there is anybody else engaged in transport not of a railway type we are looking to his interests by insisting upon certain compensation or gratuities being paid.  That is being done, even although we start off on the assumption that there are too many employed in transport as a whole in this country.  That is, to my mind not merely justice but more than justice for the employees.  Let us look to the case of the other people, those who have invested capital in the railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day we want to get something both in the way of security and something <Col N="2310" /> in the way of special enticement with regard to the capital involved in the new transport undertaking. These two measures look to the future not of a railway monopoly but of a transport monopoly under the auspices of the old railway companies. We are looking forward to them having to acquire road transport vehicles. If we do mean that we must regard them as wanting extra capital.  What inducement do we hold out to anyone at the present moment to put a penny into the capital of the new transport undertaking?  I think I have clearly stated the plan.  We are going to have a new transport undertaking, a mixed rail and road business.  We are going to need capital for the acquisition of the road vehicles.  We have made certain provision, as far as we think just and possibly even more than just, for the employees&mdash;those who are going to continue in the employment of the road transport undertaking and those who are going to be put out of employment.  What about the people who have employed their capital in the railways to whom you are going to go in the future for this extra capital that will be needed?  You are certainly going to cool down the enthusiasm of anyone to put&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Dubhairt sé nách féidir do thuismitheoirí aon chabhair a thabhairt dá leanbhaí ag baile mar gheall ar gur nGaoluinn a deintear an chuid is mó den obair anois.  Muna bhfuil d'argóint aige i gcoinne na Gaedhilge ach é sin is ana-lag an argóint atá aige.  Más rud é ná fuil ar chumas a dtuismitheoirí cabhrú le n-a leanbhaí ins na ceachtanna is amhlaidh is fearr é, mar an leanbh a gheibheann an iomarca cabhrach ag baile tógann sé ró-bhog ar scoil é.  Is ceart im' thuairim-se leigint don leanbh seasamh ar a bhonnaibh féin.  Is fearrde a ragha sé chun cinn sa tsaol 'na dhiaidh sin.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Dheineas tagairt iné do thácht na brainnse sin, Stair na hEireann, ins na scoileanna, go mór mór na bun-scoileanna. Ba mhaith liom iniu béaloideas a mholadh dhóibh&mdash;é bheith d'fhiachaibh ar na múinteoirí scéalta agus sean-ráite, chó maith le hamhráintí, rabhcáin agus mar sin de a mhúineadh.  Nuair adeirim scéalta ní scéalta suaracha ná fuil de bhlas ortha ach blas an Bhéarla atá i gceist agam, ach blódhanna béal-oidis a chuireann síos ar thréithe, ar nósanna agus ar imeachtaí na sean-daoine.

Ba cheart mar sin go mbeadh leabhra oiriúnacha béal-oideasa i lámhaibh na múinteoirí i dteannta scéalta, amhráintí, agus mar sin de a bheith de ghlan-mheabhair acu.</P>
    <P>Anois cad mar gheall ar na feiscanna? Ní mór ná go bhfuilid dulta ar ceal.  An bhféadfai aon cheangal a dhéanamh idir na scoileannaibh agus iad chun iad d'athbheochaint?  Ar na múinteoiribh atá ár seasamh chuige sin, ach be chóir do Roinn an Oideachais aitheantas a thabhairt dóibh seo a dhéanfadh é; marc agus teisteas na scoile d'árdú dá réir.  B'fhéidir go dtiocfádh leis na cigirí scol súil a choimeád ar chomórtaisíbh agus iomaíocht na scoláirí maidir le ceol, amhránuíocht, agallamha, drámaíocht agus mar sin de.  D'árdóch san sprid agus mhéadóch sé dúthracht na leanbhaí ní ba mhó ná mar a déanfaí go deo le gnáth-obair na scoile.  Do leanbhaíbh na n-árd-rang ba mhó a mholfainn drámaíocht.  B'fhéidir go n-abrófaí nách ró mhaith a bheadh féith na drámaíochta i gcuid des na múinteoiríbh féin, ach ba cheart cúrsa dhi a thabhairt dóibh agus iad ins na coláistíbh oileamhna.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom a chlos ón Aire go bhfuil feabhas ag teacht ar Cheárd-Oideachas ar fuaid na tíre mar nách mó ná leath-chuibhseach a bhí sé go nuige seo.  Ní raibh mórán éilimh ag daoine air, mar tar éis lán-téarma a chaitheamh ag gabháil do ní raibh aon obair le fáil acu.  B'fhéidir nach amhlaidh a bheadh an scéal i gceann cúpla blian eile.  Chualamar ón Aire, leis, go bhfuiltear chun athruithe a dhéanamh ar Cheárd-Oideachas.  Is maith san agus tá súil agam go mbeidh múineadh ceart na Gaedhilge ar cheann acu.</P>
    <P>Dubhairt an tAire go rabhthas chun ceárd-scoileanna a thógaint ins an nGaoltacht.  Luaidh sé Gaillimh agus mhol an Teachtaire Ó Diolúin, Tír Chonaill, ach táim se ag iarraidh air gan dearmhad a dhéanamh ar Ghaoltacht Chiarraighe, mar a bhfuil na mílte daoine óga ag imeacht díomhaoin agus a ghlacfadh le teasgasc ins na scoileanna san go cíocrach agus go fonnmhar.</P>

      <P>There is in this Estimate a sum, I think, of £10,000 set aside for the purpose of the preparation and publication of translations of original works in Irish and also for Irish music.  I should like to know how is this grant for Irish music to be used in the terms of popular interpretation.  I am interested mainly, in introducing this matter, in the question of the disemployment of a large and very cultured number of our people.  I allude, of course, to the musicians.  I do not suggest that it is due to the economic war at all, or to the general depression.  But I do submit that it is due to the change in the manners of the people.  The cult of the picture house and the cult of the jazz shop is, I think, affecting very considerably and in a not very pleasant way&mdash;I want to be very careful of the words I use, as I am generally not too careful&mdash;the disposition of our people. I know myself, personally, that in this city a large number of men and women have been thrown out of employment by the mechanisation of the picture shop.  I have never seen a &ldquo;talkie.&rdquo;  I do not know what it is like.  I never propose to see one; but I understand from those who are habitual picture-goers that there is really a very big change, from the point of view of culture, between the silent pictures and the present &ldquo;talkies.&rdquo;  People tell me that it used to be a pleasure, from a musical standpoint, to go into those picture houses years ago, and that this is all changed now.  I suppose that the general wish for this unhealthy excitement and love-stuff that is being circulated now in every picture house throughout this country has demoralised, in some way at any rate, the better sense of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular type of citizen for whom I speak suffers poverty, and suffers it, probably, in its most intense sense, because it is a secluded poverty which they suffer.  They never make their positions known and, as a matter of fact, have to be actually discovered by the various charitable organisations which look after our poor and indigent citizens.  I submit that there ought to be an attempt at <Col N="2316" /> a change.  I may be out of order altogether so far as dealing with such a question on this Estimate is concerned; but I looked through the Estimates simply to find out where I could see art and science and especially music, and being shown exactly by one of the Minister's assistants the proper places in the book to look at, I discovered this sum of £10,000.</P>
    <P>The change that I should like to see brought about, if it were possible, would be an attempt to organise civic orchestras inside the five large cities in this country subsidised, first, by grant from the Minister, if it is possible for him to do so, and subsidised also by a small rate-in-aid struck by the local authorities, and, in the third place, possibly, supported by citizens who are blessed with wealth and have cultured minds.  I look upon this as a very serious thing, not only from the point of view of the present unhappy position of those citizens to whom I have alluded, but also from the point of view of the general trend of the aspirations of our people.  From a national standpoint, I submit that it would be very useful work and very exemplary work for the Minister and his Department to undertake in order to bring about again the popularisation of the national music of our country.  I remember when I was a boy&mdash;that is a good while ago now&mdash; but when I was a boy, I used to meet, amongst the older people in the neighbourhoods in which I lived&mdash;all poor men and poor women&mdash;people of extraordinarily cultured minds. They had lived through a period of great musical effort in this city, 80 and 70 and 60 years ago.  I remember well of course, when I was a grown man, the enthusiasm of 25 years ago, amongst Sinn Féin, the Gaelic League and all the other associations existing then with strong national aspirations, for our native music.  That is now all gone, or nearly gone.  That may be a very strong statement to make, but I believe it is true.  I think it would be great work if we could help to restore it.  The Hollywood element, we know, has got big odds in the race, but <Col N="2317" /> nevertheless, I think, with the help that I am sure we could get, we would probably make some tracks in endeavouring to overtake that element.</P>
    <P>I submit, then, to the Minister that he should consider the matter and see if it would be possible for him to make this offer to the local bodies. There are many hundreds of our people, I know, idle and they have been idle for a long time owing to the change in the management of these picture houses and other changes, such as jazz music.  We hear this jazz music very often in going through the streets at night, issuing from dance halls.  It is a remarkable sort of music even to my unmusical ear.  I could not make head nor tail of it. In my opinion, there is nothing in it. How people can stand hours and hours waltzing around a room to that type of music I do not know.  If the Minister could see his way at least to consider sympathetically what I have submitted&mdash;a subsidy offered by the Government&mdash;it would encourage the local bodies to strike a small rate, and probably, as I said before, further assistance would be provided by private subscription.  By that means, I think, we would help very considerably not only to advance national culture, but certainly we would help a very deserving type of citizens who are now suffering, to my own knowledge, great privation and who have nobody to speak for them.</P>

Ní haon iongna go ndubhairt an tAthair Mícheál Ó hlcidhe nách féidir focail d'fháil chun na héagcóra san do cháine i gceart.</P>
      <P>Seo mar a labhair Cigire mar gheall ar thoradh na rialach san, gan a dteanga féin do labhairt leis na leanbhaí sa Ghaeltacht: &ldquo;They almost invariably forgot whatever English they had learnt at school.&rdquo;</P>

Muna n-éiríonn leis an nGaedhilg sna scoileanna ní eireoidh linn, agus deirim-se go bhfuil an iomad scríbhneoireachta agus an iomad léightheoireachta sna scoileanna agus gan go leor cleachta i labhairt na Gaedhilge.</P>
      <P>Nuair a cuireadh an Coimisiún ar bun fén chéad Dáil i dtaobh clár na mbun-scoileanna, do moladh obair i ranganna na naoidheanán do dhéanamh tríd an nGaedhilg.  Chuaidh siad siar ar an socrú san tuairim cheithre bliana ó shoin.  Bá mhór an dul siar é sin, im thuairim-se.  Do réir mar thuigim na rialacha, ní gá ach uair a chluig amháin sa ló do thabhairt d'fhoghluim na Gaedhilge i ranganna na naoidheanán.</P>
      <P>Molaim go láidir don Aire dul siar go dtí an socrú a rinne an Coimisiún fén chéad Dáil agus obair na naoidheanán do dhéanamh tríd an nGaedhilg i ngach scoil ina bhfuil na múinteoirí oilte ar an obair do dhéanamh.  Tar éis na hoibre atá ar siúl ins na Coláistí Ullmhúcháin agus na Coláistí Oiliúna beidh na múinteoirí oilte chuige sin. Sin é an rud, im thuairimse, atá ag teastáil uainn&mdash;céim mhór eile agus iarracht láidir chun an Bhéarla do chur as na scoileanna ar fad.  Tá sé sin déanta i gcúpla scoil anso agus ansud 'sa nGalldacht&mdash;Scoil Mhuire agus Scoil Cholmcille i mBaile Atha Cliath, cur í geás.  Más féidir é sin do dhéanamh í mbliain amháin sna scoileanna seo, agus gan focal Béarla a bheith á labhairt ionta anois, is féidir é do dhéanamh i ngach scoil sa tír ina bhfuil na múinteoirí oilte chuige sin. Ní mór dúinn dul ar aghaidh anois no teipfidh orainn ar fad.</P>

    <P>Ba mhaith liom fháil amach an bhfuil socruithe ag an Aire fiosrúchán do chur ar bun maidir le clár na mbun-scoileanna. Tá a fhios agam go maith go bhfuil an iomad abhar ar an gclár agus gur éigin iad do laigheadú má tá ionad ceart le bheith ag an nGaedhilg. Tá súil agam go gcuirfear an fiosrúchán san ar bun chó luath agus is féidir é. Tá áthas orm a chloisint gur deineadh rud fónta maidir le múineadh na Gaedhilge sna meadhon-scoileanna i rith na bliana.  Bhí an scéal go scannalach agus tá eagla orm go bhfuil an <Col N="2321" /> scéal dona go leor go fóill i gcuid acu. Tá cuid de na Coláistí móra anaghallda agus ní theígheann an Galldachas agus an Gaolachas le chéile. Iarraim ar an Aire féachaint chuige go gcólíonfaidh na Colaistí seo a ndualgas don tír agus don teangain.  Cén mhaith na múinteóirí do bheith ag obair sna bun-scoileanna más mar sin atá an scéal sna meadhon-scoileanna&mdash; is cuma an scoileanna lae no scoileanna comhnuithe atá i gceist?  Níl an scéal chó sásúil sna meadhon-scoileanna agus ba chóir é bheith.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil deacracht aun i dtaobh teacs-leabhar agus rudaí eile ach níor chóir aon deacracht do bheith ann i dtaobh labhairt na Gaedhilge do chur ar aghaidh sna scoileanna seo.  Agus sin é an rud táchtach.  Ní dóich liom go bhfuil go leor aire á thabhairt do labhairt na Gaedhilge sna meadhon-scoileanna, go mór-mór i gcolaistí na mbuachaillí.</P>
    <P>Anois, ba mhaith liom tagairt do dhéanamh do scéal na hOllscoile. Chonnach mé sa pháipéar cúpla lá ó shoin go bhfuil rud fónta déanta ag Coláiste Ath Chliath den Ollscoil Náisiúnta fé dheireadh chun an ionad ceart do thabhairt don Ghaedhilg.  Más maith, is mithid.  Is fada an lá sinn ag plé mar gheall or seo.  Tá súil agam go bhfuil an lá tagaithe fé dheireadh agus go mbeidh an Ollscoil náisiúntach i gceart&mdash;go dtabharfar ionad ceart do theanga na hEireann.  Tá rud fónta déanta acu agus tá súil agam go leanfaidh na Coláistí eile an dea-shompla so.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil dea-obair ar siúl i nGaillimh ach níl go leor á dhéanamh ansan go fóill.  Tugadh &ldquo;Ollscoil Gaedhealach&rdquo; uirthe ach nilim sásta go bhfuil sí chó-Gaedhealach agus ba chóir.  Tá Ollscoil eile sa tír seo agus ba mhaith liom súil an Aire do dhiriú ar an Ollscoil sin&mdash;sé sin, an Coláiste ar a dtugtar Coláiste na Tríonóide.  Tá cuid mhaith d'airgead na ndaoine ag dul chun an Choláiste sin in aghaidh na bliana, do réir mar thuigim.  Tá coinníol ag baint leis an Ollscoil Náisiúnta, ná bhfuil cead ag scoláire dul isteach ann gan dul fé scrúdú i nGaedhilg.  Ach níl aon riail mar sin ag baint le Coláiste na Tríonóide. Deirtear go bhfuil an Ghaedhilg á teagasc ansin.  Tá a fhios agam go <Col N="2322" /> bhfuil ach tá a fhios againn go léir gur cuireadh an áit sin ar bun mar dhaingean na nGall agus is mar sin atá sé go dtí an lá iniu.  Caithfimíd é sin d'atharú.  Chó fada agus tá comhacht ag Aire an Oideachais, tá súil agam go gcuirfidh sé roimhe gan aon chuid d'airgead na ndaoine do chaitheamh chun Gaill bheaga do thógáil sa tír seo. Iarraim ar an Aire scéal an Choláiste sin do bhreithnú agus gan tabhairt don Choláiste sin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister devoted a large part of his statement on the introduction of the Estimate to dealing with the position of Irish, and when replying on the Estimate last year he informed the House that out of 422 national schools in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht 41 per cent. were doing their work through the medium of Irish; that out of 756 schools in the Breac-Ghaeltacht only 78, or one per cent., were doing their work through the medium of Irish; and that in the Galltacht 45 out of 4,700, or one per cent., were doing their work through the medium of Irish.  Sections of the people in the City of Dublin, rearing their children, so far as they are able in the present circumstances, to be Irish-speaking from the beginning, wanted Irish-speaking schools for their children, and some years ago after some struggle they got a primary school started for children with pre-school Irish.  What assistance did the Deputy give to have that school kept to its purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of families in the City of Dublin, looking for a school that would give an Irish education to their children from the beginning to the end, succeeded in getting a school started.  Was it allowed to continue in the way it ought to continue, at as high a standard as it was possible to have in the school?  No.  The school was set up to take children who were brought up with pre-school Irish, but members of the Coiste Gnotha, and great Gaels who would not go to the trouble of teaching their children two words of Irish before they went to school, diverted, so far as they could divert, in its earlier years, that school from its purpose, and prevented it from being what it was intended to be, a school entirely for children with pre-school Irish.  I am talking of the difficulties that lie in the way of getting education through the medium of Irish in a discussion in which, speaking from the elevation the Deputy speaks from, he asks the people of the country and the Minister to turn English entirely out of the primary schools.  (<i>Interruption</i>). <Col N="2325" /> I hope I have stung the Deputy into beginning to think about the subject in the same way as he is beginning to ask the Minister, apparently, only to think about doing it.  I am speaking of the actual circumstances. Although there were lots of schools in the city, naturally, according to the programme, where the infants were being dealt with through the medium of Irish from the first entrance, nevertheless there were forced on that school, that had an opportunity of showing what standard could be achieved entirely through the medium of Irish in the City of Dublin, children with no Irish.  That damped down that standard.  You were faced with two difficulties: You had on the one hand a desire on the part of people to send their children to schools where Irish would be the medium of education from the beginning, and where it would continue to the end.  You had an insufficiency of teaching power, on the other hand, and the difficulty on the part of the Department of Education of getting teachers so qualified as whole-heartedly to be prepared to throw themselves into that work.  The teachers were faced with a temptation that, to some extent, they succumbed to.  It was easier, in the circumstances in Dublin, to take the low-grade type of class, to take the children who came in without Irish, and teach them something through the medium of Irish, than it was to start primary schools and continue, step by step, to teach the full programme entirely through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>I speak of the beginning, because the difficulties and the disabilities that the school laboured under in its early days have been more or less overcome, but only by careful watching.  I do not believe they are entirely overcome at present.  We succeeded after some time in getting an introductory school set up so as to side-track from both the girls' Irish school and the boy's Irish school, that were afterwards established, children that were not sufficiently advanced in power to use the Irish language in order to prevent the classes being held back for them.  There <Col N="2326" /> are schools now in the City of Dublin holding out an inducement to people to give their children Irish pre-school and to go steadily through the primary programme, at any rate, entirely through the medium of Irish.  But we were not helped by the Deputy and his friends. In the City of Dublin you have these two schools.  You have elementary schools for infants feeding into them. I do not believe we have eradicated. even with the wish of the Department of Education to do so, and with a certain amount of pressure to have the thing done properly, the difficulties we would like to eradicate out of the schools.</P>
    <P>You have this difficulty at your very door, that there are hundreds of children who are anxious to get into the introductory schools, in connection with the Irish classes in Dublin, and they are not able to get in because of want of accommodation.  I cannot understand why accommodation is not provided.  I cannot understand why the difficulties of a lot of people who are endeavouring to develop those schools at the moment, in the matter of accommodation, are still left unsolved, considering the many other difficulties in regard to education through the medium of Irish, apart from the question of accommodation, that are lying in front of us.  The position throughout the country as a whole, if the Deputy will only look at it, is such as to suggest that there are more constructive points in the situation which the Deputy might have seized upon to develop his thought and to give us help, rather than proceeding along the lines of asking that English be put out of the primary schools.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister here on the last occasion on which the Estimates were under discussion why a separate inspectorate in respect of the Gaeltacht areas could not be organised.  I still believe that a separate inspectorate to deal with those Irish-speaking districts pure and simple, whether the pupils are being taught through the medium of Irish or not, that would concentrate its mind on the problem of getting education imparted in the Irish-speaking districts as quickly as possible entirely through the medium of Irish, <Col N="2327" /> is absolutely necessary if the tide is not going to drift against Irish in those areas.  We had figures given us last year as to the position in regard to parents in Irish-speaking districts who gave Irish originally to their children. You have the position, as the Minister told us in November last, that in the limited area of Irish-speaking districts, where there are 422 national schools, there are only 41 per cent. of them in which the work is done entirely through the medium of Irish.  If the Deputy would try to help the Minister in keeping English as the medium of instruction within the 59 per cent. of these schools, he would be doing something worth while.  I again submit to the Minister that there is no possible way to deal with the situation in the Irish-speaking districts except by having a group of inspectors who will be definitely regarded as inspectors for the Irish-speaking districts&mdash;a separate inspectorate for the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister shows in his statement the predominant position of the Irish language in the Department of Education, but we are unfortunately in the position while that is so, the saving of the Irish language in this country means more than something purely educational.  We are not in a position to know from the Minister, nor do we get any information from any other Department either, as to whether there is any supervision in regard to watching the position in which the Irish language is a living language among the people.  There are so many evidences that, in its actual use among the people, the position of the Irish language is not growing stronger that we would welcome more evidence than we get from the Minister that he is extending his view beyond his Department and trying to secure, with the help of his Department, to put himself in a position of responsibility before the House so that he could keep the House systematically informed as to the position of the language throughout the country.  At present we have no means of knowing it.  We have nothing except our personal visits to the different parts of the country, and these can supply us with that information only very inadequately.  We have <Col N="2328" /> only these haphazard methods of giving the House any information in regard to the position.  Considering the importance of the subject, and considering the amount of money that one would like to spend economically and constructively to ensure that the language is firmly rooted and saved, it is an extraordinary thing, and it is lamentable that, as long as we have been at it, we have invented no machinery that can be held responsible for keeping the situation under review and for keeping the House informed as regards the general position of the language.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed:&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 3, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on the section previously I was endeavouring to show that at a time when we are attempting to inaugurate a new transport system, recognising that that transport system has to be a mixture of road and rail, we do not at any rate entice those people whose money we shall require for the new transport undertaking to embark their funds in it by reason of the treatment of the debenture holders.  The Minister asked what enticement I would give the debenture holders.  That can be answered simply&mdash;give them a continuance of their rights.  I would have them free from interference of this type, arbitrarily taken, the choice made arbitrarily by the Minister, that there should be some interference and the mode of interference based on a scheme given in to him and described as guesswork. The Minister has made great play with the value of these stocks for sale in the market at the moment.  It does not help the railway company to get out of its difficulties, whatever these difficulties are, to reduce the sale price of the securities in the market. The Minister will preserve the interest that has to be paid but if the price of the stock is going to be lowered artificially it does not help the railways.  It may help some chance of the stock <Col N="2329" /> holder hereafter getting the old price in the market of the stocks.  That does not matter one way or the other.  It would not help the railways, because there is no question of the railways having to buy out a lot of these stockholders.</P>
      <P>Arguments directed to what the value of the stock is in the market at the moment, are quite useless.  The whole point of the reduction is that you say hereafter the four per cent. shall not be paid; you will pay instead something in the region of £3 12s. You will put the ordinary shareholder in the position that if hereafter railway earnings did increase he will be faced with a definite clamour.  The Minister must know quite well that if, in four or five years, when something of this is forgotten, and they set out to pay people holding ordinary stock revalued as under this Bill, and they want to pay them one per cent on their old holdings and the phrasing is ten per cent., as it would have to be, a clamour will inevitably arise.  As far as the writing down of the stocks is concerned, the only thing of value is that you say in regard to the debenture holders that you will not pay £4 in future, but something in the nature of £3 12s.  That is the move that is on.  Alternatively one could see a case being made by the Minister, showing that the railways were in difficulty and required help in order to get them over the bad period between now and the establishment of a better transport undertaking and, for a couple of years, a percentage would not be paid on the old debenture stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even this argument might be put forward: &ldquo;We are going to give you two or three years in which to reconstruct the company.  Get special capital if necessary, and make every endeavour to bring the new transport system into a proper working condition, and if possible be in a position to pay dividends in the ordinary way; but if you are not in that position at the end of two or three years, then we will be obliged to enforce this scheme on you.&rdquo; There might be some argument like that put forward, but it would be still breaking the principle.  These shareholders had certain guaranteed rights, <Col N="2330" /> and for no great cause shown these rights are being taken from them.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Minister that it is not a four per cent. dividend stock at the moment.  This year for the first time it is not a four per cent. stock. The Minister's argument is that the railways have not earned the moneys they paid out to their shareholders for years past.  What was the first year in which they did not earn enough with which to pay at least the debenture holders?  Who is to be the judge as to whether they wisely or unwisely took from reserves for the payment of shareholders? What are reserves for?  There is not a great deal of good in giving a company power to pile up reserves against an evil day, and then not allowing them to use the reserves when the evil day has come upon them. Surely it would be wiser to say: &ldquo;You are under notice, and even under suspicion.  There is a certain sign given even by your own engineers that the maintenance is not being carried on in the old way.&rdquo;  It might be argued whether maintenance of the old type is desirable, and whether the old safety factors are too big.  It might be argued that the safety factors could be revised and maintenance might drop to a certain point.  But you have no examination of that sort, and it is simply stated that reserves have been put to wrong purposes.  After that argument is assumed to be correct it is declared that the railways were not earning enough to pay the shareholders, and consequently we can depreciate the shares to a certain extent without doing any harm.  That is going far too far in an unconsidered situation.</P>
    <P>I said before that even if there was a case made for a reconstruction of capital, no case had been made for this reconstruction.  The Minister brazenly said that this was part of a well thought out scheme.  I have here a quotation from the chairman's speech at a railway meeting early in March of this year.  In the course of that speech he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To gain information, however, for ourselves, we employed an eminent firm of financial accountants and experts to examine our accounts <Col N="2331" /> and financial condition, and advise us as to the feasibility of evolving from them an equitable scheme of reconstruction.  Their report laid it down that no scheme, based on anything but guesswork as to the future, was possible to be set up.  Subject to this specific proviso....</P>
    <P>&mdash;a very definite proviso, and one which throws suspicion and doubt on the whole scheme&mdash;</P>
    <P>... they submitted a scheme for our guidance and criticism.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They passed it on to the Minister, and the Minister now says that it is a well thought out scheme.  The firm of accountants who put it up in the first instance said it was guesswork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that the decision to carry out the reconstruction of the company's finances was part of a well prepared scheme of transport reorganisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>One item in this particular proposal regarding reconstruction. According to the accountants, this part of it is based on guesswork and yet this is the matter on which the House is asked to take a decision to-night.  People much better acquainted with the subject than the Minister can hope to be have indicated their opinion very distinctly.  That is one item in what the Minister has been brazen enough to describe as a well thought out scheme.  Let us take the other side of the well thought out scheme, because it has a bearing on the finances.  He certainly said in the arguments afterwards as to the exempted areas that he believed that the Road Transport Bill was going to work a great benefit to the railways; that it was going to assist them, was going to help them out of their difficulties and put them on their feet.  That is his view of it as a transport undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why not let that situation develop? Why say to the debenture holders at the moment when we believe we have got a scheme for transport in the country, when capital is required for its development: &ldquo;We hold out here now a warning to people who are foolish enough to put money in the new transport <Col N="2332" /> organisation that as regards that new capital, if we think fit in a year or two, when our plans have miscarried, we will reduce that capital; the people who are foolish enough to put in money are not going to get a return on that money; that they will never again be likely to get it whether the company earns it or not.&rdquo;  This is not a temporary business.  It is cutting down this money for all time.  I do not think it is wise, on the eve of the new transport system where new capital is required, to put that hindrance to people who are likely to invest in this new system.</P>
    <P>There are two sets of people interested. Practically there are three sets of people, but there are two sets of which we are speaking at the moment. These are, first, the employees, and we have done the best we can for them in these two Bills, and in the second place, there are the shareholders and particularly the debenture stockholders. We have given the railways certain new powers and we have taken away certain restrictions.  We have opened up what the Minister thinks is a new life for them and we recognise that new capital will be required to enable the undertaking.  We do not at this moment hold out any hope to people so as to induce them to put their money into new transport undertakings.</P>
    <P>Under these circumstances I think it would be a wise thing to delay and to put it up to the shareholders themselves. They can embark any other funds they have in the new transport undertaking.  We should put it up to them that it is their business and duty to get the whole new undertaking into a sound footing, to make it solvent and put it in a position to earn and pay the dividends that they are looking for. There is a fair hope ahead of them that they may be brought to realise that it would be a good thing for the majority of them to sacrifice a little now, if they are going to embark some more of their own capital in a new venture, to relax a little of their own claims if they are to get the security they want.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point on which Deputy Dillon has spoken, that is in <Col N="2333" /> connection with the present debenture stock holders.  Because of the antiquity of the legal instrument they hold, unanimity must be secured before any change can be made.  I do not know if there is any difference between the shareholders and debenture stock holders and those in the most modern company.  The scheme suggested was that there should be delay, that a reconstruction scheme should be called for and that that reconstruction scheme should be deemed to be approved of by the stock holders if it were approved by three-fourths.  I think that was breaking in on a principle.</P>
    <P>If there was an old right what was the old right?  Unanimity was required to this extent that one debenture holder by objecting could threaten to put in a receiver and that a debenture stock holder or a group of them then had to be bought over or they had to be invited or induced not to exercise their strict legal rights.  The real argument that used to be used towards them was that they would do far better by submitting to a scheme of reconstruction put before them by the big body of shareholders, than by going in as individuals.  If there were one or two obdurate people they had to be bought out.  That was the situation.  The difference between that and the amendment was the difference between three-fourths instead of the whole as in the old situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that this Bill is a recognition of the stock holders' old rights.  But all the time he has made no attempt to deal with this.  As far as sub-section (10) is concerned, the debenture stock holders are debarred from trying to enforce certain payment due by the appointment of a receiver. That phrase blatantly shows how badly the debenture stock holders are being treated.</P>
    <P>It was said by the Minister that the difference between 4 per cent. and the £3 odd, whatever it is going to be, is going to mean the safety or failure of the new transport system.  All we have to weigh in the balance as far as it is possible is the difference between the old 4 per cent. and what is paid on the depreciated £100 now deemed to be <Col N="2334" /> £85.  That is what is in the balance and that is what is going to make the difference.  On the other side of the scale there is a complete disappointment of the stock holders, the defeating of them and their legal rights.  There is a point that will cause much more annoyance and that is that an impediment is put upon the people who ought to be glad to put money into the new transport concern started under the decent auspices under which it was started.  I say that because people will not avoid the reflection that what happened once will happen again.  They had a signpost to that in the last Bill as it concerned the people on the passenger side.  They were assured of a profit in certain transport licences. Now the Minister comes along for the power compulsorily to acquire these and hand them over to somebody else.</P>
    <P>If the new transport undertaking that we are setting up, was held out to us as one that could carry on without any extra moneys, then I do not think the policy is an honest one and I do not think it is made more honest by that fact but it is less dangerous.  But facing the fact that new capital is required, to say with regard to the people who own the line at the moment that they cannot enforce their rights to a return of their loans and that we are going in this arbitrary way to cut down this stock is, I think, a very bad procedure.  Sub-section (10) takes away these rights.  Remember what the rights are at the moment, whatever the reserves are, whatever the value of the company's profit is, whatever could be got for it if sold in any way, the debentures have first charge upon that and that right has been taken from the debenture holders.  There is no consideration being given to them.  I mean they cannot go back again to their old 4 per cent. position.  This is complete. The Minister may say that they have no equitable claim to these moneys. But that again depends upon the judgment which I do not think he is capable of giving or that anybody except that board itself after an inquiry has been made by it into the whole matter.  I do not think that anybody is capable of saying that there has been any misuse of the reserves, such a lack of <Col N="2335" /> attention, that they have, in fact, ousted themselves in the equitable sense from the right to this money.  In these circumstances I would ask the Minister to pause before he forces this sub-section through.  I would ask that he would weigh very definitely the advantages he is to get by the difference between that 4 per cent. guaranteed as it was and whatever the new payment is to be and the disadvantages of not being able to get new capital as freely as he wanted for the purpose of the new undertaking.</P>

      <P>The point in this amendment is the principle of writing down capital.  I was anxious that the Minister would intervene at this stage, as so far he has not given adequate reason that would justify any ordinary person in agreeing that his intervention was right or was wise.  Before the State interferes with the capital of a private concern it must give a good and sufficient reason for that intervention, which will satisfy the ordinary shareholder and the ordinary investor.  The first thing that strikes one about this problem is that if the Minister was satisfied that a reduction of capital was essential, why did he not suggest to the railway company &mdash; and he had many interviews with the directors &mdash; that a reduction of capital would be of advantage, and that he would like to see the company making the reduction.</P>

      <P>There is no use arguing in that fashion.  Pistols of that sort do no good.  We have too much of that sort of thing in this State.  If we had less of the pistols and more commonsense it would be better for the whole of us &mdash; the Minister and everyone else. What I object to, and what all reasonable people object to, in the Bill is the compulsory writing down of capital by the State.  This is a private company and the capital was subscribed by private individuals.  Like all railway companies, this company has fallen on lean times, and when it falls on lean times like all other industries, its earning power is lessened.  But its earning power is not going to be increased by writing down the capital.  I have heard the suggestion put forward that the company will reap the advantage of writing down the capital.  I would like to see it.  As a shareholder it makes very little difference to me whether I draw £2 10s. on £100 or £1 5s. on £50. The earning power of the company is the important feature in connection with a company of this character.  How is that earning power going to be increased by writing down the capital? I want some of the advocates of that method to explain it.  If that proposal was put before the shareholders by the directors then I could see the reason for State intervention.  I cannot see it at the moment.  In the ordinary course of business directors are elected to look after the interests of shareholders. If the directors thought it was to the interests of the shareholders to write down the capital, then it was their duty to put that proposal before the shareholders.  If they approved of it they could then take the necessary steps to get the sanction of the court. <Col N="2337" /> That is the ordinary procedure as we know it in business.  The extraordinary thing about this Bill, and about the action of the Minister, is that he goes to the directors and says: &ldquo;I am satisfied the capital should be written down.&rdquo;  Apparently, the Minister did not put any reason why that was desirable before them.  As I know them, they are business men.  He did not put before them the advantages that would accrue from writing down the capital. He goes to them and says: &ldquo;The capital has got to be reduced, and I am going to take steps in this Bill to compel you to reduce it.&rdquo;  They are business men, and if the Minister wanted to act reasonably, why could he not say to them: &ldquo;There are obvious advantages which will accrue from writing down the capital, and as trustees for the shareholders it is your duty to take those steps?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a wider vocabulary than I have.  I will allow him to put his own name on the Bills; I will put mine.  We have put the Road Transport Bill through this Dáil. Will the Minister tell us quite frankly of any clause in that Bill which will put off the road one of the 8,000 lorries that are running the railway companies off their tracks at the moment?  I am a <Col N="2340" /> business man, and can understand advantages as well as the next.  Boiled down, what advantages are going to accrue to the railway company under the Transport Bill?  We agree that it is full of pious hopes, but you cannot run businesses on pious hopes; you want something more substantial. Boiled down, what is this Bill going to do for the railway companies?  The Minister says it relieves them of certain financial obligations.  The Bill of 1924 put heavy financial obligations on the railway companies, and I am satisfied that much of their financial trouble at the moment is the result of those obligations, the imposition of which I protested very strongly against in this House.  Burdens were then put on the railway companies which they were obviously unable to carry.  The answer that I got from the then Minister was: &ldquo;You are going to get a standard revenue which will enable you to discharge those monetary burdens.&rdquo;  Those monetary burdens have all been discharged up to this, and the companies have never had a standard revenue in any one year.  Though they discharged their financial burdens in the last year they did not get within half a million pounds of the standard revenue.  That is largely the cause of the financial plight of the railways at the moment. The State put burdens on them and then said: &ldquo;Oh, we have provided for a standard revenue.&rdquo;  They never got that standard revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What burdens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister talks about those advantages he is only trying to remove some of the grievances from which the unfortunate company has been suffering since 1924.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out to-day, he removes burdens with the one hand and shoves them on with the other.  There is an obligation which will accrue &mdash; we will be discussing it at a later stage of this Bill, and it was discussed very strongly on the Second Reading &mdash; whereby a director is to be removed. The removal of that director is going to place an obligation of £100,000 on the company to redeem a debt of £100,000.  That, as the Ceann Comhairle pointed out, will arise at a later <Col N="2341" /> stage.  In addition, we are going to lose a monetary advantage to the extent of £20,000 a year, in order that the Labour Party and the Minister may have the satisfaction of removing a director who is objectionable to them. What I want to say to the Minister is that there is in these Bills, as I see them, no advantage given to the railway company which would justify the State in coming in and saying: &ldquo;If we are going to give you those advantages we are going to interfere in those other problems.&rdquo;  There is no such right at all in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider the differences between the stocks.  He seems to classify all the stocks as if they were one and the same.  I pointed out on Second Reading that there is an extraordinary difference between the debenture stock and the ordinary preference and ordinary stocks of the company and the guaranteed preference stock. The guaranteed preference, the ordinary preference and the ordinary stock are dependent for their interest on dividends on the earnings of the company. Debentures are not in that position at all.  Debentures are not stock in the ordinary sense.  They have nothing to do with the earnings of the company, and are in no way dependent on them.  A debenture is money advanced by the debenture holders on the assets of the company.  It is just the same as if the Minister or any other Deputy here advanced money as a mortgage on a house down the street. He has the security of the house for the return of his money, and for the payment of the interest.  The debenture holder has the security of the railway for the repayment of his loan.  If the Minister is going to interfere here and write down the value of a mortgage of this character there is no guarantee whatever that he will not step in tomorrow in the case of the farmer, and after he has done with him go round to the other communities, and, as Deputy Dillon said to-day, take a mortgage which is £100 at the moment and write it down to £80.  Is that the principle we stand for in this Bill?  If so, it is going to shake the whole security of the State.  The Minister must realise what he is doing.  There is no use in his <Col N="2342" /> putting these proposals here before us and telling us that it is necessary to do this in these particular circumstances, because his successor &mdash; or he himself within the next 12 months or two years &mdash; may, in some other circumstances, adopt exactly the same principle, telling us that he is only doing what was done in the case of the Great Southern Railways Company, and that if we object to it we should have objected then when the principle was being established.  These are not things which one likes to see done in a new State.  We ought to be even more careful in a new State than in an old one, because the security is not so good, to see that the steps of this character we take are likely to be of advantage to the State rather than a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGilligan has pointed out, it is quite obvious that if the company is to continue it will have to get additional capital.  The Transport Bill foreshadows that.  The Minister told us, in the discussions on that Bill, that a great advantage to the railway company will be this: that it can buy up its competitors. Before I would say that is any advantage I would like to know the price it is going to pay.  The advantage will depend entirely on the price to be paid.  It is even possible to pay too much for gold.  The Minister seems to hold that the right to do that will be of great advantage to the railway company.  But if they have to pay too high a price to purchase a company, by reason of having to pay off its employees, in the end the thing may be a disadvantage rather than an advantage.  Everyone agrees that the company will want capital.  If this Bill is passed, and if this interference is approved of by the Parliament of this State, is it going to be easier to get capital in the future?  What will likely investors say to the directors who make the issue.  They will point to what is happening here, that the State intervened, that the capital of the company was written down and that even debentures, which should have been sacred, were written down.</P>
    <P>How is the company going to get additional capital in these circumstances? <Col N="2343" /> As far as I can see, it is going to be exceedingly difficult for it to do so and that is a point that I think should weigh with the Minister in his desire to get Irish capital invested in Irish industry.  This is one of the few industries in the State in which capital has been invested to any extent.  When people talk about investing money in the State they ought to bear in mind that there are exceedingly few securities in the State in which money can be invested.  That is one of the difficulties about this State.  But here, one of the largest companies in the State is being interfered with in such a way by Parliament as to weaken its credit.  That is not going to make the problem of getting money into Irish industry easier.  In fact it is going to shake confidence in Irish industry to such an extent that the problem will be much more difficult than it is by reason of State intervention in this particular case.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to bear these points in mind.  If there is any advantage that he can point out to us that will accrue to the company as a result of these proposals he ought to let us know what it is.  I would urge on the Minister that the ordinary channel through which this reduction in capital should come about is that which is recognised and availed of by companies of this character.  It is only in the event of a company refusing to take the steps which it was obvious to any ordinary individual would result in advantage to the company &mdash; in the event of failure of that kind that, to my mind, State intervention would be justified.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good has objected to the cutting down of the capital of the company by the Minister. I rise to suggest the reason for it.  It has been explained that new capital will be required.  If that be so, it will only be supplied by the public if there is a reasonable chance of its earning a dividend.  That reasonable chance will not be there for the new capital if there is a very large bulk of old capital that has to <Col N="2344" /> be provided for.  Therefore, the reason for the cutting down of the capital of the company is this: that if new capital is to be provided at all the old capital must be written down so that a reasonable chance may be provided for the new capital to earn a dividend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if the Minister appreciates the difference between capital being reduced by agreement amongst shareholders and being reduced, presumably under compulsion, by the Government.  That, to my mind, is what is at issue here.  Companies that have passed through bad times before have reduced their capital.  But it was done voluntarily, after a meeting together and a hammering out of an agreed scheme.  It has been pointed out that the railway directors could not, under the existing circumstances, hammer out a proper scheme.  I think it was Deputy Dillon who suggested that the Minister should take powers under this Bill to alter the law as far as the debentures are concerned, so that a writing down by agreement amongst the shareholders could effectually take place.  I would urge the consideration of that on the Minister.  The Minister argues: &ldquo;Well, the debenture shareholders' security is gone; he could not realise his £100.&rdquo;  Although he was pressed several times to state the reason why this scheme was necessary to the success of the Bill, the Minister has left me personally without the information as to why it was necessary.  I cannot understand why it is necessary.  One can only speculate the reason is that the Minister expects the railway company to make such enormous profits under this reconstituted measure that the shareholders would be in danger of receiving their previous dividends on their ordinary stock.  That is the only reason I can conceive why this scheme is absolutely necessary here and now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Deputies have urged very forcibly the danger that will accrue to the credit of this State and the companies in this State through the writing down of debenture stocks by the Government.  Broadly speaking, if <Col N="2345" /> this reconstruction is carried out by the Government &mdash; there is no use putting a tooth in it &mdash; the railway debentures will cease to be debentures.  That is what it amounts to.  No doubt the Minister can get suitable guarantees that a proper effort will be made to carry out the reconstruction by the company, but I would urge him to consider the enormous difference there is between a voluntary scheme, as evolved by the shareholders and a scheme imposed upon them by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no very strong views on this question of compulsory reduction of capital, but having heard Deputies Dockrell, Thrift and Good referring to the danger to the credit of the State, I feel bound to state that they seem to be overlooking one important aspect of the matter.  I think they are overlooking this very important aspect, that the State is coming to the rescue of a company rather than allow it to go bankrupt.  That seems to me a very big precedent and a very big and favourable thing for the credit of the State.  The position is, if we are right in the bases of our discussion. that this big company is faced with bankruptcy and the Minister, in order to prevent that bankruptcy, comes along and demands sacrifices, not merely from one section of the community but from practically every family in the country.  He demands such big sacrifices from some that their businesses are actually to be taken from them &mdash; from people who are accustomed to a life that probably represents the nearest thing we know to economic freedom.  He demands that people who are used to an independent existence, earning their living by their own effort and through their own enterprise, shall abandon that way of living, and that they will abandon it for compensation, which they know is the vaguest thing that can possibly be described &mdash; a thing so vague that they have not the faintest idea what it will amount to; and he demands from the general public the sacrifice of conveniences and amenities to which they have been accustomed for years.  He demands, in my opinion, so much sacrifice in that way that it is very doubtful if the Bill will be workable, so much sacrifice is <Col N="2346" /> the Minister demanding from the ordinary person living in this country and particularly from the farming community.</P>
      <P>The Minister is compelling all that sacrifice in order to keep the company from bankruptcy.  Now, the debenture shareholders have to be visualised as citizens of the State.  Surely they have an interest, too, even if under bankruptcy their property or their investments were safe&mdash;surely they also have an interest in preventing such a catastrophe as the bankruptcy of the Great Southern Railways Company, Is the Minister taking too much liberty in saying that the debenture holders of the Great Southern Railways Company are not people who would object to some sacrifice for that end?  It is to be remembered that we are all taking the liberty of saying that the objections of the farmers of the country and the people engaged in road transport must be overruled.  In that respect I should like to remind Deputy Good that one investor is as much entitled to consideration as another.  Deputy Good &mdash; I do not mean it in any offensive way &mdash; has not shown any great concern as to whether a man who invested £300 in a lorry in the past three or four years, shall get adequate compensation now that he is deprived of his living.  Is a man who invest £300, with a view to making a decent existence for himself, not entitled to as much consideration as the man who puts £300 or £400 into debenture stock of the Great Southern Railways Company?</P>

      <P>It may do so.  It may be writing it down by 90 per cent. for all he knows.  Remember that the State has given every encouragement to people like that to embark on such enterprise.  We have spent, probably, £12,000,000 from a Government fund <Col N="2347" /> alone on the improvement of roads during the past ten or 12 years.  That improvement was intended purposely, and is still intended, to encourage motor transport on the roads.  And now, without warning, without consent from these people at all, we come along and say: &ldquo;That type of enterprise must cease; we are going to take your business from you; we are going to take your livelihood from you; you have got to look in some other direction for a means of living, and we will give you certain compensation, but, with regard to the terms or the amount of that compensation, we can promise you nothing.&rdquo;  In face of sacrifices of that kind, that are being demanded from a certain section, is it such a colossal thing to ask the debenture holders of the Great Southern Railways Company to agree to a reduction of their capital in this way?</P>
      <P>As I said before, the debenture holders must be assumed to be citizens of the State anxious&mdash;particularly anxious &mdash; for the credit of the State &mdash; and surely it will redound to the credit of the State if we are able to prevent that big company, perhaps the biggest company in the country, from going bankrupt.</P>

As I have said previously, I doubt if any debenture holder, if it were put up to him, would prefer to realise his assets by the bankruptcy of this company rather than in this way.  If it were put up to any debenture holder that he could only realise his assets either by the bankrupt way or this way, I doubt if he would say: &ldquo;Give me the bankrupt way.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>But remember that there are a great many people who ought to have been consulted, if it were possible to have consulted them.  If it were possible to do so, it would be right under democratic rule to consult everyone concerned.  I doubt if any such interference with the ordinary life of the ordinary family in the country was ever attempted before as is attempted, not so much under this Bill as under the Road Transport Bill.  I do not think that any of us realises the extent to which it will affect the ordinary life of the people and I am inclined to think that the Minister has overdone it in that interference.  But necessity knows no law and the consequences of the bankruptcy of that big concern will be so great that nearly all of us, I am sure, are prepared to agree that that bankruptcy must be avoided at all costs.  In my opinion, looking at it in that way, so far from discouraging investors or people who are interested particularly in investments, I think that it will redound to the credit of the State and that its merit will be rather on the credit side of this country's investment attractions in the future.</P>

      <P>The necessity for this reorganisation of the finances of the company, the necessity for the provision of the other two Bills, were discussed by the directors of the company with me before the emergency situation arose and they agreed that reconstruction of the finances of the company was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>Admitted! But the matter was one that demanded to be dealt with as a general transport problem.  Nobody would have suggested that it was a situation that would require permanent depreciation of a trustee stock of the country.  That situation has developed because of the entirely abnormal situation which prevails at present.  I believe I am as amenable to reason as anyone, but it does not influence me, in the least, for the Minister to get up and say, time after time, &ldquo;we were convinced this transport scheme must be associated with reconstruction.&rdquo;  He stated that on Second Reading and he stated it several times since.  It does not influence me one bit to have that reiterated.  What I want to know is why is that so?  I cannot see any way in which general ease in the transport <Col N="2350" /> situation is going to be effected by the carrying through of this reconstruction scheme.  On the contrary, to my mind, it makes the whole trend of this remedial legislation nugatory.  It interferes directly with the operations of these transport Bills and their likelihood of producing a permanent change in our general transport situation. I am not under any delusion in this matter, neither is the Minister nor Deputy Davin.  These Bills &mdash; and I put them together for the moment &mdash; are not introduced for the benefit of the shareholders.  They are introduced in order to unify and put on a proper footing our transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The railways are necessary for our national life.  There was danger that things would so develop, that the railway services would have to be curtailed so much that the number of railwaymen unemployed was likely to be increased more and more.  That was the reason for these Bills, and for that reason I approve of these Bills.  There was a hope that by these Bills some good might be done to put the railway system in a more stable condition.  It was for that reason alone, and not for the benefit of the shareholders at all the Bills were introduced.  Therefore, there is no point in the Minister trying to insist upon this as something that the railway company had to expect if they were to get the other measures.  That is neither here nor there.  It is not a bargain in which the railway companies have to give up something in order to get something. That is not what we want to secure. What we want is to get the transport service into a proper state.  I agree with Deputy McGilligan and others that the only way to get that is to put the company into such a position that if necessary it can reconstruct itself; that it can put itself in such a state of stability that it may improve, and put itself into such a position that even if necessary it may be able to get fresh capital.  To my mind that is as clear as daylight.  I do not see how anyone can fail to see that if this reconstruction scheme is passed here it will absolutely prevent the raising of fresh capital.  I do not see how any man in his senses is going to put up fresh <Col N="2351" /> capital for the Government to take it away.  It will be said they have done it once and they may do it twice or three times if they want to.  No one would be such a fool as to throw away money like that.  In that way you are absolutely preventing the company developing itself or bringing about a unified transport system of its own motion apart from a measure like this.</P>
    <P>This is a reconstruction scheme! Hold it up for twelve months.  Give a chance of seeing if these other measures are capable of stabilising the company.  Refrain from doing any harm.  And you are going to do definite harm and, I am convinced, far more harm than you think by this measure.  Again I appeal to the Minister to hesitate.  There is no necessity for combining this reconstruction scheme with the other scheme.  Hold up the reconstruction scheme for at least 12 months and give the company a chance to rehabilitate itself.  I am not pessimistic enough to believe it is not going to rehabilitate itself or that it will not be able to raise money through its own shareholders.  It will be found solvent if you do not put this reconstruction scheme through.  Why cut down the debenture holders 15 per cent. and not cut off by 15 per cent. every other commitment to everyone else. You should no more pay the full 100 per cent. to ordinary creditors than pay it to debenture holders.  The Minister made a small point against me in his reply, and it was the only point he made, that I might have been construed as saying that the debentures were losing capital.  I know that the debentures are irredeemable, and, therefore, the debenture holder could not recover his £100 from the company, but that did not matter.  He would get a permanent four per cent. as long as there was hope of its being permanent.  His stock was valued at £84.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

This Bill is going to make the position worse.  I appeal for time in this matter.  Give the company a chance to get on its feet; do not attempt to force this reconstruction scheme through at the very worst crisis. Let us get back, partially at any rate, to the ordinary times before you do this.  Again I say, there is no real reason for connecting this forced reconstruction with the other clauses of your Bill.</P>

Deputy Dowdall said this reconstruction scheme was necessary in order that a reasonable dividend might be provided on the new capital.  I do not know whether the Minister is in agreement with him or not.  The most amazing comparison I heard in this debate came from Deputy Moore.  He endeavoured to persuade Deputies that the person who is to-day the owner of a lorry worth £300, purchased on the hire-purchase system and paid for by the lorry owner out of revenue on the instalment system, is in the same position as the person who invested £300 in the debenture shares of the Great Southern Railways Company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that a very small percentage of those engaged in road services paid for their lorries. Deputy McGilligan knows, and the Minister knows, that the majority of the single lorry owner-drivers, and a number of others who have two or three lorries, bought their lorries on the hire purchase system in England from the Leyland Motor Company and are paying for them on the instalment system.  Surely there is no comparison between those who are going to be compensated as existing carriers under the Bill and people who put a certain amount of money into the debenture shares of the Great Southern Railways Company.  The only thing I am concerned about, and personally I have a good deal of doubt about it, is in what respect the procedure proposed by the Minister is going to injure the future of the company.  If the Minister came to the House and told us plainly that he was bringing forward this proposal for the reconstruction of the capital of the company fully convinced that within 12 months he was going to ask the House to hand over the property at the reduced figure to the State, to be worked by the State, then I would say there was some good reason for it.  Is that in the Minister's mind?  If that is at the back of his mind, let him have the courage to say so, and I will for that reason, if he gives that as a reason, say that there may be some justification for his action.  I listened very carefully, without having any expert knowledge in a matter of this kind, without being in any way concerned in the matter other than being concerned as to the future financial <Col N="2354" /> stability of the country, to Deputy McGilligan, and I believe he made an unanswerable case against the procedure adopted by the Minister in this section.  The Minister has made no attempt, as a matter of fact, to answer him, up to the present.  Perhaps he will, before the debate concludes deal with the pertinent points made by Deputy McGilligan in his last speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add something to what I said previously arising out of what Deputy Moore said and what was said by Deputy Dowdall, who always asks what is the truth and will not wait for his answer.  I want to stand on common ground with Deputy Moore in one thing, that I do not think the farming community have as yet realised what these two Bills mean to them.  Putting the farming community in perspective first, and leaving the railway community &mdash; employees, shareholders, etc. &mdash; out of it, I do not believe the farming community yet realise what the Bills are going to do.  I think undoubtedly they are going to suffer immediately, and if they do not suffer eventually it will be only because the railway company will reconstitute themselves with a decent transport system and that they will take over, not merely some lorries, but the lorry activity of the people whom they displace.  Deputy Moore and I will probably have common ground in cur view that there is scant justice being done to some of these lorry owners.  But let us leave that aside for the moment and concentrate on the greater good to the greater number in this community; the people who want goods transported with a certain amount of convenience, with certain small handlings, with certain reduced expenditure, and the certainty of arrival in a particularly short period. I do not believe for a moment that the farming community yet realise the change that is going to be worked to their detriment by the Bills.  We ought to assist the railway company to lessen the harm that is likely to be done to the farming community and to lessen it in the shortest possible time.  The only way the railway company can do that is by running an auxiliary road <Col N="2355" /> service to the rails they have.  For that they will need capital.</P>
      <P>I should like to take up Deputy Davin on the only point raised worth considering.  We are speaking only of the debenture holders, of the people who put money into the debenture stock of the railway company.  We are leaving the rest out of consideration. Are people going to be frightened off putting money into the new concern &mdash; and it will need new money if the farmers are not going to suffer very severe damage &mdash; after what is happening to the debenture stock?  I think you have only to mention what is happening to the debenture stockholders to raise that fear.  What good is it going to do the new company? Here is the point on which I want to take up Deputy Moore.  Deputy Moore says that is what we did in the last couple of days to the lorry owner.  We did not do this.  We did not say that when the arbitrator comes to fix what is going to be given to the owner of a lorry that he cannot give more than 10 per cent. of the value or that he cannot give more than 50 per cent. We have, at any rate, avoided doing that to the lorry owner.  Here we say with regard to the ordinary stockholder of the railway company: &ldquo;You are written down to one-tenth of what you were originally,&rdquo; and so on up with the rest.  We, at any rate, have refrained from doing that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The value does not matter at present.  It is now only a question of the dividend to be paid. What is the harm to the new concern if there is not enough money to pay the ordinary stockholders on the old original capital?  They get nothing; the same with the preference.  We come to the debentures in the end. What is the saving in this?  You are going to do all this harm.  I think, undoubtedly, that you have only to mention this scheme to indicate the harm that is going to be done.  What are we going to save?  £50,000 a year. That is the saving on the debenture <Col N="2356" /> holders.  Deputy Dowdall has left the House.  He thinks it will enable new capital to come in, because, as the chairman said, out of £477,000 that has to be paid you are going to save £50,000 in the year.  Deputy Dowdall will probably march into the Lobby and vote at any rate for the possibility of saving £20,000 a year to the new concern and, at any rate, putting on the new concern the possibility of having to pay back £100,000 capital lent to them. Now where is the special harm done to the railway company in asking them to keep faith with the debenture stockholders to the extent of this £50,000 that is to be saved?</P>
      <P>This is a section of the Bill which I think inevitably means the destruction of the £20,000 receipts that are now coming in and may impose the necessity for paying back £100,000.  There is the point that there is £50,000 saving. There is too much talk of it being a bankrupt concern.  I am speaking now only in relation to the debenture holders.  This year, a terrible year according to the chairman's statement, the total receipts were £3,172,000 and the expenditure was £2,767,000.  The net income was £520,000.  The amount required to pay debenture stockholders on the fixed charges was £477,000.  There was a surplus shown here of £44,000, but there was £2,000 brought in from last year.  On the year's working, however, there was a surplus of £42,000.  There is a surplus nearly to the amount that is being saved in this, without breaking credit with the debenture stockholders, after paying the debenture stock.  Why should we insist on breaking faith with these people and prevent their seizing on the assets of the company which is their legal right?  Why should we insist that that is necessary at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said, in an interjection, that if the directors had not put this up, at any rate they had agreed to it and he asked further had there not been shareholders' meetings since? What does the chairman say about reconstruction?  He said: &ldquo;The Minister, in all our interviews with him, was insistent in his demands for reconstruction of the company's capital <Col N="2357" /> simultaneously with the enactment of any measures of relief.&rdquo;  Here is the phrase the Minister makes his point about: &ldquo;He contended that it was obviously hopeless ever again to earn any dividend for the greater number of our shareholders so long as their existing nominal capital values remained unaltered.  The chairman added: &ldquo;That was an undeniable contention.&rdquo; I asked previously that the circumstances in which the chairman was asked to agree to that contention should be declared.  He certainly did not mean anything about the debenture shareholders, because he goes on to say: &ldquo;We pointed out to him that any effective scheme of reconstruction must embrace the debenture holders who were in regular receipt of their full interest and whom we did not represent.&rdquo;  Definitely I hold the view which the directors held, that they must cut out the debenture holders from any recommendations, agreements or submissions that the Minister put to them.</P>
    <P>There were shareholders' meetings.  I think there have been three different meetings of different groups of shareholders since the proposals were made. Does the Minister mean that the shareholders accepted this reconstruction of capital?  I have hurriedly searched the various statements that were made and I cannot find anything by way of agreement with reconstruction of capital anywhere in these statements. I find one shareholder saying that &ldquo;it was a great shame that their shares should be scrapped like that.&rdquo;  Another said that &ldquo;it was one of the most infamous Bills ever put before a legislative assembly.  Such a scheme of legislative robbery was never heard of in any country.&rdquo;  A third shareholder said that &ldquo;the policy of the Government had been framed on the basis that they were the owners of the railway and that the interests of the shareholders were a secondary consideration.&rdquo;  Another shareholder suggested to the Minister that &ldquo;it was a leap in the dark to reconstruct the capital of the company until he had some data to go upon in relation to the improvements that he thought were going to arise from the <Col N="2358" /> new Bills.  Those Bills had as their origin an attempt to give better revenue, but nobody knew what revenue they would give &mdash; whether they would increase or decrease revenue. Let them bide their time for two, three or four years to see what was the effect of these Bills before they seriously suggested to intelligent people that they wanted the capital cut down to a definite figure for which they had no data.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister's interjection about shareholders meant. As far as the chairman was concerned, he said the debenture holders were definitely out of this.  Once the proposals came before them, put before them merely as guesswork, the shareholders almost to a man were against the proposals.  The Minister has said that the directors were ready to agree to the suggestion of a reconstruction of capital.  I would like to query the Minister a little bit on that point. The ordinary way in which a reconstruction of capital could be brought about would be by those interested in the concern promoting a private Bill. Was that ever suggested to the directors, and, if so, what answer was given?  I think that the answer they would be bound to give is quite obvious.  What happened at the shareholders' meeting must prove them to be good judges of their own people. Imagine the directors of the Great Southern Railways Company going before the two Houses of the Oireachtas to reduce the capital of the company and being met in the attempt to prove the preamble of the Bill by their own shareholders, which undoubtedly would be the position.  Is that what the Minister means by saying that he got the directors in the end to agree to a reconstruction of capital, or does he mean that what he got them to agree to was that, if it had to be done, it had better be done by him than by them, because they could not face their shareholders on the matter?</P>
    <P>There is another point.  It was announced at the shareholders' meeting this year that there was a net income of £525,000, sufficient, at any <Col N="2359" /> rate, to pay the debenture stock.  The chairman indicated that they had lost so much during the year.  What did he say was the extra loss involved to the railways by reason of the economic war?  A very moderate estimate of £100,000.  Are we going to have this as a permanency in our economic lives in this country, this extra loss of £100,000?  Will Deputy Davin think that, that being the situation, there is any case made at this moment for the writing down of the debenture stock to save £50,000 at a time when we are adding on certain other charges to the company?  I want to refer here to the case which was made in a rather aggravated way, in regard to the 1924 Act.  Deputy Good said, joined by Deputy Thrift, that the 1924 Act injured the company.  That that Act injured the company I have grave doubts.  The chairman was able to tell us this year that economies had been effected under the impact of the 1924 Act, so as to reduce their working expenses by £1,700,000 in a year, after compensation paid to employees. That £1,700,000 would pay a great many shareholders, not alone the debenture shareholders, but other people also.  If there was a transfer of the old stock into stock of the new company what was the standard given to the outside impartial body established to determine the value of the stock?  It was this, that they should give them a sufficient holding in the stock of the new company, that new company being declared to be one which had a certain standard revenue equal to the aggregate standard revenue of a particular named three years &mdash; not the best in the history of the railway company, but nearly the best.  So far from writing down the value, that was an attempt to put an appreciated value on the transferred stock, the stocks transferred into the new company.  The standard revenue has not worked out according to expectations, not by reason of anything that is in the 1924 Act, but by reason of new circumstances, new circumstances which the present Bills are designed to meet.  Why not give them a chance?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2360" /> I want to get back to where I am on common ground with Deputy Moore.  I have made the point over and over again with regard to employees and I want to stress it with regard to those who first embarked their money into the most strongly guaranteed stock that a transport concern could give them.  I want to stress the point with regard to those who put their money into debenture stock, those who really built the railways.  Why should they not be given a chance to get back to their ancient positions, to remake their ancient positions?  They may have to add on new capital, but you have a better chance of getting them to add something if you leave their old debenture stock as it is than you will have by merely putting forward here a scheme based expressly on guesswork without the authority of the directors and without any attempt to get into consultation with the debenture holders.  Your proposal here is to write it down to a certain figure.  I plead with Deputy Thrift that this move is not necessary.  It has not been shown to be an essential part of the new scheme.  The savings are inconsiderable in relation to the harm likely to be done.</P>
    <P>If anybody has a right to get benefit from the new transport undertaking, it ought to be the people who long ago embarked their money in this way.  I am not saying that these are the original holders &mdash; the people who are now in possession &mdash; but if there has been a change how has it been worked? Owing to the peculiar situation which developed with regard to this type of railway stock, in the main all stock is held for the people whose funds were in the possession of the courts of the country &mdash; orphans, widows, people whose property had to be taken care of for them, people who were, to some degree, by reason of age or infirmity or some particular position which is regarded as a weakness, placed in the position that their money had to be taken charge of and embarked on what was supposed to be gilt-edged, safe, untouchable securities.  Now the Government say: &ldquo;We are going to touch them and we are doing it at a time when we say we need new money <Col N="2361" /> for the rehabilitation of the new undertaking which we are going to build on the foundations of the old.&rdquo;  I say it is unwise and unnecessary.</P>

      <P>Not a bit lonely.  You may be bored here, and bored excessively I will admit, but you are never lonely.  The opposite side suffers from too many lawyers.  I have found during my lifetime that lawyers usually pretend they know everything about everything and everybody.  That is the position over there.  I am sorry for it because the lawyers there are intellectual men &mdash; there is no doubt about that.  I like to listen to them sometimes. They are young men, most of them, and they have to make their way in the world and I take an interest in them from that standpoint.  According to them, however, everything that is proposed by the Government here is bad.  The Road Traffic Bill is bad, the control of road traffic is bad, the Railway Bill is bad, and the Cuts Bill is bad.  I suppose Ole Bill would be bad, if he were here &mdash; he is the man who wrote about the things that happened during the war.  How is it that intelligent, intellectual men go on with that sort of nonsense?  Surely, if Ministers here propose a certain measure that the Opposition think is not a good measure, ought not the Opposition try to be constructive and show that they could produce a better measure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was taught a certain philosophy long ago by a man who said: &ldquo;If your neighbour puts up a matchbox, you put up a better matchbox.  If your neighbour puts up a henroost, you put up a <Col N="2362" /> better henroost.&rdquo;  I offer that philosophy to the Deputies on the opposite benches.  I am afraid, unfortunately, that their minds are warped. I do not mention this for the purpose of raising a laugh.  It is a very old story, as old as I am myself.  A man was indicted before the court for some offence.  He said: &ldquo;I am a poor man. I have no money for a lawyer.&rdquo;  The judge said: &ldquo;Well, then, I will appoint Mr. So and So to defend you.&rdquo;&ldquo;In that case, my lord, I will plead guilty,&rdquo; said the man.  Let me say that I am indicted before a court.  I have committed burglary &mdash; perhaps that savours too much of adventure for me &mdash; or I have picked pockets or I have been drunk and disorderly and have beaten the police.  The Cumann na nGaedheal lawyers are present in court.  I say to the judge: &ldquo;I am a poor man.  I cannot afford to fee a lawyer.&rdquo;  Then the judge says: &ldquo;Prisoner at the Bar, I name Mr. Cumann na nGaedheal to defend you.&rdquo;  I say immediately: &ldquo;My lord, I plead guilty and I throw myself on the mercy of the court.&rdquo;  That is safer for me because I am perfectly satisfied the Cumann na nGaedheal lawyer would say: &ldquo;This man has been a back bencher of the Fianna Fáil Party and if he is not in jail he deserves to be.  My defence of him will be such that, while he might get three months by throwing himself on the mercy of the court, he will probably get six or maybe 12 months if I defend him.&rdquo;  That is the position in crude, probably ignorant, language.  According to the lawyers over there, everything is bad.  The Minister here is making an effort to try and rehabilitate what is admitted on all sides to be a decaying industry.  He is doing his best and putting all the wisdom and strength at his command into the work.</P>

      <P>I could not.  If I had his ability and knowledge I would try. According to Cumann na nGaedheal, nothing good can come from the Fianna Fáil Benches.  Why do they not produce better?  That is a fair challenge. They are here to serve the country, just as we are.  If I were in <Col N="2363" /> the position of a Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy I would be prepared to say: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil are over there and I am over here.  The only chance I have of getting back is to show I have a constructive mind and that I am not always criticising.&rdquo;  I have to be careful about my words here, but if I were outside the Chamber I would know the word I would like to use.  I merely stood up out of charity.  There is an abundance of charity on these benches and we never get credit for it.  The charity on the opposite benches would fit into an egg-cup.  If those men wish to serve their country better than they are now doing they would endeavour to show where our proposals are wrong and prove that they could do better.</P>
      <P>I heard about the 1924 Act dealing with railways.  A number of us were not here in 1924 and probably it is a good job for us.  Whatever mess was made of the railways in 1924, the gentlemen over there who were then in power are responsible. Our man says: &ldquo;This is my effort.&rdquo;  Then from the opposite benches we have all sorts of destructive criticism.  I have been sitting here a patient man for a long time and I am going to be patient no longer.  We back benchers are looked upon as a lot of duds.  People are beginning to say outside the House that all the intelligence is over there.  We sit here and we want to do the work.  That is what we came here for.  I did not come here to make speeches.  A quarter of an hour ago I had no more idea of making a speech than any of you here, but I cannot help it; I cannot stick it any longer.  I am going to give you fair notice now that we are going to be very assertive for the future.  We want our Ministers' work done.  The only people whom we care about are the people who sent us here.  If they say &ldquo;You did not do your work well,&rdquo; then we are prepared to go out; but until they do say it we are going to help our Government as far as we can and we are going to stand up definitely against the great intellectuals over there who, unfortunately, are not doing much constructive work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of the <Col N="2364" /> reorganisation of the Great Southern Railways' finances was discussed at considerable length during the course of the Second Reading debate and also this afternoon, and I do not think that any useful purpose could be served by taking the discussion further.  It is quite clear that those Deputies who have spoken on the matter have already made up their own minds as to the attitude they are taking, and nothing that is likely to be said now will alter them.  I want to get them right on the facts.  First of all, as to the history of this proposal, I have this to say:&mdash; The directors of the Great Southern Railways came to me, in the first instance, and said their enterprise was in a bad way.  They pointed out that since 1924 they have never succeeded in earning the very restricted standard revenue fixed by the Act of 1924.  They pointed out that in the year 1932 money would not likely be available for the payment of interest and dividend on the debenture stock, if the full charge for the maintenance of the permanent way and the rolling stock was to be met.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that for the arrears in respect of maintenance on the branch lines a sum of over £800,000 would have to be provided.  They showed that the position of the company had been steadily deteriorating not last year but for a number of years past and they asked that certain legislative action should be taken.  They asked that their competitors should be brought under very rigid control so that they would be in a position to put them out of business altogether.  They asked that certain debts due to the State by the railway company should be cancelled.  They asked that they should be released from the statutory undertakings which were imposed for the purpose of protecting public interests, and they made other requests too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said to them, as I have already said here to-night, that the majority of the things they asked were things that would have to be done in pursuance of any policy of transport reorganisation, but if they were to be done there should also be a reorganisation of the company's finances.  I said that the main idea behind any scheme <Col N="2365" /> should be the provision of a transport system not so much with the view to the earning of dividends upon capital &mdash; the greater part of which was represented by assets no longer capable of earning revenue &mdash; as with a view to the better organisation of transport.  The directors &mdash; not in a vague statement at an annual meeting this year &mdash; admitted to me in my office that a scheme of financial reorganisation was necessary and desirable.  I told them that I would prefer to have that reorganisation of their finances undertaken by them and that we could secure the enactment here of the necessary provisions so as to give them the power to carry out that reconstruction.  I told them definitely that it was the policy of this Government, over which it was prepared to stand, that the measure imposing these burdens upon the competitors of the railway company and the prospect of additional burdens upon a large number of people in this country would not be given effect to until the reorganisation of the finances took place.  That is a matter of policy upon which division of opinion may exist. It happens to be the policy of this Government, and it is justifiable from every point of view.</P>
    <P>The discussion on that particular matter took place long ago.  It was not last week nor the week before.  It took place well over six months ago for the first time, and there was considerable delay.  It became quite clear to me that we would have to wait a long time for a reconstruction of the company's finances by that method. It was clear to me that the more straightforward scheme was the one we are now putting forward in this Bill because any scheme which the company would devise and which would be approved of by any class of shareholders would have to be as drastic as that in the Bill and probably much more drastic than that to meet the Government's views.  I had intended saying here to-day, on Deputy Thrift's amendment, that in the event of any such proposal coming into operation and a scheme of reconstruction being considered by any tribunal, I would consider myself obliged to urge <Col N="2366" /> that having regard to the earnings of the company and the present market value of the different stocks and shares the reduction of the capital effected by the Bill was not sufficient and that in fact there should be a bigger reduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>That amendment was not moved.  In the event of the Minister not yielding anything that we asked for, I want to ask if he would be prepared to bring in an amendment of his own on Report Stage and get considered advice in the meantime. The position would have been well considered then?</P>

      <P>No. The details could not have been better considered than they have been.

The Deputies who spoke here to-night tried to make some point as to the possibility of the company requiring additional capital in the near future and urged that the adoption of the proposals in this Bill would prevent its getting that capital.

      <P>The fact is that until the future of railway undertakings is more clearly known the prospect of any additional capital being raised for any railway enterprise is extremely doubtful, to say the least.  The position, however, is that quite a number of industries of various kinds have carried out reconstruction schemes in recent years for the purpose of putting themselves in the position of raising fresh capital.  Of course, we will be told that these reconstruction schemes were approved by the shareholders. What does that mean?  In the majority of cases, the approval of the shareholders was purely formal, as the directors had prepared schemes for submission to the shareholders, and were able to ensure their acceptance.  In so far as there was a minority, wherever there was a minority, it made no essential difference whether the reduction in the nominal values was effected by majority vote or by Acts of Parliament.  As far as they were concerned, the effect of the change was the same.  Still that action was taken in these cases to enable fresh capital to be raised, and I want to have it shown that the effect of leaving the Great Southern Railways finances unchanged is going to enable the company to raise additional capital before I am satisfied that that situation is not more likely to be achieved as a result of the measure before the Dáil.  In any case we are in this position, that the proposal is an essential part of our railway and transport proposals.  One part stands with the other, and I for one would <Col N="2368" /> not be prepared to recommend to the House, or to anyone, that these restrictions should be placed on road transport, or that additional burdens should be placed on the country and on the Exchequer for the benefit of the railway company, unless these essential measures of re-organisation were also adopted.</P>

I do not know whether their view is that there should not be reorganisation, or that it should be delayed for a number of years.  I am faced with the fact that those with intimate knowledge of the situation have agreed that reorganisation should be effected, or that there should be reorganisation concurrently with the scheme in these two Bills.

I am saying to them that concurrently with the reorganisation of the capital we are prepared to enact legislation to put the railway company in a position in which they will be able to make the standard charges real charges.  Deputy Good said that this Bill conferred no benefit on the railway company.  The railway directors did not say that.  Whatever these Bills may do when they become Acts of Parliament they will create the position in which the railway company will not have to cut standard charges to flitters.  They will be able to make the standard charges the real charges and to estimate in relation to the volume of traffic what they can do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It means raising them. In any circumstances if we are to have a sound transport reorganisation we must have higher charges, because the essence of the whole thing is that transport is being sold under the cost of production.  Let us consider the position of the debenture holders.  In essence what is the difference between the debenture stock and the guaranteed preference stock?  No difference except that in certain circumstances the <Col N="2370" /> debenture holders can put in a receiver.  Is it practical politics in any circumstances for the debenture holders to put in a receiver?  The receiver cannot realise on the assets of the company.  His only power would be to carry on the business until the arrears of interest were made good, and he would have to carry it on on sound business lines, making provision for depreciation and for the maintenance of the system.  In present circumstances he would not be able to earn the debenture interest, much less the arrears of such interest.  If he had power to realise on the assets, does anyone believe that he would realise £85 on every £100 worth of debentures? I do not like to quote the market value of these stocks, but we must appreciate the fact that that is some indication of the value of these stocks in the eyes of the commercial community.  The capital of this company has been written down by the commercial community much more drastically than we propose.  That is an argument on which no very great reliance can be placed, because of the smallness of the movement in the stock.  Whatever value these stocks have in the markets would disappear entirely if there was any general movement to realise.  In that connection I would like Deputies to realise that a very large number of the debenture holders and of the other classes of shareholders bought their holdings on the market at prices substantially less than the nominal values to which these stocks are reduced by the Bill.  I have mentioned the matter of the minor stocks.  The priority of the charge on the Great Southern Railways for the City of Dublin Junction Guaranteed Stock is one point on which we are seeking additional information which has not been supplied by the railway company. In that connection, and in connection with the other stocks mentioned, I agree that a case could be made for an amendment of the Bill, but a decision on that will not be possible until we get the information which is required and which was asked for. Those were the main points raised.  It seems to me, however, that Deputies have got to be prepared to consider <Col N="2371" /> the proposals in these two Bills as a whole.  It has got to be realised first of all that it is not possible to make distinctions and say &ldquo;because this condition confers a benefit on the railway companies we are prepared to accept it, but because this one imposes some restriction we will reject it.&rdquo; The thing has to stand as a whole.  It has to be borne in mind that the essential condition must be the bringing into existence in this country of a transport organisation not overburdened with capital liabilities to such an extent that proper provision cannot be made for maintenance and improvement of the services.  If the railway company were to continue in existence with a nominal £26,000,000 capital it is undoubtedly correct that the natural inclination would be to secure from receipts the payment of dividends upon all classes of that capital before making any proper provision for maintenance or renewals. That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that in all the circumstances we are not doing any injustice to anybody.  It is true that the debenture holders are suffering a comparatively small reduction in their interest payments, but their position is being improved in so far as the possibility of that interest continuing into the future is greatly strengthened.  If there were any sound prospect of the 4 per cent. interest being payable for any number of years ahead those debenture stocks would not be quoted at 35 on the market.  It is because the commercial community does not think there is any real prospect of the 4 per cent. being paid for any length of time that that value is put on the stock.  The reduction of the interest payment and the reduction in the <Col N="2372" /> nominal value of the stock will somewhat diminish the yearly return, but the real value of the stock will be increased and the period over which the interest will be payable will be very considerably prolonged.  In respect of the other classes of stock, the position is the same.  The nominal value will be reduced, but the real value will be increased.  In addition, we are going to get a transport organisation that will be economically sound, and consequently, can be conducted on an economic basis.  That is why this section of the Bill is essential.</P>

      <P>I recognise the enormous burden under which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been labouring during the last fortnight, and what a terrific strain it must have been to handle those Bills, but he cannot imagine that the reply he has made to this debate is in any way conclusive or adequate.  What I would suggest is that the Report Stage of this Bill be postponed until after the Recess, in order that the Minister may have an opportunity of considering the very grave issues he is handling at the present time.  I do not intend to be offensive or sarcastic.  I recognise that the Minister has been acting under a terrific burden, but his reply has not met the points raised.  All I am asking is that he will consider the desirability of postponing the Report Stage until after the Recess, so that he can give a considered judgment on the issues.</P>

    <P>Section 5, as drafted, provided that a review of the standard charges might be made at the same time as the revision of the standard revenue consequent on the reduction of the capital.  It is considered desirable, however, that some time should elapse to allow for a possible reconstruction of the Great Southern Railways system under Section 8 of the Bill.  Amendments 13 and 14, therefore, provide for a postponement of the reviews of standard charges under Section 54 of the 1924 Act, and that in effect that it should commence to operate afresh under the new conditions created by this Bill and the Road Transport Bill, from the appointed day to be fixed by the Minister, which will, in all probability, be the day on which the capital reconstruction comes fully into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I want to know what it means even in its amended form.  The section provides that &ldquo;as soon as conveniently may be after the passing of this Act, the Railway Tribunal shall reconsider the standard revenue (within the meaning of Section 53 of the Principal Act),&rdquo; and after hearing various people &ldquo;the Railway Tribunal shall adjust and vary the said standard revenue to such extent (if any) and in such manner as appears to the Railway Tribunal to be just and equitable in consequence of the reconstruction of the capital of the company effected by this Act.&rdquo;  What has the reconstruction of the capital of the company got to do with standard revenue?  The Minister refers this to the Tribunal and refers to them standard revenue within the meaning of Section 53 of the Principal Act. But standard revenue, as reviewed by the Tribunal, was never a question of the distribution of the moneys.  It is a question of the receipts that were to be earned, not the purpose of them. The terms of reference laid down for the Tribunal was that the standard charges were to be such as would &ldquo;so far as practicable yield, with efficient and economical working and management, an annual net revenue (hereinafter referred to as the standard revenue) equivalent to the average annual aggregate net revenue for the three years of account ended next before the 1st day of January, 1914.&rdquo; That is not changed.  Therefore, if the standard revenue remains the same as before, what is the idea of referring this in relation to the reconstruction of the capital?  The reconstruction of the capital only affects the distribution of the receipts.  The standard revenue has to be fixed without any relation to distribution at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite correct.  As the Deputy is aware, standard revenue has never been earned and there appears to be no prospect of its being earned.  In fact, the railway holds that no system of charges which can be devised could meet the case.  We think that the reconstruction of capital is a suitable opportunity of having the standard revenue reduced <Col N="2377" /> so that a new standard revenue will be fixed which will be within the company's ability to earn and which will have, of course, some definite relation to the prior charges and the total capital commitments of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But you have defined what standard revenue is. It really means something over £1,000,000.  That amount was not determined in relation to so much for debenture, so much for preference and so much for ordinary shareholders.  It simply was how much was earned&mdash; what was the net aggregate income earned in three years, and the railway said &ldquo;take that as a fixed standard.&rdquo; You do not say that another standard should be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard revenue which was fixed had relation to the revenue of the company in the years to which the Deputy referred.  In these years a certain proportion of the revenue of the Company was paid in dividends to the shareholders.  It was the amount required for various charges and to pay dividends.  In view of the fact that the capital has been reconstructed we think there should be a review of the standard revenue.  We tell them to review the standard revenue in whatever manner they think to be just and equitable in consequence of this reconstruction of the capital.  That is the intention. It is possible that the drafting is defective, but if it is defective we can have it examined.  However, the intention is to vary the revenue in such a manner as would appear just and equitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the intention, but, if so, I think the intention is not carried out.  Originally, it was given one test only.  Section 53 of the Principal Act says that what is called revenue is &ldquo;the equivalent to the average annual aggregate net revenue for the three years of account ended next before the first day of January, 1914.&rdquo;  That is, in fact, a sum of about £1,000,000.  They are the terms of reference of the Railway Tribunal.  Standard revenue is £1,000,000.  You do not say because they have to pay X, Y and Z £1,000,000, as if it was tightly tied up. You say &ldquo;within the meaning of Section 53 of the Principal Act&rdquo;; and then you say the only standard for adjudication is what was earned in three years irrespective of what it was equivalent to, and anybody would say that that same sum can still be your standard.  The standard revenue still stands.  At least, the criterion by which it was arrived at still stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  The Railway Tribunal fixed £1,000,000, or whatever the sum may be.  Having determined to reconsider the standard revenue &ldquo;the Railway Tribunal shall adjust and vary the said standard revenue to such extent (if any) and in such manner as appears to the Railway Tribunal to be just and equitable in consequence of the reconstruction of the capital.&rdquo;  I think the meaning would be clear if the words &ldquo;in consequence of the reconstruction of the capital&rdquo; went in after the word &ldquo;tribunal,&rdquo; so that it should read &ldquo;the Railway Tribunal in consequence of the reconstruction of the capital shall adjust and vary the said standard revenue to such extent (if any) and in such manner as appears to the Railway Tribunal to be just and equitable.&rdquo; But I think it is quite clear that they shall adjust the standard revenue which was previously fixed at £1,100,000.</P>

      <P>That means in consequence of something that never entered into their heads before when they were fixing standard revenue.  I do not see how the argument can even be heard by the Railway Tribunal. Deputy Dillon is going into an extreme case.  I do not deny his locus standi as a man to argue before the Tribunal, but I doubt if that argument is relevant.  Supposing we said that they should vary it because we want the money to go on a prolonged spree for a number of years.  They would refuse that because they would say that that was never any part of their calculations when they were putting up standard revenue.  The revenue is still £1,000,000 a year.  It is a complete matter of irrelevance if you say to the Tribunal: &ldquo;Remember, we are not having so much of that £1,000,000 spent in commitments to shareholders.&rdquo;  The Tribunal would be right to say: &ldquo;We never considered that before and we do not think we are bound to consider it now.&rdquo;  All we were bound to consider was what did the railway earn in the <Col N="2381" /> three named years.

      <Col N="2382" /> Must the Railway Tribunal then fix the charge?  The section begins by stating that the Railway Tribunal may reconsider the standard revenue of the company and the Tribunal shall adjust and vary the said standard revenue to such an extent as appears to be just and equitable, in consequence of the reconstruction of the capital of the company.  We all know how the standard revenue was arrived at, by taking the three years' average, and now it is £1,000,000; they go on to say that the standard revenue will be the revenue for the purposes of Sections 53 and 54 of the Act of 1924.  Will paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) of the Bill apply?  It says: &ldquo;The Railway Tribunal may, concurrently with the reconsideration of the said standard revenue of the company in pursuance of this section review the standard charges and exceptional charges... and make such (if any) modification of such charges or any of them as the Railway Tribunal shall consider to be proper...&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And it will be known again.  I still hold to my contention that there is a completely irrelevant matter being dragged before the Tribunal.  They were to find out the particular sum earned during the three years as standard revenue in order to fix the charges.  It is a matter of considerable difficulty to fix charges, of course, because of the variation up and down between classes of merchandise. Still it was done.  Now we are getting in a new consideration.  The Railway Tribunal is entitled to say: &ldquo;We had <Col N="2385" /> not this before us in the first instance. If we are to get in the new consideration, we have to readjust the whole thing on the footing of that consideration.&rdquo; What does that mean?  If they take this at all, which I still doubt, they will have to have before their minds as an order from the Oireachtas that the first purpose of the standard revenue is to pay dividends.  What did the £1,100,000 pay?  It certainly paid full dividends on the debentures and the guaranteed stock down to the ordinary stockholders.  What did it pay to them?  Considerable dividends. Are they now to say: &ldquo;Very good, the ordinary stock is reduced to one-tenth; divide that by ten.&rdquo;  The old amount used to go before to the provision of certain dividend to them and similarly all along the line with the other ones. That is Deputy Dillon's point.  We must make up our minds to stand somewhere or another.  Previously we did give the Railway Tribunal something fixed to go by &mdash; to find out what was earned in certain years and by that measure fix the standard charges. Now it is like mixing two completely distinct elements.  They are to remember the old standard revenue and remember something that they never took into consideration before and that was not before them when they fixed the standard revenue &mdash; the distribution of the standard revenue. We have to say: &ldquo;Stand entirely on that foot for the future; think of how near to 100 per cent. payments the £1,100,000 allowed to all the guaranteed shareholders and find out what additional it allowed, in fact, to be paid to the ordinary shareholders, and revalue that according to the reconstruction of the capital.&rdquo;  If that is the case the Minister's statement that standard revenue is going to be more real and mean charges being put up I do not think will be borne out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When I said the charges might be increased I meant that there would not be the same number of exceptional charges.  At the present time, the standard charges are being departed from considerably and, in fact, the railway company are continually making application for leave to charge exceptional rates.  The number <Col N="2386" /> of these exceptional rates is very great, and it is the fact that these rates are being charged that has cut the revenue down.  With the new situation the necessity to quote exceptional rates in order to get traffic will not be there and, consequently, the standard charges will be a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a change that can be made in either of two ways; either the standard charges will, in fact, become exceptional ones, or the exceptional ones will be raised to some point higher, so as to be nearer to the standard charges laid down by the Tribunal.  The Minister indicated that there was going to be an increase in actual charges made to the public. Does he think there will?  The new terms of reference to the Tribunal are to cut down that old £1,100,000, after thinking of what it supplied in the way of dividends, in relation to the new moneys which under this will be payable to the stockholders.  Supposing there is only one element that is variable in this.  All the classes scheduled here are named percentages with the exception of the ordinary stock &mdash; the North Wall Extension Line Stock; the City of Dublin Junction Railways Stocks.  There is only one of these material &mdash; the ordinary stock. Supposing the £1,100,000 that was paid in the years of account ending 1st January, 1914, after meeting all the other stockholders in full, allowed a payment of four per cent. to the ordinary stockholder.  Does that mean that the Railway Tribunal have now to go back and say: &ldquo;Very good, the stock paid four per cent. in 1914.  We will take, as one element in the calculation, what will give four per cent. on one-tenth of this stock, and so on up along the line with all the other stocks&rdquo;?  Is that what is meant or what is meant?  Where are we between the two things?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What is meant is that the Railway Tribunal is being asked, in view of this reorganisation of the capital, to reconsider the standard revenue, and, because of that reorganisation, fix whatever standard revenue appears to be just and equitable.  It <Col N="2387" /> probably will mean the reduction of standard revenue, but the reduction need not be in exactly the same proportion as the reduction in the total capital.  There are obviously a number of considerations to be taken into account by the Railway Tribunal in making the calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is the four per cent. guaranteed preference stock reduced by 50 per cent.  The Railway Tribunal are asked to reduce the standard revenue from what it was and remember when doing it the reduction in capital.  They will look at this and say: &ldquo;The Oireachtas, in their wisdom, have decided that the four per cent. guaranteed preference stockholders should only be paid as if every £100 was worth £50.  £1,100,000 used to give four per cent. on the entire amount.  We will give four per cent. on half the amount.&rdquo;  Surely that is just and equitable from the point of view of the Railway Tribunal.  Or are the Tribunal to say: &ldquo;We think the Oireachtas were unduly harsh towards those people&rdquo;?  You have gone completely away from the three years of account ending 1st January, 1914.  You are on some new footing, and the only thing you have added to that, reversing this, is what is to be just and equitable in view of the reconstruction. Surely they have to take the reconstruction as it comes from the Oireachtas &mdash; such and such a stock cut down 50 per cent., something reduced to one-tenth.  I get back to my first point, and I should like the Minister to have a further look at this and see can the Railway Tribunal take this into consideration at all.  Are they not tied to the old standard revenue fixed for the three years of account and after that, if you let in this idea of reconstruction of capital, how can you prevent the Railway Tribunal from considering as just and equitable a reduction corresponding to the reduction in the value of the capital stocks which we have degraded?  Surely it is the obvious thing to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister that the standard revenue was <Col N="2388" /> fixed as a revenue which was really to guide the Tribunal in fixing the rates.  Owing to the conditions that prevailed the standard revenue was never reached and the whole thing became a farce.  What was the report of the Tribunal as recently as July last?  They stated that the net revenue for 1931 was £499,455, practically half a million below the standard.  The standard net revenue had been fixed at £1,169,899.  In other words, that the revenue in 1931 was only, in approximate figures, half the standard revenue.  They go on to say that they are satisfied that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No modification of the present rates and charges as fixed by the Tribunal would assist the company to a nearer approach to the standard revenue.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, while trade is so depressed and while the volume of traffic is small, it is useless to try to fix or to get a nearer approach to the standard revenue.  Now, let us look at the proposition of fixing in the near future, while those conditions still prevail, any standard revenue.  The one was fixed so high that the revenue could not approach it and, if you are going to fix another standard revenue when conditions are very depressed, you will get to the other end and you will have some difficulty.  I suggest to the Minister, in view of what the Tribunal has said, that it would be exceedingly unwise while these abnormal conditions prevail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The question that is being raised is revenue.  What I said before and what I repeat now is that, although the standard revenue may be reduced, in consequence of this reorganisation of the company's finances, it is not likely that the rates will be reduced because the rates, having regard to the volume of traffic, have not been able to yield the standard revenue, and, right from the beginning, the point of view was taken that the standard revenue could not be secured and rates were not, in fact, fixed for that purpose because of the point of view that was then held &mdash; that the volume of traffic offered was such that no system of rates could produce the standard revenue in so far as the increase that would appear necessary to get increased revenue would stop the traffic and thus defeat its own end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates were fixed at the level that traffic could bear &mdash; the highest rate that could operate and still allow traffic to move &mdash; but no system of fixation on that basis was capable of yielding the standard revenue and that is why I say that, even though the standard revenue may be reduced, the <Col N="2390" /> rates are not likely to be reduced because the old rates, unable to yield the old revenue, may also be unable to yield the new revenue and, certainly, will not be able to yield more.</P>
