    <Title>Promotion of Pig Production&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> Debate resumed on motion by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a motion: &ldquo;That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for the purpose of enquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance, that is to say:&mdash;(1) the present position of pig production in Saorstát Eireann and of the industries and trades dealing with live pigs, pig meat, whether fresh or cured, and other pig products,&rdquo; and so on for seven sections dealing with aspects of pig production.  It is strange that when the Minister was asking for permission to set up a tribunal to deal with the pig industry he left the part of Hamlet out of the scope of the inquiry.  I could understand, and I think the country could understand, and would have appreciated his proposal if he asked for an inquiry as to how the economic war had affected the pig industry and farming economy generally.  If he had put up a proposition like that, this discussion would probably be productive of good results, and if he were satisfied with a Commission of Inquiry it would have brought out in very bold relief how the pig industry and the whole farming economy generally were affected by the economic war.  Of course, the Ministry, true to their traditions, will talk of everything under the sun except the kernel of the matter at hand. This whole proposal would be better described as a hogwash proposal.  If it were so termed by the Minister, we could deal with the serious and lighter sides without being afraid of forcing the Ceann Comhairle to rise in his seat.  Pigs are commonly called hogs, so I do not think I will be out of order if I proceed to deal with this hogwash tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, this is called a tribunal. I understood the Minister to say yesterday that the tribunal would have power not only to call witnesses, but to force witnesses to attend and, of course, having forced them to attend, to force them to give evidence.  I wonder what part of the Russian system of Government this is.  There seems to be about <Col N="664" /> all the measures that the present Government are introducing a continuity of compulsion, of prying into private business, so that if they continue much further in that direction there will be no such thing as private business in this country, because every private business man will have a Government inspector at the front door and the back door and in his office. Then we shall have reached the El Dorado of communism like the imperceptible change to the Republic.  When we have eliminated all the obnoxious symbols in the Constitution, to quote the President, then the formal change to the Republic will be imperceptible. So it will be with the economic and social life of this country, with the so-called reforms the Government are attempting to put over.  When these are all in working order the change from the present social state to the communist social state will be imperceptible, because we will have practical communism before we have the courage to come out publicly and acknowledge that we are communistic.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had given any examination to his conscience before proposing this motion he would have known that the inevitable has happened.  It should happen when people who were in a large way of production last year found a sudden change and their markets swept away.  The Minister for Defence stated: &ldquo;Now we will have cheap food,&rdquo; when he wanted to appeal to the lower instincts of the mob.  But the Minister had not the experience of laying out his working capital on the production of food.  He was not looking forward to the harvest when he would have to pay the many bills coming in to him.  Normally these would be paid by the ordinary economic return of money expended, whether for raw materials for agriculture or in the shape of wages.  He was not concerned with that because he did nothing at it.  Neither did the Minister for Agriculture.  These two Ministers go before mobs and appeal to their passion for cheap food and say: &ldquo;We will not feed John Bull; we will keep our good food at home.&rdquo;  Those Ministers who attended conferences claimed that the policy of the present Government <Col N="665" /> is to have a two-armed nation while they boasted that their policy was to produce cheap food&mdash;not themselves, of course, but their policy.  Why did they not carry it further and say that we must produce cheap clothes and furniture and everything else as well as agricultural produce?  They knew that that would be too much for the people to swallow.  That dope that was handed out to the people by these Ministers is not sticking in the neck of the general public when they see the aftermath, but it has stuck in the throat of the Government and hence the Minister for Agriculture comes here to set up a tribunal to shift the responsibility, probably, off the guilty shoulders of himself and his colleagues on to somebody else.</P>
    <P>The only way to deal with the pig industry is to leave it alone in every sense of the word.  It cannot just now be left alone, but no ameliorative benefits can be given in the way proposed. The right way is for the Government to undo the harm they have done the industry in the last 12 months.  It is the duty of the Government so to formulate, regulate, and administer economic policy that productive industry will follow by being induced, not compelled along certain lines.  The Government's function in agriculture, as well as in every economy, is to clear the obstacles out of the way and give good raw materials to the people to work.  The Minister knows that throughout the Saorstát the system of premium boars has been in vogue for some time and every county committee of agriculture has risen to its responsibility and provided these boars.  The Minister knows that the scientific breeding of pigs was carried on in the Albert College, Glasnevin, long before the Minister had any interest in pigs or agriculture.  He knows that the system is not run as a commercial proposition, but for the improvement of strains is not run as a different aspects of the bacon industry. He knows also that bacon curers have interested themselves intelligently in this matter and have demonstrated that they were seriously interested not only from their own point of view, but <Col N="666" /> from the point of view of the nation. He should know that our bacon curers have reached a position of pre-eminence with their products in the world markets.  The bacon curing industry is peculiar to a few families.  Those families take not only an industrial, but a national interest in their products. It is a matter of family pride with them and the sons endeavour to maintain in the world markets the position won by their ancestors.</P>
    <P>This matter was brought up suddenly here; otherwise I could have supplemented my general remarks with details supplied me by one bacon-curer, one of the largest in the country.  I could quote figures from him, had I an opportunity of bringing them here.  In the short space of time at my disposal since this matter was placed on the Order Paper, I had not time to get them.  The gentleman to whom I have referred went through all the factories and piggeries in Denmark in order to see how the industry was worked.  He was surprised when he went through the big abattoirs there to see lines of pig carcases hung up and not even an expert could see a difference in any of them, so symmetrical were they in every way.  He is still of the opinion that when our bacon reaches a standard of favour in a foreign market it does so because of many points in the quality of our product.  It must have a certain amount of fat, with lean intermixed; it must be a certain weight, and so on.  From his general study of the subject he is convinced that a pig can be bred and, under normal feeding and proper curing, that pig will produce a certain type of bacon.  If we are to breed pigs indiscriminately without any regard to pedigree and points of strain, we cannot guarantee the exact product which is essential in order that we may hold our place in the export market.</P>
    <P>The bacon-curers came back to the centres from which they bought most of their pigs.  They realised that the feeding had a lot to do with the flavour of the bacon.  No matter how it was cured, they realised the feeding was an essential factor in the quality of the bacon.  They were aware that it was because of the system of feeding certain <Col N="667" /> areas attained their pre-eminent position. Assuming that the system of feeding would continue, the next step was to get uniformity in the pig strain. Not only did they offer premiums to people to keep boars of their selection, but they actually gave boars to farmers for service in their areas in order to produce the type of pig necessary. Yesterday, 20 years after bacon-curers adopted that policy, we heard from the Minister that they want a tribunal to ascertain how to improve the pig industry.  A department that for 30 years has been costing this country half a million a year cannot tell us how to improve the industry.  I suggest that in the circumstances the Minister should withdraw his estimate of approximately half a million for the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that it is not the duty of the Government to suggest how the pig industry should be improved.  According to the Minister, the Government is not capable of improving it.  Yet that same Government is going to pry into the private business of curers who hold gold medals obtained at international exhibitions for the best bacon in the world. This Government, which has acknowledged it does not know its own business, wants to instruct private firms, gold medallists, in pig rearing.  I am afraid there is a terrible lot of camouflage about this.  It is a classical instance of sending the fool farther, a classical instance of diverting the people's attention from the real cause of the present plight, a classical example of a Government move to get the people to look everywhere for the cause of their present deplorable condition except to the doors of the people who alone are responsible for the present plight of the country&mdash;that is the Government Front Bench.</P>
    <P>There will be plenty of opportunity in the course of this debate for any Deputy who has anything to contribute to the debate to speak on it.  It is every Deputy's duty when he comes to this House to represent roughly 20,000 people, to speak on behalf of those people, but no Deputy has been sent to <Col N="668" /> this House to represent or misrepresent 20,000 people, to sit on the back benches and in whispers and sneers try to misrepresent the Deputy who is trying to do his duty by the people who sent him here.  It is very easy for a Deputy to do his job in this House if he satisfies himself to sit for a few minutes on the back benches, then go out and strut the corridor, go down to the bar or down to the refreshment room and see ladies and gentlemen up to the gallery.  That is an easy job to perform if it is the beginning and ending of a Deputy's duty to his constituents. Every Deputy who has any conception of his duty will think otherwise. I have my conception of my duty to my constituents and I am endeavouring to perform that duty to them.  I use the words &ldquo;my constituents&rdquo; advisedly.  I see the traces of a whisper on the face of a Deputy opposite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not see how he can &ldquo;see whispers.&rdquo;  Am I to judge all his remarks by what he can see in whispers?  Would the Deputy say what Deputy in this House represents 20,000 constituents?</P>

I am speaking on this matter on behalf of not only a good many of my constituents, but of the most industrious and hard-working of my constituents.  Pigs are fed in North City and in South City, too, under more difficult conditions than they are fed in any constituency in the Free State.  I know the conditions.  I have been through their yards.  I have sold, and I sell every year, hundreds of tons of pig-feeding potatoes to those people. I draw manure from their yards, and I know their condition.  I know approximately the number of pigs that were fed in the City of Dublin a year ago and I know the number that are in it to-day.  I know people who had 60 to 70 pigs in the City of Dublin a year ago, and I know them to be drawing relief to-day.  I defy contradiction on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister wants a competent body to do what is obviously the work of the Department of Agriculture. If he wants a competent body to tell him what is wrong I will give him the names of 40 or 50 pig feeders in the City of Dublin and out of that number he can pick any three he likes and they will form a competent body.  They will tell him some home truths.  I would not like to see the Minister going further in the mire and employing a few fellows who want jobs, people who never fed pigs or who fed pigs and got broken in the pig feeding business and got broken not through the economic war but because of their own incompetence.  Behind this motion of the Minister I can see the power and influence of pig feeders who became bankrupt at the pig feeding business and became bankrupt in good times. These are the people who are behind the Minister looking for jobs now from the Government when they themselves failed at the pig industry.  These are the people who are going to be selected to tell the country how to breed and <Col N="670" /> feed pigs.  I could put my hands on these people and the Minister knows that too.  This thing is on all fours with everything that has been done with the agricultural industry.  People have not got it out of their heads either in the Government or the country yet that the fool of the family is the proper person to put on the farm.</P>

      <P>We are advised to-day by a so-called agricultural association, set up by the Government, to grow tobacco.  That agricultural association is presided over by a lawyer and the secretary of it is a pensioner policeman living in the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite irrelevant to the motion before the House the terms of which were read out by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the influences that are prompting the ways and means of meeting the agricultural situation; and these ways and means seem to be deliberately invented to camouflage the real position and the real trouble.  The motion reads: &ldquo;The measures requisite to promote the production of pigs of the quality and in numbers calculated to ensure the maintenance of output at a point which will supply, constantly, the demand of the home market and provide for the requirements of the export trade while giving a steady economic return to producers of pigs and those engaged in the handling of pig meats and other pig products.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is concerned about producing for the export trade.  He has spent 12 months with his colleagues in doing all that is humanly possible to kill the export trade.  He now wants to produce an article for the export trade.  I remember long ago learning in commercial geography that the success of German industries in the world <Col N="671" /> markets and the decline of British exports in the world markets was due to the two different policies pursued.  The Germans went and studied the requirements of their potential customers.  The Englishman felt that English production was the best in the world and that there was no need to study the requirements or tastes of his customers, because the article he produced was English and so the people should buy it.  The German had a different outlook on the matter.  He was not satisfied that because the article was German, people should buy it.  He saw to it that whatever the tastes of the people, his potential customers, were, he would produce an article to meet those tastes. In that way he secured the market and ousted English products out of it.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister for Agriculture has killed the export trade to a particular market, and wants to revive an export trade, surely he owes it to this House and to the country to tell us where he hopes to get an export market.  He killed the market we had. It was not good enough.  Having killed that, I am quite sure he is not going to bring his medical skill to bear upon the victim and try, by some system of artificial respiration, to bring the victim back to life.  He must have in mind some other fields in which he contemplates pushing an export trade. He should have told us where they are. I wonder if any agreements that he made in Ottawa with other parts of the Empire are still in cold storage, or if we are going to be surprised some morning by being asked to ratify an agreement to send pig products to Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, or somewhere else.</P>

      <P>Where does the Minister contemplate getting an export trade? It should come within the Minister's normal duty to keep abreast of the times commercially and agriculturally and to read such papers as are devoted specially to commercial, financial and economic knowledge.  Even if he read current literature, he would have <Col N="672" /> learned that while we were shouting for a republic here and afraid to name it, cheering for the removal of an oath that was an empty formula, Denmark was signing an agreement taking our export market away from us for the next three years.  When all the tomfoolery and flag-waving have gone, the Minister comes and seriously asks this House to set up a tribunal which I understood from him yesterday was going to be a paid tribunal.  I understand that the Minister left the impression generally on the House that the tribunal was to be paid.</P>

      <P>There is one compliment I shall pay Deputy Corry&mdash;even if he interrupts he is never afraid to get up and speak his mind on any subject before the House.  I am sure that Deputy Corry will speak his mind on this subject and I shall be glad to hear him.  While I differ from Deputy Corry on many things, I have respect for the man who stands up and speaks for his constituents on any subject that interests them which comes before the House, but I have little respect for the man who occupies his time throwing in interjections and doing nothing else. The Minister should tell us what export market we are to have.  In the first three months of 1931 we exported to Great Britain 234,000 cwts. of bacon and in the same period of 1933, 99,000 cwts.  The total amounts imported into England for the same periods in 1931, 1932 and 1933, respectively, were 7,852,000 cwts., 7,270,000 cwts., and <Col N="673" /> 6,677,000 cwts.  The figures of exports from Denmark to England for the same periods, respectively, were 5,502,000 cwts., 5,203,000 cwts., and 4,432,000 cwts.</P>
      <P>To make the matter more clear, in the first three months of 1931 the British market absorbed in imports 7,852,000 cwts. of bacon.  Denmark sent 5,502,000 cwts. of that amount and the Free State 234,000 cwts.  In the same period of 1932, the British market absorbed in imports of bacon 7,270,000 cwts.  Of these, Denmark supplied 5,203,000 and the Free State 168,000. For the first three months of 1933, the British market absorbed 6,677,000 cwts. Of that Denmark supplied 4,422,000 and the Irish Free State 99,000.  This motion will have done national service if it achieves no other purpose than to confute and refute the lying propaganda of the Government Party.</P>
      <P>They have been telling the unfortunate people that the reason they cannot get a price for their stock, and for their pigs, and the reason England is not buying them is because England cannot afford to do so, being too poor. We had a classical demonstration here, I might say in force, by one Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flinn, when he told us about the colour of the meat that he saw selling in butchers' shops in England.  He told us that the fresh, appetising meat, which he described as Irish meat, that the people of England were in the habit of using, was now replaced by frozen meat, and that that was owing to the poverty of the British consumers and to the depression in British industries.  The British people, the Parliamentary Secretary said, could no longer afford to buy fresh meat, and purchased instead frozen or chilled meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have compared the two countries, not for the reason that it is popular to compare Ireland and Denmark, but because Danish and Irish bacon are approximately of a similar standard. I have put figures before the House showing that out of roughly 7,000,000 cwts. of bacon imported into Great Britain in the first three months of this year, Denmark supplied 4½ million cwt., and we supplied only 99,000 cwts.  In <Col N="674" /> the British market during the first three months of this year there was a market for 4½ million cwts. of bacon from Denmark, similar to the bacon we supplied.  We are nearer to Great Britain than to Denmark, and we can get preferential treatment that Denmark cannot get.  We had that market and this Government threw it away. They went to the country and told the people the falsehood that the British were unable to buy the good quality bacon that they had been in the habit of buying, that they were unable to buy Irish bacon, but they bought, and I presume paid for, 4½ million cwts. from Denmark during the period mentioned. If this debate dispels the delusion that the people are labouring under, the introduction of the motion will have done infinite good.  Let the Minister and his colleagues tell the country the truth.  If they do no Party will be afraid of the decision, except the Government Party.  Let them submit their policy on its merits, and not appeal to popular glamour, which has been worked up through unfair and untrue propaganda.  Apart from the good that the motion will have done in contradicting the propaganda of Fianna Fáil, it is only wasting the time of the House.</P>

      <P>No instruction was offered this morning.  Since the proceedings opened the House has not been attempting to interrupt the Minister. The burthen of my remarks is directed to the Minister.  As the export market has been destroyed, what is an export trade wanted for now, unless the Minister contemplates opening an export trade with other countries? What is the country and what are its requirements?  Is there a possibility of getting an export trade there?  Is there a possibility of getting an export trade in any European country?  Is there a possibility of getting an export trade in any of the British Dominions? If there is, we should know it.  If there is not, then why are there words in the motion dealing with supplying:</P>
      <P>the demand of the home market and to provide for the requirements of the export trade while giving a steady economic return to producers of pigs...?</P>
      <P>The Minister is evidently contemplating an export trade.  We are not, at this stage, trying to instruct the Minister, nor will we, at any stage, instruct him.  It is for him to do his job.  If he wants instructions he had better resign his job and go and qualify for it before he takes it up.</P>

      <P>The Minister, as well as the Government have shown their magnificent qualification for their positions in the last 12 months.  It was admirably described by Deputy Dillon yesterday as buffoonery.  There are to be:</P>
      <P>proposals for the reorganisation of the pig raising and bacon-curing industry which may be referred to the tribunal by the President of the Executive Council for consideration.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister contemplates turning the whole matter into a joke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, the President of the Executive Council is going to instruct the bacon-curers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bacon for the export trade is no longer there, but the tribunal is to have <Col N="676" /> power, I presume, to force the bacon-curers to give evidence and to make public the secrets of their industry, perhaps, even under penalty.  Paragraph (4) talks about taking &ldquo;the measures which, having regard to the national interests, should be taken (a) to encourage the production of pigs of suitable and uniformed type and quality for the bacon and pork trade.&rdquo; That is the only paragraph in the whole of the terms of reference that has any grain of commonsense in it.  But there is no necessity in the world to set up a tribunal to investigate that.  The Department of Agriculture, if it is fit to be in existence at all, should be able to do that.  If they want to take outside opinion on the matter they have their organisations throughout the country in the committees of agriculture whom they can consult upon that and other suggestions.  They can go further and allow the committees of agriculture that function in every county, to confer with people outside these committees and send the whole suggestions right up the line to the Department of Agriculture where experts should be, and I am satisfied where experts are, in the Department who can sit round a table and advise the Minister.  By such means, in one afternoon, the Minister would get more solid, practical information than he would get in 20 years through his proposed tribunal.  With the suggestion contained in paragraph (a) of Section 4 I entirely agree but there is no necessity, as I have said, for a tribunal to investigate that.  I suggest the other means which is the natural businesslike means of doing that.</P>
    <P>I have been at many conferences where different sections of the pig 8industry, members of the conference, held certain strong views about varieties of breeds and strains of breeds of pigs.  There were other persons, members of the conference, who held different views, and banked upon other breeds, or strains of the same breed.  I have seen practical men changing their opinions as a result of the discussion on points with regard to different strains of breeding, which were brought out by other practical intelligent men.  I consider that one <Col N="677" /> reason for that change was that, although I do not like to see any conference or inquiry overloaded with people having only book knowledge, those conferences that I have in mind included people who had a good book knowledge and had experience, of reports coming into the Department, of cause and effect, and of question and answer.  They were able to put before any member of the conference the utility of a particular breed or strain; they put relevant questions and they knew in a practical, as well as in a theoretical way, or a semi-practical way, their subject and they were able to put good points.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants, and I am sure he does, to carry out the purposes of paragraph (a) of Section 4, I suggest that that is a much better way of doing so than setting up a tribunal.  Paragraph (b) reads &ldquo;facilitate and regulate in the most efficient manner the marketing of pigs intended for home consumption or for export.&rdquo;  There is no export trade now.  Until the Minister indicates the fields of wealth that he has in mind, I cannot in any way discuss the export trade, for there is no such trade under present conditions, and I can see no hope of building up an export trade.  As to the manner of marketing pigs for home consumption, I suggest to the Minister that he should leave that alone, and I assure him that the more the home producer is let alone the better for him and the industry.  If the Minister attempts anything else it means another class of inspectors that will have to be paid and then you will have still another class of inspectors to inspect these inspectors and so <i>ad infinitum.</i>  Paragraph (c) states: &ldquo;Ensure the economic production of bacon and other manufactured pig products of a quality suited to the needs of the home and export markets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have never heard a bacon-curer or producer say that the pigs produced in this country are not suitable for bacon for the home markets.  The only time the bacon-curers became worried was in the pig push made in the export pork trade, two or three years ago, when the pig feeders turned largely to the production of the smaller type of <Col N="678" /> pig for the pork trade, and the bacon-curers got alarmed lest their supplies would run out.  Speaking from memory I think they were seriously curtailed at the time.  There is no danger of that now because, thanks to the Minister and his colleagues, the export trade was annihilated and was abolished with the Oath.  We need not worry about it now.  The Minister wants the economic production of bacon, and other manufactured pig products, of a quality suited to the needs of the home and export markets. I hope he was not thinking of butter and that in connection with bacon or pork for export he is not showing his butter mentality.  I hope he is not thinking of taxing the unfortunate people of this country to pay two prices for their butter and bacon here in order to give the British consumer one-third of its value.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I withdraw it.  Without the adjective, which has disappeared, the Minister for Agriculture, owing to his many and varied activities and qualifications, will be able to assimilate this medicine. Section 5 of the motion says that the tribunal is to investigate &ldquo;the manner in which the exports of live pigs, bacon and pork should be controlled.&rdquo;  Controlled! I wonder if the meaning of the word controlled which I learned is correct.  The whole lot of the motion up to this is a rigmarole on how we are going to increase exports.  If the tribunal achieves the impossible and devises a means of developing an export trade, for fear that would be successful they are confronted with another section, &ldquo;the manner in which the exports of live pigs, bacon and pork should be controlled in view of the measures which have been or may be adopted for regulating quantitatively supplies of these commodities on extern markets.&rdquo;  I must say that to get meaning out of that is beyond me. We are going to go all out for an export trade and then for fear it would function we must control it.  I think the Minister does not want any tribunal to tell him how to control it, or even to annihilate it.  He is a past master at that.  It took generations to build up an export market from this country to Great Britain, and the Minister and his colleagues have shown their expert skill at destruction by annihilating it in 12 months.  Now the Minister wants to build up an export market somewhere else, and he also wants to know how he will control that market.  Is the Minister preparing for the day when this bogey about the non-payment of the land annuities, this bogey about the empty formula Oath, and all such stock in trade runs out, and he wants some other means of controlling the market?  Why cannot the Minister come out boldly and bluntly <Col N="680" /> and say &ldquo;we want a Communist State?&rdquo;  What else is it to lead to? I am not saying the Minister is a Communist by any means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If you do not want me to qualify it, I will withdraw the qualification.  Is it making for anything else?  The Minister pretends to find that he has a little surplus goods here; he wants an export market; then he wants to know how it is going to be controlled and he wants to set up a tribunal to advise on that.  If the Minister stood in the midst of his constituent farmers of Wexford, and told them: &ldquo;I am looking after your interests; I am setting up a tribunal to find an export market, but I am also asking the same tribunal to advise ways and means of controlling that export market,&rdquo; I wonder would the farmers of Wexford, who cannot sell their pigs or corn at the present time owing to the Minister's policy, applaud him when he makes such a promise. The next section deals with &ldquo;any matter which, in the opinion of the tribunal, affects the welfare of the pig and bacon industry.&rdquo;  For fear that complete control of every human activity in private enterprise was not secured by the first five sections, the Minister puts in a general section, to place in the hands of three or four civil servants power to investigate any matter which, in their opinion, affects the welfare of the pig and bacon industry. For fear any &ldquo;i&rdquo; was not dotted, or &ldquo;t&rdquo; crossed in the first five sections, he says: &ldquo;Here, boys, investigate any matter you like and make any recommendation you like.  Investigate any matter you like, whether it does or does not affect the bacon and pig industry.&rdquo; The next section refers to &ldquo;the administrative machinery necessary to give effect to the tribunal's recommendations.&rdquo; Deputy Dillon very rightly questioned the Minister as to what machinery he contemplated.  The Minister did not give the House any help on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Having the general framework, he must have had some ideas, but he wanted the consolidation of those ideas by investigation. Here are seven heads of an inquiry that the Minister wants held.  Surely in going over these he should have taken them section by section and amplified them for the House.  I am sorry he did not because it would be far more useful to us if he had done that.  Our criticism would then be, of necessity, more confined and it would be more helpful to the Minister.  When the Minister introduces these seven general headings and introduces them in a very general way, he cannot expect any particular criticism or any particular suggestions from the House because no Deputy knows what line to pursue.  If we pursue a line directly opposed to the line operating in the Minister's mind he will naturally become antagonistic, but if he indicated certain lines and amplified these somewhat, we, in speaking on them here, would of necessity have to direct our discussion along his lines, either for or against the lines suggested by him.  I suggest to the Minister that had he done that we would have a far more useful discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the administrative machinery that he contemplates setting up to give effect to the tribunal's recommendations, the whole thing, boiled down, comes to nothing more than this, to produce an economical type of pig for the home market. There is no use in fooling ourselves about an export market; we have not got it nor is there any sign of our getting it.  As regards the decline in pig production, first of all we had the decline in prices.  That was because we had a pig economy that provided <Col N="682" /> unconsciously or subconsciously for the requirements of the home market and a margin for export.  I cannot speak with any accuracy about the relative ratios or proportions of these figures, but I do not think I would be far wrong if I said they were roughly fifty-fifty when that economy was functioning. The market for 50 per cent. of our pig products was suddenly wiped out on conditions that were not entirely unsurmountable, to wit, the tariffs.  A certain amount of pigs and pig products got over the tariff wall, because the Minister of course knows that a pig is unlike any other animal.  When he is fit for marketing, he is fit for marketing. You must market him and you must get him away.  The shrinkage in exports set in naturally when that export trade had to bear a tariff of 20 or 40 per cent. of its own value.  That shrinkage in the export trade threw a surplus quantity of pigs and pig products on the home market and depressed the price.  The people fed the pigs for months and sold them for less than the price at which they bought them.</P>

      <P>Naturally when the people found themselves robbed of their market, having goods to sell in that market, they were partly unwilling and partly unable to restock.  They got out of pig production and the quantity of pigs was reduced.  There was a surplus and there was no market.  They swung to the other side and the whole <Col N="683" /> economic machine was disturbed.  An equilibrium had to be found.  Disequilibration set in when the slice that was to go to the British market could not go there.  When that market was shut that slice was thrown into the home market; economic disequilibration set in.</P>

      <P>The economic disequilibration set in when half the market was lost.  People were stampeded into a reduction in their stocks for various causes.  They swung to the other end, swung too far.  They have swung to a point now when evidently, in the mind of the Minister&mdash;it must have prompted this inquiry&mdash;there is a danger that the price of pigs will be forced up here artificially owing to a shortage in stocks.  That will regulate itself.  When the producer finds that there is an economic price to be got for pigs, pig production will increase.  The equilibrium will come and must come, not at the old standard, but at a much lower standard quantitatively, because under the old conditions equilibrium was established when we had a home and an export market.  Of necessity the <Col N="684" /> quantity of pigs must be higher under those conditions than if we establish an economic equilibrium quantitatively only for the home market.  In other words, pig producers and pig breeders have got to readjust their economy to produce that quantity, and that quantity only, that the home market will absorb.  Otherwise, they will be producing and selling below the cost of production.</P>

      <P>I did not, in any way, attempt to give a history of the pig trade here.  I dealt entirely with the production of pigs and pig products at present, but the matter is so big and so important and it is so closely related to the whole agricultural economy that it must of necessity take time to discuss it carefully, if it is to be discussed usefully.  The Minister, of course, thought he could set up his tribunal as a matter of form and have them come forward with their recommendations and then let us discuss these recommendations. That is the happy position the Minister wanted to get into, so that he could blame the other fellow, so that he could blame the tribunal and so that he would not have to stand behind anything.  Let him stand behind the proposition he is putting up now and justify this tribunal to consider the home and export trade. There is no export trade.  It is pure eye-wash and the Minister knows it. <Col N="686" /> The only thing that is wrong with the home trade is what I have just explained, the economic disequilibration that has set in because of the loss of the export market.  I have given the figures showing the loss of the export market.</P>

When these Ministers, who never produced anything, were boasting last year that the people would now get cheap food, those of us who are suffering and who have suffered from over-production saw our crops rotting.  We are the people who have a right to talk on this matter and to discuss this matter and, if the Minister thinks that the people who have suffered and are suffering and have paid for it and not those who have talked about it, when they come in here to represent the people, are to be curtailed in their speeches he is making a big mistake.  If you want Communism, and you are asking for it in this section in which you seek to regulate the economic life of this country and, if you want a dictatorship, come out and propose it and we will then deal with it, but do not come in here and act the little tinpot dictator in an effort to curtail free speech in this free assembly, which has been made a free assembly in spite of the Minister and his colleagues.

      <P>I was dealing with the motion until the interruptions took place and, even then, I say I was not far removed from the motion, but I accept your ruling in the matter. There is a section in this on which I should like some enlightenment.  It says:</P>
      <P>To regulate hygienically the conditions under which pig husbandry is carried on and the veterinary inspection ante and post mortem of pigs slaughtered for the home and export bacon and pork trades.</P>
      <P>Whatever does that mean?  Only last Monday, on the advice of the Minister's Department, the Dublin County Council met to allocate the veterinary services and the veterinary officers for the County Dublin&mdash;to do all that the Minister is here asking should be considered by a tribunal.  This reorganisation of veterinary services in County Dublin has only just been decided on. The officers are in their places, being lifted from the old district councils, and they want only formal appointment. It is only in the initial stages of its activities and here it is proposed to consider something covering the same services.  Is the Minister not aware that everything on which he seeks advice and asks to be considered in sub-section (d) of Section 4 is being carried out by the veterinary officers of every county?  The whole thing is camouflage and anybody who wants to get on with the work will vote against this and stop unnecessary interference with private enterprise.  Let the Government do its job and give us a market.  If we get a market, we do not want any tribunal to tell us what to do or how to do it.  Give us a market at a remunerative price and we will produce for that market.  Give us an assurance that we will have some kind of continuity and that no hare-brained scheme like that of last year will be started, and let us alone.  All we want is to be let alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  I hope some of you will learn it.  Of course, every Deputy on the two benches opposite looks through one pair of glasses&mdash;the economic war.  Let us examine what Deputy Belton says we lost and see where it leads us.  In 1928, we exported £2,730,000 worth of bacon to Great Britain and other countries at 98/- per cwt.  In 1929, we exported about the same amount at 112/- per cwt.  In 1930, our exports dropped by £1,000,000 and the price fell to 104/- per cwt.  In 1931, before there was any economic war at all, we got £1,135,000 for our bacon in the English market and the price fell to 76/11 per cwt.  That was a drop of 25 per cent. in the price of our produce &mdash;a drop of one-fourth.  The same thing occurred in regard to hams, which dropped from 132/- per cwt. in 1930 to 102/- in 1931.  The same thing happened with regard to fresh pork which dropped from 85/6 in 1930 to 63/7 in 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are figures which the Deputy could very well have quoted as constituting an absolute necessity for examining the position.  Apart altogether from the question of the economic war, which the Deputy is so fond of talking about, the question is, was it paying? That is the whole question.  Let us examine it in that light and see what <Col N="689" /> it leads to.  We find that the exports of bacon to Great Britain fell from 557,000 cwts. in 1928 to 295,000 cwts. in 1931.  That is, in three years we reduced our exports by 50 per cent. to Britain.  Hams practically held their own; we dropped 1,000 cwts. of hams in our exports.  Fresh pork held its own so far as quantity is concerned, but the price of it dropped by £280,000. We exported the same quantity but the loss on it was a quarter of a million pounds.  Those are facts which I would invite Deputies to consider very carefully.</P>
    <P>In 1930 we exported 720,000 cwts. to Britain.  In 1932 we exported 520,000 cwts.&mdash;a drop of 200,000 cwts.  What did we import between the two years? Let us take the two figures.  In 1931 we imported 500,000 cwts. of foreign bacon and pig meat.  In 1932 we imported 200,000 cwts.  That is to say, our exports dropped, as between 1931 and 1932 by 200,000 cwts., but in the same period we had a home market here of 300,000 cwts. instead of the 200,000 cwts. that we exported.  Those are facts and figures that no Deputy in either the Centre Party or the Cumann na nGaedheal Party can deny.</P>

      <P>I will give the Deputy all the figures he wants.  Perhaps I will give him too many figures.  He may not like it.  Apparently, the Deputy does not like this dose.  Those figures stand out very clearly.  Compare that with the first three months of this year and see what market have we.  Take January, February and March of 1932 and compare that period with January, February and March of 1933 and see what is the change. During the first three months of last year £236,746 was paid to the foreigner for bacon, in spite of all the deathbed repentances of the former Minister for Agriculture when he put on the tariff on bacon the week before he was kicked out of office.  This year we paid the foreigner £3,000 during the corresponding three months.  That is to say, the home producer got a market worth <Col N="690" /> £233,000 to him for three months owing to the protection of our home market. That, of course, is not worth anything to those who have their two eyes across on John Bull and who are prepared to take anything John Bull gives them. That is what is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>And we are making it right.  We realise, as any Deputy opposite who goes into the question must realise, that when the price of your produce drops by 25 per cent. or by 40 per cent. or by 30 per cent. as the price did drop in Great Britain during the past three or four years, you are gradually coming to the point when you will have to sell under the cost of production, and when that happens you have got to stop.  It is the duty of any Minister for Agriculture in this country to see that the market you can keep is kept here, and our Minister for Agriculture has done that.  We have preserved for the Irish farmer a market that was worth £233,000 to him in three months.  Work that out. It is close on £1,000,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully submit that I have spoken more to the resolution as it stands than any Deputy who has spoken.  By giving figures and showing the gradual fall in prices I am proving that there is an absolute necessity for this tribunal being set up to go into the question and find out what is wrong.  I know that Deputies do not like these figures, but the figures speak for themselves.  I have reared a large number of pigs in my time and I know that prices go in cycles.  Pig production can be increased in a very short period and when prices are good we naturally produce a lot of pigs.  Then when we over produce prices go down and we get very bad prices.  That is what has happened.  That does not by any means account for the big drop in prices in the English market between 1930 and 1931 and the continual drop in prices during 1932.  Unless we were making an enormous profit out of pig rearing we could not afford a 25 per cent. cut in price and we did get a 25 per cent. cut in the English market between 1930 and 1931.  There is no use in bluffing it.  Can any Deputy say that he made a profit of over 30/- per cwt. on his pigs in 1930 as compared with 1931.?  Yet the price fell by 30/- per cwt. in the English market and more. These are facts that cannot be contradicted and are the basis of the whole question.  We have to consider the class of pig which suits our home market and produce that class of pig. That is a market which we can keep. It is a market which was thrown away. It is a market worth more than £1,000,000 to us.  We find that that will be something over 50 per cent. of the English market.  As I said, what we received for our bacon exports fell from <Col N="693" /> £2,730,000 in 1928 to £1,135,000 in 1931. That is a drop of over 50 per cent. in the price we got in the English market for bacon alone.  I hold that the home market is worth more than that £1,135,000.  The figures here bear out that it is.  What we pay for bacon imported into this country bears out that it is, and that absolutely bears out my argument that the proper thing for us to do is to examine the position, examine what suits the home market, and produce for that.</P>

Deputies in Opposition here have their eyes all the time across the water and they do not give a hang what happens here.  The home market is worth considering. It is capable of absorbing 1,000,000 pigs in the year, and that is an important consideration.  The Irish people have here an opportunity of securing a market which can be protected and in which they will be guaranteed the cost of production. That market is worth far more to you than if you were depending on the gentlemen across the water, who buy when and what they like and who have reduced the price of our produce by fully 50 per cent.  The drop in price was over and above the 40 per cent. tariff.  They have already reduced the price of our produce considerably and to a great extent that is why Cumann na nGaedheal were put out of office.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton no longer represents the farmer; he represents the City.  This whole matter could have been settled in ten minutes if Deputies only indicated clearly whether or not there is an necessity for those regulations.  In my opinion, a grave necessity exists for their introduction by the Minister.  We have practically to change the minds of the people of this country who were formerly engaged in pig production.  We need a different class of pig for the home market than we did need for the export market, and that entails <Col N="696" /> different feeding.  I do not see why so much time should have been spent on this subject.  Deputies could have briefly indicated whether or not they considered the regulations necessary. I observe that Deputy Belton is now going to diffuse his genius amongst the members of the Centre Party.</P>

      <P>I have listened attentively to this debate and I think there are many Deputies in the House who will agree that it would be refreshing to have some change.  I would like to confine my remarks to something of a constructive nature.  Deputy Dillon has already spoken on behalf of the Centre Party.  If I were to view the matter in the same light as he does, I could scarcely hope to improve on the case he made; but as it is, I am looking at it from a different angle.  Notwithstanding the fact that Deputy Dillon is a very brilliant young man, he still sticks in the old rut of reasoning and commonsense.  I would like to point out that that attitude is not quite in keeping with new progressive ideas.  The new, progressive ideas mark, apparently, an advance on reasoning and commonsense.  It would seem as if these things are out of date. Whatever may be said against it, I believe this proposal will go through by sheer strength of votes when the Division Bell rings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I confine my remarks to something of a constructive nature with a view to pointing out where the Minister might be helpful if he wishes to be helpful and I believe he does wish to be helpful in spite of the error of his ways.  I am not opposed to the idea of some sort of a tribunal provided the terms of reference were right and provided the tribunal would act upon <Col N="697" /> the wishes of the farmers in certain counties or groups of counties.  In the County Cavan the farmers are very much interested in the question of pork, but before I go on to deal with the particular county or counties I wish to examine the matter of prices.  I do that because the burden of some of the speakers on the Fianna Fáil side has been directed to proving that we are getting prices for pork much better than the prices that would have ruled were it not for the operation of the tariff.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes told us of the enormous price he got for a little pig and he produced an invoice in proof of that.  Of course, the matter of the price he got for his pig may be a matter of interest to Deputy Hayes, but neither we nor the farmers of the country are very much concerned about the price of that pig.  We are much concerned, however, about the market prices of pork and pigs.  I listened to Deputy Corry who was the next speaker on that side.  Deputy Corry is out in every race but his horse will not run.  He kicks, lashes and rears right, centre and left, especially at the Centre.  I think he was trained in a circle.  Some people dislike hearing Deputy Corry speak in this House at all.  I am not of that kind.  I would like to hear Deputy Corry speak. This would be a dull place if Deputy Corry were not here.  I always feel 40 years younger when I see him get on his feet because he reminds me of the first circus I ever attended.  I do not, however, want to lose time in talking about Deputy Corry, because there is nothing that he said which I would waste five minutes to disprove. I did notice that he tried to prove that the Fianna Fáil policy was increasing the price of pork.  The Minister for Agriculture spoke on the same lines. When one hears the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Hayes or Deputy Corry are not in it at all.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question that I asked about the price of pork in the House here the Minister gave a long reply and he finished up by saying that he was satisfied that the price of pork here was reasonably related to the <Col N="698" /> price of pork in Northern Ireland.  The Minister must be very easily satisfied, much easier than it is to satisfy me and much easier than it is to satisfy the farmers along the Border counties. The farmers there are not satisfied about the price of pork.  They know the prices obtaining on both sides of the Border.  There are other Deputies in the House from the Border counties and they will bear out what I say. There are Deputies from Cavan present and they know perfectly well that the statement of the Minister for Agriculture is not right.</P>
    <P>Lest there should be any dispute or doubt over the matter I will give the House a few quotations from the Press as to the price of pork and pigs. The very day on which the Minister said that he was satisfied that the prices were reasonably related to the prices on the Northern side of the Border, &ldquo;The Farmers' Gazette&rdquo; of the 14th March, the day on which I asked the question, gave the price at 54/- per cwt. in Cavan.  Cavan is a capital town in the County Cavan. That was the price in Cavan that day. Enniskillen is the capital town of Fermanagh, a Border county.  The two towns are not far distant.  The price at Enniskillen on that day was 63/- per cwt.  That is a difference of 9/- per cwt, against the pigs in the Free State. Are these prices reasonably related? In the &ldquo;Anglo-Celt&rdquo; for the same week the price of pork was given in Ballyconnell at 53/- per cwt.  In the town of Newtownbutler, about 12 miles on the other side of the Border in Northern Ireland, pork prices the same day were 62/- per cwt.  That again is 9/- against the Free State.  The &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; stated at the same time that the latest type of pork quotations in the Northern markets was 64/- per cwt.  The price in Ballybay and Clones was 54/-, and in Letterkenny and Donegal 52/-.  That is a difference according to the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; of from 10/- to 12/- per cwt. in the price of pork along the Border towns.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the answer the Minister for Agriculture gave me about the price of pork and notwithstanding all that Deputy Hayes and Deputy <Col N="699" /> Corry on several occasions stated about the prices of pork, these are the facts. The Minister for Agriculture also told the House about the price he got for his pigs.  Neither the House nor the country is much concerned about the price the Minister got for his pigs. What matters is the price that the farmers are getting.  The Minister can live very well without what he is getting from the sale of pigs.  Pigs are the last hope of the farmers in the County Cavan because they base their whole agricultural economy upon a mixed system; they depend on the cow and the calf, on the sale of butter and young stock, and on the sale of their pork and eggs.  These small farmers in this congested county of Cavan as also in Leitrim make their living mainly by the sale of these commodities. I would ask the Minister to make a note of the fact that Cavan is really a congested county and that when dealing with the land along the Border he will not treat Cavan as he treats other counties.  However, that is only by the way.  What I want to say is that the peculiar position of Cavan farmers is that they are very small farmers, and they have to reply entirely on these things to make a living.  Pork is their very last hope now.  As far as one can see it appears to be a forlorn hope.  But hoping against hope I look forward to an improvement.  I look forward with hope that the Minister may do something to improve the position of the farmers.  The reason the farmers had to fall back so much upon pork is because butter is a bad price in spite of what the Minister has done for it, and I give him credit for doing a great deal for it.  It is the brightest spot in his policy.  I do not agree with the view expressed by Deputy Belton.  I know that butter is very important to the farmers of the country.</P>
    <P>After all the Minister has tried to do for butter, he should do something in connection with the pig industry. What the Minister had done for butter was described by a Fianna Fáil orator when he said that the butter industry was &ldquo;the oasis in the desert of his agricultural policy.&rdquo;  It turned out <Col N="700" /> that this &ldquo;oasis&rdquo; was in reality constituted of sweated workers, because the producers of milk, according to the Minister's own figures, as shown by Deputy Curran, received 1½d. under the cost of production.  I leave the House to imagine what the rest of the desert was like.  The last hope of the Cavan farmers is in the pig business, and I hope the Minister will do something to help these small farmers.  I am not opposed to the idea of a tribunal, provided it acts upon the advice of the people concerned in pig production. The power of that tribunal should be directed to protecting the farmers against profiteering until the markets are opened.  That is necessary.  While the markets are closed, something is required to protect the farmer against profiteering.  When the markets were opened, he required no protection. Things regulated themselves.  There was no necessity for any control or interference.  The less interference and control the Minister has with the pork industry and with every branch of agriculture the better.  If he proposes to put into operation some of the things suggested here with regard to the hygienic conditions under which pigs are to be kept and matters of that nature, I think he should transfer the duties under that part of the scheme to the Minister for Defence. He is the Minister most likely to be able to give effect to regulations of that kind.  It would not be safe for the ordinary inspector to take upon himself duties of that type.  The people are getting sick of this sort of thing. They want something sensible and reasonable.  I hope that the Minister will listen to reason.  The people concerned in the pig-production counties should be listened to and their advice acted upon.  That is the most likely way of doing something to help the industry.  I believe that the Minister does really mean to help the industry, but he is not going the right way about it.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which concerns the County Cavan, particularly. The price of pig feeding is just as important as the price of pork. Counties like Cavan and Leitrim cannot produce feeding-stuffs sufficient for <Col N="701" /> their needs.  They are not grain-growing counties.  Other representatives of County Cavan will bear me out in what I say.  They know that the farmers of Cavan always try to use more than they are themselves able to produce.  They feed more poultry and more pigs than they could afford to keep upon what they grow themselves. They cannot grow the necessary feeding-stuffs economically owing to the nature of the land in parts of County Cavan and the nature of the climate. They can grow very little even for their own use, not to speak of the feed ing of stock.  These facts should be taken into consideration by the Minister for Agriculture, who comes from a grain-growing county.  He should not make that county the basis upon which to arrive at a ruling for the whole country.  He should consider the suggestions of farmers in the groups of counties to which I have alluded and see what he can do to help them.  I think it was Deputy Norton who said that the Government does not think nationally, that it thinks piecemeal. What he meant, I think, was that each department of the Government thinks on its own lines and that the Government does not think as a body.  If Deputy Norton's view be correct and if the Minister for Agriculture be one of those he referred to, I think that Minister has gone on an even smaller basis.  He thinks all the time of the County Wexford.  The Deputy who thinks of his own constituency is a really good Deputy, but the Minister who thinks only of one county is a very bad Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to think of the country generally.  I want him to consider carefully, cautiously and sympathetically the position in County Cavan as well as the position in County Wexford.  I suppose that this tribunal will be set up notwithstanding any opposition we may offer.  I do not know whether I shall vote against it or not, but I certainly cannot vote for it on account <Col N="702" /> of the objectionable provisions it contains. But whether this Party or any other Party votes against it or not, it will, I suppose, go through.  I trust that the Minister will consider the suggestions I have made and take the advice of farmers in groups of counties that are affected in a manner different from most other counties.</P>
      <P>The real remedy for the present position is to give the producer a profit on production.  Unless the price of pork is increased, there is no inducement to produce more.  Unless the small farmers of Cavan and such counties get a price that allows them a profit, they must get out of pig feeding altogether.  The Minister cannot too carefully consider this matter because the position in County Cavan is getting very hard.  The farmers there have been living in hopes and their last hope is in the pig industry.  If something is not done to improve the price of pork and to reduce the price of feeding-stuffs, farmers in counties like Cavan will have to go out of the business of pig production altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>It requires a certain amount of temerity for any Deputy to get up and speak on this question without being able to prove conclusively that he has been actually engaged in the breeding of pigs.  The discussion has ranged over such a wide field that I feel justified, without that certificate of qualification, in making a few remarks.  I claim only the competence to read what is on the Order Paper. I think that the majority of the long-winded speeches we have listened to discussed in an intimate way not what was on the Paper, but the things which the Deputies thought from their superior farming knowledge they were able to read between the lines.  There have been abundant plots, hidden and obscure, disclosed in the speeches of Deputy Dillon, Deputy Belton and some other Deputies.  We have had Irish bulls produced from Irish pigs by Deputy Dillon.  We have heard of pigs in beauty parlours.  We heard on every side a great deal about pigs and about things that had nothing to do with the motion.  Right through the gamut <Col N="703" /> of the speeches I do not think any one admitted that the pig producing industry, or that pig rearing, exporting or the manufacture of bacon was in such a happy position that some sort of inquiry was not essential.  Everything went to indicate that something should be done, apart from the economic war, to put things right with the pig trade. In Limerick, where we have the enviable reputation of killing more pigs than in any other part of the country, from conversations I had with bacon-curers long before the economic war started, they told me that all was not right with pig rearing.  There were frequent complaints that Irish farmers were very slow about producing the particular type of pig required for export in comparison with their Danish colleagues.  The Danes had reached a very high standard of efficiency in meeting the needs of the manufacturers, and by the co-operation of farmers and manufacturers the Danish trade was established.  Deputy Belton gave abundant support to that statement, when he spoke of his conversation with merchants who had traversed Denmark in order to get, as well as they could, an idea of the methods practised there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the economic war or otherwise, I think there is need in this industry and perhaps in other industries for an inquiry, and I do not see any reason why the Government should be precluded from setting up a tribunal in the hope of improving the industry.  I cannot contemplate that the Minister would think of setting up such a tribunal without consultation with his experts.  Deputy Belton fears that the Minister has excluded the experts in the Department of Agriculture from consultation, and that they have had nothing to do with the proposal. If that were so I would be opposed to anything of the kind taking place.  I have greater confidence than that in the Minister.  He is in his present position for the purpose of helping the pig industry, which is one of the most important left in this country.  There is nothing further being done than to set up a tribunal <Col N="704" /> and nothing will arise, as the report will have to come back to this House. The proposal does not inflict any legislation on the people.  This will simply be an inquiry, and I trust it will be constituted of people competent to advise the Minister as to the needs of the industry, and competent to give evidence of a constructive character.  I hope the attitude taken up by Deputies who spoke earlier in this debate will not be followed when the tribunal has been set up, because the bad parliamentary manners displayed earlier would seem to me to be inconsistent with the importance of the subject under discussion.  If the manners and the temper behind these remarks were to be continued, I believe those concerned could not be accused of acting in the best interests of the industry. I believe that Deputy Belton, with his undoubted knowledge, should be prepared to co-operate, and also Deputies who are farmers.  As Deputy McGovern mentioned, it is important, whether the industry pays or not, that the co-operation of every section should be given in this inquiry.  I am sure the Minister has no idea of setting up the tribunal for the protection or advancement of a particular branch of the industry.  That idea is too remote to need serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I am not quite enthusiastic about the particular method adopted.  I would like to have types of experts brought together who would bring their abilities to bear upon the problem that exists, regarding the production of a suitable type of pig for export.  Here I would like to suggest that, amongst other matters which could be brought to the notice of the tribunal, is the method of exporting pig offals.  The present method is not satisfactory.  I also suggest, without wishing to anticipate the functions of the tribunal, that there should be a standard type of cask for the export of pig offals.  That is essential in order to ensure that the offals reach the markets in proper condition. A more generous attitude on the part of members of the farming community, would have an effect in improving the pig industry.  This tribunal that is to inquire into that question should get the best assistance that can be given <Col N="705" /> to it, and when its recommendations are available, I hope they will be of such a character as to ensure more profits for all engaged in the industry.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to speak at any length upon this motion, not because I do not think the bacon and pig industries are of prime importance to the existence of this State, but because the case against this motion can be put and put unanswerably in a few words.  My reason for opposing this motion is that at a time in which it is a necessity that the pig industry in this State should be helped to get once again upon its feet, the Minister for Agriculture runs away from his responsibility, and endeavours to wash his hands of responsibility by setting up a tribunal when immediate consideration is called for.  The Minister's attitude, and the attitude of the Executive Council, is to set up a tribunal to delay, delay, delay. I say this is a proposal for delay, and that is the reason I am opposed to this motion.  Of course it does not come as a surprise to me.  The Minister for Agriculture is very ingenious.  He is always very ready and willing to admit that he is not a person who is capable of devising anything himself.  He is always seeking elsewhere for plans to help Irish agriculture.  He is always asking assistance from this person and from that person, in a most pathetic, and I might say, very disarming manner. Of course one does not expect, after his own admission, that the Minister for Agriculture is likely to evolve of himself any plan which will be, in any way, beneficial to the bacon trade or the pig trade in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly the setting up of this tribunal may be the very best thing the Minister for Agriculture could do, but it is not the very best thing any competent Minister for Agriculture, perfectly determined to shoulder his own responsibilities, would do, and that is the reason why I cannot vote for this motion.  With these remarks I might almost sit down, but there have been a certain number of things said to-day, and yesterday, in the course of the debate, which compel me to go a little further.  We find that this <Col N="706" /> proposed tribunal is to do two things. We are told it is important to examine and consider how improvement can be effected, if it can be effected, in the pig industry in the home market and also for the export market.  Some time ago the Minister used to allude to pigs, and the prices of pigs as the one bright spot in the agricultural horizon&mdash;the one place that one could see the sun breaking through the clouds.  All that is now gone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told that pigs were on sale in the Irish Free State at prices just as good as in Northern Ireland.  The Minister made these remarks on more than one occasion in the teeth of the market reports published.  What is the need for this tribunal if the pig trade is all right, is excellent, and is flourishing? If the pig trade is paying, and doing well, and if nothing further is required, why set up this tribunal?  Is not every Deputy in this House, every Deputy in the Fianna Fail Party who spoke, or intends to vote for this motion, absolutely convinced now, on the admission of the Minister, that the Irish pig trade is in danger and menaced almost with extinction.  Is not that what everyone knows?  It is menaced almost with extinction.  I do not say total extinction because, in better times the pig industry can be revived again.  But although the pig population can be increased, in a short time, still, when the pig industry loses its market it is extremely difficult to get the market back again.  That is what the Minister should concentrate upon.  That is what the Executive Council, if they wished to help the Irish pig producer and the Irish bacon manufacturer, would have concentrated upon&mdash;getting back the market which is necessary for the continuance of profitable prices, and for the protection, not merely of the bacon and pork trade, but for the protection of all livestock products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told again and again that the export trade in pigs and the live-stock trade in everything else is <Col N="707" />&ldquo;down and out,&rdquo; and never can be recovered.  It is necessary to put forward propaganda of that kind in order to justify the attitude the Government has taken up, and the delight with which they hail the continuance of the economic war, and the expressions that we get from them that they have no desire, and will take no steps towards ending the economic war.  What this country requires for the pig industry, or the pork industry, or any other branch of a farming industry, is that they should be put upon a sound and solid financial path.  What it requires for that, first of all, is the restoration of our export trade.  We are told that we have the home market and that that is enough.  That is the most sheer absolute folly in the world, and I wish, in that connection, that Deputy Corry would make an attempt to understand figures before he starts quoting them.  Does any sane person think that the Irish home market is going to absorb the output of Irish pigs?  If that is the argument, then the Irish pig trade is for all practical purposes, dead.  The Irish home market is not big enough, and never could be big enough, to absorb anything approaching what ought to be the output of Irish pigs and what must be the output of Irish pigs if a very large proportion of the small farmers of this country are to carry on farming on a profitable basis.  If you are to have farming carried on in the County Mayo you must produce your pigs at a reasonable rate of profit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes talked about Limerick as a great pig producing place and said that some of the bacon manufacturers were not satisfied with the quality of the pigs they get.  That may be correct, because I know that one of the largest organisations in Limerick has partially, if not completely, closed down there and transferred itself to Mayo.  It has opened an establishment in Claremorris and has completely or partially wound up its Limerick business. That may be because in the immediate neighbourhood they are not producing the proper pigs for bacon. About that matter I make not the slightest observation.  I know absolutely <Col N="708" /> nothing about it, but I know that the right and correct class of pig, as that incident establishes, is being produced, at the present moment, in the constituency I represent, and all over Connaught, for that matter. What I want to see is an effort made to ensure that the producers of those pigs get a fair and profitable price.  A motion to set up a commission to enquire into these matters can be of no benefit to the pig producers and is merely a method of continuing the present state of affairs by the Executive Council.  I do not intend to take up the time of the House any further. This is not the kind of motion that ought to be introduced here.  We ought to have no crisis like this, and I say that if we had an Executive Council in office that was able to formulate a policy of its own, and understood the situation in the country, they would be able to frame proposals here to meet the needs of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to tell you the cause.  Five months ago the price of pigs from 13 stone to 16 stone live weight in the Minister's own constituency was 20/- per cwt.  The price of pigs from over 16 stone to 20 stone was 16/- a cwt. live weight.  Pigs over 20 stone fetched a price of 10/- per cwt. live weight.  What did the producer lose on those pigs?  He lost from 30/- to 40/- a pig on the pigs from 13 to 20 stone.  Could he continue to produce under those circumstances?  What is the cause of the scarcity of pigs now?  Every man had a small pig; he rushed it on and sent it away as pork, and that leaves the country to-day without a supply of pigs.  We are told from the Opposition Benches that the price of pigs was very low in 1931.</P>

      <P>I am a weekly buyer of pigs, and am in a position to give you the figures.  In December, 1931, the lowest price was 30/- a cwt., which was an uneconomic price to the feeder. They were worth that for the home factory and for the British market.  In December, 1932, through the effects of the economic war and the surplus of pigs in the country, the home factories could not handle the supply of pigs, and they dropped the price to 20/- per cwt. live weight.  They would only kill them from 13 stone to 16 stone.  Pigs over 16 stone had to go to England, where they were bought at 16/- per cwt. live weight.  That is the cause of the scarcity of pigs to-day.  I see here in a cutting out of a paper that Canada is sending 10,000 cattle to Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Bill, 1933&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed.)</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to make restitution and to give to the citizens of this State their just dues long withheld from them.  When I was speaking on this Stage of this Bill on 30th March last, I dealt at length with the various disabilities which had been imposed on good citizens merely because of their political opinions.  I do not know whether I should read that speech to the Dáil again because it would seem that, if I did so, there is some possibility that I might have to read it a second time.</P>
      <P>I should like to recall briefly to the members of the House what the two main blots upon the existing Damage to Property (Compensation) Acts are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, in the Principal Act, there was Section 9, the effect of which was to debar Republicans and Republican supporters from the receipt of compensation in respect of post-Truce losses. Similarly, under Section 15, sub-section (9), Republicans were prohibited from receiving payment of compensation in respect of goods given voluntarily to Republican forces.  A number of claims were dismissed by the court under one or both of these sections, and in addition, in a number of cases, notwithstanding the awards made by the court, my predecessor in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government refused to honour those awards.  Apart altogether from those who were treated with such manifest injustice, there was another considerable section of the people who thought that it would be fruitless to appeal to the courts because of the <Col N="717" /> penal provisions in the Compensation Acts and who, consequently, did not bring claims.  The principal purpose of this Bill is to repeal the two provisions in the Principal Act, to which I have referred, so far as new claims are concerned, and it also will enable me to make payment on foot of the reports where payment was refused by my predecessor. It also provides that parties, whose applications under the Act of 1923 were dismissed by the court on political grounds, or those who did not previously make application because their applications would have been refused on political grounds, may now put forward claims.  It will be seen, therefore, that, as I said at the outset, the principal purpose of this Bill is to mete out the justice which has been long deferred.</P>
    <P>It will also be seen that the Bill relates mainly to post-Truce events. Neither the Compensation (Ireland) Commission nor the Indemnity Act Committee ruled out claims on political grounds, and the latter Act, as I intimated on the last occasion, permitted the Committee to take under consideration the taking of goods, whether the taking was with or without the consent of the owner.  It is possible, however, owing to the feeling which ran high at the time when these bodies were sitting, that some people may have declined to prefer claims before them, while others, owing to the peculiar circumstances of the time also, may not have lodged claims until after the prescribed date.  In the case of the post-Truce applicants this Bill affords such parties a further opportunity of presenting their claims.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the losses which will fall to be dealt with under this measure embrace, first of all, damage to and destruction of property between the 21st January, 1919 and the 12th May, 1923, and secondly, the taking away of chattels by Republican forces between the 21st January, 1919, and the 12th May, 1923, whether such taking away occurred with or without the consent of the owner; provided in each case that, first of all, a claim, with the exception of claims for chattels taken, was not duly made to the Compensation (Ireland) Commission; secondly, that a <Col N="718" /> claim was not duly made under the Indemnity Act of 1924; thirdly, that a claim was not duly made under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, and, fourthly, that if such a claim were made it had been dismissed on political grounds.</P>
    <P>The admission of claims, which were dismissed either by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission or the Indemnity Act Committee, or for reasons other than political reasons under the 1923 Act, is not intended.  The Government takes the view that the parties concerned in these cases have already had an ample opportunity to establish their claims, and that the people should not be saddled with the expense of opposing them for the second time.</P>
    <P>The main items of losses excluded from the Bill are, first of all, consequential losses; secondly, claims arising out of the billeting of troops; and thirdly, claims for cash taken, levied, or otherwise expended, save where it was expended in restoring or replacing lost or injured property. In that connection, I may point out that none of these items was the subject of compensation under the Criminal Injuries Code which was the original foundation of all this legislation. Furthermore, neither the Compensation (Ireland) Commission nor the Indemnity Act Committee awarded compensation in respect of these and no compensation was paid for them under the Compensation Act of 1923.</P>
    <P>As to the merits of excluding these particular classes of claims, it may be pointed out that, as regards consequential losses, it would be quite impossible, obviously, to provide compensation in cases of this nature which were suffered on so substantial a scale by many sections of the community during the Anglo-Irish and Civil Wars.  Again, with regard to billeting, it was excluded specifically from the scope of the 1924 Act, and I think properly excluded, because, first of all, we all know that the basis of service rendered, whether in the Volunteers or in any ancillary or subsidiary capacity, was a voluntary basis and, consequently, to deal with the question of billeting would be <Col N="719" /> quite against the principle under which the whole of the national struggle had been sustained.  Apart altogether from that, there is a very practical consideration&mdash;even in 1924&mdash; that it would be exceedingly difficult to investigate these claims and, if the principle were once admitted, to assess them on their just merits.  That difficulty, of course, has become very much greater after the passage of so <Col N="720" /> many more years.  The same might be said with regard to cash taken, levied or expended.  It would be quite impossible at this time to ascertain whether, in fact, losses of that nature had been sustained and, for these reasons, therefore, all claims of this class have been properly ruled out.</P>
    <P>I move the adjournment.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
