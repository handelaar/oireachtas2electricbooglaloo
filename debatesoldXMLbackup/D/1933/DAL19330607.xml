    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state how many applicants for blind pensions in Saorstát Eireann are awaiting examination by the medical representative of the Department of Local Government and Public Health and if the Minister can state how long will applicants for blind pensions in County Donegal have to wait before they can be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Blind pension administration is carried out as part of Old Age Pension administration and the number of appeals on both heads has increased to an abnormal extent since the passing of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1932, with the result that a certain amount of unavoidable delay has occurred in dealing with the appeals which have arisen.  Accurate statistics cannot be given, but so far as can be ascertained there are upwards of 1,800 appeals awaiting decision on blind pension <Col N="6" /> claims.  Donegal County Board of Health has not appointed a County Ophthalmic Surgeon and claimants for blind pensions in that county have not therefore the advantage of procuring certificates which exist in counties where such an appointment has been made.</P>
      <P>County Donegal has, however, no cause for complaint as the Departmental Medical Inspector made an extended tour of inspection therein in December, 1932, when he examined 180 claimants.  He examined a further 19 claimants in Inishowen on 9th May, 1933, when he was in that area.  Sixty-five cases appear to remain not yet dealt with in the county, the reason for the delay lying, in some cases, with the claimants themselves, as they failed to appear for examination when called before the inspector.  These remaining cases will receive attention at the earliest available opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, while fully appreciating the splendid work which has been done by the Department's Medical Officer in Donegal, does the Parliamentary Secretary not realise that, if there are 1,800 appellants who must be medically examined, steps should be taken forthwith to provide for greater dispatch and greater facilities for their examinations?  When he says that Donegal has no reason to complain, might I ask him does he mean that the persons who lodged their applications subsequent to the departure of the Departmental Medical Inspector have no complaint on being called upon to wait nine to 12 months to be examined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated, in answer to the Deputy's question, that the Departmental Medical Inspector made an extended tour therein in December, 1932, when he examined 180 claimants; that on the 9th May, 1933, he was again in Donegal and examined a further 19 claimants; and that, in view of that, County Donegal has no reason to complain.  County Donegal has got more attention from the Departmental Inspector in relation to blind pension claims than, I think, any county in the 26 County area.  If the County Donegal Board of Health <Col N="7" /> appointed an ophthalmic surgeon it would be unnecessary to send the medical inspector down to Donegal to carry out examination; the certificate of the ophthalmic surgeon would be accepted.  So far the County Donegal Board of Health have failed to make such an appointment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

The evidence showed that the claimant, John Murphy, and his wife, Mary Murphy, reside on a holding of land in John Murphy's name, comprising 80 acres; poor law valuation £25 10/-; with over five acres of tillage, and carrying 12 cows, together with other stock.</P>

Of the 39 officers, 12 were transferred within the Dublin Metropolitan Area, without any expense.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Extension of Franchise) Bill, 1933&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPatrickKelly" hpid="Mr. J.P. Kelly Mr. J.P. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill because I believe that the extension of the franchise to a considerable percentage of our population is overdue.  Deputy Fitzgerald, in opposing this measure when it was last before the Dáil, told us that if we extended the franchise we would be giving the vote to an irresponsible multitude.  Does he suggest that the young men who went out in Easter Week were irresponsible; or the young men who fought the anti-conscription campaign; or the young men who took over the courts from the British, while the British were still in occupation here; or the young men who took over the county councils and other local bodies and carried them on in spite of the opposition offered by the English Government at the time&mdash;carried out their work efficiently and to the satisfaction of the people concerned?  To whom do we extend the franchise?  If we take the ordinary country household, the workingman's household, we find the young man earning his daily bread, contributing to the support of the household and contributing his share of the rates.  We find the young girl engaged in her household duties also <Col N="33" /> contributing, by the sale of eggs and butter, etc., to the support of the household and to the support of the rates.  In the same way, in the farmer's house, we find the young men working in the fields from early morning until dark.  They have a responsibility to support the household and provide money for the rates.</P>
      <P>So it is with the town workers. If they find that the rates are high they know they have a responsibility to keep them low, so that they may be able to find employment and continuous employment; because they realise that if the rates were very high they would not have the opportunity of getting the same amount of employment. The unemployed man has a responsibility also, because if there is extravagant administration by the local bodies and the rates are high, the unemployed man would be less likely to secure a position than he would if the rates were low.  They all have a responsibility.  I consider that the Deputy who said that these people form an irresponsible multitude did not consider them so at election time, when he would have been willing enough to send them out as canvassers and agents to do the bulk of his work.  I wonder what those people would think if they heard Deputies alluding to them as an irresponsible multitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late Government, although now when they find themselves in opposition oppose this measure, had not implicit confidence in the men running the local bodies down the country. On numerous occasions they thought fit to suspend the local councils and to put commissioners into their places simply because they were not carrying out their duties to the satisfaction of the late Government.  Furthermore, they did not place confidence in the rural councils because they took the power from them and appointed various people to different positions under those councils.  They took control out of the hands of the local bodies and put it into the hands of commissioners.  Then, in the case of appointments to those bodies, they sent one name from Dublin, took the <Col N="34" /> responsibility for the selection of officials out of the hands of the local councillors and contended that the local councillors were not fit to select people to fill those positions.  Deputy MacDermot said that youth wanted to take money out of other peoples' pockets and that that was the reason they were crying out for the extension of the franchise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not profess to be quoting the Deputy's exact words.  I merely took pencil notes.  I have not the Official Report because it is not yet circulated.  If the Deputy says he did not use these words I accept his statement unreservedly.  We did not come in here for the express purpose of collecting taxes.  We are here to represent the people in An Dáil for the purpose of collecting taxation and spending it to the best advantage.  So it is with the local councils.  They collect the money and they spend it to the best advantage.  I do not see why it is that old men should be better administrators than young men.  I hope I will not be accused of egotism when I say that at 21 years of age I was elected a member of the Board of Guardians in my native place and at 23 I was appointed chairman of that Board of Guardians, a post which I held until the Board was abolished by the last Government.  I may say that many eulogistic things are on record as to the administrative policy of that Board of Guardians.  I mention that to point out that old men should not be afraid of young men coming into power.  Young men are trying to make themselves acquainted with the details of local administration and there is probably no better school than the school of the world for those young <Col N="35" /> men who want to learn.  It will develop their character and they will become better citizens as a result.</P>
      <P>To my mind no argument has been put forward so far as to why young people should not get the vote and not merely the young people.  Some of those who are without the vote at the present moment are men and women who have not been as successful in life as other people are.  Merely because a person is living in a house in the country it is supposed that he has more right to a vote than a man who does not own a house, but the man who does not own a house has certainly the responsibility to try and provide a house for himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What struck me most forcibly about this Bill is that the sponsors of it have failed to prove that disability exists in the respect that is contended.  The last speaker mentioned that the men who went out in Easter Week were not irresponsible. He also mentioned that the men who went out in 1920 and took hold of the local authorities were not <Col N="36" /> irresponsible; but he forgets that at that time the men who took hold of the local authorities got elected to them on the then existing register. It was the same register; there was no adult suffrage then.  The comparison the last speaker made is even from his point of view most unfavourable considering the circumstances of the time and that there was no extended franchise required at the time such as the Fianna Fáil Party wants at the present time.</P>
      <P>They have not put forward the reason why they require it.  They have not told this House what is the real reason behind this Bill.  Of course it is evident to any person who knows anything of the country what the real reason behind this Bill is.  The real reason behind this Bill at the present time is that the people who have anything to lose in this country have been losing it because of the Fianna Fáil policy, and Fianna Fáil is afraid to face the country on the issue.  There is no other reason.  Deputy Kelly may laugh.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly thinks, as a matter of fact, that this country does not exist outside the four walls of Dublin.  It does exist, and very much so.  The one redeeming feature about this Bill is that Fianna Fáil have realised that they are afraid, and that they ought to be afraid, to go back to the country and ask for a vote of the people who have something to lose in the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  As our friend of the Government Benches said, the register was good enough in 1920, when the British Government were here.  The young people had not votes then.  It is not good enough to-day because the Fianna Fáil policy has robbed the people, and Fianna Fáil are afraid to face them.  There ought to be no repeal of an Act unless that Act has either failed in its administration, or does not suit. Does either of those conditions exist <Col N="37" /> at the present time?  If so, the Government has not put up any case to that effect.  They have not shown what improvement there will be in local administration as a result of this Bill.  Probably the case will be made that the Government is in fact the greatest contributor towards the rates at the present time, by way of grant. Admitted.  It will also be used as an argument in favour of this Bill that every taxpayer in the country, irrespective of what his age is, if he is a smoker or a drinker&mdash;a tea drinker or anything else&mdash;has to contribute his share to national taxation, and is entitled to be represented on the county council and local authorities generally because of that indirect way in which he himself has contributed towards the county council fund.  At the same time take the case of two men, one who is not a ratepayer and the other who is a ratepayer.  They are both, we will say, making equal contributions towards national taxation. One, by reason of the fact that he has a farm of land which carries a valuation of £50 or £60, is contributing say £7 or £8 towards national taxation the same as the other man, and in addition he is contributing £25 or £40 per annum towards local rates. Has he a right, after all, to some advantage over the other man on account of the expenditure of that particular money?  He certainly has, or at least he should have.  Consequently, I maintain that the present register is, for the purposes of good administration, the soundest and best register.  This Bill is an attempt to give votes to irresponsible people.  It does not matter for what reason they are irresponsible; it does not matter, as the last Deputy said, if you think you are going to get better administration from people of mature age; that may be true, but then it may also be quite right that the Deputy is a man who came to maturity before the ordinary run of people; in any case the people who are responsible for the payment of rates ought to be the best people to administer the funds.  That goes without saying.  There is no reason that I can see behind the Bill. The country knows that, and Fianna <Col N="38" /> Fáil knows it, but they are afraid to face the people who have something to lose in this country, and they want to get in the voters who have nothing to lose.  That is the real reason behind the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Brennan, I am inclined, in one respect, to rejoice at the introduction of this Bill, because it is an admission that Fianna Fáil has completely lost the confidence of all the persons who are responsible ratepayers in this State.  The object of postponing the elections, and the object of bringing in this Bill, is perfectly obvious.  The present administration knows that on going to county council elections, especially in the rural districts, upon the present register, on going to ask the suffrages of those persons whom it has ruined by its legislation and by its administrative action during the last year and a half, they would be absolutely swept out of existence. Therefore, as far as it is an admission on the part of Fianna Fáil, I suppose that if we were mere politicians we would rejoice at the introduction of this Bill, but when I come to consider what the Bill is and what its repercussions are going to be it becomes obvious that the Fianna Fáil Party is clutching at any sort of straw it can see.  At no matter what cost to the country, at no matter what cost to the State, we have Fianna Fáil endeavouring to keep itself afloat. Take this Bill.  It is a matter of expediency of course&mdash;I will deal with expediency in a moment&mdash;for the Government to bring it in.  Let us take the principle which lies behind it, and there is a big principle behind it.  There certainly is a case which appealed to the last Executive Council that in the matter of electing Deputies to this House every adult man and woman should have a vote. Why?  Because every adult man and woman pay taxes, directly or indirectly.  There is nobody in this State who does not pay some of the taxes which are levied.  Whether he pays them out of his own pocket, whether he gets the money from another person to do it, or whether <Col N="39" /> he gets it actually in the shape of dole or otherwise from the State, some of it is taken back in indirect taxes from him, taxes on the various articles essential to life which he has to buy, and which this Administration has taxed.</P>
      <P>Every administration levies indirect taxes.  This House is a great deal more than a rate-collecting or tax-collecting body.  This House, and the Oireachtas generally, is a law-making body.  It brings in laws which regulate, to a certain extent, the lives and conduct of the people of this State.  The people of this State, therefore, when general laws are being passed, must undoubtedly have a claim that they should be considered in the making of those laws.  As I have said, there is a case in that respect, and a case which appeared to be a good one to the last Executive Council, when manhood suffrage was introduced into this State before it had been introduced into many countries in Europe. When you come to local administration it stands upon a completely different footing.  None of those considerations arise.  According to our system of administration nobody pays rates except persons who own property, and apart from Government grants the entire funds which are being administered are funds which are taken out of the ratepayers' pockets.  It is, accordingly, to the interests of the ratepayer to see, in the first place, that no unnecessary amount of money will be raised by way of rates, and secondly, it is to the interests of the ratepayer to see that the money levied as rates shall be properly and efficiently expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a great example recently of the danger of indiscriminate expenditure&mdash;of persons expending money who have not got to provide the money.  I do not believe there is a single Deputy in this House who will not say that the £1,000,000 borrowed on the Road Fund was frittered away or that there was 5/- worth of work done for each pound of that money expended, because the persons expending it had nothing to do with the raising of the money. <Col N="40" /> What you have here is that people, who are not interested in anything except getting the rates as high as they possibly can if they can make any money out of it themselves, are to be the electors.  That is entirely wrong.  Why should they?  The ratepayers pay all the rates.  Why should they not have the sole voice in the expending of the rates?  Why should any person, who does not contribute a halfpenny to the rates, have a voice in the spending of them?  Why should they have any voice in electing the representatives who are to have charge of the expenditure of the sums collected in rates?</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly, speaking a few moments ago, made a very remarkable pronouncement.  He said that every man had a responsibility to provide for himself.  Most men have a responsibility to provide for themselves out of the labours of their own hands or the exertions of their own brains; but this is a new doctrine, that a man should have a responsibility to provide for himself out of the pockets of other people; and you may be certain that no set of men in this world yet have been economists when they were dealing with the contents of the purses or of the pockets of other men.  That is precisely what you are going to have in this State. You are going to have a large body of electors putting in men who are pledged, not to economy but pledged to expenditure.  You are going to have money spent indiscriminately in unnecessary works and flung in every direction, because they will not have to pay for it themselves.</P>
    <P>Already&mdash;and here I come to what is, possibly, the most serious part of this Bill, coming as it does in the present crisis of Irish life&mdash;we know, at the present moment, that the Government has put on such heavy expenditure on the country and such a heavy load of taxation on the back of the taxpayer that the Minister for Finance admits that he has completely exhausted all the possible sources of taxation. Nothing more can be got from taxation unless, he says, he goes down and taxes the absolute necessities of life more heavily than they are taxed at <Col N="41" /> present, or heavier than they can bear. That is the position as far as the ordinary taxpayer is concerned.  Now, under this Bill, you will have the young men, about whom we hear so much and who are anxious for expenditure, getting control; and there is, at any rate, a very grave danger that these men will run up the rates until the rates, like taxation, have reached to the very highest possible point.  You will have, then, some persons unable to pay rates, and any person who has a single penny left after he has paid his taxes will find it taken out of his pockets by excessive rates.  This Bill, taken together with the taxation which the Minister for Finance is imposing upon this country, is having this effect, and must have this effect&mdash;that by taking away from every single person who has got money every single penny that you can wring out of him&mdash;and I do not mean now large-moneyed men or men of large possessions, but men of small possessions&mdash;if you take away from such men the entirety of their possessions, and that is what you are doing&mdash; you are cultivating and tilling the field for the establishment of those things that we hear so much about now-a-days: workers' republics, the Communistic State and everything of that nature.  You are heading fast for it. I do not say that the Executive Council are deliberately playing for these results to follow.  I do not say that.  But I do say this: that if Deputy O'Kelly and the other members of the Executive Council spent their nights and days studying Marx and Engels, I do not think they could devise methods better than the methods they are devising at the present moment for bringing about that revolution which was to be the principal method to which Marx and others of his school look for the achievement of their aims.</P>
    <P>We have already had in this House, or have been asked to have, a complete disregard for law of all kinds and disregard for the dictates of common honesty.  We have two Bills already before the House which are direct infringements of the Seventh Commandment. We have now in this Bill a direct encouragement to persons who, by electing the representatives, <Col N="42" /> may get control of the finances of the country and, getting control of the finances of the country and having no responsibility, not having to find the rates themselves, will very naturally &mdash; because it is in human nature that they would do it&mdash;will not have any regard to the interests of the ratepayers and will make the burden of rates as heavy upon the ratepayer as the burden of taxation is upon the ordinary individual at the present moment.  The combination of those two is the most excellent tilling of the field for other people to scatter pernicious doctrines in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, in introducing this Bill, has an idea that it is likely to improve local government.  Deputy Kelly, a few moments ago, speaking to that effect, made mention of the young men of Easter Week and of 1920 and so on. I cannot see at all what that has got to do with this Bill.  People should be chosen for local government purposes on account of their ability to see that the rates which are paid are judiciously spent.  I put it to the Minister himself: Is he satisfied, even under the present restricted electorate, that that has been done?  I know that it has not.  I know that when this Bill becomes law, and when the elections are held under it, there will be no more pitiable man in the country than the Minister for Local Government and Public Health himself, because he cannot manage it.  I cannot see how, under this Bill, the ordinary, reasonable ratepayer will have any say.  I am absolutely certain that he will not, and that people will be chosen for one idea or another.  They will say that they are going to do this and that they are going to do that; that they are going to build houses, give home assistance and everything else.  That is the effect that the whole thing will have. I have heard it stated here that there should be no taxation without representation. How are the taxpayers affected by this Bill?  People who contribute nothing to local taxation will have the greatest say in connection with the disbursement of money.  Is that fair?</P>

      <P>That is news to me.  I may be dense, but I cannot understand that viewpoint at all.  The Minister knows perfectly well the condition of affairs in the constituency which I represent.  He knows why the existing conditions were brought about.  Irresponsible persons have seen fit to impose taxation on the ratepayers which the ratepayers cannot meet.  The Minister has seen fit to admonish, to reprimand them, but with no effect.  What effect will this Bill have upon such a state of things?  It will have no effect.  I would much prefer to see a commissioner appointed than to see this Bill become operative.  Under a commissioner, at any rate, we would get a fair crack of the whip.  Under this Bill the farming community, the large or even moderate ratepayers, will have no reasonable say in connection with the administration of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local elections were postponed because of the very obvious fact that the Fianna Fáil representatives were afraid to face the elections.  There was no other reason why the elections should be postponed.  The Minister knows quite well that members of the body I spoke about were sentenced in Green Street to several months imprisonment in connection with the letting of a cottage.  If £40 could be extracted from a labourer for being given possession of a cottage what <Col N="44" /> could not be done in the future by irresponsible people?  I say all that sort of thing is due to the fact that we have irresponsible people on local councils.</P>

No Bill that has been introduced in this House could have a more adverse effect on the ordinary ratepayers&mdash;they need not be large ratepayers, either&mdash;than this measure.  The ordinary ratepayers will have little or no say as regards administration.  I can visualise the time when the rates will mount to such a high figure that there will not be a chance in a million of having them collected.  That is a state of affairs which no responsible Government should bring about.  Deputy T. Kelly mentioned that he entered public life at a very early age.  That is quite true, but so also did the Minister for Local Government.  You have a few people like that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have had conversations with people representing various interests.  I am not drawing any distinction between Fianna Fáil, Cumann na nGaedheal, the Centre Party or the Labour Party. One man told me that it was his duty to see that the rates were high&mdash;that was what he was there for.  I am sure <Col N="45" /> everybody knows that when it comes to a question of running the affairs of a county council there will be a lot of wildcat schemes before us for one reason or another.  There have been in the past and, I am sure, there will be more in the future.  Where you have representatives who have nothing to lose and who contribute nothing to the rates&mdash;and the people whom they represent do not contribute, either&mdash;is it not plain that they will see the rates are increased?</P>
      <P>I regret that such a Bill as this has been introduced.  It was hard enough to get proper men on local boards in the past, but I fear it will be a lot harder in the future if this Bill is made law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill, and I do so with a full sense of my responsibility.  I claim to speak with a certain amount of authority on this particular matter.  I have had a considerable experience of local government.  For 12 years I have been connected with the Clare County Council, of which body I happen to be Chairman.  I have also been a member of practically everyone of the subsidiary bodies connected with the county council during the last 12 years.  We are told here that if there is an extension of the franchise the scheme of local government will turn topsy-turvy.  We are told that if young men are admitted to take part in the administration of local affairs these affairs cannot be properly administered.  I am pleased to see here some very young men on the opposite benches.  Can it be contended by these young men that they are unfit to administer the affairs of an ordinary county council, and yet they are considered fit to take part in the deliberations of this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Fitzgerald who told us that the only concern of members of local authorities is to collect and spend the rates, whereas the Central Government has the responsibility of catering for the requirements of our citizens.  Despite that allegation I contend that the members of local authorities are in closer touch with the ordinary lives of <Col N="46" /> the plain people than those who are members of the central authority can claim to be.  More than 50 per cent. of the funds administered by the local authorities are contributed from central funds, and to the central funds all persons, whether they are on the local government franchise or not, contribute.</P>
    <P>All the people have a say in the election of Deputies into this House, and these Deputies have the control of the central fund in their hands. Surely if it is right that they should have a say as to who is to control the central funds which provide the necessary lubricating oil for the working of the Central Government as well as more than 50 per cent. of the moneys which are administered by the local authorities, it is only fair and reasonable that they should have a say as to who should administer the remaining portion of somewhat less than 50 per cent. to which they are supposed not to contribute directly, but to which most undoubtedly they contribute indirectly.  Let us take the case of a farmer's son, 30 or 40 years of age, living at home and working all his lifetime on the farm. Can it be contended that that man is not contributing to the rates?  Is that man not working as hard as any man, whether in town or country? And is he not contributing his share towards these rates out of the farm on which he works?</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the irresponsible multitude. What is the will of the people now? Some few years ago we heard the will of the people flaunted all over the country.  Is it to be the will of the majority of the people?  Is it to be the will of the people or is it to be merely the will of the rapidly <Col N="47" /> diminishing majority who have reached that stage of senile decay when they can be cajoled into the support of Cumann na nGaedheal?  Are these the people who alone should have a say in local administration?  In my opening remarks I referred to my association with local affairs in my native county, and I just briefly wish to revert to the position which obtains there.  Despite the allegations from the people on the opposite benches I challenge any of them to go down to Clare and take us on even in local administration.  Why? Because up to 1925 local affairs were in the control of Cumann na nGaedheal, and what was the record?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy MacDermot I am sorry that I did not inspect the birth certificates of the members of the public bodies in my county before I came up, and if I did, I would certainly say that the personnel of the council in control of local affairs in the last seven or eight years was certainly somewhat on the youthful side.  Despite the extravagance of the old men who preceded them, they have certainly carried out an economy in administration, so much so that they are not afraid to face the electors. Despite the fact that the rates in 1925 were something upwards of 20/- in the £, despite the fact that an arrears of debt was handed down to them of upwards of £80,000 in the case of the county council, and £30,000 in the case of the board of health, despite the fact that the entire hospital accommodation which the old council had failed to provide had to be faced and provided despite all these adverse factors, in the past eight years all that has been changed, and the rates are now within the capacity of the people of Clare to pay, despite all the <Col N="48" /> complaining and whining from Deputies across the way.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies have spoken in favour of commissioners.  The commissioner system has been tried in the past and I do not know if there is any Deputy in the House who will stand up and defend it.  Has it been found that the commissioner system has worked better or more satisfactorily from the ratepayers' point of view?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>But these bodies were elected on the old register and now we are told if the register is changed and the young people given a chance matters will be worse.  In certain parts of the country people have failed to face up to their responsibilities. They have elected men who should not be elected.  I contend that men ought not to be elected who had not any regard for the interests of the ratepayers, big and small.  I have known men whose valuation runs into considerable sums and these men had no more scruples of conscience about expending public money than men of no property.  Perhaps after all the possession of broad acres is not a good standard by which to judge men's honesty.  Deputies may laugh but I have known very honest men who had not as much money as would jingle on a tombstone and we have seen the other kind too.  Personally I would like to see an infusion of new blood into the local authorities of this country. We have a considerable demand for the amenities of life throughout the country.  We have demands for waterworks and sewerage schemes.  If the fight against disease is to be carried to a successful conclusion; if disease is to be prevented, if this fight against epidemics is to be carried on to the successful conclusion that we all hope to see then the provision of waterworks and sewerage schemes and other preventive measures are a necessity to win <Col N="49" /> this fight and the local authorities will have to face up to it in the future. After all, prevention is more economical than cure.</P>
      <P>It is only by an infusion of new blood and by permitting the young men of the country to have a say in the administration of local affairs, just as they have in the administration of national affairs, and by the addition of men of vision and courage that these schemes will be tackled properly.  We have had for the past few months a campaign against the payment of rates sponsored by people who should have known better&mdash;some people who have perhaps grown old in experience.  One of them, speaking last week, informed us that he deprecated having politics in local authorities.  Was it not from political motives that the advice was tendered to local authorities to abstain from striking rates?  I hope, therefore, that this Bill will become law in a very short time, and that we shall thus see an advance in local administration and not be harking back to the old mid-Victorian methods which some Deputies would like to see.  This is an age of progress, and if progress is to be made it can only be made by young men.</P>

      <P>I think it will be abundantly clear to Deputies that political wisdom does not lie in the possession of a grey beard any more than in the possession of a youthful appearance, because if you look round the House you will find grey heads and bald heads in abundance in the opposite benches and you will find many young men on these benches. If you go down the country you will find that a lot of the young people who are now coming on are showing far more political wisdom than their immediate predecessors who voted in the last two general elections.  I do not take umbrage at this Bill on account of its giving votes or authority or political influence to youthful people, because I have got some connection with the county from which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries comes, and I know that in <Col N="50" /> his county, men, as long as they remain unmarried, whether they are 70 or 80 years of age, are still referred to as boys.  I know one particular instance in County Clare where a poor man aged 75 lamented the death of his mother and being left a poor orphan. We can readily understand the Parliamentary Secretary's championing of youth.  The question, however, as to whether this is or is not a good Bill does not depend on whether people who are young or people who are old get votes under the Bill.  For Deputies on this side of the House, from whose Party was formed the Government that gave this country adult suffrage and proportional representation in 1922, in the middle of a civil war, adult suffrage in local government has no terrors.  I think Deputy Brennan put his finger on the real issue when he asked whether the Government had made any case to show what improvement would be effected in the system of local government by the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be perfectly prepared to support the measure, even at the expense of the big ratepayers, whose cause was ably advocated by Deputy Curran, if I were convinced that any betterment would be effected in the system of local government by the proposals in the Bill.  But I do not think there will.  I do not think there will, for the reasons given by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and others who spoke.  I do not intend to repeat these observations, nor do I intend to put forward the case of those people who base their advocacy against this Bill on the principle of no taxation without representation, or of those who base their advocacy against the Bill on the principle of no representation without taxation.  I should like to put it on two grounds: (1) does it effect any betterment in the system of local government; and (2) what effect it is going to have on the system of democracy? The first aspect of the case has been dealt with by previous speakers. I only hope that as a result of the Bill we shall not have more corruption, more of the ward heelers, more of the corruption of every kind, class, and description, with which we were familiar in the past in connection with <Col N="51" /> local government administration.  It is permitted even to those who are against this Bill to hope that, if those young people whose cause has been advocated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, after sowing all their local wild oats on these boards, are brought to a proper sense of their responsibility in connection with the expenditure and administration of public funds, that some good will have been effected by the passage of the Bill.  We are all familiar with the spectacle of people from every part of the country with their hands outstretched to the local authority begging for a grant, and money, and more money for this, that and the other thing.  If this Bill could achieve a position where the local people could be brought to a sense of their responsibility in connection, not merely with State expenditure, but local expenditure, then something would have been achieved by the Bill. I very gravely doubt, however, whether that purpose will be effected.</P>
    <P>This country has been for the last ten or 11 years the happy hunting ground of students of political theories, and this Bill will furnish them with an additional chapter for their theorising, because it appears to me that this Bill is really democracy brought to its logical conclusion.  I am disposed to agree with those political thinkers who are advocates of democracy and democratic forms of government, but who feel that if these forms of government are pushed too far, and if democratic principles are allowed to run riot, the result will ultimately be to ruin democracy, to bring about a failure of these institutions of State and local administration which have their base on real, true foundations of democratic government. We have a small country here in the whole thirty-two counties.  We have two Parliamentary Governments and we are always crying, and properly crying, about partition.  But we are going by this Bill to introduce into the Twenty-Six Counties a system of federal government, not immediately but ultimately.  It seems to me ridiculous that, in a country with <Col N="52" /> a population of about 3,000,000, we should set up not merely an expensive system of central organisation but a whole series of what, in effect, will be local parliaments.  I believe that when people find their feet in connection with the new franchise and the new representation given by the Bill you will have demands from the local boards for local autonomy in matters other than those now within the jurisdiction of local authorities.  The logical result of that must be conflict with the central administration and, possibly, ultimately a system of futile federalism in this country and the weakening of the central authority. That, if you like, is the actual theoretical aspect of the proposals contained in this Bill.  We object to this Bill on two grounds.  In the first place, it is not going to help in purifying local administration; and in the second place it is inevitable that it will bring about a strong reaction against democracy.</P>

It struck me as an interesting coincidence that the Minister became so passionately democratic when the members of the Fianna Fáil Party discovered, up and down the country, that they had not the slightest chance of winning the local government, elections scheduled to take place in June and to be fought upon the old register.</P>

      <P>And having discovered that, they informed the Minister for Local Government with a great deal more embellishment than the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, that something should be done.  Then a wave of democracy swept the Executive Council, and the second Magna Charta was written, and the rights of the people were again vindicated.  Every one knows the reason this Bill was brought in was to collar the county councils for Fianna <Col N="53" /> Fáil.  I shall deal with that aspect of the question in a moment.  I should like just now to refer to the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries. He is badly informed upon lobsters, but he is glorious upon young men.  The Fianna Fáil young men of 40, and upwards, marching behind this Bill in the defence of the youth of this country is a glorious picture.  It is the farmers' sons the Parliamentary Secretary is anxious about.  He is anxious about the 40-year-old labourers who have a right to make their voices heard in local administration.  That is the Parliamentary Secretary's excuse for the introduction of this Bill&mdash;the 40-year old labourers clamouring, in the name of Fianna Fáil, for democratic rights of the county councils.  The Parliamentary Secretary went on to speak with deep emotion of the will of the people.  He wants to see the will of the people made truly effective in this land.  That immediately gives us the key to the whole poisonous atmosphere that surrounds this proposal. The object of this Bill is not to improve local administration; the object of this Bill is to turn every local body in this country into a political platform.</P>

The number of times that poor Caitlin Ni Houlihan has been marched up and down the council chamber, rioting in the complexity of every colour, would be past reckoning, and it was the bombast that always did it so badly. I have no doubt that the Deputy, when he was a small boy, heard <Col N="54" /> repeated those bombastic expressions of patriotism and love of country. These patriots were supposed to be doing their bit for Ireland, and the ratepayers were called upon to pay.</P>

      <P>Let us not get into ancient history.  That would only give rise to a type of discussion that would embarrass the Chair and lead to something approaching breaches of order, because when I get on to that particular subject anything may happen.  I say then to the credit of Cumann na nGaedheal that they cleared that kind of clap-trap out of the local bodies, and after that a great many of the local bodies became efficient and addressed themselves to the work that they were sent there to do.  When they were protected from politics they settled down to the administration of the local services they were called upon to administer. I am convinced that the result of this Bill will be to revive that unhealthy atmosphere of the old administration where the primary purposes of the councils will be forgotten and where they will be used as political platforms for the discussion of every kind of political subjects.  I think, from the point of view of the ratepayers and the poor in the rural areas, that is all very bad and is bound to do a great deal of harm to the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary wound up by saying that this was an age of progress, and he rejoiced to be in the van.  He did not examine where he was progressing to, and after all, when discussing progress, it is a very important thing to make up your mind in what direction you are facing, because you may be progressing towards destruction.  In my opinion, and I believe in the opinion of every <Col N="55" /> local administrator on these benches, the result of this Bill is going to be that local authorities will become unworkable.  The Minister for Local Government will eventually be driven back to carry into operation the warning he once gave here that the time may come when he would have to do away with the local bodies and put in commissioners.  I think the Minister by this Bill is hastening that day.  I am sufficient of a democrat to believe that local administration is better conducted by responsible individuals elected by ratepayers of the area than by commissioners, if they are responsible men.  But I warn Deputies that this Bill is going to create a situation that will force the Minister's hand, that it will create a situation that the Minister cannot stand over in this Dáil, and he will be driven back, or his successor will be driven back, in two or three years' time, and will be forced to come before this House, and inform the House that it is his duty either to put in commissioners or to put in the law.</P>
    <P>Now it is all nonsense and cheap clap-trap to be talking about young men and the poor.  To my mind it is unscrupulous clap-trap.  There is no real solicitude there for the young men or the poor, any more than there is on any of the other benches.  I am satisfied that every Deputy in this House is as anxious as any of the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches to see that the poor are looked after. All the youth and beauty is not on the Fianna Fáil Benches.  They are lovely to look at, I know.  I can well believe that they are a great deal admired&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All I can say is that it is high time Deputies got it out of their heads that they are the young-looking heroes coming out of the West.  It is a long time since some of them came out of the West, and they should stop talking about being the Party of the rising generation.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite prepared to take the risk.  The issue here is not between the young men and the greybeards.  The issue is between the ratepayers and non-ratepayers. A case can be made for universal suffrage so far as Dáil elections are concerned, because the personal liberty of every individual is concerned.  The personal liberty of every man and woman in this country is in the hands of this House; therefore a very strong case can be made for the proposition that every man and every woman should have a voice in the elections to this House for the protection of their personal liberty. The case of the local authority is entirely different.  As I see it, the purpose of the local authority is to decide what amenities are to be made available in their own particular little community over which they have been placed, and, having made up their minds what is desirable, to decide what the people of that community can afford.  Suppose the Minister had come in here and said, &ldquo;We have decided that the local authorities of this country are denying to the poor in their own community the amenities that manifestly the poor are entitled to,&rdquo; then I think there would be a strong case.  He did not attempt to make that case.  He did not make it because there never was a time in the history of this country when the poor were being looked after more adequately by the local authorities than they are being looked after at the present time.  No question arises of any attempt to withhold from the poorer members of the community any amenity that the local authority can possibly afford. The Minister knows that.  Bear in mind that suppose, having made fair provision, the members of the local authority make up their mind that the rateable capacity of their particular county will not bear any further expenses, it is always open <Col N="57" /> to the poor to write to me in Donegal, to write to Deputy Harris, to write to Deputy Kelly and say, &ldquo;Certain amenities are withheld from the poor in this district on the ground that the rateable capacity of the country is no longer able to hear it.  We demand that those amenities be made available, and it is your job to get them for us.&rdquo; It would then be our duty to come here to this House and say, &ldquo;If the rates are no longer able to bear those burdens it is the duty of the Central Government to take them up.&rdquo;  We frequently do it.  The whole system of agricultural grants is based upon that very thing.  Representation has been made in this House that the rateable capacity of certain areas is no longer able to provide for the poor what the poor are entitled to, and that it is the duty of the Central Government to come to the assistance of the rates and to make those amenities available to the people. They have always got them when that fair and just case has been made.</P>
      <P>This House has never been backward in spreading the burden equally all over the community.  That seems to be a sensible arrangement, and it seems to me an arrangement which is proof against any serious abuse.  As Deputy Costello pointed out to-day, the tendency here and the road along which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries is progressing, though he does not know it, is to a kind of bastard federalism in this country.  That is whither he is going.  You will have in every county a body set up on the basis of universal suffrage which will be a challenge to the authority of this House.</P>

I suggest to the Deputy that the extraordinary possibility might arise that, while President de Valera sat in one place, County Cork might remain Cumann na nGaedheal.  Let us not be misunderstood.  That is not a danger which is here present, or that directly flows from this Bill.  I mention it in connection with the Parliamentary Secretary's observation that we are progressing.  I suggest to him that that is the direction of his progress.  It is a dangerous and unnecessary principle. There has been no effective indictment of the general administration of local government in this country.  We have had bouquets thrown to the poor.  We have had bouquets thrown to almost everybody and every thing but common sense.</P>

      <P>The Deputy shows strange wisdom&mdash;quite unaccustomed. It is up to us to decide what the result of this is going to be.  I am convinced that the introduction of this new principle into the administration of local government is going to mean several things; first, that the administration of local affairs is going to be submerged in national politics; secondly, that you are going to constitute county councils a type of body which it was never intended that they should be; and thirdly, and this is the gravest of all, I think you are going to set on foot a system of irresponsible extravagance with public funds, which I believe will eventually force the Minister for Local Government to come into this House and announce that, in order to save the whole system of local government in this country, he will have to do away with all the county councils.  For my part I would regret that.  I should like to see the democratic character we have in the county councils thrive and prosper.  I think that the steps that Fianna Fáil are taking are calculated to undermine it.  They do a great disservice to democracy and to this country, <Col N="59" /> and I believe they will expose their own Ministers, in due course, to as great humiliation as any Minister ever had to bear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that Deputy Kelly, who spoke from the Fianna Fáil Benches, is now present. In his speech he stated that he was elected on a board&mdash;either a board of guardians or a district council&mdash;in his own locality, when he was 21.  He expatiated on the very able and efficient manner in which he acquitted himself in that capacity.  That, needless to say, I am not going to question. I am sure that he is entitled to any credit which he claimed he was entitled to.  I should like to say, however, that in order that Deputy Kelly should be elected a member of a board of guardians or a district council, he had to have certain qualifications to entitle him to be elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I have no objection to young men being elected to local boards&mdash;none whatever&mdash;but I have decided objection to any man being placed in a position that would permit him to put his hand into the pocket of another man without having responsibility as to the manner in which money would be expended or otherwise.  If Deputy Kelly entered public life when he was 21, he had a responsibility to himself, because he was either a voter or was responsible for rates and had to have a rateable qualification.  That is the point on which, I think, every Deputy on this side of the House has dwelt; and I think it is a point that should be dwelt on.  It is not the question of years that matters but the sense of responsibility to himself in the first instance, and to the general public in the second instance.  This sense of responsibility is brought home more keenly by touching his pocket than in any other way.  I have never known any man who boasts very much about his patriotism to stand that test with a total disregard of consequences. Many quaver and begin to search their pockets to see how much it will cost.  In the matter of local administration you must try to realise what it is going to cost.  That is the one way in which you can bring properly before your mind what it means to be a public administrator. <Col N="61" /> You must set out to do your duty conscientiously to yourself and to your neighbour.  You must not take liberties with the moneys of the people.  You must not dive your hand into your neighbour's pockets, saying to yourself: &ldquo;This is costing me nothing.  I am not a ratepayer; I am a free-lance and I have no responsibility.  It is not going to cost me anything and, therefore, I can afford to be generous.&rdquo; Doubtless any man who is not going to pay can afford to be generous.</P>
    <P>That is a very substantial reason why irresponsible people should not have a say in public affairs.  I am opposed to this Bill, not from the point of view of the age of the people who will be allowed to vote, but because I fully appreciate the grave responsibility of public bodies.  This measure will permit irresponsible sections of the people to wield a big influence, and it is for that reason I hesitate to see it made operative.  We were told some months ago, and the statement was never contradicted, that we were going to have the local elections on the 23rd June.  Why have the Government decided to change their tactics?  I do not think it will be denied that Ministers and Deputies visited the country some four or six weeks ago and, while they were there, they ascertained the views of the people.  They realised then that a certain position had been created, a position which they had every right to fear.  The Minister for Justice visited my county, which I have represented for upwards of 20 years.  The county council there were just about to strike a rate when a message arrived informing them that conditions were going to be altered. The Cosgrave Government granted a sum of £750,000 as an agricultural grant towards the relief of rates.  Of that £750,000 this Government withdrew £448,000 at the last moment.</P>

      <P>The Government claims to be a large local ratepayer at the moment.  I am not concerned with that point of view at all; that does not affect the situation. Deputy Davis proceeds to argue whether it is right or wrong to withhold portion of the agricultural grant. That is clearly a thing we must not discuss at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>I really had no intention of discussing the agricultural grant.  I am merely proceeding to argue why an effort has been made to bring about this change in representation.  I am merely pointing out that in Mayo, as a result of the reduction made in the grant, an extra rate was necessitated to the extent of 1/4 in the pound.  I merely add, in that connection, that in such circumstances the Fianna Fáil Party could not with any confidence <Col N="63" /> have faced the people again.  I submit that that is not discussing the merits or demerits of the agricultural grant, but rather the action of the Government.  They created a certain situation and I suggest that they were afraid to face the people.  They want a change because, without that change, their efforts to convince the people would be futile.  If they go to the people now they will get the answer that they rightly deserve.</P>
      <P>On other occasions I have heard the commissioner system condemned.  I may be reminded that there was a commissioner appointed in Mayo.  I submit that the Minister opposite has appointed 36 commissioners to carry on the affairs in County Mayo.  He removed me by sealed order because I would not recognise his commissioners, nor would I recognise himself. As a matter of fact, any condemnation there was of commissioners came from this side of the House.  The Minister put 36 commissioners into County Mayo as against the one put there by Deputy Mulcahy.  I am sure the Minister is proud of that position.  I am sure he feels confident that by reason of such conduct he will be entitled to the goodwill of the people.  I say that the Minister's action has brought discredit to the administration of County Mayo.  We know what the rates are there to-day and what they were in 1928.  I say the change has brought about a peculiar alteration in the feelings of the people.  In 1928 we had a rate in Mayo of 3/2 and to-day we have a rate of 5/8.  What consequent improvement has there been in the administration?  What advance has been made in the way of local services? Does the Minister think the Mayo people are not taking note of all that? The people fully recognise that the Minister for Justice and another Deputy went down there quite recently in order to ascertain the feelings of the people.  They selected their candidates in the town of Ballina for the county council election, but two days afterwards we had the announcement postponing the elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the young men to whom I object.  If a young man is honest and <Col N="64" /> upright, I say every credit should be given to him, and I would have the greatest possible confidence in him. But, in addition to being intelligent, upright and honest he should have a sense of responsibility, and I contend that that will best be brought home to him through his own pocket.  The men who pay the piper ought to call the tune.</P>
    <P>So far as local administration is concerned this Bill is a false step.  I think the Minister will some day have reason to regret this legislation.  I think it is a Bill that will impose ultimately on the Minister the necessity of abolishing all local administration such as it is carried on to-day.  I will hesitate before giving my consent to a measure which will leave it open to people to be so irresponsible as to carry on public affairs recklessly and bring about the ruin of their neighbours because they are in the privileged position of being able to put their hands into their neighbours' pockets.  The Government have run away from the position they once took up.  When the ratepayers were deprived of £448,000 Fianna Fáil people felt they could not face the electors.  I say quite openly that the ratepayers were robbed of that money. At the last moment when the Estimates were made out on the basis that the agricultural grant would be the same this year as in previous years, the astounding announcement was made to them that they were going to be deprived of a big share of the agricultural grant.  I say they were deliberately robbed.</P>
    <P>I think the members of the Party opposite have the utmost audacity to imagine that they can approach the people with confidence after what the country has experienced since they undertook the administration of its affairs.  They never had the full confidence of the electors of Mayo.  They are under no false impression now. They know they will meet with an ignominious defeat and for that reason they thought it wise to take shelter and to seek some other method by which they will try to fool the people once more.  They are now appealing to the youth.  The youth <Col N="65" /> are all right if they get a fair deal and an honest deal.  If they are misled it is hard to blame the youth if they sometimes miscalculate and misunderstand things.  The Government may deceive the people for a while, but they will not deceive them all the time.  The day of reckoning will come and the people will throw them out. Never again will they receive the confidence of the electors, because they have bled them too well.</P>

The speech made in the debate we had here some days ago by Deputy Fitzgerald, who led the Opposition, was an excellent speech.  He did not want to encroach on the domain of politics.  He argued from a higher plane altogether.  He was followed by Deputy MacDermot, as representing the Centre Party, in a similar strain.  They were both excellent speeches, and I am sorry that the debate on this Bill has now descended to Party politics.  For that we must blame the Party opposite.  They introduced it.  They have not added much to the intellectual part of this debate by bringing politics in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of those who believe that every young man should have a vote and a wife.  Both combined would soon make him a responsible person. Some people add to that that he should also have a rifle.  I do not believe in rifles.  I do not wish to advocate them.  I am satisfied that if he had a wife, after a couple of months experience of matrimony he would not want a rifle.  He would then be a sensible man and may be a beaten man without the rifle at all.  I cannot understand how the Deputies opposite, having regard to what is happening at present, can argue against this Bill.  At present the county councils throughout the <Col N="66" /> country are defying the law and holding up the institutions of local government.  They do not care twopence about providing the workmen's wages or providing for the care of the blind, the lame or the destitute.  They say deliberately that they will refuse to strike a rate.</P>
    <P>Why would not the Fianna Fáil Government take steps to prevent that in the future?  They are doing that now by appealing to the responsible and proper portion of the electorate, the young people.  On their shoulders must the burden for the future government of this country rest.  They must be responsible for it. According to the arguments used here the old superstition, that the man who makes money and has money is the right man, seems to hold the field. We all know that old piece&mdash;I do not know whether it was a song or a poem or a catch cry, but it was about:</P>
    <P>God bless the Squire and his relations,</P>
    <P>And keep us in our proper stations;</P>
    <P>For we work with heart and we work with hand,</P>
    <P>To see that the Squire gets the fat of the land.</P>
    <P>That is the way some people talk about the responsibility of getting money and about other people having a right to put their hands in other people's pockets and get their money. How can it be argued by a sensible and intelligent man that young people should be allowed to vote to send in Deputies here as law-makers, but refused the right of voting for the local bodies, who are to administer these laws on the local councils?  That is a most illogical position to take up. If people are responsible for the making of the laws why not be responsible for the proper administration of the laws?  All this talk about the ratepayers&mdash;that only the man who hands out a cheque to the rate-collector is a ratepayer is all nonsense. There are no men or women earning their bread in this country who are not ratepayers.  The sooner the people opposite get that into their skulls the better.</P>

      <P>Well, may be they have no skulls.  Might I produce here the estimate for the Dublin Corporation? I brought it here for the purpose of this debate and for the purpose of keeping this debate outside politics. The two Deputies of whom I spoke tried to keep this outside politics, and they gave an excellent example.  Now this estimate for the Dublin Corporation is an estimate up to the 31st March, 1934.  I hope I am not out of order.  I see that An Leas-Cheann Comhairle is getting uneasy.</P>

      <P>Now this is the annual estimate of the Dublin Corporation, and the sum of £1,426,635 is required to carry on the City of Dublin for the next 12 months until the 31st March next.  That has to be met by amounts for the following services including finance and general purposes, public lavatories, markets, domestic water, public water, public lighting, paving cleansing, sewers and main drainage, housing, public health and tuberculosis, etc.  These are the principal services. It cannot possibly be argued that any young man or any young woman has no interest whatever in these services.  Do not the very circumstances of their lives intimately connect them with all these things, and are they to have no say and no responsibility for the proper carrying out of these services?  Let me turn for one second to one estimate. I will take the Housing Estimate.  The sum required is £90,331.  The receipts from the Dublin Corporation dwellings for this year are estimated to produce £229,353.  That is the sum that will probably astonish some of the Deputies here who, probably, are not aware of the extensive housing accommodation already provided by the Dublin Corporation.  Of course it is only very small in comparison with the tremendous demand that still exists for housing.  Young men and young women, the majority of the inhabitants of this city are compelled by the circumstances of their lives at the present moment to live in insanitary dwellings.  Can you say that it is possible for these men not to feel <Col N="68" /> certain responsibilities in connection with the poor and lowly, and the disgustingly dirty tenements in which they live, and that they will do nothing to help to get rid of these things?  Do you not know that they will?  Why not, therefore, give them the responsibility of it?</P>
      <P>I have heard frequent references here to associations of young men and names associated with them that I certainly would not associate with them.  I have heard the I.R.A. mentioned time and again.  I do not know many of them, but I know some of them, and I can say unhesitatingly that they are good citizens.  I know some women connected with certain associations and I know that they are excellent women doing the best of work in this city, as far as their influence and circumstances will allow. Suppose, for argument's sake, that I agreed with the statements I heard constantly made by Deputies when referring to these associations.  Would it not be a good day's work, if I agreed with them, to try and bring these men out of such associations, if they are dangerous, by giving certain responsibility to them, certain power to them, certain influence to them, so that they might become useful and good citizens in the future?  Will anybody gainsay that?  I am perfectly certain they will not.  This Bill goes a long way in that direction.  I do not suggest that these men will accept the Bill from that standpoint.  Many of them, unfortunately, believe that nothing good can come out of this legislative assembly. At any rate, let us make the effort to give them the responsibility of citizens, and to put upon their shoulders the duty of electing the right men to administer their city, their county, or their village, as the case may be.  Having done that, we shall have done good work.  Put aside your Party politics and consider the matter from that aspect, because if you do not, it can be said hereafter that an opportunity was offered here to help in that direction and that you refused it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a hundred other thoughts in my mind, but I am not going to take up any more time.  I have said enough.  Only Deputy Dillon is gone <Col N="69" /> out of the House, I would have paid him certain respects in connection with the statement he made, but I shall remember him on some other occasion. I am glad that the present Minister for Local Government has taken this opportunity of introducing this Bill. He has been long and honourably connected with the administration of the City of Dublin and, as he said himself, he took up that administration when a very young man.  I think he can safely say, with those associated with him, that he and they did their best to have a clean, economic administration in this city.  That is what the original Sinn Féin movement stood for and it was upon that programme that we were elected.  So far as our small numbers could go, we carried out that programme up to the last measure of it.  We did our work, and if the young men, who are now to receive the franchise as a result of this Bill, will take the example set them, they will, I believe, become as good, as responsible, and as patriotic citizens as the Minister.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly said that politics had been introduced to this debate from this side of the House.  I should like to remind the Deputy that politics were introduced into local councils by the Party to which he belongs, because they openly declared that it was their policy to get control of local government in this country, and it is because of that that this Bill is introduced.  Let us be quite clear on this.  The introduction of this Bill is purely a Fianna Fáil stunt.  We, who have been for years in public life and taken part in public administration know what is the move behind the Bill.  A Deputy from this side of the House has stated that the Fianna Fáil Party were not sure of their ground in facing the country at the coming election.  The elections have been postponed.  Why were they postponed?  They were due to take place in June.  There has been no disturbance in the country which would prevent a fair and honest election.  To my mind, the writing is on the wall, and this Bill is introduced to give the vote to young men and young women, <Col N="70" /> because the Government hope that they can again deceive the youth of the country and get control of the local boards, as they have got control in this House.  I wonder why there is all this concern that the young men and young girls of 21 should have the vote.  Have not the parents of these people the vote, and are not the youth in safe hands while their parents have the vote and the controlling power to elect people to the local bodies?  No case has been made for the Bill.  It cannot be compared in any way with giving votes to people to elect Deputies.  The point has been made over and over again that people with the vote require to have some sense of responsibility in the spending of the rates.  As a member of a public board for years, I know that it is people of mature age and good training that are the most useful on the different public boards in spending the money of the ratepayers.  We should try and keep politics out of matters of this kind.  To my mind, there is nothing behind this Bill except a Fianna Fáil political stunt to try to get into power again by giving votes to youthful people whom they hope they can deceive at the coming elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting this Bill because I believe that the one safeguard there is for the preservation of democratic government is the extension to the widest possible number of people of every possible democratic right.  My only regret in the matter is that such a well-known and life-long democrat as the Minister for Local Government should have been given the unpleasant task of introducing this Bill in circumstances which suggest, to me at all events, that it is rather democracy by expediency.  I would have supported the introduction of this measure 12 months ago.  My only regret is that the Executive Council left it too late, almost on the eve of the local elections, to introduce it, because I think that suggests that the Government, in connection with the local elections, have been got on the run, and that this Bill is introduced for the purpose, as it were, of stemming the rout.  Whether that is the <Col N="71" /> purpose or not, I am satisfied that the principle enshrined in the Bill is a sound one.  Even if there were no local elections, I would be prepared to support the principle of the Bill, and even be prepared to see, under this Bill, Fianna Fáil secure the monopoly of representation on the local authorities, rather than see some of the people who are on these bodies to-day control them in the manner in which they are controlling them to-day.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Dillon has left the House.  I do not know, though I listened to his speech carefully, whether he was talking on behalf of the political patriarchs of other years, or whether he was still representing the squires for whom I am afraid the Centre Party stand.  The one clear thing about Deputy Dillon's speech was that it was a 100 years out of date.  The same kind of speech as was made by Deputy Dillon and repeated by Deputy Davis, was made against the Reform Bill of 1832.  If Deputy Davis takes the trouble to look the matter up or if some historian in his Party will spare him the trouble he will see that that is so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy knew very much about it he did not display his knowledge in his speech.  It would appear that he has fears for the ratepayers. The same kind of speech was made over a 100 years ago and as the fears entertained over a 100 years ago proved to be groundless, so will the fears expressed to-day prove to be equally groundless.  With regard to Deputy Batt O'Connor, his plea for the disfranchisement of certain classes of the people passes my comprehension unless we are to witness a sudden tearing up of some of the decent principles of the old Sinn Fein Party.  Deputy Dillon and Deputy Davis made speeches in support of principles which were swept away in 1832.  If this Bill gives into the hands of the plain people, not merely those endowed with wealth, but those who have no wealth, a controlling voice in local administration I believe <Col N="72" /> it will do for this country a very useful thing in the development of democracy.</P>
      <P>If one were not a supporter of this Bill, one would find it difficult to oppose it because of the speeches made in opposition to it.  Not a single point of any substance has been urged in opposition to this Bill.  Deputy Davis talked of 36 commissioners in Mayo as distinct from the one appointed by his own Government when in power. Deputy Dillon's speech was one long display of dramatic nonsense from beginning to end; he talked of federalism as being the end of this Bill.  Did anyone ever hear such nonsense? If people can elect T.D.s by universal franchise why should not people get a voice in municipal affairs? How that affords a ground for raising a question of federalism is more than I can understand.  The simple position is the Executive Council of this country seeks to give to every man and woman over 21 years of age&mdash;and that does not mean merely people of 21 years of age but people twice and three times that age&mdash;the right to elect people to the local bodies the same as they have the right to elect representatives to this Dáil.  The present position is an absolute farce.  Persons of 21 years of age, or persons disqualified under the Local Government Act because they have no property qualifications, can elect this Dáil.  They can elect a Minister for Finance who spends 31 million pounds per year; yet this Legislature, up to the present, has set a bar to these same persons electing a man for a seat upon town commissioners where they may not spend £100 per annum.  It is all right to allow them to elect to this Dáil a Minister for Local Government, but it would be ruinous to allow them to elect town commissioners who may have to spend £100 a year, though it is the height of sanity to allow the same elector to elect a Minister for Finance to this House who has the spending, as I said, of 31 million pounds per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the present differentiation is clearly illogical.  It has no foundation in reason or in justice.  It was inherited in this country from an alien administration which could do nothing right.  Deputy Batt <Col N="73" /> O'Connor referred to a democratic Government's desire to set up a democratic machine.  But he would be in favour of giving the vote to even the most unworthy citizen in the land, to the worst political filibusterer or to the most discreditable ward heeler, but would not give to a decent, honest, clean citizen the right to vote unless that citizen was endowed with the property qualification, and it would not matter at all where or how he got that property qualification.  It did not matter though such a person might be of the most unscrupulous character, and might have misappropriated the moneys and the property he acquired so long as he did so secretly; once he had such property he becomes a local squire entitled to vote for local bodies.  The clean, decent, honest citizen, who works hard for a living, but has no property, must have no vote or right to vote for local representatives in the country although he may have a cleaner, more noble and more honest interest in local administration than the squire who is well endowed with the world's goods. If there is to be any test for a vote it surely should be on the basis of the worthiness of the person and of the individual's trustworthiness as a citizen and the manner in which he conducts himself as a citizen; that kind of test apparently would be inconceivable to some people.  But the idea of taking property as the only qualification of giving a vote is something that a democratic Government and democratic State should never stand for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that once this Bill is passed it means the coming of bad government again.  Unless people have bank balances or some property they must stand down, and allow the local squire to legislate for them.  The principle enshrined there embodies much of the philosophy of byegone ages and years.  In this age I would not like to find myself in the Division Lobby with the Parties opposite in order to maintain that the right system of voting is right based upon property and denying to decent, honest people who have no property any voice in the local administration of the country or any say as to who should <Col N="74" /> guide the destinies of local administration. Not a single member of the Party opposite gave one convincing reason why this Bill should not be accepted.  It gives the farmers' sons the right to vote; it gives the squire's son the right to vote, it also gives the sons of brewers and bankers and some other people who support Cumann na nGaedheal the right to vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not as good for them as the tenement dweller to have the right to vote?  There is only one explanation of the attitude of the Party opposite in regard to this Bill, and that is that they depend for support on people with a bank balance, and they believe that politically they are right in keeping the vote tied down to people with bank balances.  That is the reason they are opposed to this Bill.  That is the reason why they want to maintain in this country an outworn system of political representation that ought to find no place in a democratic State.  I concede them a perfect understanding of their political position in the matter, but let them frankly say: &ldquo;We believe that the passage of this Bill will attenuate our representation on the local authorities.&rdquo;  That is clearly in the mind of everyone who spoke in opposition to this Bill, and their opposition is understandable. They should say that, and not try to buttress up opposition to this Bill by using democracy as an argument against it, or by pretending to shed crocodile tears over the fate of the ratepayers whose interests are affected by it.  Deputy Davis said his great fear&mdash;and his voice seemed to portray his fear&mdash;was that youth would ruin the local administration of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>I said nothing of the kind. I said I was not afraid of young men, but that young men should have a sense of responsibility.  Deputy Kelly, from your side of the House, said that he was elected at 21 years of age, and I said that to be elected then he should have certain qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That phrase will do just as well&mdash;young men should have a <Col N="75" /> sense of responsibility.  How many young men are on the Cork County Council to-day?  What about the wrecking tactics that are going on in the Cork County Council?  Is it the young men who are doing that?  Was it the young men who threw 3,000 road workers out in the past fortnight? There was no responsibility there, only blind prejudice against the Government in power, an attempt to wreck local administration, and an attempt to carry on their wrecking by applying pressure to the people who would feel economic pressure most.</P>
      <P>I am supporting this Bill because I believe it is a democratic measure; because I believe a democratic Government will only be saved by the fusion of responsibility, and by the extension of democracy.  I suggest to Deputy Davis, and even to Deputy Dillon, that when the next generation comes to read their speeches on this Bill they will have just as much contempt for them as those who to-day read the speeches that were delivered in opposition to the Reform Bill of 1832.</P>

I have heard other members of the Opposition say that there was no trust to be placed in greybeards.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that possibly Deputy MacDermot had that in mind, and that certainly one other member of his Party did speak in that strain. In answer to that one argument I have only to point to the administration of Deputy Curran's own local authority.  As he reminded us himself that local authority has had to be abolished more than once by the Minister for Local Government. From my own personal experience, I am satisfied that it will make for better, cleaner and more just administration to have the franchise on the same basis as for the Dáil elections. That is the result of my personal experience on local authorities.  I do honestly believe that we will get more efficient, more just, cleaner and less extravagant administration from a body on which there will be a good proportion of younger men.  They will come in with higher ideals; they will come in with a greater ambition to do the just, right, and proper thing than you will find as a rule in the majority of local authorities to-day. That is my belief from my own personal knowledge of the administration of local boards, which has been enhanced and increased by the experience I have had of local government administration from the Chair of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health during the last 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to recent experience of administration by and under the bodies elected under the old franchise.  We have had bodies, as he suggested, like the Cork County Council and the Dublin County Council, elected on the old franchise, with some young men, but a big majority of old men, acting in the most extravagant and irresponsible way.  These are only two, but there are many other examples.  There is no rule on which one could say that the local authorities will be best managed, will be most economically and justly managed if you keep out the men who are not and were not capable of being on the present Register.  I am quite satisfied, as I <Col N="77" /> have said, and as I should like to repeat, that, with the type of men we should and will get in on a revised and amended franchise such as we suggest, local administration will be cleaner, better, and more efficient and less extravagant.</P>
    <P>My experience has been that many of these councils, while preaching economy and talking of extravagant rates&mdash;I don't agree that the rates are extravagant at all; Deputy MacDermot said they were altogether too high, but I do not agree&mdash;mean economy by somebody else, economy by another authority, but when it comes to individual cases put up to themselves very frequently you will find them the most extravagant people.  There was scarcely a day in the week on which the Ministry of Local Government had not to check extravagance of one kind or another when certain propositions were put up to us by the bodies elected on this old franchise.  There is not a day in the week on which we have not to watch carefully over them, and check their extravagance.  I do not think I need argue that extravagance does not make for efficiency. There is extravagance in administration, and I believe we can have less of it under the type of councils that will be elected under the new franchise.</P>
    <P>If I have any one apology or excuse to make to the House it is that this Bill was not introduced a year ago.  I am responsible for the delay.  I got instructions to have this Bill prepared, I will not say exactly a year ago, but in or about that.  I had so many other things on hands that I did not have an opportunity of attending to it.  It is my fault and I willingly admit it.  The introduction of the Bill at this stage gives it the appearance of being brought in merely for the purpose of the local elections.  The delay is something for which I owe an apology to the House.</P>

      <P>There is another point that was stressed by Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald. I do not know that it has much connection with the Bill, but he talked about the preaching of Communism in these days and our idea of a Christian State and of upholding the Christian ideal.  As I say, I do not know that we can talk about Communism in connection with this Bill at all, but I do agree to this extent, and I agree with Deputy Norton, too, where he said that one good thing would be to spread the responsibility as widely as possible, that it will have a very steadying effect on the young people of to-day who are inclined &mdash; some of them, not a very great number &mdash;to lean towards extreme views and extreme measures such as we could not approve of.  I do think that giving responsibility and placing it upon the shoulders of these people, who may be made members of local authorities if this Bill passes, will have the best possible effect even from the point of view of upholding the Christian ideal and the Christian state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have faith in the young people.  I believe that they are no less Christian than their elders and I am not a bit unhappy about the effects of this, nor am I a bit nervous about inviting a very big proportion or as many of the people of the country who will have the votes, old and young, to elect as many of the younger people as they wish to have.  I think that the younger the members of the local authorities will be the more efficient and more effective they will be and the better the administration of the local authorities will be.  I remember&mdash;Deputy Tom Kelly reminded me of it to-day &mdash; the first meeting of a local authority I ever attended.  It was a committee of the Dublin Corporation and when I went in every man, I think, with one exception, of the committee wore a very long beard.  You do not see many of them nowadays but certainly, in 1906, out of ten members of that committee nine of them wore very long beards and when I walked in they wondered what had happened.  They <Col N="79" /> wondered how a person looking so young, at any rate, could have been allowed in as a member of such a council. They asked the secretary how I got in, and when he told them who I was and introduced me, I was invited to sit down; but God help me if I attempted to make any suggestion&mdash;I was ready to be torn asunder.  After a short period I discovered that these greybeards&mdash;they were not all greybeards but their beards were long&mdash;I had, to my mind, very little idea of the duty that devolved upon them to spend public money as they would their own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it was the Dublin Corporation of 27 years ago. They were not so, ten or 12 years ago. My idea, and what I should like to impress upon everybody who may be a member of a local authority, is that it is the duty of every individual member of a local authority to be more careful and more conscientious in dealing with public money than he would be in dealing with his own money.  I think you will get more of that ideal and of that conscientiousness among the youth&mdash;I do not say the boys and girls&mdash;than among those who have grown too old in the service of local authorities.  I do not say that that is true of all the old men.  Some of them I know, personally, in different counties who have given magnificent service, perhaps, for over 50 years.  But it seems to me that to-day there seems to be a laxity on these boards when it is a question of dealing with public funds.  I am sorry to say that during the year and a half I have been in office there is not a week in the year that I have not had to dismiss some public official.  It is a very difficult thing for a Minister to have to dismiss an official who has sometimes been 30 years and more in office and with big family responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>For a variety of reasons, but mostly because they were <Col N="80" /> dealing with public funds as they would not deal with their own.  I am determined to stop that at whatever cost, and I think I will be helped in stopping looseness in administration, by members as well as by officials, by introducing new blood and a younger element into our public boards.  It is in that belief and in that conviction that I am certainly strongly in favour of the passing of this Bill.  I think that the results will be, not the sad prophecies made by Deputy Davis and other speakers of the calamities and disastrous things that will happen, but that in three or four years' time, when we come to judge the results, we will see that it has made for efficient and careful administration rather than for extravagance.  It is in that confident belief that I ask the House to pass this measure.</P>

      <P>Might I put one or two questions to the Minister?  I am putting them in good faith.  I have sympathy with what Deputy Norton said, and I thoroughly believe in bringing youth into public affairs, but I would ask is it not true that adult suffrage has proved a financial failure of very great magnitude&mdash;Parliamentary adult suffrage everywhere.  I suppose that Deputy Norton would say that anyone who opposed it is an old fogey and would be laughed at, but I think it will be admitted that so far as national finances are concerned it has been a failure, and I should like to know whether there is any reason to believe that adult suffrage for local authorities will not lead to similar extravagance.  Again as regards youth, is it not quite possible to get young people on county councils as things stand at present?  There are plenty of young people qualified to be on these boards and why cannot they...</P>

      <P>It is not a question of money.  There are at least two big questions of political philosophy being discussed these days&mdash;dictatorship on the one side and democracy on the <Col N="82" /> other.  During the last 18 months there has hardly been a week in which I have not been discussing this matter with two friends of mine.  One is a Frenchman very hostile to democracy, but still no lover of Mussolini.  Another is a clergyman who takes an interest in these matters from the opposite point of view. Accordingly, I think that I am fairly well qualified to discuss it, but I do not think it is on all-fours with the question of adult suffrage.  First of all, it must be remembered that there is a restriction on the local authority. There is an authority above the local authority and an authority that can and does control their expenditure of local finance.</P>

      <P>I beg to move: &mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill is consequential on the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act, 1933.  That Act made certain amendments in the Constitution, and the purpose of this Bill is to make in the electoral law certain necessary amendments and repeals without which the electoral law would be inconsistent with the Constitution as now amended.  With regard to the deposit of £100 made by a candidate as part of his nomination at a Dáil election, if he is elected he has proved definitely that he was a bona fide candidate.  In such a case the deposit will be returned as soon as practicable after the result of the election is declared.  As there is no longer an oath prescribed by the Constitution, taking the oath is not a condition precedent to a candidate taking a seat in the House, and the reservation to that effect is now removed from the Electoral Act.  It is not necessary to make any further provision in the electoral law as regards taking a seat in the House, since each House of the Oireachtas has power under Article 20 of the Constitution to make its own Standing Orders.  For the orderly transaction of business each member must comply with Standing Orders, and taking a seat in the House is part of the ordinary business.  The proposed alteration in the terms of Sections 51 and 57 of the Electoral Act of 1923 is merely declaratory of the powers of the House, and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will no doubt consider whether the existing Standing Orders will require any alteration.  I move the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>This measure is designed to amend an Act which might be described as the Enfranchisement of the Fianna Fáil Party, as I believe it had some responsibility for introducing them into this House.  The real fault in this measure, as far as the Dáil is concerned, is in Section 2, which may be said to perpetuate absenteeism because of a member having been elected who may still decline to enter the House and no penalty is attached to that position.  I think that Section 2 might reasonably be amended to provide for the payment of the deposit when a member takes his seat.  That completes the transaction. The only thing that might be said in respect of that is that as illness sometimes delays a person taking his seat provision might be made for that. But as it stands, the Standing Orders, as the Minister says, can make regulations in respect of how members should take their seats and so forth.  The Bill was originally intended to ensure that this House would be fully representative <Col N="85" /> of persons returned to it.  We will revert to the position in which we were before the original Act was passed if Section 2, as it is drawn in the Bill, is allowed to stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was before the House during its previous stages we pressed for more information than the Minister had given, and we were anxious that, on this Stage, he should give us some information which he had not given on the previous stages.  It was also pointed out that there were very essential features in connection with the Bill, and in connection with matters that arise out of it, on which more information should be given to the House.  The first item was that of the cost of cement.  It is not necessary to stress at this stage the importance of cost in an item that is so largely used in one of our largest industries. The Minister might say in the early stages that he had not got a definite figure, but he told the House when this Bill was last before us that he had offers in his Department and that he only required the sanction of the House to this Bill to put these different agreements into force.  Knowing the Minister as I do, I am quite satisfied that he has inquired into the question of costs very fully and that he has had these particular items under consideration in his Department.  But we have not had from the Minister, on any stage of the Bill, a figure as to what he anticipated the cost of manufacturing cement in this country would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope now in view of the notice the Minister has had on previous stages that he will give us that figure.  It is essential we should have it.  The next item we stressed during the previous stages was the number of hands that would get employment under this particular scheme.  It is hardly necessary to recall that on Second Reading, when the Minister was overflowing with optimism about this scheme, he told us that between the two works intended to be set up <Col N="88" /> under the Bill, with an output of 100,000 tons per annum it was anticipated that 500 hands would get employment in each of the works; in other words 1,000 hands would be employed.  When the Bill was last before the House the Minister was not at all so optimistic; that figure of 1,000 had shrunk to 500.  We pointed that out, but he could give no explanation.  It is very important to know the number of hands that will get employment. I have gone to some trouble to find the number of hands employed in an ordinary cement works with an output of 100,000 tons per annum. I find the figure is, taking the average, 120 employees.  I presume the works to be erected here will be works of the most modern machinery in them.  Taking two of these works, employing 120 hands in each we get a total of 240 employees so that we have the 1,000 on Second Reading reduced to 500 by the Minister, voluntarily, during the last stages of the Bill, and now, when we come to probe the matter we find the real number will be 240.</P>
    <P>Let us dwell upon that figure.  The Minister can contradict that figure by revealing the information in his Department.  Let us dwell, as I say, for a moment upon that figure.  I put forward on Second Reading the argument that the probable additional cost of cement manufacture in this state would be an average of 20/- per ton.  We pressed the Minister very strongly to find out exactly what the cost would be.  He gave general figures round about 40/-, but he would not give any definite figure.  I then went as high as 45/-.  I am not sure but I think he told us it would not be higher than anything on the other side.  I find the price of cement at present in Liverpool is 45/- per ton. We can get cement of good quality delivered in Dublin for little over 25/- per ton.  That means that if we have to pay the price current on the other side we are going to have an increase of 20/-.  Take it even at the figure of 10/-, if we work out employment for 240 people at an increased cost to the State of 10/- per ton it <Col N="89" /> works out that each employee will cost the State £416 10/- per annum. That is a magnificent scheme&mdash; £416 10/- per annum for each employee.</P>
    <P>As I said on a previous occasion, I am as anxious as any Deputy in this House that Irish industry should be developed but we can pay too high a price for industry and I think this is one of the cases in which we are called upon by the Minister to pay a figure which is too high.  Possibly he will give the reason as to why we did not get this figure on previous stages.  But there is a figure I would like the Minister to deal with.  I am taking the extra cost of cement at 10/- per ton, I am taking the number of employees turning out of the most modern up-to-date works employing 240 men, and that works out, the Minister will find, at a cost under the scheme of £416 per annum to the State.</P>
    <P>There is another point stressed at previous stages and that was that one of the most urgent problems of the State at the moment is the need that exists for housing.  In other words that need is equally urgent.  The Minister for Local Government told us that it is the intention of the Government to spend sums running to some four or five millions per annum for some years in order to deal with this important problem.  Now we know the most important item in modern housing is cement.  90 per cent. of the houses erected are built with cement so, therefore, it is very essential at a crisis like the present we should know exactly, when we are going to limit this house building to the use of cement manufactured in the State, what that will cost.  According to the figures given to me, and they quite agree with the Minister's figure which he gave on Second Reading, the cost will run into something like 3d. per week per house, taking the average house.  The people who will pay for the industry will be the unfortunate people who will pay the rent for these dwellings.  That is a very important matter.  I am anxious to see industries started here but we must scrutinise things carefully particularly <Col N="90" /> an industry that is to have such influence upon the cost of houses. We find objection made to the high cost of houses and it is notorious that the cost of housing in this country is much higher than it ought to be. Therefore we should be careful not to throw any increased burden upon the people or to increase the cost of rent unless we see that some advantage is going to result from the increased cost.  No advantage is going to result from this particular proposal of the Minister.  I again stress the fact that we are entitled to the figures we asked for on the different stages of the Bill. I cannot understand the cause or the reason for the withholding of this information which I am sure is in the Minister's hands or those of his officials.  I think that information ought to be given to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Good has stressed the question of the cost of cement.  I would like to stress the question of cost from an entirely different angle namely of quality. When this Bill was in the Committee Stage I urged upon the Minister that in regard to Section 12 (h) &ldquo;the nature and quality of the cement manufactured by such factory,&rdquo; he ought to bind himself that the quality would not be below the latest standard specification.  I should like to urge on him to put some such safeguard as that in the Bill, because cement is a very difficult and intricate manufacture. While there are a number of works manufacturing cement of the very highest quality they have only got to that pitch by the most ceaseless care and attention to every stage of the manufacture.  There may be a certain amount of pressure, as every cement works is in an experimental stage, brought to bear on the Minister to allow cement which is not up to what it should be to be put on the market. I should like this House to remember that if one batch of cement that is not right is put on the market, people will not forget it for a quarter of a century, and in the interest of everybody the Minister cannot be too stringent in specifying that the cement should be the very best. <Col N="91" /> Another point that I should like to put before the Minister is that in regard to the people who come in here to put up buildings or works it is desirable that they should be protected, and should not be compelled to use cement which they may have a suspicion of, or which is not up to standard.  It would be very desirable if people who are coming in here to do certain works and put up certain factories were assured in advance, by being able to see it from the legislation, that the cement here could not be turned out below the very best standard.  We here have been accustomed to such good cement over such a long period that we are rather inclined to under-estimate the effects that will be produced in this country if we do not maintain our reputation, and, if the people lose confidence in the buildings that are put up here.  I cannot too strongly urge that on the Minister, and I should like to ask him to consider that it would be in everybody's interest that such a proviso should be inserted in the Bill.  He no doubt can envisage the position that if once people become suspicious about the cement they are asked to use in this country they will not care what price they pay to bring it in from abroad.  From that point of view, I would again urge on the Minister to consider the question of inserting such a proviso in the Bill, so as to make it compulsory that cement will not be put on the market unless it is up to the very highest standard.</P>

      <P>I was very curious to hear the points upon which Deputy Good wanted information.  I am naturally anxious to facilitate the Deputies in relation to any matters I am responsible for, and consequently I listened to him with great care.  He wants to know what it is going to cost to manufacture cement here.  My first answer is I do not know, and my second is that if I did I would not tell him.  I do not mean to be discourteous in the least.  There is a Bill before the Dáil which gives us power to license people to manufacture <Col N="92" /> cement here.  I explained in the Bill that we were going to ask every person interested in the manufacture of cement here to submit their proposals to us when this Bill became law, indicating the nature of the industry they proposed to establish, the price at which they thought they could produce cement, and the price at which they were prepared to guarantee to sell cement.  We will give a licence to the people who put forward the most attractive proposition. Obviously it would be most undesirable that I should give any indication here as to the price which I might regard as a satisfactory one, or the cost of production I might consider to be practical, while those applications are pending, and in that way as it were to limit the full competition that is open at present to the different parties interested.  It is most undesirable that I should do that.  I said here in the Dáil that, from the applications I had already received from reputable firms, I had every reason to believe that even if we accepted the most unfavourable offer from our point of view the price of cement here would not be as high as it is at present in Great Britain.  Deputy Good said: &ldquo;Cement in Liverpool is 45/-; we can buy cement at 25/-; that is too high a price to pay for an industry in any country.&rdquo;  It is possibly to be regretted that there is not in the British Parliament a Deputy Good to explain that matter to the British Government.  Why do not the British people shut down their cement industry and proceed to buy from Belgium, Denmark, and the other countries that are willing to supply them with cement at the same price we can get it from those continental countries?  Is there some wisdom in our remaining dependent on that supply of cement that does not apply in Great Britain?  Surely if the arguments that justify us in failing to develop our own resources, and remaining dependent on those external sources of supply, have any weight in them they apply in Great Britain as much as they apply here.  The cost of housing is an important consideration. The Deputy said that cement is the <Col N="93" /> most important single item in the cost of housing.  The British people must be very foolish to maintain housing costs so much higher than they are here at the moment.  Does the Deputy agree with me on that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If cement here were at the same price as in Great Britain a larger number of houses would be built of bricks.  In so far as cement is the most important single item in the cost of housing is it true to say that housing costs are higher here than in Great Britain?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true despite the fact that cement here is only half the price it is in Great Britain?  The Deputy cannot have it both ways. The cost of cement cannot be the most important single item in the cost of housing if despite cheap cement we cannot build houses here as cheaply as they can build them in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister, but he is not comparing like with like.  Houses are built on the other side with bricks; in Northern Ireland they are built with bricks; in the Free State practically every house is built of cement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But if they could get cement in Great Britain as cheaply as we can get it here they would build them with cement too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases there are cheap bricks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason they are building houses with bricks is because cement is not as cheap as it is here.  If cement were as dear here as it is in Great Britain we would be building houses in brick too.  Building houses in brick is another reason why housing in Great Britain should <Col N="94" /> cost as much as it costs here, whereas it costs less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Because if you increase the price of cement you increase the price of the house.  If you build it with brick, which is practically as dear as cement, that would increase the price also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is logic I cannot follow.  The Deputy says we can buy cement at 25/-; in Liverpool it is 45/-; cement is the most important single item in the cost of a house, and yet houses in England are cheaper than they are here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to ask Deputy Good that.  But at what price can we buy British cement here?  Is it 45/- here?  It is a lot less than 45/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  The British, who are charging their own people in Liverpool 45/- are willing to sell to us at a lot less and, no doubt, we will continue to enjoy that advantage as long as the British are foolish enough to do it; but on the day that they decide that it is a game not worth the candle, or that they enter into an arrangement with the Belgians or the Danes or others to ensure that an economic price is going to prevail in this market, we lose these advantages and we do not get the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>We have enjoyed these advantages for the last 50 years, and <Col N="95" /> the probability is that, if the Minister did not interfere, we would continue to enjoy them still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I think that the probabilities are the other way round.  I think the most reasonable assumption is that the period of the present advantages is a very limited one.  Many attempts have been made in the quite recent past to get an arrangement in this market between the various cement producers.  If the Deputy asks me what will be the difference in the price of Irish-made cement and the price of the imported cement I can only say that I do not know, because there is no saying what we may have to pay for it in future.  Admittedly, we are getting it now at a price less than the cost of manufacture. There is not an importer who will not admit that he is selling it at a loss but we have no guarantee that in 18 months' time the same conditions will hold.  In fact, the production of Irish-made cement may mean a reduction in the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good also talks about employment, and insists that it is important to know exactly the number of people who will be employed.  I do not know that it is of the least importance.  The Deputy said that there are 120 employees engaged in a modern cement works producing 100,000 tons of cement. I want to ask him so many questions about that 120 that I do not know where to start.  Does he include in that figure the men who are engaged in quarrying, or does he include those engaged in packing?  Does he include those working in the mill itself?  Does he include the clerical staff or the sales staff?  According as he brings one other additional class of workers in I will get a different figure for the total number to be employed.  I think that the most important figure of all is the £400,000 which, in each year, goes abroad and which, as a result of this project, will be almost entirely kept in the country and circulating here, available for the purchase of Irish produce, giving increased employment <Col N="96" /> and making for increased prosperity generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going to pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell said that the important thing was the quality of the cement.  There is no question about that, but there is no reason why we should impose upon ourselves a self-denying ordinance that no other country imposes upon itself. Deputy Dockrell says that no cement of a quality lower than the best possible cement should be allowed to be manufactured here.  Other countries do not do that.  We are going to make it a condition upon the firms engaged in the manufacture of cement here that they will sell cement of the specified quality at the guaranteed price; and the specified quality will be the best we can get.  I have no reason to anticipate that it will be as low as, certainly not lower than, the current British specification. But there is no reason why we should bind ourselves to produce no cheaper quality cement if, as is quite practicable, the production of a cheaper cement may follow as a by-product of another industry that might be established.  If people want to buy the lower grade at the lower cost there is no reason why we should stop them, provided that they know what they are buying.  Our intention is to get 200,000 tons of best quality cement produced here at a guaranteed maximum price, and to have that cement available at that quality and at that price for a definite period in the country.  The quality of the cement will be as good as that of the cement now being imported, and the price will be lower than the price is now in the country supplying it.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether he is persisting in placing the tariff on cement between now and the time the cement is produced here?

      <P>On the Schedule I should like to make a few remarks about No. 2, dry batteries and component parts.  I think that this Schedule serves to illustrate what is happening in a very large degree at the present time.  In my opinion, unless the Government takes steps to remedy the matter, the Irish industries <Col N="101" /> will get the blame of a lot of charges that really cannot be laid at their door.  The Minister or the Government has put a duty on dry batteries. The Minister has not told us what the import of dry batteries into this country is and what the potential power of manufacture in this country is at the moment, and how far the local manufacturers are prepared to cope with the demand.  I think it is very essential at the present time that the country should be informed as to what is being manufactured by the Irish manufacturers and where there is a duty put on to help them; the rest of the items, where it is not a question of raising revenue, should be allowed in free.</P>
      <P>The Press of last Saturday started by describing the introduction of those items in words to this effect:&mdash;&ldquo;Additional duties to protect infant industries.&rdquo; I am not at all sure that the infants have yet been born, but if they have, there is no reason why the Minister should not tell us who is going to make the torch batteries; who is going to make the wireless batteries, who is going to make the cycle lamp batteries and who is going to make the bell batteries?  I do not see why the Minister should not announce that he has been able to make arrangements for the manufacture of the whole cycle of dry batteries.  The distributors of these items, in my opinion, ought to be informed as to the potential supplies that they can expect from the manufacturers.  The Minister ought then quite frankly to say if Irish manufacturers are only prepared to deal with certain items; that the rest are going to be admitted free, and that the Government are prepared to give a licence for the importation of these items free of duty.</P>

    <P>I do not know why there should be this secrecy about the manufacturers who apparently are able to supply the needs of this country.  The Minister may as well give them an advertisement and if the trade who distribute these goods are in ignorance of what is going on, what can he expect of the general public?  I submit to the Minister that it would be very desirable to have some such statement as <Col N="102" /> that made publicly, and I should like to ask the Minister what are the potential sources from which these batteries mentioned&mdash;torch batteries, wireless batteries, cycle lamp and bell batteries and a whole lot of others&mdash;can be obtained?  I think the whole field should be covered by the Minister, and he should announce publicly how much of that field is going to be covered by the Irish manufacturers and what is the policy of the Government towards the rest of the batteries not covered by the existing production.  The remarks I have made on these batteries might very well be applied to a whole lot of other items on which the Government are putting duties, and I would ask in the interest of Irish manufacturers that a frank announcement should be made as to what section of this trade is going to be covered by the Irish manufacturers and what is the policy of the Government towards the rest of the people.</P>

      <P>I cannot give any precise figures concerning the imports of dry batteries and cells into this country, as they have not been shown separately in the official import list heretofore.  Only estimates which may be right or which may be wrong have been prepared as to the annual consumption of these goods here. Certain estimates were prepared by firms interested in the production of the goods for the market.  There are at present only a number of small firms engaged in the manufacture of these dry batteries, the principal one of which is probably the Waterford Electric and Chemical Works, Limited.  There are one or two in Dublin, one in Ballina, I think, and one or two others throughout the country.  A large scale production of dry batteries of all kinds, however, is about to be commenced by an old established Irish firm.  The intention is to permit a limited importation free of duty until production has started on the larger scale contemplated in the new works.  It is necessary to do that because, of course, one decent-sized cargo of dry batteries would flood this market for a couple of years and we cannot afford to take the risk of <Col N="103" /> having the whole prospect of establishing the industry here destroyed by allowing notice of the intention to get out in advance and imports to take place before the duties are imposed.  Consequently the duty is imposed at this stage.  It will be of direct benefit to the small works to which I have referred, and facilitate the establishment of the larger works in contemplation.  When these works have been established, the full range of dry batteries required and enumerated by the Deputy will all be produced here.</P>

      <P>Speaking here on last Friday night on this amendment, I endeavoured to convince&mdash;I do not know with what measure of success &mdash; the Minister for Finance, that in the case of the teachers the Minister's own reputation is involved in this cut.  I said then, and lest it has escaped the Minister's attention, I might repeat it in perhaps more tabloid form, that the Minister, while in Opposition, displayed a virility and progressiveness of view that has not marked his advent to the Front Bench.  When the teachers' <Col N="104" /> organisation entered into negotiations with the last Government and accepted a certain kind of bargain, a bargain which, in my opinion, was better than the bargain contained in this section, because it made provision for the settlement of the pensions question, which is left completely untouched in this Bill, the present Minister for Finance, with all the freedom and licence of an individual Deputy, denounced that settlement, lock, stock and barrel.  With that eloquence which I have felt bound to comment upon on other amendments in this House, and with that facility of pen which distinguishes his literary contributions to the Press, the Minister, if one might say so, almost wrote himself away, advising the teachers not to take this ruinous settlement.  The Minister's eloquence on that matter, both in the spoken and the written word, was no less eminent and no less worthy of admiration than many of the eloquent speeches which he delivered on the first series of amendments to this Bill, which resulted in its taking a few days to get the Bill through the House.  The Minister, at all events, is committed in this matter.  I think he admitted on an earlier amendment that he did write these letters to the Press.  I invited him to extend that pastime of his of reading letters from files by reading the very interesting letters which he then wrote to the Press in support of the opposition of certain teachers to the cut.  The Minister has not yet seen fit to adopt that experiment.  I suggest to the Minister that he might bring the letters in and read them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could import much more fervour and soul into his letters than I could, and I must let him be the reader of his own letters.  He is so fond of reading others, he ought to have the chance of reading some of his own.  At all events, the Minister then denounced the settlement.  I think, in many respects, the Minister was right in his denunciation of the settlement.  The Minister was too far-seeing and <Col N="105" /> progressive-minded a man to believe that there was a solution of any difficulty by way of slashing salaries, and then rightly denounced the cuts. On an earlier amendment the Minister said that at a certain stage he gave up writing to the Press.  I reminded him, however, that when he stopped, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce took up the running. The Minister for Industry and Commerce made a speech at Cahir, I think it was, and announced that there was no need whatever in the financial situation existing in the country to cut the salaries of teachers.  Lest apparently that speech of his did not attract sufficient public attention, he went, I think, to East Cork constituency and there delivered a long homily against the teachers' executive and against the secretary of the teachers' organisation in particular, not so much, I imagine, because he happened to be the secretary of the teachers' organisation, but because he happened to be the Leader of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might now take stock of where the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and where the present Minister for Finance stand.  The Minister for Finance, who wrote all these letters to the Press denouncing the settlement, now comes along and is the very instrument for inflicting a worse cut than he then denounced. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who denounced the secretary of the teachers' organisation, and then Leader of the Labour Party, finds himself compelled, under the Whip of the Party and the orders of the Executive Council, to go into the Division Lobby in favour of the cuts which he then said, if accepted, represented a worse betrayal of the teachers than had ever been placed on record.  Now I think the Minister for Finance ought to get back to where he stood originally in connection with this matter. There is no reason whatever, on economic or financial grounds, for cutting the salaries of the teachers.  Their advent to the teaching profession is only accomplished after a long period of training, and after a good deal of money has been expended on their education.  Their early service in the <Col N="106" /> profession is marked by very low scales of salaries, so low that one could scarcely justify them as being salaries which would keep the teachers in the barest of physical comfort.  If they do reach a higher scale ultimately, it is only after long years of service, after years of patient endeavour, and after they have satisfied the Department of Education annually that their proficiency is not merely static, but improving rapidly.  If they fail to satisfy the test imposed annually by the Department, their position is not such a one as even the Minister for Finance might envy.  I suggest to the Minister that there is no case whatever for cutting the salaries of the teachers. They are men and women who, in the first instance, receive a very sound education for which they have to pay in a substantial measure in time, patience and money.  The scale of salaries at present accorded to them is not an extravagant one, and no remedy for any existing financial difficulty is to be found along the line of cutting the salaries of national teachers.</P>
    <P>In a small country like this it may be pleaded that education costs a considerable sum of money.  It does, but I should like to see education in this country costing even more.  The philosophy we ought to adopt is that this country is too poor to economise in the matter of education.  The main relief that the Minister would receive according to his own calculation would be £280,000 under this Bill.  That is not a serious problem in a Budget of approximately £34,000,000.  The Minister could get the money in other ways, and in more ways than one, without imposing these cuts on public servants.  He imposes these cuts not with any degree of legitimate or moral right, but because the victims of them are most convenient to the marauding hand of the Minister and his Department. That is no sound or logical reason for cutting their salaries though this may be a convenient excuse. But it is no reason or justification for cutting their salaries.  So far the Minister has not accepted a single <Col N="107" /> amendment to this Bill.  Having regard to the letters that he wrote to the Press and having regard to the wise advice he there tendered to the teachers of Ireland, I suggest to the Minister that this is an occasion and these are amendments that ought to recall to his mind some of his progressive days when he was sitting on the opposite benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gearóid O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking to amendment 58, my own amendment and that of Deputy Lynch, which will be governed by this amendment 57, I should like to support Deputy Norton's appeal to the Minister to accept, at least, one of those two amendments.  I do not want to refer to the general principle already decided, that the salaries of the national teachers must be cut.  These two amendments deal with a specific type.  Part III of the Schedule sets out the rate of the cut per annum on salaries less than £175, at 5 per cent.  My appeal to the Minister in this case would be on these lines.  The scale is based on the principle that those who get a higher salary should be cut more.  I need not remind the Minister that that is very unfair to persons who, as a result of their ability and satisfactory work, have gone up in the scale.  They have done so because of their number of years' service.  No efficiency will give a teacher any of those higher salaries unless he has a number of years' service to his credit. The increased cuts come entirely upon those teachers who are married and have families to support, and who really spend a good deal more on general taxation and on local taxation than those on the lower scales.  The amendment I propose is that the reduction of the salaries of the teachers in national schools should be 5 per cent. of the annual salaries provided always there is to be no reduction from any salary of less than £230 per annum, that is that no salary of less than £4 per week would be reduced.  I need not refer again to the letters the Minister wrote to the Press, or to the President's <Col N="108" /> speech at Rathmines, as to the undesirability and non-necessity of cutting salaries lower than £300 per annum.  In my amendment I have gone below that figure, and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment reducing the cut to 5 per cent. on all salaries and providing that there should be no cut on salaries less than £4 per week.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to one matter on which the Minister spoke one evening on the Second Reading debate.  I said that this matter should be faced upon a much bigger basis than that of so many hundreds of pounds or thousands of pounds.  It should be based first of all upon the necessity of having a higher teaching service.  I entirely agree that the question of education is one of those things on which parsimony should not be practised.  I also think that the amount that will be involved by reason of the amendment I proposed would be small.  I am sure the Minister will not allow the rather impassioned feeling to which he gave expression on the last occasion to govern his decision upon this, and that he will realise, whatever can be said about the necessity or non-necessity of the cuts, that this amendment is a reasonable one and one which I think many people in this House and in the country would be very glad to see accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to put one question and to make one point.  The question arises out of Deputy Norton's remarks a few moments ago.  He said the Minister for Finance could easily have raised this money by some more satisfactory method.  The question I want to put, is whether by that he means the money should be raised by increased taxation or is it some alternative form of economy he has in his mind?  The point I want to make is a very simple one.  I quite agree with Deputies Norton and O'Sullivan that few matters can be more important to a nation's well-being than education. But I part from them when they deduce from that that more money should be spent on education.  It is an absolute fallacy to suppose that <Col N="109" /> you can test a country's educational system by its cost.  I venture to say it will be found that in some countries in Europe where education is much more satisfactory its cost is lower. The same principle holds good in regard to individuals.  A man's education may be very expensive and yet very inefficient and very little use to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot told us that the value of education cannot be measured by cost.  I think there is something in what he says. At the same time I think that Deputy MacDermot must admit that the initial salaries of teachers, under present conditions, are very low.  In fact when you consider the expense and the sacrifices that young people have to make before they become qualified as teachers, you find they sometimes spend as much as seven years before they can get a salary which would be hardly sufficient for a handy man in a village.  While I agree that the efficiency of education cannot be measured by the cost, still, the inference can be drawn that the initial salaries of teachers are admittedly very low for such a profession.  Teaching is a profession, and if you bring down the salaries any lower than what they are you will be degrading the profession unfairly. I think there is one thing in this country that we would all like to have, and that is, that our teachers at all events should be men that would be looked up to in the community where they teach; that they should share the respect of the children whom they teach and of the parents of those children.  How can you attract to the profession a desirable class of men if you are going to degrade their salary below the low point at which it already stands?  On that account, sir, I support the amendment which has been introduced by Deputy Norton.  In doing so, I want to emphasise that I protest against taking anything off the initial salaries of the teachers, as it is going to degrade the profession and in the future you will not, on account of this degradation of the salary, bring to the <Col N="110" /> profession the class of men which we would desire to bring to it.  That is my protest against the degradation of the profession as represented by this attempt to cut their salaries.</P>

      <P>I desire to support this amendment and express the hope that this attempt to minimise the hardships of the Bill on the lower grade of teachers will meet with more success than previous attempts have met with.  I am anxious to hear how the Minister proposes to justify the cutting of the salary of a man who earns £175 a year.  A man or woman goes into the teaching profession after spending three or four years in a preparatory college and a couple of years in a training college.  The Minister must be aware of the fact that a good many of the young teachers come out of the training college with the certain knowledge that over some years they have to face the prospect of paying back to a bank, to kind neighbours, or somebody else, a substantial part of the expenses that were demanded for the cost of their training.  They must, in a good many cases, endeavour at least to help their parents to repay the money that had to be raised&mdash;£30 or £40 a year in some instances&mdash;for the cost of their maintenance and education in a training college.  The Minister must know, or the Minister for Education will tell him, that in a number of cases the brainy children of very poor people go into a training college and are allowed to enter into an agreement to repay the cost of their training when they afterwards obtain a position as teacher.  Members of all sides of this House are aware that it is an everyday occurrence that concessions have to be obtained for boys and girls in that way.  I should like to mention that the Department of Education has been very fair in dealing with cases of that kind.  I cannot see how the Minister can justify imposing a cut on any teacher in the position of earning £3 10s. 0d. a week and faced with the responsibility of paying back over some years a substantial sum either to the Department of Education, to a <Col N="111" /> bank, or private individuals for the cost of his training.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to mention again what was referred to earlier in the course of this debate, that the teachers are called on to bear the largest share of the economies that are to be effected under this Bill.  One finds it hard to see how the Minister, in view of his declaration, in view of the declaration of his colleagues, in view of the public statements that were made in the course of the election, is prepared to justify putting the bulk of the loan on the backs of the teachers.  I would suggest that if the Minister insists on economies as far as the teachers are concerned he ought to have no hesitation in accepting amendments that will reduce the hardships on the lower paid teachers.  While the two amendments which are under discussion go some distance to meeting that position in accepting amendments that have adopted, earlier in the course of this debate, a fairer attitude in dealing with this whole matter.  Even now there is an opportunity for dealing out bare justice to the lower paid teachers. The Minister might atone for some of his misdeeds in the course of the earlier discussion on this Bill by, even at the eleventh hour, making some gesture of sympathy to teachers who will find a cut imposed on a salary of £3 10s. 0d. per week.  I certainly hope that the Minister will accede to that demand, which I feel must be as strong in the ranks of his own Party as on any side of this House, if it could be made vocal.  If he is not prepared to do that, I hope that he will justify his action, because it will be very interesting to listen to the Minister attempting to justify cuts of this kind in view of all that has been said previously from that side of the House on this whole subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with these two amendments that are before us our attitude is, I think, very well known.  We first of all tried to secure that the Bill would not get a Second Reading, but the House unfortunately agreed to the principle of the Bill. Then, so far as the particular profession which we are now discussing is <Col N="112" /> concerned, we tried&mdash;and I think the Labour Party were in agreement with us&mdash;to get the exclusion of this particular class altogether.  This is only the third best method we are now discussing. Reference has been made to the speeches and the promises of not merely the Fianna Fáil Party and the head of that Party but of the Minister himself and some of his colleagues.  I am not going into the promises themselves, but if you consider the £280,000 that is being economised by this Bill, and if you consider the £170,000 that is being economised so far as this particular class is concerned, the bulk in the one case of the £280,000 and in the other case of the £170,000 is drawn from people with salaries under £400 a year.  Far the greater portion of it is drawn from them.  It is, therefore, in direct violation of the line that was taken up by the Minister.  Speaking of the conduct of the teachers in this particular matter, he accused them of playing politics.  In reality they only believed in the sincerity of the Minister and his colleagues.  If that was playing politics I suggest that it was very poor politics.  The success of the Minister's eloquence may have astonished them.  The virility of that brain is shown to a very large extent in speeches and letter-writing.  No justification has been put forward for any of these cuts.  None of them has been defended except the Guards' cut. No attempt has been made to justify any of those cuts on their merits.  The suggestion was made that salary is no guarantee of good service in education. That is perfectly true.  It is not a guarantee of good service in any sphere of life, but it is quite obvious that by cutting of salaries you may take a very good step to see that you get bad service. That is the difficulty.  I quite realise that voluntary service is very often the best, but it cannot be argued from that that payment should be abolished altogether for work done. The serious matter is that for the paltry sum involved in this whole Bill and in this particular Schedule to which the amendments are moved&mdash;and it is manifestly only for 12 months, remember&mdash;a great deal of damage is being done to the working of the State machine and to the scholastic work <Col N="113" /> throughout the country.  The fact that it is temporary only makes it worse. That is no justification for it, because in that case you are creating a disturbance with practically nothing to show for it.  In reality, of course, I fear that this is only temporary in the sense that, unless the Government is pressed by opposition against it throughout the country, it is only the beginning of further cuts.  In that particular respect, I fear, the Bill is temporary.</P>

      <P>I never did. The Ceann Comhairle knows that it was purely unintentional on my part. Whatever error was on my side was mental and not physical.  Of the two amendments, much can be said for either of them; and if either of them is carried I am quite satisfied.  The bigger deduction, and, therefore, the wiping away of the bigger damage, is possibly done by the amendment in Deputy Norton's name; but there is this to be said in favour of the amendment in the names of Deputies Lynch and O'Sullivan, and that is that it refuses to penalise the men who have the heavier responsibility.  I am not saying that Deputy Norton's amendment does that.  It does not, and that is the reason why his amendment should be voted for by those who are opposed to the extent of this particular cut; but the other amendment tries to give relief to the men with the <Col N="114" /> higher responsibilities and especially with the better qualifications, who have reached the supernormal scale owing to their higher qualifications for teaching. Again and again, there have been debates in this House in which the question was asked by Deputies who are now on the Government side: Are we getting value?  And the plea was put forward that for the good teacher no salary could be too high, roughly speaking.  The good teacher in the scales of salary is specially singled out and he is being particularly hit by this particular cut.  It is to meet cases like his&mdash;the man who, owing to his high efficiency, reaches the supernormal scale and who, owing to his age, has heavy responsibilities&mdash;that amendment 58, in the names of Deputies Lynch and O'Sullivan, has been moved; namely, that these are the people, if we are to pay any attention to the arguments put forward, who ought to be specially cared for.  Yet, we have the instance here, that the highly efficient teachers especially, the men who have shown by long years of service that they belong to that particular category and who have reached a highly efficient standard for a number of years, are the people specially singled out by a Government who, when they were in Opposition, professed to be anxious to get the most highly efficient people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason why I think these amendments should be supported is this: I have already referred to the fact that this particular cut imposed by the Government is independent of any attempt to deal with the pension fund.  So far as the people whom Deputy Norton tries to exempt are concerned, unless the pension fund is dealt with, they are paying into a fund out of which they will get no benefit whatsoever.  There is that to be said in favour of the amendments in the names of Deputy Norton and the other Deputies that in reality, so far as the bulk of the young teachers is concerned, for them the pension fund is bankrupt and they are getting no benefit out of it.  Their salary, therefore, is not £170.  Their initial salary in reality is, roughly speaking, about £147 a year for the fully trained <Col N="115" /> teacher because the 4/- he pays, owing to the refusal of the Government to couple a settlement of the pension fund with the cuts, makes an additional contribution from young teachers.  That is another reason why these amendments should be supported.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am not going into the general responsibility of the Government for the opposition that the teachers, especially, have shown to these particular cuts.  The Government are responsible for it. They have an opportunity, at least so far as mere form goes, of meeting the case that they themselves made, namely, that the lower scaled or lower salaried people should not be cut.  They have an opportunity here of meeting that particular case if they accept either of the amendments before the House, and I suggest that the House, in so far as it can, ought to insist that the Government accepts either of these amendments.</P>

      <P>The Deputy opened his speech by stating that this is not a Second Stage debate and that discussion should be confined to the amendment before the House.  So far, the Deputy has been making a Second Reading speech.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling. This Party has consistently contended that it is bad national economy to cut the salaries of public servants below what is known as the living-wage level. In that we were in agreement with President de Valera who, in his famous and historic Rathmines Town Hall speech, said he did not propose, if returned to office at the General Election, to cut the salaries of public servants where they ranged between £300 and £400 per annum.  He said that those in receipt of salaries between £300 and £400 were receiving nothing excessive.  At the same time as the President was making that speech in Rathmines, the Minister for Finance was speaking somewhere else in the country, telling the electors that if Fianna Fáil were returned they would save at least £2,000,000 on the Estimates.  In my own constituency he held a meeting under the chairmanship of a member of the I.N.T.O. and he promised the teachers that if he were returned their salaries would not be cut.  Does he deny that?</P>
      <P>I do not want to waste the time of the House or to irritate the Minister. Apparently these things do irritate the Minister.  One source of irritation is to repeat verbatim the statement made by the President in Rathmines Town Hall.  Deputies of all Parties have good reason to know the valuable support that Fianna Fáil received from the teachers during the General Election, particularly as a result of the speeches delivered by their leaders in 1932 and 1933.  I have heard Fianna Fáil Deputies suggesting recently that nobody in the country has any sympathy with the teachers; that the Government has the general backing of the country in reducing teachers' salaries.  In making a statement of that kind Government Deputies are, I say, appealing to the mentality of the down and out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Finance speaking here five times in succession on one amendment, contending all the time that these cuts are but temporary, while at the same time he was using language which, to anyone who studies it carefully, indicates clearly that he is <Col N="118" /> arguing in favour of permanent cuts. I believe it is quite true to state that when this Labour Party held the balance of power it was the intention of the Minister for Finance to put similar cuts into operation.  They would be in operation to-day were it not that the Minister knew he would not get the support of the seven Labour Deputies. The Minister might have been straightforward in the early part of the present year when he issued his manifesto to the electors and told the teachers their salaries would not be cut.  Fianna Fáil asked for a clear majority and they got a clear majority and the teachers who supported them are now going to be compensated for their efforts by having their salaries cut.</P>
    <P>I read the manifestos issued by the President in 1932 and 1933.  There is not a word in either of them which would suggest that the salaries of teachers or of public servants would be altered.  If the Ministry had that policy in mind at the General Election, they should in all decency have made it clear to the people.  I say deliberately that this or no other Government will get the support of the Labour Party in cutting the salaries of public servants below a decent living level. We are told that the policy of this Government is to build up a great home market to replace the export market that has been lost as a result of their own policy.  How can you build up a good home market if you cut the salaries of poorly paid servants?  Every penny of their salaries would ordinarily be spent in purchasing the necessaries of life and, if those salaries are altered, that will have a definite reaction upon purchasing power.</P>
    <P>The Minister was well aware that the return of eleven Centre Party Deputies would mean a certain backing in the matter of cutting the salaries of teachers and other public servants. He knew beforehand that he was going to get the support of Deputy MacDermot and his ten colleagues and then he decided to bring these audacious proposals before the House.  But before he even consulted the House on the merits of the measure or the extent to which the cuts should be put into <Col N="119" /> operation, he decided to put them into practice as from the 1st of April.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by Deputy Murphy to explain how I am going to justify cutting the salaries of men with less than £175 per annum. There is one justification which may be mentioned for the policy and it is that the teachers themselves, speaking through their organisation in December, 1931, decided by a majority of almost two to one that instead of cutting the man with £175 by five per cent. he should be cut by ten per cent. Deputy Norton was much more honest in his presentation of arguments than Deputy Davin, because Deputy Norton did not withhold from the Dáil the fact that in 1931 an agreement was entered into with our predecessors and accepted by the teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We will keep on the one point&mdash;what is the justification.  The justification is this, that in December, 1931, when the position of the Exchequer, the general budgetary position, was better than it is at the present time, and when our predecessors, the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, found it necessary to economise in the public service, the I.N.T.O. met them and, by a majority of almost two to one, decided to accept a cut, not of five per cent. but of ten per cent. I think that is a sufficient justification.  If I could not produce any other than that, I think it is sufficient for the inclusion in this Bill of the teachers.  Deputy Davin said that this Government or no other Government will get the support of his Party to cut the salaries of teachers. Would Deputy Davin have supported the agreement of December, 1931? Would his Party have accepted that agreement; would his Party, when it was led by the then General Secretary of the I.N.T.O., have supported the Cumann na nGaedheal Government of the day in cutting the teachers' salaries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but as an instrument of the teachers who felt that in the circumstances of the time when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office they should accept a cut of ten per cent., but who now, when they find that a Fianna Fáil Government is in office, refuse to accept a cut of half that amount. Surely there is not reason or logic in the position that Deputy Davin puts forward.  The one reason why this Bill was not introduced before this year, the one reason why it was not introduced last year, was that it was impossible for the Government last year, with the other problems that were pressing for our attention, to have prepared a comprehensive plan.  We wasted twelve months trying to secure agreement, but we had this Bill in mind.  When we came into power in March, 1932, we found such a situation confronting us that we had to impose very heavy taxation, which we would have to increase in the year following.  We decided, therefore, if we were not able to make the necessary retrenchments in 1932, that at any rate in 1933 if the Budget would not balance without imposing additional taxation, economies would have to be made in the salaries of public servants, and those economies would have to be shared by every branch of the public service.  The general election had nothing to do with the introduction of this Bill.  The provisions of this Bill were under consideration in my Department before the election.  We went to the country for one thing and for one thing only, and that was for the purpose of fortifying ourselves with a fresh mandate to carry to a conclusion which we believed would be satisfactory to the people the land annuities dispute.  There was never in regard to the 1932 or the 1933 <Col N="121" /> General Election a pledge given to the teachers to the effect that they would be excluded from the operations of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The President's speech in Rathmines on this Bill was made there in my presence.  Deputy Davin, with his usual disregard for facts, said that speech was made when I was down the country.  The speech was made by the President at a meeting at which I was present.  I was on the platform at that meeting.  When the President, in making the statement at the time, referred to public services, it was quite clear from the context of his remarks that the only people he had in mind were the civil servants.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Minister's allegation that the speech of the President in Rathmines, in 1932, only gave a pledge to the civil servants, I must say this: that on the morning of the election the <i>Irish Press</i> carried a guarantee that the President's speech in Rathmines applied to the teachers as well as to the civil servants.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton referred to the fact that not a single amendment from any side of the House was accepted by the Minister.  There was one amendment to be considered, and that was amendment 9b and, while I would not be in order to discuss it now, I hope the Minister will not entertain it, because if he does it will be a public scandal.</P>

    <P>I said here on the Second Reading of the Cuts Bill that the teachers objected to two things definitely&mdash;to cuts in the first place and, secondly, to the discrimination used against <Col N="123" /> the teachers.  When I pointed out that the teachers had to bear 62½ per cent. of the whole of these economies, the Minister in his reply ignored my remarks completely and indulged in a most intemperate tirade against the I.N.T.O., which I represent, and accused the teachers of not teaching the Irish language, not supporting Gaelic pastimes, and in being disloyal subjects of the State, of marching through the streets and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to reply to that now and to say that I repudiate these statements of the Minister categorically.  The teachers did not refuse to teach the Irish language; they did not refuse to support Gaelic pastimes; they are not disloyal subjects of the State.  Some of them marched through the streets.  I say now that, if the Minister's attitude to the teachers is indicative of the action of the Executive Council, they will march again through the streets very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a flat rate has been discussed here at some length by the different Deputies.  I confess that I am myself converted to the flat rate as far as the teachers are concerned and for this reason: A young teacher earning £160 might get a cut of £11, £12 or £13 this year, but he has a chance next year of recovering that by way of increment; whereas the teacher who is at his maximum if he is getting a cut of £10 or £11, has no chance of recovering it by way of increment. That teacher has his wife and family and other obligations and he has no chance of recovering that cut unless, of course, this cut may be, as the Minister says, only a temporary one which we hope it will be.  I must <Col N="124" /> again accuse the Minister of discrimination against the teachers.  He has not yet explained how it is that a national teacher in Dublin (North City) enjoying, if I may use the word, a salary of £220 a year, and supporting a wife and three children, is to suffer a cut, of 6½ per cent., while a lady civil servant, living next door, with a higher salary, will not suffer a single penny of a cut.  That is a position which occurs and one in which it will be very hard for the teachers to believe that they are being specially favoured in this Bill.  I do not believe that.  The Minister has put forward a certain argument to show that teachers are specially favoured.  I join with other Deputies who have spoken in a last-minute appeal to the Minister to give some concession in this measure to the teachers.  I should like him, if he replies again, to make some reference to the Pensions Fund.  He referred to it a moment ago and said that the present state of the fund is due to the teachers.  That is entirely incorrect. The teachers' side of the fund is perfectly solvent and is in credit.  The teachers, under an old arrangement, are responsible for one-quarter of the Pensions Fund.  The teachers' quarter is maintained and is perfectly solvent, is in fact over a quarter million in credit.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in reply to a question by Deputy Davin, stated that his justification for cutting salaries from £175 downwards was that the teachers themselves, at <Col N="125" /> a special congress in December, 1931, accepted that cut by a majority, I think he said, of two to one.  I suggest that that is not so, or, at least, that it is only part of the truth.  I must, I submit, refer to the pensions fund in connection with that statement of his, because there was involved in the agreement then of the teachers to accept that cut the acceptance by the Government of the day of full responsibility for seeing that the pensions fund was made solvent.  The two things went together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how I can argue against the Minister's statement, that the teachers themselves at a special congress accepted a cut equal to, or greater than, the cuts outlined in this Bill, unless I point out what was involved in that cut which the teachers accepted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the cut then to be enforced was greater than is embodied in the Bill. That again is not so, because the cuts outlined in the Bill vary from 5 to 8½ per cent.  Under the proposal in 1931, there was to be a flat rate cut of 6 per cent.  The Minister is also taking into consideration the permanent 4 per cent. contribution of the teachers to the pension fund, which will go on now, if these cuts are imposed, just as it has been going on all the time. So that, if it is true to say, as the Minister said, that we proposed a 10 per cent. cut in 1931, then the Minister proposes for some teachers a reduction now of 12½ per cent.  It would be just as true to say that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Minister is now making, under this Bill, a reduction varying from five per cent. in the case of teachers under £175 per year, to 12 per cent. in the case of teachers who have £450 or more.  I do not like to go into comparisons as between the different services, as I do not think that does any good, because the whole principle in the Bill is wrong, but undoubtedly I think Deputy Breathnach is justified in stating that there is unfair discrimination against the teachers.  He pointed to one case of a lady civil servant in receipt of £220 per year and of a teacher, a married teacher perhaps, with £220 per year, and of the teacher being cut in his salary while the lady civil servant has not her salary cut at all.  The same might be said with regard to the Gárda Síochána.  The unmarried Gárda is to have a small reduction made in his pay, amounting I think to 2/- per week, or £5 4s. per annum, whereas a teacher with a salary of £175 would receive a cut of £8 15s. per annum.  Then the pay of the married Gárda is not being cut at all.  There is no such discrimination with regard to the married teacher.  Some Deputies seem to think that all teachers marry lady teachers, or that the lady teachers marry members of the Gárda Síochána.  Of course that is not so.  There was a time, probably thirty or forty years ago, or perhaps ten or fifteen years ago, when the custom largely prevailed throughout the country that the teacher in the boys' school was the husband of the teacher in the girls' school next door&mdash;a forced condition of affairs very often, because of the miserable salaries prevailing at the time, the salary of the male teacher being about £60, and that of the woman teacher being something less. If a discrimination is made in the case of the married Gárda, a discrimination should also be made in the case of the married teacher with a very low salary.  It might also be said in relation to the Civil Service.  It has been pointed out that teachers have this permanent cut of four per cent. in their salaries for the pensions fund, whereas civil servants, who are not touched by this Bill until they reach <Col N="127" /> a salary of £300, make no contribution towards their pensions fund.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That in the opinion of the Dáil the Executive Council should take steps to relieve the agricultural community from rates and annuities during the continuance of the economic war.&mdash;(Deputy O'Donovan)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to occupy the time of the House for long in bringing my observations to a conclusion as I believe there is an understanding that this debate is to conclude to-night.  I <Col N="128" /> should like however to ask the Centre Party, responsible for putting down this motion, now before the debate comes to a conclusion, to make some practical suggestion.  There is not much use putting down a motion like this on the Order Paper, that we should come to the relief of the farmers with regard to annuities or rates. Someone else may put down a motion that the townspeople should be relieved of rates and rents also.  What we really want to get is how that is to be done.  If some practical suggestion of that kind was made it would be much more useful than arguments in this debate.  The argument put forward in support of this motion was that the economic war was a great mistake.  I do not see that that arises. Whether impractical or not it is there. The motion states as long as the economic war lasts there should be relief from rates, and what we want to know is how that is to be done.  There is no use in the Centre Party, or the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, or any other Party, talking about the economic war and saying it should be brought to a conclusion.  As long as this Government remains here they mean to be true to the people who returned them, and the people who returned them gave them a mandate not to surrender in this economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see no suggestion was made from the Centre Party except surrender.  They say &ldquo;stop the economic war.&rdquo;  But on what basis? Is it on the basis of paying over the £5,000,000 or not?  If it is on the basis of paying over the £5,000,000, that is surrender.  If it is on the basis of not paying over the £5,000,000 there is no need to talk of the economic war.  This motion does contemplate carrying on the economic war.  It says &ldquo;during the continuance of the economic war&rdquo; so and so should be done; that so long as the economic war goes on we should give relief to the farmers for rates and annuities.  Derating would cost 1½ millions; relief of annuities would cost about £4,000,000.  We have, as everybody knows, a moratorium on annuities for the November-December gale, and the May-June gale; but 50 per cent. of the annuities will <Col N="129" /> become payable in the next period&mdash; November-December and afterwards. The demand there really is in addition to what we have done in the way of relief of the agricultural community by the reduction of rates to the extent of one and a half millions and annuities to the extent of £2,000,000&mdash;that is a total of £3,500,000.  No one will deny that agriculture would need relief if it were possible to give it that relief, but the difficulty is to see how it can be done.  I am not going to admit that things are as bad as some members of the Opposition make them out to be.  On 31st March, 1933, the arrears of rates stood only two per cent. higher than on 31st March, 1932.  Any stranger coming into the country who knew nothing of the conditions, and who had been listening to the speeches of the Opposition, and to the description of the preposterous conditions as painted by Cumann na nGaedheal, would come to the conclusion that after all two per cent. of arrears in rates as compared with last year was not an unreasonable rise.  Especially would that be so if people took into account the frantic efforts made by the Farmers' Party to get farmers not to pay their rates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These things were done. At a Cumann na nGaedheal Convention it was stated, by the President of <Col N="130" /> that Convention, that the county councils were justified in not striking rates, and appeals were made in the country, in public speeches, to the effect that the farmers were unable to pay their rates and that they should not pay their annuities, as long as the economic war lasted.  In spite of these irresponsible statements, the arrears of rates were only two per cent. higher on 31st March last than on the previous 31st March.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister says that notwithstanding that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that notwithstanding that the county councils would not take the advice of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party; they struck their rates.  Only one county in the 26 did take the Cumann na nGaedheal advice not to strike a rate.  The point is, at any rate, that even while these irresponsible statements were made, and while the farmers, if you like, are badly off, if we were to relieve them from paying rates and annuities, there is no suggestion where the money is to come from.  I ask for practical advice. We have balanced our Budget and we would now have to find £3,500,000 to do this thing.  We must do it either by increasing taxation or reducing expenditure.  When there is any practical suggestion either for increasing taxation by £3,500,000, or reducing expenditure by £3,500,000, we will consider it and see what can be done.  There was not a single thing that we put forward by way of increasing taxation that was not opposed.  There is no suggestion at all made now, so that I suppose we are to reduce expenditure on old age pensions and relief schemes or anything else in order to give this relief in rates and annuities.  No suggestion came from anybody as to where this money can be got.  Still we have Deputies who think themselves responsible <Col N="131" /> telling us, on a motion like this, that we must give relief of rates and annuities for the continuance of the economic war.  I have not heard any suggestion except one and that I shall deal with briefly.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that has been made and, perhaps, made honestly, is that we should drop bounties.  I want to deal with that suggestion because, as I say, it is the only suggestion that I have heard&mdash;that, instead of giving bounties, we should give relief in annuities and in rates.  There are objections to that.  For one thing, if we decided to drop the bounties, you will find on examining it in detail, that we cannot drop them altogether, because, if we were to drop the bounties on butter and milk products, you would find that, no matter what relief the farmer might get in annuities and rates, he could not carry on.  The world price of butter is so low and the world price of other milk products is so low that the farmer could not possibly carry on unless some bounty or subsidy was given, so that what amounts to about 40 per cent. of the entire bounty payable this year would have to remain. Another objection, and a big objection, to that suggestion is that the stock raiser might not be the land owner. Take, for instance, the owner of land who is letting his land on the 11 months system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>The rancher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason whatever why the owner of such land should get any relief whatever in rates or annuities because it does not matter to him whether or not there is an economic war.  It makes no difference to him in the price of stock.  It must also be remembered that the output of agricultural produce, whether cattle, pigs or poultry or anything else, is not in direct proportion at all to the amount of annuities or rates that a person has to pay.  The good farmer, for instance, has an output in pigs or poultry three or four times as great as the indifferent farmer and it is only fair that the bounty should be given to a person who <Col N="132" /> has a large output of pigs and poultry and these other products to help him. There is no reason why the indifferent farmer with a large farm and with no great output, should get the same relief as the good farmer.</P>
      <P>It is said, of course, that the bounties are not going to the farmer.  I have referred to that here a few times, but the contention appears to me to be so foolish that it is scarcely worth dealing with.  The contention is that the cattle buyers and exporters through the country have entered into a conspiracy to put 35/- a head on all the cattle they buy into their pockets and to keep it from the farmers.  In the first place, I know, from examining several consignments of cattle that were sent to Great Britain, knowing what was paid for the cattle, which I have verified, and what was got for the cattle when they were eventually sold, which I have also verified, and knowing what the total expenses were, that the profits to the shipper worked out at about the same average profit as he would have in any normal year, so that he was not putting 35/- a head into his pocket.  In any case, suppose you do not accept that, is there any reason, if we take the 35/- bounty off cattle, why cattle shippers would not then hold a meeting and say: &ldquo;We will put another 30/- in our pockets now because we have got into the habit and know how to do it?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only suggestion I have heard from anybody as to the source from which this money could be got&mdash;that we should stop paying bounties and subsidies on exports and, instead, give a bounty to farmers by way of relief in rates and annuities. As it is the only suggestion made, it is the only one I can deal with.  But, if any other suggestion can be made, if any new form of taxation could be suggested, or if any increase in existing taxation were suggested, it could be considered.  If any saving in expenditure could be suggested in order to meet this £3,500,000 that is sought, it could be considered also, but until some suggestion like that is made, there is no use in this discussion, and the only <Col N="133" /> thing I have to say to the mover of this motion is that, if he wants to get anywhere with such a motion&mdash;and four of them, with, I think, the same aim, are down on the Paper&mdash;what he should do is to drop the propaganda part of it and try to make practical suggestions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan claimed, and rightly claimed, that he had made an unanswerable case for his motion.  There is not a speaker who has spoken on this motion from any side of the House who has not strengthened that case, including the speakers from the Government Benches.  Four of them have already spoken, including two fully fledged Ministers, and each one of them has strengthened the case in favour of the motion instead of weakening it.  Three of them said nothing at all to the motion.  They did not refer to the motion at all.  They kept so far away from it that I believe they would scarcely appear in the House for the division, if we are to judge by the manner in which they spoke to it. With the exception of the Minister for Agriculture, they did not refer to it at all.  The Minister for Agriculture, as he usually does in dealing with matters of this sort, repeated, over and over again, everything he has previously said.  He talked in millions as usual and, for the twentieth time since I came into the House, he has scattered these millions among the farmers and yet these scoundrels are not grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He talked about bounties and, on that matter, there is a good deal to be said.  One thing to be said is that the bounties are being paid by the people themselves in taxation of one sort or another and the bounties are given as an excuse for increasing taxation by six millions instead of reducing it, so that that is not a great boon to the agricultural community, when we remember that the agricultural community produces 75 per cent. of the wealth of the country and, therefore, of the taxation of this State and that the agricultural community are paying 75 per cent. of the bounty.  It has been admitted by Deputy Corry, on the Fianna Fáil side, that less than 50 per <Col N="134" /> cent. of the bounties reach the farmer so that, instead of the farmer gaining anything from the bounties, they are, according to Deputy Corry, losing on them.  In the figures the Minister has brought forward, he has tried to answer the case put up and it is quite true that some hard nuts have been given to the Minister to crack but he has failed to crack any of them.  He has swallowed them as usual.  He has a method of dealing with figures that is all his own.  He shakes them up and creates confusion, producing a sort of jumble of figures in which all order is swallowed up.  The Minister's mind must be modelled on something like the revolving drum.  He shakes up all the figures that come before him and produces disorder and then, of course, he draws a horse for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will draw a winner, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only comparison I can draw as to the Minister's method of dealing with figures.  In the end, he admits that there is a case for coming to the relief of the agricultural community but he does not see his way to do it.  The Executive Council, who are responsible for this economic war and who admit that they have inflicted extreme hardship on the agricultural community, now come along and admit, through the Minister for Agriculture, that they are unable to deal with the situation and ask us to make suggestions as to how to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not suggest that he should start this economic war.  The responsibility of finding a remedy, and of relieving those he has impoverished, so as to enable them to meet their liabilities, is upon him.  Deputy Corry, who spoke on this motion, was, of course, full of sympathy for the farmers.  As far as sympathy goes it pours out from every pore of Deputy Corry, from the top of his head to his toes.  In fact, it is pouring out everywhere only from the Deputy's pocket.  When Deputy Dillon brought forward an amendment to one of the Bills, asking that the members of the Oireachtas should contribute their share towards the relief of those involved in the economic war, Deputy Corry did not <Col N="135" /> say much about it.  He went on the same lines as the Minister.  No matter what figures the Deputy quotes they are facts.  Any figures he quotes he turns, by his magic wand, into facts, but in this case he left the position as it was before.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce confined his remarks to answering certain things which were said by Deputy MacDermot, as well as to some things that Deputy MacDermot did not say at all.  Deputy MacDermot tried several times to keep the Minister on the rails, but he kept so far away that it is not necessary to answer what he said.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the heavy duties that had been imposed.  That had nothing to do with the motion. He also referred to the policy of surrender. I do not see anything in the motion calling on the Executive to surrender. I will read the motion to the House, and I ask any member of the Executive Council, or of the Government, to point out the word in it calling for surrender.  (<i>Motion read</i>). There is not one word about surrender there.  It must be in the imagination of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>What this motion asks is that the Executive Council, which is responsible to the country, should come to the relief of the men in the front-line trenches.  What it really asks is that the generals should not desert the men they left in the front-line trenches; that they should not run away like cowards but fight.  They like talking in military terms and to pose as Napoleons of the economic war.  I should like to see them acting like Napoleon.  Napoleon never deserted the men in the trenches.  He stood by them and provided the sinews of war. He did not desert them and leave them to take care of themselves when he got them into the front lines.  One of Napoleon's dictums has become a proverb that during a war soldiers march on their stomachs.  Does the Executive Council agree with that?  Do the members of the Executive Council agree with Napoleon's dictum or do they hold that in this economic war there is no necessity for having a <Col N="136" /> stomach at all, that it is a superfluous appendage; that the soldiers can live on slogans, can wear hair shirts and have tight belts, provided the generals wear broad belts and fine cloths?  Is that the position the Executive Council takes up?  If it is the sooner they get away from it the better.  Does the Executive Council realise that agriculture is the basic industry of this State, and that if they destroy the basic industry, instead of building up other industries, they are really pulling down the pillars of the State?  If they pull down the pillars they are not playing at being Napoleons at all.  By pulling down the pillars of their own State they are deliberately committing national economic suicide, in the hope of destroying all the Imperial Philistines in the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>The motion deals with rates and annuities.  The claim for the remission of these burdens is based upon something more than the circumstances arising out of the economic war.  The claim with regard to the rates on land is based upon something more permanent than the circumstances of the economic war.  It is based on something more permanent and more lasting than the fact that our competitors in Great Britain and Northern Ireland have been derated.  It is based on something more solid than the broken crockery of Fianna Fáil promises.  It is based on the solid rock of economic justice, that farmers are entitled to derating, even if the position was altogether different from what it is.  If they were as prosperous as they are depressed they would be still entitled to derating as a matter of social justice.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the question, because it is too complex, and I would scarcely be in order in doing so on this motion, but I will refer to a few salient facts in connection with the agitation for derating.  The first time this claim took concrete shape was in 1927, when the County Council of Cavan passed a resolution calling attention to the fact that the system of rating for public services was a violation of the principle of social justice, as far as farmers were concerned.  The resolution was forwarded to the then Minister for <Col N="137" /> Local Government, who seemed sympathetically to consider it, by asking for the further views of the county council.  A further statement was forwarded to the Minister but, by that time, he had transferred to another Department, and his successors took no further notice of it.  The matter dropped for some years until derating was granted in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, when an agitation sprang up to deal with the farmers here, as they had been dealt with elsewhere. The late Government that always boasted of keeping to the middle of the road, when confronted with the issue, tottered more or less and took one side of the road.  Fianna Fáil came along and promised that they would do justice to the farmer if and when they became elected and became the Government of the country.  We see now what they have done when they got elected on those promises. I do not know what material those promises were made of, but it seems to be very fragile.  I only know that if their promises were as elastic as their consciences the farmers would have got more fair play on this question.  They told us, of course, about Christian principles.  I do not know how they can reconcile this conduct, and their treatment of this question of justice, with Christian principle.  I do not like to say a hard word.  I hate the word hypocrisy, but perhaps some Deputy will be good enough to suggest an appropriate word to designate a Government that excludes the virtue of justice from its code of Christian principle.</P>
    <P>With regard to annuities, I do admit that there is no claim for the remission of annuities except such as is based on the circumstances of this economic war. The circumstances of the economic war are sufficient justification for the remission of both rates and annuities, as the Minister for Agriculture admitted, and it is not for us to tell him how he is to find the money.  The responsibility is upon the front benches of the Government Party to find how they are to get the money to relieve the farmers from bankruptcy and poverty.  What is the position with regard to the annuities?  Not only are <Col N="138" /> the farmers compelled, if they export anything from this country, to pay the amount of the annuities&mdash;somewhere about £3,000,000&mdash;but they are compelled to pay other sums, which amount in all to five and a half million pounds. Not only are they losing five and a half million pounds, that is, provided Britain succeeds in collecting it, but they are losing ten per cent. preference upon all their exports.  Calculated upon £30,000,000 agricultural exports that would amount to another £3,000,000; so that the farmers are really losing eight and a half million pounds, or five and a half million pounds in excess of the £3,000,000 annuities.  If Britain succeeds in collecting the amount that is what they will lose.  Of course we are told by the Fianna Fáil side that Britain is not succeeding, and will not succeed.  Let us examine the position.  Everybody admits that if Britain succeeds in collecting this sum they have won the war. If Britain does not succeed, I think it is plain to everybody, no matter how dense they may be, that we have lost the war.  If we succeed in defeating her, then it means that we lose our whole export trade of £30,000,000.  It means that we lose £30,000,000 to deprive Britain of five and a half million pounds.  If we lose £30,000,000 while Britain loses five and a half million pounds, are we winning the war?  Does the Executive Council say that we are winning the war?  Britain, according to President de Valera, can afford 66 times as much as we can.  If we lose five or six pounds for every one Britain loses are we winning the war?  When we lose five pounds Britain would require to lose 66 times five, or £330, before we would be equal.  I do not see, when we are losing five pounds to Britain's one, instead of five to Britain's £330, how we are going to win this war.  We take John Bull to be very dense.  There are some people in the country who think that John Bull is so dense that he does not understand this.  He understands it as well as any Deputy in this House; he understands it as well as any farmer down the country; he understands it much better than the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Government tells us they are the friends of the small farmers.  Let us examine that. As regards the big farmers I am not concerned, because County Cavan is a county of small farmers.  If the Government is fair to small farmers I certainly have very little to complain of.  I wish they would be fair to them. As far as the big farmers are concerned all I can say is that they are entitled to their due, just the same. To go back to the time of Caesar, it was a great Christian principle to give unto Caesar the things that were Caesar's.  If the coin of the tribute has the inscription of Caesar on it, and if they are entitled to it because the inscription is there, then the big farmer's name is on his title deed, and that is some consideration.  As regards the small farmer with whom I am concerned, let us take the average farmer in County Cavan, and compare his position with that of the farmer in Fermanagh, or in any other part of Northern Ireland.  The average farmer in County Cavan keeps about five cows; he rears about four or five calves; he makes some butter; he feeds pigs and poultry, and he depends for his livelihood upon the sale of his pork, eggs, butter, etc.  The Minister has claimed credit&mdash;and I certainly give him credit&mdash;for his butter policy.  He has done much to improve the position of butter, and I do admit that the position of the butter industry is better in the Free State than in Northern Ireland.  I give the Minister credit for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position of the small farmer in Cavan?  We find, with regard to butter, that in 1929 there were 20,000 odd cwts. of butter produced in Cavan; that was an average of 140 lbs. for the 15,000 farmers in the county.  If the Minister has increased the price of butter say three pence higher than it is in Northern Ireland <Col N="140" /> I admit it is a big thing.  For the 140 lbs. it comes to £1 15/- to the average farmer in Co. Cavan.  That is £1 15/- of a net gain, and I give the Minister credit for that.  Against that let us consider the position with regard to young stock, pork and eggs.  The farmer who has five cows generally has four or five calves to sell.  They generally sell them as yearlings and they are losing about £3 on each.  I am not giving figures like those given by Deputy Corry or the Minister for Agriculture. The figures which I produce are figures that will stand investigation. I can prove those figures, and in fact I am taking rather a low estimate.  They lose £15 upon five calves.  On sixty hundred eggs they lose 2/- per hundred.  The quotations in the paper can be looked up any day, and it will be found that 2/- is the lowest estimate.  The loss is from 2/- to 2/8, and 2/- is the very lowest figure.  On the sixty hundred eggs they lose an average of £6.  On 16 cwt. of pork they lose 9/- per cwt. at the lowest.  It varies from 9/- to 12/- as compared with Northern Ireland.  They, therefore, lose £7 4/- on 16 cwt. of pork.  I am not adding to those figures; they are rather a low estimate.  Taking £15 loss on calves, £6 on eggs and £7 4/- on pork, that gives a total of £28 4/-.  Against that they gain £1 15/- on butter. When you deduct £1 15/- from £28 4/- it leaves £26 9/- of a net loss to a small farmer in Co. Cavan. That is what this Government is doing for the small farmers.  That is the position.  There is another class in County Cavan to whom I may refer. They are mountainy men, who do not produce pigs at all, so they do not lose the £7 4/- on pork.</P>

      <P>They do not sell milk to the creamery either and do not gain the £1 15/-.  What do they lose upon their mountainy lambs?  The average farmer has 20 of these lambs to sell. The average price used to be £1 apiece. Last year it varied from 8/- to 12/-. Instead of losing £7 4/- upon the bulk he loses £12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the position the small <Col N="141" /> farmers are in and then they are told that they will get relief work on the roads&mdash;a week's work on the roads is what they get in return for all this. The relief works are very light except when an election is coming on and such work is a very poor consolation for the loss of all this money.  The rates and land annuities are small in comparison and would only come to half what they lose.  I think that it is fair that the very least they can get is the remission of these rates and annuities because they are unable to pay them. With regard to this relief work on the roads, it is a bad policy for the Government to ask these men, who wish to live independently and to work out their own salvation, to throw over their independence and to look to the Government for spoon-feeding.  That amounts to turning the country into a great national soup-kitchen.  That is the position the country is being turned into at the present time, and all that the young men and the old men and the small farmers in the country are looking forward to now is to get a day's work on the roads, and they are not even getting that.  It is bad enough to turn the country into a soup-kitchen but it is very much worse when it is a soup-kitchen without the soup.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Executive Council not to regard this motion as a call upon them to surrender, but as a call on them to fight like men and to stand by their army in the front-line trenches and not to desert them.  They are the men who are fighting and it is up to the Minister to stand by them.</P>

      <P>The other day in this House we had a very remarkable statement.  We had the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture being introduced and we found that the Minister who was introducing it was suddenly stricken dumb.  I wondered, as I think the whole House wondered, what lay behind this strange attitude on the part of the Minister for Agriculture.  When I heard his speech to-night, however, whatever doubts I may have had before were entirely dissipated because, from his speech to-night, it is perfectly plain that the Minister for Agriculture has, at the present moment, abandoned all <Col N="142" /> hope of any help coming to agriculture in this country for a very long period to come.  In other words, the Minister is expecting, be the distance of time long or short, the death blow to be inflicted upon agriculture, and he stands by with his arms folded looking on and exclaiming, as he exclaimed to-night: &ldquo;For goodness' sake, will some of you come and give me help; I can do nothing myself; help me to extricate myself and the Government from the hopeless morass into which we have been led by the ignorance and the obstinacy of the present Executive Council.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now the Minister has declared that they have a mandate not to surrender and that this economic war can only be terminated on the basis of not paying £5,000,000 or on the basis of paying it.  I wonder if he really believes that. I wonder if, when he was making that statement, he thought that the House would be sufficiently foolish and sufficiently wanting in even a gleam of intelligence to think that that in any fashion represents the true situation. Wars are not always fought out to a finish.  They are not always terminated by the complete and overwhelming victory of one side or the other.  Most of the great wars in history have been wound up by treaties of peace at the end of them.  That is what we have urged upon the Government repeatedly from these benches&mdash;that they can make, and should spare no efforts to make, a treaty which will not be a surrender, but that a treaty can be made which will be a surrender neither by this country nor a surrender by Great Britain, but will be a peace perfectly fair and honourable to both sides.  Those are the terms upon which we have pressed the Executive Council to act.  That is the line of conduct which we have suggested to them and which for a very long time past we have been pressing upon them to adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an Economic Congress coming shortly.  I say nothing further about it except that I do sincerely hope that the Executive Council will, upon that occasion, through their representatives, allow common sense to rule and will bring this wretched economic war to a termination by a <Col N="143" /> fair treaty of peace derived through negotiation.  That is the hope which we, certainly, have on these benches. I know that we are called anti-Irishmen and traitors and things of that kind because that is our hope; but we have that hope, and we sincerely wish that from that conference something of that nature may come.</P>
    <P>The position at the present moment is that the Minister admits that agriculture is in a very bad way and that something ought to be done, and he says simply: &ldquo;I do not know what to do because I have no money and cannot get it.&rdquo;  He was asked very pertinently, in an interjection, what has happened the money in the Suspense Account.  This economic Government could increase taxation last year by £5,000,000 or more; they could take this £5,000,000 which is in dispute at present; they have, therefore, got £10,000,000 more money than was available two years ago; and yet, at the present moment, they declare that they are bankrupt and have not got a penny.  If that be so, it seems to me that one of the first things the Minister should do would be to use all his influence with his fellow-members of the Executive Council to have the extraordinarily incompetent Minister for Finance, who, having that enormous sum at his disposal, has managed to fritter it away uselessly, removed from office.</P>

      <P>I am going to make my speech, despite the Minister's interruptions.  This economic war is being fought over a sum of £5,000,000 per annum.  Very recently a Professor of Economics, a very well-known man who has made an exhaustive study of the subject&mdash;and as the statement was made in the presence of the Minister, I am sure he is aware of it&mdash;calculated that the loss sustained by this country as a result of the economic war is £40,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Professor Johnston.  He also mentioned that at least £20,000,000 of that amount has been borne by the small farmers.  That is quite true, because we have lost not merely the export trade but also the prices farmers were accustomed to get in the home market; they are both gone.  Look, for instance, at the way lambs are selling.  Lambs such as Deputy McGovern spoke about this evening, that would be worth over £1 a couple of years ago would not fetch 8/- to-day.  I can give examples where the margin is much wider.  And a great number of these lambs have not gone to England; large numbers of them are being retained in this country.  We all recollect what the Minister for Defence was so proud about&mdash;that persons in this country, who never ate lamb before, could now get it for 3d or 4d per lb.  All the losses incurred in that way have to be borne by the farmers.  The money comes out of the pockets of the farmers and probably more than half of it out of the pockets of the working farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was very proud about the way in which the rates are being collected.  He said the arrears were only a very minor percentage of the total sum.  Is the Minister aware that rates are paid in two moieties and the <Col N="145" /> second moiety is collected in October? Is he aware that no one pays his rates before Christmas and that the economic war had not begun in all its intensity until after the second moiety of rates had become due?  In those circumstances his figures are misleading. The fact of the matter is that the policy of the Executive Council has now put the people in the position that they are not able to pay their rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about advice being given to people not to pay their rates.  No such advice was given by anybody.  I have not seen it stated anywhere.  The Minister declared that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party advised that county councils should not strike rates.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Party advised the county councils&mdash;certainly one of them&mdash;to have the legality of the Government's action tested in the courts.  The courts are open to every citizen; at any rate they were up to the present.  A citizen can in the courts have the legality of every action tested. What has taken place?  The Executive Council has acted not only in a dishonourable fashion, but in a very wrong fashion towards the county councils in this State.  They allowed the county councils to base their estimates on the understanding that they were going to get the same agricultural grant this year as they got in other years.  After the estimates had been adopted the Government, in the most dishonourable manner possible, deceived the county councils.  They indicated that there was a sum of £449,000 being taken off the agricultural grant and that amount had to be put on to the rates this year.  In such circumstances the county councils should have had an opportunity of revising their estimates. That was a matter that should have been, and in fact was, decided by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course this motion cuts right across the policy of the Government, because it asks <Col N="146" /> that during the continuance of the economic war the rates should be reduced.  The policy of the Government is the very opposite.  During the economic war the rates should be increased&mdash;that is the policy of the Government.  The rates have to be increased owing to the fact that the agricultural grant is being reduced and owing to the fact that enormous sums are going to be flung upon the county councils for the carrying out of relief works.  Therefore, the policy of the Government during this economic war is to increase and not decrease the rates.  Of course this motion would be a direct negation of all their policy.</P>
      <P>They cannot show any reason why they should adopt this policy of rate increasing just at a time when the farmers are in a worse position from the point of view of the payment of rates than they have been in the memory of any man now living.  And because this is dead in the teeth of the Government's policy I am perfectly sure that the Government will use their majority against it.  I dare say there are Fianna Fáil Deputies who would like, if they could, to come to the assistance of agriculture.  I dare say there are some of them who are interested in agriculture and who are very anxious that the Government's policy, which is ruining agriculture, should be stopped.  But I know they are powerless to act; they have to obey their orders and I do not expect they will do anything else upon this occasion.</P>

      <P>The last speaker made a very significant statement when he said that this Government could make a settlement of the economic war that would be just and honourable on the Irish side and equally on the English side.  I think it is the height of dishonesty that the Deputy, who poses as being a responsible member of Cumann na nGaedheal, should make such a statement without pointing out to the Government how such an honourable bargain can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>It reminds me of the statements made during the election, <Col N="147" /> when Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and other Deputies were trying to mislead the people, that if Cumann na nGaedheal got into power the people would not have to pay annuities for a few years.  It would appear from the statements then made and from the statement made here to-night that there was some bargain arranged between Cumann na nGaedheal and the British&mdash;that there was some indication given by the British to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party that a bargain could be arranged over the annuities.  I hold that it is absolutely anti-national and dishonest for the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to hold the essence of such a bargain from the people.  If they are so interested in the farmers, then the least they might do is to divulge to us their great secret and tell us how they can strike the honourable bargain that we have been told about.  I think the House would like to have the details before they would allow them to go and negotiate any more bargains. Otherwise, it might turn out like some of their other bargains&mdash;the payment of another £5,000,000 a year to England.  If that is the kind of honourable bargain they now find they can strike, I think the House would like to have it discussed fully before accepting their <i>bona fides</i> in the matter of striking honourable bargains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know if Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney accepts this motion. Is he sincere in backing it?  He talked about the money that was squandered and wasted by the Government, but when asked to quote even one instance he could not give it.  I can quote an instance where a certain sum of money was absolutely squandered and wasted by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government when they briefed Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney as one of the counsel to make a case for the payment of the land annuities to England. It is not so many months ago since Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, Deputy McGilligan and others with a legal training on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches were briefed not only to make out a case for the payment of the land <Col N="148" /> annuities to England but to go into court, as they actually did, to prove that the annuities did not belong to the farmers&mdash;but that they belonged to John Bull.</P>
    <P>What about the waste that was involved in briefing these gentlemen in that case?  What about the advice that was then given by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney? Does he now admit that the advice he then gave was worth nothing, that he gave it because he was briefed to give advice to suit a certain political Party?  Does he admit that when politics is to be played afterwards he will give different advice, as he did to-night, and make out quite a different statement for propaganda purposes with the object of fooling the people? I do not accept anything the Deputy has said on this as being in the interest of the farmers.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney in his speech to-night was simply playing politics, talking in very much the same strain as he has been for the past couple of months about his great concern for the poor unfortunate struggling farmer. But the Deputy's policy at the last election was not a policy that would benefit the small farmer.  No, his policy then was the policy of grass. The Deputy has left the House and is now somewhere in the Lobby, but I want to remind him that at the last election his policy for this country was essentially a grass policy.  A tillage policy was only a secondary consideration with him then.  I come from small farmers myself.  I have lived amongst them all my life.  I know the efforts they have to make to gain a livelihood, how they labour to make their small farms a success.  It is not a grass policy but a tillage policy that is going to be of benefit to the small farmer. To-night we saw Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney running away from his election policy of grass and heard him talk about the welfare of the small farmers.</P>

He is so benevolent that he may buy it at a good price from <Col N="149" /> you.  Surely your benevolent leader will not let you down if you have any to sell.  The whole case made by the Deputies who are supporting this motion is simply this: that they are trying to boost a certain system of farming, a system that has gone crash in this country, and that even if Cumann na nGaedheal or the Centre Party were put in power can never be resurrected again in this country&mdash;the system of the 200 and 500 acre farm and a grass policy.  That policy is gone and gone forever not only in this country but in other countries because of world conditions.  The policy can never be a success in this country again.  It is a bankrupt policy.  A complete change must be made.  If this country is to go ahead it must get away from the remnants of that old policy of grass, of ranching and of idleness, a policy that no doubt made profits for the big man, but that was detrimental to the small and struggling farmers of this country.  This is a land not of ranchers but essentially of small farmers.  They are in the big majority in this State.  The areas of the country in which you have small farms are the areas that are most thickly populated.</P>

He was able to keep his land and to pay his annuities to England because the ranching system suited him.  He could make his profits and live in idleness. But while that was the position the people of this country had to take to the emigrant ship and to cross to the other side as migratory labourers because they were deprived of the opportunity of getting land at home and making a living on it.  Their day must come now, and it is about time. There are many men sitting on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches who, if they left politics aside would much prefer to back that policy to the one they are backing.  They know that the right policy for this country is a tillage policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to facilitate Deputy O'Donovan if he wants to conclude.  I think I might be allowed to refer, however, to the fact that Deputy McGovern stated down the country that he was one of the most unpopular members in the House.  He tried, evidently, to regain his popularity to-night by speaking for about half an hour.  The policy that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party would pursue if they came back into power&mdash;and possibly some members of the Centre Party would assist them to get back into power&mdash;would be a policy of &ldquo;grass.&rdquo;  I believe that if that did occur, certain big ranchers would be able to pay their annuities and the annuities could be sent across to England, but the large majority of Irish working farmers would not be able to live on a &ldquo;grass&rdquo; policy and they could not pay their annuities.  I was saying when I was interrupted that if the tillage policy of the Government is to continue for the next ten years, as I believe it will continue, and if at the end of ten years it brings no greater disaster or works no greater damage to the farmers than the policy of Deputy Cosgrave's Party during their ten years in office, it will not have done a lot of harm.  At least Deputies opposite cannot complain if we only do the same amount of harm by a tillage policy as they did with a grass policy.  That is taking the matter at its worst but I am convinced, knowing the working farmers of the State, that ten years successful working of our policy will more than compensate for <Col N="152" /> any loss which may accrue owing to British tariffs.  I hold that the Government have no right to surrender on this question.  They have no right to accept this motion of Deputy O'Donovan.  They got a mandate at the last election to carry on in this way absolutely and it was the people opposite questioned the will of the people.  Do they now question that that is the will of the people?</P>

      <P>I suppose before there are any more interruptions I had better conclude lest I might become as unpopular as Deputy McGovern.  I say the Government have no right to accept this motion.  They got a mandate to carry on the economic war to a successful conclusion.  The people are standing behind them in that.  I would further say this that if this Government went out of office and if any other Government, which would surrender on this question, succeeded them, that Government would not be able to govern in this State.  The people want to stand on their feet and to build up this country economically, nationally and socially.  That is what any Government in office must do in order to be able to carry on.</P>

      <P>This motion has been put on the Order Paper for the purpose of getting an expression of opinion from the Government on this matter.  The Minister for Agriculture who is, I understand, himself a farmer must thoroughly understand the condition of agriculture in this country.  He <Col N="153" /> must know perfectly well that the farmers have to depend on the sales of their produce during the year.  Take the farmer with say 50 or 60 acres of land, a man who has at all times in the past done his utmost to pay his way, to meet his liabilities and to pay his rates and annuities.  That man perhaps has ten cows and he rears 15 calves.  I certainly say that on the price of these 15 calves he would lose more than would pay his rates and annuities for the year.  That is in addition to what he would lose on his sheep, pigs and poultry.  We have heard a good deal from Deputy Cleary about &ldquo;grass&rdquo; farmers.  I do not know whether Deputy Cleary is a farmer or not.  I am a farmer and live on my farm.  I have had to make my living on it and to work as hard on the farm as any Deputy in the House.  I suppose I can say that I till as much as any Deputy or any two Deputies on the other side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall not argue it.  I have sixty acres of tillage anyway. I believe that if the present policy of the Government in connection with the economic war continues and <Col N="154" /> if the present position exists for a few months further, every farmer in the country is going to be bankrupt.  We are drifting towards bankruptcy every day.  With regard to the statement that we are forcing the Government to make a settlement of the economic dispute with England, we are not forcing them, but we want some relief for the farmers to sustain them during the continuance of this dispute.  We want some relief from rates and annuities.  If we are relieved of these burdens we will get some compensation for the amount of loss we have sustained owing to the economic dispute.  I would appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to relieve farmers of rates and annuities during the continuance of this dispute.  By doing that he will not be doing anything more than is justified by the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that other Deputies want to deal with this motion, but in view of the understanding come to I shall now conclude the debate. Those who have spoken from the Government Benches have not put up any case against the motion.  In fact, I think the Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Corry made a very good case for its acceptance.  In any event, they did not. face up to the facts. Deputy Corry stated that before the Fianna Fáil Government came into office prices had dropped and agriculture was declining.  I am not denying that.  Agriculture was on the decline before that.  From the time, however, that the present Government came into office in March, 1932, prices dropped from 113.2 to 88.9 per cent., and that in one 12 months.  What was the cause of that decrease?  The policy carried out by the present Government.  The prices of live-stock and farm produce were declining before that, but the decline was not anything as serious as occurred from March, 1932, to March, 1933, when the motion was tabled.  The figures I am quoting are taken from the Irish Trade Journal, vol. 8, March, 1933, page 31.  As far as the farmers are concerned, since this motion was tabled our position has worsened.  The doctrine is that if a seller cannot cover his costs he must go out of production. If the farmer cannot cover his costs he must go out of production also, and out of production he is going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying anything against the policy of the Government in trying to develop industries.  Protection has been afforded to industries and we hear that 300 of them have been established.  Certain products have been let into the country free, but the protection was there for them and we have to pay.  That means that the price is artifically raised.  The farmer, however, has got no protection.  The protection he has got is that when we asked the Cumann na nGaedheal Government for derating of agricultural land they gave us £750,000. Fianna Fáil, seeking office, promised <Col N="156" /> another £250,000, and they gave it. But what have they done now?  When we have lost our markets as a result of the economic war, they have deprived us of £500,000 of that money which was given in relief of agricultural rates. There is no denying that; nobody dare deny it.  The Minister for Agriculture said that the rates were collected in 1932.  They were, because the farmers in this State are honest and will pay as far as they can, and it was a normal rate struck at a normal period.  The Minister also said that there was a ramp through the country on the part of the Centre Party not to pay rates and annuities. I deny that; there never was such a thing.  The farmers have always stood by the poor, the helpless and the needy and, as far as they are able, they are willing to stand by them again.  The Minister for Agriculture admitted that agriculture needs relief.  In his first speech on this motion, he said that he was fortunate enough to get a profit on his pigs.  Of course he could get a profit on his pigs at that time.  Why did he get a profit on his pigs?  Because he was wise enough to get into pig rearing when the whole country had gone out of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters which led to the tabling of this motion.  One of them is the cost to the farmer of the Cereals Act. Deputy Corry mentioned the increase <Col N="157" /> in price of 3/- or 4/- per barrel which he was able to get as a result of that Act.  I pointed out in my opening statement that there were 760,000 acres under cereals in this State.  That figure was taken from the &ldquo;Trade Journal.&rdquo;  That acreage produced an average of one ton to the acre.  The admixture was only ten per cent. Deputy Corry said that the whole country benefited by the admixture of ten per cent.  What became of the other 700,000 tons?  It is there still with no one to buy it.  What has that cost?  The admixture has cost at least 10/- per ton to the farmer and given him an inferior article for fattening purposes.  Then we had the tariff on artificial manures.  On 5th April last I asked the Minister for Agriculture for the details of the employment given in the fertilising industry after he had put on the tariff.  The Minister said that figures were not available. They may not be available for this year, and I would not expect them to <Col N="158" /> be, but certainly last year, when he was going into the question of putting a tariff on, he should not have put it on without getting information as to the number employed in the industry and the advantage which it would be to the industry.  If he did that without making inquiries, it is the damnedest thing ever done by any responsible Minister of any Government. He has added to the cost to the producer by these and a whole lot of other measures.  I wanted to deal with this matter at length, but owing to the understanding come to I have to finish up now.  However, I may perhaps get another opportunity.  I am satisfied that a case has been made for this motion that no case has been made against it, and when it is put to a division I hope the farmer Deputies on the other side of the House, who know the conditions of the people, will support it.</P>
