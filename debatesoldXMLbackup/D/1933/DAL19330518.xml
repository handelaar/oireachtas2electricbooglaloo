      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if, owing to the progressive difficulty of collecting rates, he will permit the local bodies to issue instructions to their rate collectors to accept the rates in monthly or quarterly instalments, instead of two moieties as heretofore, and thus make it easier for the ratepayers to meet their liabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no power to issue instructions to the effect indicated.  The matter has been frequently under consideration, and the view generally held by those experienced in local administration is that it would be unwise for many reasons to give power to rate collectors to accept rates in less than half-yearly amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that rates for the past year have not been paid in full, and seeing that the rates in general are about 25 per cent. over the rates of last year, and that the ability of the people to pay is considerably less this year, and also having regard, generally, to the unprecedented condition of things will the Minister consider the advisability of helping the people in their effort to meet the heavy burdens of the rates this year?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the precise reasons why he has refused to sanction <Col N="1188" /> an old age pension to Daniel Brien residing in the Skibbereen Rural District (No. in Sub-Committee's Register 4419 and No. in Pensions Officer's Register 1314).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>An appeal was decided on 20th April, 1933, when it was determined that Daniel Brien, Raheen, Nyross, Union Hall, Skibbereen (No. in Sub-Committee's Register 4419) was not entitled to an old age pension, as it was not considered on the evidence furnished that his means, as calculated under the Old Age Pensions Acts, were within the statutory limit for the receipt of a pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Dr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state why a pension for blindness has not been granted to John Dillon, Ballybritt, Roscrea, although passed for 10/- weekly by the local Pensions Committee on the 27th October, 1932, and if he is aware that he had certificates from both the local medical officer and from the county occulist, Offaly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>An appeal was received on 10th December, 1932, from the Pension Officer against the proposed allowance by the Shinrone Old Age Pension Sub-Committee of a blind pension of 10/- a week from 30th September, 1932, to John Dillon, Ballybrit, Roscrea.  The date of the Sub-Committee's decision appears to have been 5th December, 1932, not 27th October, 1932, as stated in the question.</P>
      <P>The clerk of the local Pension SubCommittee has been requested to forward the necessary relative papers, but so far has failed to do so.  The Minister is therefore not yet aware of the evidence by which the present claim is supported.  The case will be expedited.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regretted that some unavoidable delay has occurred in dealing with applications for grants for reconstruction of houses&mdash;this has been due to the very large number of cases and need for proper inspection before payments can be made.  The staff of inspectors has been increased and every effort will be made to deal with all cases as promptly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if, owing to the fact that the price being paid for lobsters at present in West Cork is only 8/- per dozen, compared to 12/- and 13/- last season, the difference being due to the British tariffs, he will again consider the granting of a bounty on these shellfish to enable the poor fishermen on our rocky shores to get a fair living from their labours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>The price which the Deputy mentions as being paid at present for lobsters in West Cork is not in my opinion an unsatisfactory one, having regard to world prices and conditions generally.  The prices mentioned as prevailing last year do not accord with my information on the subject.  In my opinion a sufficient case has not been made to justify the granting of a bounty on shellfish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts I have adduced are quite accurate according to my own experience.  I know that 12/- or 13/- was the regular price on the Cork coast between Kinsale and Baltimore for lobster last year.  I am very sorry to hear the Minister say that he thinks 8/- per dozen is fair remuneration for lobster fishermen.  I was surmising the Parliamentary Secretary might say the price this year is not as good as last year in the English market, but I would remind him that whatever the price, he must understand that that price is lessened by the amount of the tariff, and that tariff is coming out of the remuneration of the unfortunate fishermen.</P>

      <P>It is not proposed to deal with the whole of it.  <i>(Interruption).</i><Col N="1192" /> We do not want the introduction of stupidity.  We want to have the matter clarified.  From the introduction of the word &ldquo;possibly&rdquo; by the Vice-President, some business requires to be finished next week.  I think the House is entitled to know what business the Vice-President really desires to get done on Tuesday and Wednesday which if not done, will have to be dealt with on Friday.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 24:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (7) and substitute a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(7)  If any person employed by an approved society shall feel aggrieved by the decision of the unified society on any matter to be determined by it under this Act, or if any dispute or question shall arise between any such person and the unified society on any matter arising under this Act, such person may appeal to a standing arbitrator, to be appointed by the Chief Justice, who shall hear and determine such appeal and whose decisions thereon shall be final.  The amount of feel payable to such standing arbitrator on any such appeal shall be fixed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health with the consent of the Minister for Finance and shall be paid by the unified society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> The standing arbitrator shall have power to administer oaths and to award costs at his own discretion and to direct to and by whom and in what manner such costs or any part thereof shall be paid and to measure the amount of such costs and to require security for costs to be given to his satisfaction by any party at any stage of the proceedings before him or them.</P>
    <P>The standing arbitrator shall have the like powers of enforcing the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents as are possessed by the High Court.</P>
    <P>The standing arbitrator may at any time correct any clerical mistake or error in any award arising from any accidental slip or omission.</P>
    <P>Any sum payable under any award made by the standing arbitrator shall be a simple contract debt recoverable by action at law.</P>
    <P>This amendment was put down in the hope of the adoption of a previous amendment.  I am not quite sure whether the Minister will take the view that the procedure outlined in this amendment is absolutely necessary.  I am sure he will consider the question without prejudice.  We put the amendment down on the possibility of the Minister accepting amendment No. 11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  The Minister is in all things acting impartially in his Ministerial capacity, but in this case, even as Minister, he has no special interest.  This is an outside affair. The parties have their own rights, which are set out in the statute.  The Minister would act as fairly between the interests concerned as any outside arbitrator would.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>We felt that this amendment would be necessary in consequence of the acceptance of amendment 11.  If amendment 11 had been accepted by the Minister, the method of computing compensation might lead to disputes.  In that event, we thought it desirable that an amendment of this kind should be introduced.  As the <Col N="1196" /> majority of the House has turned down amendment 11, I do not propose to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I think the fear arising from this Bill is that there will be a great deal unemployment caused by the unification plan.  The Minister would do a great deal to dispel any misgiving in that respect if he could give the House an assurance that the staff of the unified society would be drawn from existing officials.  As there is a feeling that a great many of the existing officials will not be employed, the Minister could at this stage set the fears of these people at rest if he could give an assurance that in framing this unification plan the existing officials will, as far as possible, be absorbed.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has not got the permission of the House yet.  If this amendment were not withdrawn, but were incorporated in the Bill, I take it that another question will arise, whether a person who was, in fact, at the time employed, would be referred to the arbitrator.  I suggest to the Minister, whether he accepts the amendment or not, that differences might arise between the unified society and the displaced employees of approved societies, which it would be very desirable to have resolved by some independent person.  The Minister is, to some extent, an independent person in this matter, but, after all, his expert advisers in the past were very much more detached from the approved societies than they are going to be from the unified society.  The unified society being the creature of the Minister, and blood being thicker than water, I feel that there are a number of people who would prefer to have the right of appeal to a person who would be, more or less, in a judicial capacity outside. That becomes all the more urgent if the Minister considers the acceptance of amendment 25 in any form, or of a concession along the lines laid down in <Col N="1197" /> amendment 27, where the question will arise as to whether a man has been dispensed with two or three years as a result of unification.  I think the principle has been enshrined in many statutes before, that there should be some kind of arbitrator appointed to pass judgment upon these cases.  I would be very glad to hear the Minister say that he would consider the matter and, if necessary, amend the Bill on the next stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>Where any person is employed by the unified society in a position which is inferior in status or responsibility to the position occupied by such person in an approved society at the date of transfer, then such person if he is dissatisfied with his employment and the conditions thereof, may, at any time within two years of the date of transfer, by notice in writing to the unified society, resign his position and thereupon he shall be entitled to compensation as if he had not been employed by the unified society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment suggests a way out of the difficulty for the unified society, if persons are offered employment on terms less favourable than they enjoyed when in the employment of an approved society.  The Minister stated last night that he thought two years rather too long.  That is an administrative question, and that particular period would be a matter which I would be quite content to leave for settlement to the Minister.  I put this to him.  Supposing he does not put in the proviso suggested in the amendment, and takes over a man who feels himself under a sense of grievance, on account of the conditions under which he has been taken over, what good is that man going to be to anyone? Would it not be much better to <Col N="1198" /> get rid of him, to open a door and let him out?  There is no use in taking over a &ldquo;sorehead.&rdquo;  If you take him over he may be a &ldquo;sorehead&rdquo; for the first month, but when he settles down to work and finds, all things considered, that he has a fair salary and a good job, which has not turned out as badly as he thought, he might prove to be a very useful official.  A few persons taken over under these circumstances will remain discontented, and unless there is a proviso of this kind, there are two alternatives open to the unified society, one being to sack them when they are entitled to nothing, or carry on their backs, for the full time, inefficient and discontented officers. Let us not look at it from the point of view of efficiency at all.  From the point of view of the committee it is very necessary that they should have some kind of porthole to put such fellows out through if they proved to be embarrassing passengers.  If they have not, then to my mind they are letting themselves in for a lot of trouble.  The number of persons who would take advantage of this proviso would be infinitesimal.  The vast majority of people who get employment in the unified society will be very glad to get it, and the vast majority of those who do not want employment will be dispensed with and given compensation. Perhaps one per cent. will be taken on reluctantly and will remain for two years.  There is a way of getting rid of them.  If there is not that way the society is married to them for the rest of their lives.</P>

      <P>I am sure the management committee would not like to have on their staff people&mdash;even one or two people&mdash;who were so discontented that they would be a source of trouble to themselves and their colleagues, and a source of considerable annoyance to the whole machine.  As the Bill stands if these people are offered employment and refuse it, then they get no compensation. If they accept employment, and in a year or six months go out then they have kept another person out of that post.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the person who was available for the post six months before, who was already in the employment of an approved society, and who would be glad to get that post, has been turned down or has gone into some other employment. The opportunity of availing of his services, is, perhaps, no longer there. An injustice has been done to that person.  If a person goes out after a year, after looking around and securing other employment that he finds is more suitable, or for any reason that may arise, he is still bound to get compensation.  I think we would probably do a very grave injustice to other people who might have been employed, and who were not, because this person took up the position to suit his own convenience for whatever period is fixed in the Bill. The injustice that might be done would rule out the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has omitted to notice that it is not a question of a person taking a job to suit his own convenience.  It is a question of the unified society going to a man and saying: &ldquo;You have got to take this job or you will get no compensation.&rdquo;  The case I envisage is that of a man going to the unified society saying: &ldquo;I do not want the job, I prefer to go out,&rdquo; to whom the unified society says &ldquo;you cannot go out.  You have either to come in and take this job or get no compensation.&rdquo;  It only refers to cases where a man claims to get out, and does not want to come in, but who would like to take the compensation, and to whom the unified society says: &ldquo;You must come in or get no compensation.&rdquo;  So that the case the Minister envisages, of where a fellow took a job and did another man out of it, could not possibly arise, because this man is clamouring to get out. The man may say: &ldquo;Very well, I will go and see if I can make any hand of it at all.&rdquo;  He does not succeed in making any hand of it.  It may be only a very small percentage, but they will go on clamouring and they will be a continual nuisance to everybody &mdash;to themselves and to the managers of the societies.  They will be <Col N="1200" />&ldquo;grousers.&rdquo;  What I am suggesting is a way of divorcing this unfortunate marriage and what I am offering is a bill of divorcement.  I am reluctant to advocate companionate marriages, but this is a case in point.  It must be remembered that when you take this man in he is there for the rest of his natural days and there is no superannuation scheme to cover it.  I suggest that here you have a way out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to advocate forced marriage any more than the Deputy likes to advocate companionate marriages.  I have in mind that it is possible that the management committee will know that there are certain individuals whom, perhaps, they would like to have, and who are officials of approved societies at present and might be taken over. They would get to know, in the way these things get around, that such a man, though desirable, would rather go out and take his compensation. There is another such man who is equally suitable and who will take the position.  My feeling would be to let the man go, unless he was an absolutely indispensable man, and I do not know that there are so many such men to be found.  My feeling would be to let him go and take his compensation.  There will be a lot of officials left to select from and, certainly, my own notion is that unless a person were absolutely indispensable in the view of the management committee, the individual or the official concerned should not be forced to stay on.  While, probably, it would not be right to say that he would be given the option&mdash;we could not say that&mdash; it will be generally known, as I say, to the management committee what officials are competent and what officials they want.  They will know in advance whether these people are in the market, and are willing to come in or whether they will accept compensation and go out.  I think it will be got over in 90 per cent. of the cases.  We cannot, I suppose, take 100 per cent.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 26:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a person entitled to compensation under this section is offered and accepts employment in the unified society on a salary lower than the salary he was receiving from an approved society at the date of transfer, he shall be entitled to compensation calculated on the value of the loss thus sustained by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the same kind of matter, and has the same subject matter as that of other amendments we have considered&mdash;in particular, amendment No. 10.  That deals with this sort of case, but in a very strict way.  The proposal that I am putting forward in this amendment is a kind of compromise, and I think it is a very fair one and would tend to help matters.  From another point of view, I think it is absolutely necessary that we should put in the Bill, in some form or other, a proposal that envisages that kind of case, where an official in one of the old societies is offered a post for which the remuneration is less than what he has been enjoying.  If he refuses that post, as I understand the Bill, he will not be entitled to any compensation. Therefore, he is obliged to take this post no matter how badly it will be paid.  His situation may be considerably worsened.  This amendment suggests that for that worsening of his <Col N="1202" /> position he should get compensation. I think that is only fair, and I think it will help the unified society very much to set about working with its new officials.  I think, if you do not make some proviso of that kind, you will reduce to a farcical extent the whole position as regards compensation, because it will be open to the new society to offer some ridiculously low remuneration to the official who is taken over, which he could not possibly accept, and which he will have to refuse, and he will get no compensation at all.  It might be worked so as to invalidate the whole idea of compensation.  I suggest that this is a very reasonable way of meeting this and establishing the genuineness of the whole principle on which this matter of compensation is based.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;possibly&mdash;I have doubts, unless the Minister is in a more sympathetic frame of mind to-day than he was last night, whether this will be accepted.  I would point out that secretaries of approved societies with headquarters in provincial towns &mdash;good men, who have proved themselves to be efficient administrators so far as their own area of administration is concerned&mdash;might be offered positions, possibly at the same salary, but who, by accepting a position at the same salary and having to go from the provincial town to Dublin, would suffer a loss apart altogether from any possible loss of salary involved.  I think that compensation should be payable in such cases.  I was speaking to one of these secretaries recently&mdash;the secretary of a very successful society, and successful from the point of view of figures which are available for the Minister.  If he came to Dublin he would have to sell his house, cut away from family and other associations and come to Dublin with very little chance of getting a house.  Possibly, he would <Col N="1203" /> have a chance of purchasing a house but he would have practically no chance of getting a house to rent. That man would suffer a loss of income in view of the higher cost of living in Dublin which, I suppose, would be the headquarters of the unified society.  I think that in fairness to these people some allowance should be made, because from a financial point of view they would not be able to bear the burden and it would not pay them to cut off their associations and come to Dublin.  I think that case should be taken into consideration by the Minister. At any rate, the Minister would be well advised to give sympathetic consideration to this whole matter between this and the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy will agree that I have already given sympathetic consideration to this whole question of compensation. I do not know whether the Deputy agrees with that or not, but I do maintain that I have given very sympathetic consideration to the whole matter and have gone into it with great thought and sympathy for the officials concerned.  As a result of that thought and careful examination that have been given to this aspect of the Bill since the Second Reading Stage compensation has been increased very considerably. The scale of compensation and the cost of it have been increased by nearly 50 per cent.  As I said last night when dealing with another amendment on this section, we have encroached so heavily upon the administration fund for compensation purposes that I could not think of dipping any deeper into its resources.  I am told by the officials that what we have done already will hamper the administration fund, but we have decided to take the risk of improving compensation all round.  In view of the financial propositions that have been put up to me as to the condition of that fund I could not possibly go any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out to the Minister that my proposition will not put a burden on the unified society?  It will not burden the society more if it is accepted than if it is not. <Col N="1204" /> Let us take a concrete case.  Suppose, for the sake of argument, that an official was getting £2 a week.  The society, if it takes him over, may say &ldquo;we think you are being paid too much for the work you are doing and we are going to give you 30/- a week.&rdquo;  The man says: &ldquo;I cannot live on 30/- a week and I cannot take up the position on those terms.&rdquo;  You reply to him: &ldquo;You must either do it or go out without compensation.&rdquo;  You may think that a very unfair thing to do to a man who has been employed for a long time, but the alternative is for the society to take him over at £2 a week or to treat the man harshly.  If they take him over at 30/- a week they will pay him reasonable compensation for the difference.  As far as the society is concerned, it comes to the same thing in the end.</P>
      <P>As far as the legal aspect of the matter goes, does the Minister think it right that we should pass a Bill which leaves it possible for the whole scheme of compensation to be made nugatory?  Suppose that any particular society decides that it will offer a man a perfectly absurd salary because it does not want to take him over and does not want to compensate him, such a thing is quite possible if you do not put in some saving clause such as I suggest.  I think it would be wrong for the House to pass a Bill with the knowledge that it could be worked in that grossly unfair way.  I do not say that it would be so worked, but it leaves the possibility to do it.  I think it would be grossly unfair of the House to do that of its own knowledge: to leave such a loophole for unfair working in a Bill that it sends out as an Act of Parliament.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  I agree that the Minister has tried to meet amendments moved to this particular section in a very sympathetic way.  I think it will be admitted by the Minister himself that in this amendment Deputy Thrift is asking not for sympathy but for bare justice.  Deputy Davin made a point which I had intended making, and made it, perhaps, better than I could make it with regard to officials coming <Col N="1205" /> up from the country who may be selected and given employment by the unified management.  Apart altogether from the amount of actual cash they will lose by coming to Dublin, they will suffer other very substantial losses. House rents and the cost of living are higher in Dublin than in country towns.  The change will also mean for them the tearing up, so to speak, of the roots of the life that they have been accustomed to live, some of them for 40 or 50 years.  Their losses, apart altogether from the question of cash, will be very substantial indeed.  Take the case of an official of a local society in the Counties Tipperary, Clare or Cork who is now receiving £320 a year and who is offered £300 a year in the City of Dublin.  To start with, he suffers a loss of £20 a year in his salary, but I think it is putting the case moderately to say that his actual loss will amount to about £100 a year. He has to suffer that loss or accept the alternative of getting no compensation. I am satisfied that it is not the intention or desire of the Minister that any employee of a local society should be unfairly treated.</P>
      <P>As has been pointed out on many occasions, once a measure leaves this House and becomes an Act of Parliament it is not the intention of the Minister or of the Government that comes into play, but a strict legal interpretation of the law.  Deputy Thrift gave a case in which he pointed out that the unified management, if they desire, can deprive a man either of his job or of compensation.  That can happen under the Bill as it is now before the House.  I would like the Minister and some members of the House to remember this, that if such a thing did happen it would not be the first time it occurred under legislation passed here.  If my memory serves me right, cases of the kind did occur under the Electricity Supply Acts.</P>

It is because <Col N="1206" /> of that experience that we are anxious to safeguard those who will be affected by this section.  I suggest to the Minister that the acceptance of Deputy Thrift's amendment is not going to place any undue burden on the unified society.  It is not going to make all the difference between success and failure of the unified society.  If the society can survive all the other obstacles that I see in its way, I have no doubt it will survive this.  We are asking for plain justice for these officials.  We are not asking for any extra compensation. I think the reason for the section being in the Bill at all is because the Minister does not want to do an injustice.  If he wants to carry out the spirit of the Bill and the section, to do justice in a fair way, then I think he should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>There is a fundamental argument in favour of the amendment. If the House decides to bring about a reform in the administration of these societies&mdash;that such a change is for the benefit of the State and the people&mdash; then, while the House has that power it has not the moral right to interfere with a person's means of livelihood without compensating him for it. Deputy Thrift's amendment is designed to meet the case of a person who has a certain amount of remuneration as part of his livelihood.  If that is taken away from him for what are really public purposes, then I say the House has not the moral right to carry out any such scheme without compensating him. For that reason, I think the amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be unreasonable and I do not want that the management committee should have the power even to act unreasonably with regard to an official.  I said on an earlier stage that I was quite prepared to put into the Bill, in regard to compensation, that the offer made to an official of an approved society should be a reasonable offer in comparison with the post that such an official held previously.  That is not in the Bill so far.  As Deputy Thrift and other Deputies have said, as the Bill stands it is possible that the new committee of management could make a ridiculous <Col N="1207" /> offer to an official and penalise that official.  I would like to have that position safeguarded, but I do not want to safeguard it by putting further expense on the administration fund.  I should like to have the position with the revised compensation clause safeguarded so that the management committee must act reasonably and, as far as the finances will allow, justly, towards those persons who are offering to go into the employment of the new organisation.  I cannot see my way to accept this amendment because I do believe it will add further considerable expense.  Like Deputy Morrissey, I believe it is not what our intentions are, any more than what Deputy Thrift's intentions are&mdash;his intentions are good&mdash;but it is what is down there in black and white or black and green on the Paper that will count.  There might be a considerable number of people who would get compensation for loss of remuneration.  If the Deputy is satisfied I shall look into it and see what can be done on Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The acceptance of employment with the unified society shall not deprive any person of his right to compensation under this section but such right shall be suspended and arise only if his services are dispensed with by reason of the establishment <Col N="1208" /> of the unified society, or if he suffers any diminution in salary, wages or emoluments within seven years from date of transfer.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to provide for an employee who would be taken over in 1933 or 1934 and disposed of in 1936 as redundant.  Suppose you were dealing with the secretary of an approved society, one secretary can never be redundant in any given approved society, but he might be taken over into the unified society in some position and in 1936 the management committee might revise their estimate of the staff necessary to do the work.  He might be informed in 1936 that he was redundant and he has then lost his right to compensation.  I think the Minister will see there a very real danger.  It is quite on the cards that, using their best discretion, the management committee might take over an excessive staff when they start the unified society.  I think, in fact, that they probably will have to, in order to make sure they will have an adequate staff.  When they get the machine running they will find quite possibly that they have half a dozen men too many.  In that event I want them to be free to say to these half a dozen men: &ldquo;We do not want you; you are redundant and we therefore propose to give you the compensation we would have given you if we had never taken you over and let you go.&rdquo; This cannot arise unless they dismiss these men as redundant.</P>

      <P>I could not accept the amendment.  First of all, I am satisfied that when an employee is offered a post, he will be offered one which the management committee is satisfied there is need to fill.  This will not be exactly a Civil Service post but it will be the nearest thing possible to it, and anybody who knows the Civil Service will admit that though it may be difficult to get into it, it is very difficult to get out of it.  A person must commit a very serious offence before he is put out of an organisation of that kind. He must prove himself very incompetent and he will be given many a chance before being discharged.  I think it is most unlikely that anybody <Col N="1209" /> taken into the service, unless he is guilty of some grave dereliction of duty or proves so incompetent that he cannot possibly be kept, will be deprived of office.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister has missed my point.  This is very different to a Civil Service post.  Possibly one of the explanations of the excessive national expenditure is that once you get into the Civil Service you never get out of it.  Of course in an ordinary business firm, once they have no work for a man they let him go.  They do not put him dusting the office stool or smiling through the window.  If they have no work for him they let him go. I should say that there is no question here of dealing with a person who is dismissed for bad conduct or for insubordination.  There is no question of dealing with a person who is discharged for cause stated.  This only deals with people who are discharged because they are redundant, or who are degraded from one grade into a lower grade because they become redundant in the grade in which they were originally. That is all the amendment deals with&mdash;the redundant man.  What I want to avoid is that the unified society should be carrying on its back as a regular practice half-a-dozen, a dozen or 20 men who are redundant or who are not wanted because, mind you, if you leave one redundant man there in a job that you will have to make for him, when he retires in the ordinary course of business you will be expected to put another man in his place. Because you create the job you will create a vacuum when the man retires, and nature abhors a vacuum.  If you have ten, 20 or 30 men in such jobs you will have ten, 20 or 30 vacuums, and they will be filled down the ages at the expense of the administration fund.  That is what we have to consider.</P>

There is provision for that in the Bill.  They will be offered employment, and if they accept they will be kept on as long as <Col N="1210" /> is necessary to continue that temporary employment.

I am satisfied that the new management committee will, in view of the necessity for caution and for economy, only take on the minimum staff of permanent people and a number of temporary people.  The number of temporary people will not be great, but they will be safeguarded by way of compensation. At the end of the period if it is necessary to get rid of them compensation will be available for them.</P>

      <P>The Minister, according to his own case, sees no conceivable evil consequences that can flow from this amendment, except to provide for a few exceptional cases, but the Minister cannot say, on the one hand, that his experience is that a redundant official is never dispensed with as a result of the benevolence of the Civil Service; and, on the other hand, that redundant officials never turn up in a Civil Service department.  I am suggesting that, under the special circumstances here, the unified society must ensure that they get an adequate <Col N="1211" /> staff of expert men in order to get going, and in doing that they will inevitably, or, very probably, may, retain the services of a few men who will not be required when the machine is working smoothly.  These men might then either be de-graded or dispensed with or, worst of all, highly paid jobs might be made to hold them until the end of their period of service, but once the highly paid job is made it will stay there, and because we have not made provision to dispose of redundant officials effectively we would involve the administration fund in permanent expense.  This plan removes all these objections, and I cannot see how it can give rise to any evil.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 28:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>Where for the purpose of administrative convenience or otherwise any approved society shared with its parent society or any other society or body, whether corporate or unincorporate, the services of any person entitled to compensation under this section on such terms and conditions that the person so employed was regularly employed and received remuneration from both the society and from such other employer, then the following provisions shall apply to such person:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) where such person is not given permanent employment in the unified society then, for the purpose of calculating the amount of compensation payable to such person, the remuneration and emoluments received by him from the approved society shall, alone, be taken into account;</P>
      <P>(b) for the purpose of considering whether such person has been offered permanent employment on terms and conditions not less favourable than the terms and conditions on and under which such person was employed at the date of transfer then the terms and conditions of his employment with both employers shall be taken into consideration and there shall be added to the remuneration and emoluments received by him from the approved society the remuneration and emoluments which he received from such other employer;</P>
      <P>(c) where such person is offered and accepts employment in the unified society on terms and conditions less favourable on the whole than the terms and conditions under which such person was employed at the date of transfer, he shall be entitled to compensation calculated on the value of the loss thus sustained by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to deal with the cases of persons who are <Col N="1213" /> part-time officials of an insurance society and part-time officials of the society which created the insurance society.  There are cases where the secretary of a trade union is also the secretary of the trade union national health insurance society.  Portion of his salary is paid from the insurance society and portion paid from trade union funds.  The object of the amendment is to endeavour to ensure that when that person is offered employment in the unified society, the test, for purposes of comparison, shall be his total remuneration in his old post.  In other words, if you have a secretary receiving, say, £300 from a trade union society as secretary, half of which is recouped from the insurance section, the amendment would ensure that the person would be provided with a post comparable with his £300 post at the moment or, if it is not possible to offer him employment in the unified society, he should be compensated on the basis of whatever loss he sustains as a result of the merging of his insurance section with the unified society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  We are only concerned with the new national health organisation and with the approved societies that are being unified.  We cannot possibly provide for the large number of officials who associate other work with their work for national health insurance.  We can only provide compensation for the loss of whatever office a person holds in the approved society, whether he was a whole-time official or whether his work was of such a nature as could be regarded as whole-time.  I think we could not be expected to offer officials posts in the unified society comparable to the dual post that the secretary of an organisation such as a trade union body or an official of an insurance organisation would hold.  There are such officials who did ordinary life and fire insurance and associated national health insurance with it.  There is a good number of officials who do both kinds of work, and I think it would be a burden that we could not stand if we were to compensate these people <Col N="1214" /> for work other than national health insurance work or if we were asked to provide posts at the same composite salary.  I am certain that we could not do it, and I think it is not fair that we should be asked to do it.</P>

      <P>I am not asking that be should be compensated on the basis of remuneration derived from any other employment but insurance work, but where a person who, at the present moment, receives portion of his remuneration from an insurance society and the remainder from some other funds, my suggestion to the Minister is not that he should be compensated for the loss of his insurance employment but that the compensation should be based on such remuneration as he received from the insurance funds.  In other words, if a person was receiving £4 a week, £2 of which was received for being a part-time secretary of an insurance society, and if he is absorbed into the new society he should receive compensation for the loss of the £2 a week, because it represents a substantial portion of his income.</P>

Should that not be taken into consideration if he is being absorbed into the unified society?  Why should he be limited to the exact amount which he was receiving from the national health insurance portion <Col N="1215" /> of his work?  In that way, you may rob yourself of the opportunity of getting suitable men for some of the higher posts.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>The first portion of the amendment sets out: &ldquo;The provisions of this section regarding compensation shall extend to and include any person employed by a parent society or body in connection with the administrative work of an approved society where such administrative work is discharged by such parent society or body...&rdquo; That contemplates a case where a parent society, by arrangement with an approved society, carries out on a contract basis certain administrative work. Such instances do occur.  No doubt the approved society find it the most economical way in some cases of carrying out the work.  That portion of the amendment will not be covered by amendment 28.  Then you will have the case of a whole-time employee doing national health insurance work under a contract with the parent society, but he is really doing the work of the approved society.  Under the section he would not be entitled to compensation because in law he is not an employee of the approved society but of the parent society.  In substance and in fact he is doing the work of the approved society and I think such person should not be excluded from compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second portion of the amendment deals with a clerk employed by any secretary, treasurer or other salaried officer.  If a secretary or treasurer, by reason of the multiplicity of duties in the approved society, has to employ a whole-time clerk, that person is as much a person carrying out the work of administration under the National Health Insurance Acts as his principal. I think that person should not be excluded from compensation either. The third portion of the amendment, dealing with a member of the medical or legal profession, is in a somewhat different position.  Where a person is employed for an isolated job he is in quite a different position from the person receiving a salary.  The giving of a salary contemplates the giving of a considerable portion of time on the part of a professional man to a particular class of work.  Such employment does result in his exclusion from a considerable <Col N="1217" /> amount of what might be termed his general practice.  The legislature has recognised that distinction in this country because it has applied the principles of giving pensionable rights to doctors and solicitors employed, not from job to job, but on a salaried basis, to do a certain specified amount of work in the year.  I submit that this amendment is not governed by amendment 28.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that where officials such as are mentioned in this amendment, officials of what the Deputy has described as the parent society, who are whole-time officials and who have given their whole time to the work of national health insurance, can prove that they have given their whole time to such work and are perhaps likely to lose employment in the parent society because of unification, they would be entitled to compensation and we are prepared to bring forward some amendment on the Report Stage that will cover that position. The second point refers to clerks or officials employed by the official in charge.  It is provided in the Bill that where those officials pay out of their own salaries for the services of these officers the salary of the official employing the clerk will be reduced for compensation purposes.  He will get his compensation, if he is entitled to it, less the amount given to the clerk, and the clerk will be given compensation also.  We are quite satisfied that some compensation should be given.  Provided they are otherwise qualified for compensation, we think they should get compensation.  As regards legal advisers and doctors, the Bill provides only for compensation for people with whole-time posts or people whose services were such that, though they were part-time, the work was still of such a nature that almost whole-time service was given.  If there are such officers who have given whole-time service they would come in under the ordinary compensation clauses set out in the Bill, but if they cannot prove whole-time service <Col N="1218" /> I do not think there is much hope for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 30:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a part-time employee of an approved society at the date of transfer is not offered employment by the unified society, and is not entitled to compensation under Section 21 of this Act, then provided that he was so employed by such approved society on the 30th day of June, 1932, he shall be entitled to receive a gratuity from the unified society on the basis of one month's remuneration excluding expenses for each completed year of service calculated on his average monthly remuneration for the year 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 21 (3), it is provided that in order to get compensation a part-time employee would have to receive from an insurance society his principal means of livelihood.  In other words, if a person were employed as a part-time agent by an insurance society, the bulk of his income would have to come from the society.  It must, according to the reading of the section, be his principal means of livelihood in order that he may get compensation.  On the Second Reading I pointed to the case of an agent receiving from a private employer £1 a week, and receiving as agent of an insurance society 18/- a week.  The 18/- is not his principal <Col N="1219" /> means of livelihood, although it is a very substantial portion, but because the 18/- is less than what he gets from another source, that person receives no compensation.  I think that is a grossly unfair method of assessment.  He is only a part-time agent and his earnings are small, but in the case of such a person the small payment from the insurance society represents a very substantial part of the weekly income. In such a person's domestic budget the small income derived as agent is a very substantial item.  To take that means of livelihood away from a man and give him no compensation, all because the State considers it desirable to unify societies, is in my opinion acting towards such people in a very harsh manner.  There is very little apparent consideration given to them if they are to comply with the conditions set out by the Minister in sub-section (3) of Section 21.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to provide very modest compensation for such persons. It seeks to ensure that if a person is not entitled to compensation under sub-section (3) he should nevertheless be entitled to compensation for the loss of his employment, and that the compensation should be calculated on the basis of one month's remuneration for each completed year of service.  That, at most, would give these people pretty small compensation.  The compensation would be very much less relatively than their weekly earnings from the society would amount to.  I hope the Minister is not going to tell the House, in respect of these agents, that because they cannot prove or cannot show that the principal part of their earnings came from the society, they are to get no compensation.  If the Minister rejects this amendment that means he is sentencing these people virtually to economic death.  Because if you take away from these people the part of their livelihood that they get from an approved society, though that is not the principal part of their livelihood, you impose a severe hardship upon them. These people are poor people, always struggling and always endeavouring to eke out a livelihood.  Yet, the legislation which provides for men with fixed <Col N="1220" /> salaries in the societies and for members of the professions associated with the societies, gives no consideration at all to people who do not receive the main part of their livelihood from their work in the society.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment for part-time employees. The only part-time employees for whom we can provide compensation are those mentioned in Section 21 of the Bill.  The part-time employee of a society who proves to the satisfaction of the provisional committee that his earnings from such society were his principal means of livelihood is being compensated. The funds are not sufficient and that is the reason why I cannot accept the amendment.  I am told that there are round about 2,500 agents who would be compensated on the lines suggested by the amendment and that would cost about £30,000 for the whole lot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>He told us that it would cost £30,000, that is, roughly, £12 per man or per woman compensated. I want to put the viewpoint to the House and to the Minister that it is largely due to the work of these part-time employees throughout the country that national health insurance has been able to live and grow and to be kept solvent in this country.  The Minister is, or should be, aware of the <Col N="1221" /> fact that most of those who would be covered by this amendment are what are called card collectors and card distributors. They collect the old cards and distribute the new cards.  But that was not the beginning and end of their work.  These men were also the people who secured compliance with the Act, and it was their action perhaps more than any of the old officials employed either directly by the local societies or by the National Health Insurance Commissioners, that secured compliance with the Act, and it was they who did most to prevent malingering.  The work which they did was out of all proportion to the remuneration that they got for the collection and distribution of the cards.  The Minister said it would cost £30,000. Personally I am sorry, not alone from the point of view of the compensation but from the point of view of the future of the national health insurance service in this country, even as a unified society, to see those men going, because the Minister will find it almost impossible to replace them and almost impossible to get the machinery that will do the work as effectively as these men were doing it.</P>
      <P>I happen personally to know a great number of these men.  On the Second Reading here I stated that I have been a member of the committee of management of a society for over 15 years and I am in fairly close touch with societies adjacent to my own county. I could give, and I am prepared to give, to the Minister privately the names and the particulars of men, if he requires them, to whom this deprivation of their fees under the existing law of the local society will make all the difference in the world.  I can give the Minister the particulars of at least a dozen cases where these men are at present through the fees they earn from local societies just able to live and to support their families.  The passage of this Bill will mean that they are driven back below the starvation line.  In a few cases that I have in mind these are fairly old men and there is no other employment open to them.  They are not capable of taking up other employment even if such were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> Let me give a typical case.  It is the case of a man living in a fairly large town.  He is an agent for a fairly large district around the town and that is his area for the distribution of cards. This man is a widower with a fairly large young family.  He has a small huckster's shop.  Now I submit that it would be utterly impossible for him to prove to the satisfaction of the commission or whomsoever would be the authority under this Bill whether the greater part of his livelihood came from the fees got from the society or from the shop.  I am giving that as an illustration.  I want the Minister to realise this, and I am sure he does realise it, that these men have been recruiting agents for national health insurance.  They were watching the young fellows in their area until they came on to 16 years of age.  They watched them from the time they left school at 14 until they went into employment with a farmer.  They went to the farmer's house to see that these young fellows were insured and that is how the societies were built up.  I am satisfied that the Minister desires to be fair and I suggest in all fairness to the Minister that he will not be doing any injustice in giving those men the compensation which Deputy Norton asks for in this amendment.  I am satisfied that if it were possible to have a vote of the insured members and the contributing employers they would agree that these men should get fair compensation.  According to the Minister's own statement it would cost £30,000 for 2,500 employees.  The funds to the credit of the societies are roughly about three and a half million pounds, I suppose.  Surely the Minister will not say that taking £30,000 from that sum to do an act of justice to men, some of whom have given 21 years in helping to build up this social machine, is going to make any difference as to whether the unified society will be a success or not.  I do not think it will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Minister cannot.  In view of the figures <Col N="1223" /> given by the Minister on the Second Reading in trying to justify the introduction of the unification scheme, and having regard to the last actuarial report, and even the Minister's estimate of what the next one will be, does the Minister say that it would be worth £30,000 to national health insurance or to the State to deprive these men of the very modest compensation asked for?  It will not cost £30,000, because I am satisfied that if the unified scheme is to work, many of these men, and I hope a great number of them, will have to be retained; or, alternatively, the Minister will have to set up machinery to replace these men all over the country, which will cost ten times £30,000. I speak from a little experience of an average local society, and the Minister knows as well as I do that unless you can secure the maximum compliance, and unless you can cut malingering down to the minimum, no scheme introduced can succeed.  I suggest to the Minister that it would pay to compensate these men on a just basis to secure their co-operation.  Even as men who are not employed at all, but who know the system and what it means to get the system going, they would probably, even after they left the service, give information and advice to whatever officers may be appointed by the unified management and that would be of much greater value to the State and national health insurance than the £20,000 or £30,000 this will cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey, in the concluding portion of his speech, made the point I intended to make. The Minister says that if he accepts the amendment it will cost £30,000 to provide for these 2,500 people.  I should like to emphasise the point Deputy Morrissey made, that I think it is certain that a large number of these men will have to be assimilated in the new society so that there will be a large proportion of them who will not have to be provided for.  It cannot cost the sum that the Minister stated, in view of the possibility nay, the probability, that a great many of these men will have to be assimilated in the new society.  I think, therefore, that the <Col N="1224" /> Minister might reasonably accept the amendment.  It will not, as I say, cost the amount he estimated, but even if it did, I think, as Deputy Morrissey argued, that a great case can be made for it.  These are the people who will suffer most from the unification of the societies.  We could all give instances of cases, as Deputy Morrissey did, of men who are acting as part-time agents in these societies.  I know myself of the case of a man who is incapacitated for any other form of work.  He has a very bad foot and can only go round in a cart, but he has done his work very well and to the satisfaction of his society.  If he is debarred from this work, I do not know where he is going to get alternative employment. Other Deputies could give similar instances.  As I said, it is almost certain that most of these men will have to be assimilated in the new society.  The society will have to find men to do this sort of work.  Why not, therefore, engage the men who were doing it before?  The number that will then be left will not be so great that it is going to cost what the Minister says to provide for them.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the figure given by the Minister last night and, possibly, the figure representing the estimated cost to cover the compensation to be paid to these agents on the basis of the amendment really represent the figure which would go to pay compensation to all the agents and all the employees now working for the different societies.  If that is so, I do not think it is a fair way of presenting the case against either this amendment or previous amendments asking for the payment of compensation to people who will lose their employment.  The Minister says that 2,500 is possibly the maximum number who would come within the terms of the amendment.  I suggest that it would not be unfair to say that at least 500 of these will have to be retained if the society is to be a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it at the very minimum.  On that basis, and on the basis that the average number of years' service of agents has been very <Col N="1225" /> low, I do not see how you could possibly arrive at a figure of £30,000. I am informed, and my information comes from people who have some knowledge of the working of approved societies, that the maximum cost of compensating, under the terms of this amendment, those who would have to go, would not exceed half the amount mentioned by the Minister, namely £15,000.  The basis of compensation laid down in the amendment is not unknown even in the case of servants of the State who retire.  The remuneration of part-time postmen at the expiration of their service is on the basis of one pound for every year of service. I am informed, and I believe it is correct, that unestablished people, like carpenters and labourers in the Board of Works, when they retire get a month's pay for every year of service. Presumably, the same basis applies to other unestablished servants of the State in other Departments.  Somebody appears to have frightened the Minister with figures which are not really reliable regarding the cost of compensation to those who would lose their part-time employment as a result of this legislation.  Although the previous Government was supposed to be reactionary, they always recognised in passing legislation that when men lost employment or remuneration, either from public companies or the State, compensation on a reasonable scale should be provided under the legislation. Many speeches have been quoted in this House, and I certainly read some of the Minister's own speeches which go to show that the Minister himself, when in opposition, was much more generous in his outlook than he is now.  I should like the Minister to look up a speech which he made in this House, supporting an amendment moved by me, making provision for compensation to the secretaries of insurance committees.  That amendment was carried by a majority of four, as a result of the Minister's eloquence, and as a result of the support given by the members of the Minister's Party at the time.</P>

      <P>I have a copy of part of one of them with me, but I would rather the Minister would read it himself than that I should be forced to read it for him.  It will I am sure remind him that he was in a much more generous mood in those days.  He was not then worrying so much as to where the money was to come from.  He was considering, I suppose, the justification or otherwise of making provision for those who would lose their part-time employment as a result of Government intervention.  Perhaps, as I say, the Minister would give an assurance that between this and the Report Stage he would look into the whole matter in the light of his own speeches in the past, and in the light of the speeches made by his Ministerial colleagues on other issues coming up under other Bills and affecting the same principle. I believe we can give the Minister time to look into the question in the light of those matters.  If the Minister is going to take up an adverse attitude I think we shall be forced to ask Deputies who walked with him and with us into the Division Lobby in support of similar proposals in, I think, 1929, to give reasons here, or to go in silence into the Lobby and reverse the attitude which they adopted in 1929 on the same issue.</P>

      <P>I think I have already said all I can say on this matter.  I should like to be more generous if the money were there.  If we could lay hands on any of the £3,000,000 that Deputy Morrissey referred to, not alone would those people get compensation but others would get more generous compensation than they have got; but that £3,000,000 cannot be touched.  As the Deputy knows, national health insurance and everybody connected <Col N="1227" /> with it would suffer materially in benefit if it were.  We are restricted for compensation purposes to the administration fund, and expenses under that administration fund have already been exceeded by societies.</P>

The administration fund, which is the only fund out of which we can get any money for this purpose, is already going to be depleted to such an extent that it may endanger the successful working of the unified society.  That is what I am informed will be the result of the compensation that we have already in this House agreed to give. I am sorry that I cannot go any further.</P>

      <P>With regard to the administration fund.  I agree with the Minister that certain societies&mdash;I do not think that there are very many; I should like to get the figures&mdash;have exceeded the amount which is set aside for administration.  Surely if there is any justification whatever for this Bill before the House, for unification and <Col N="1228" /> for reducing the number of societies from 65 to 1, it is that there should be a very substantial reduction in the administrative expenses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but those who were in favour of and so enthusiastic about unification told us not only during the course of this Bill but for the last four or five years&mdash; and particularly the National Health Insurance Commission&mdash;that there would be no doubt whatever that the saving would be very great in administration, and that we would be able to pay very generous compensation. The Minister knows as well as I do that the question of unification did not arise within the last twelve months, or within the last two years; it has been going on for years.  We know that the National Health Insurance Commission has thought of nothing else except unification for a number of years.  Are we now to be told that the saving in administrative expenses is going to be so small and the dividing line is going to be so thin that a matter of £20,000&mdash;not £20,000 per year but one sum of roughly £20,000, or, if the Minister likes, £30,000&mdash;is going to make all the difference between success and failure to the new society?  I am sure it would be very hard to convince even the Minister himself that that is so. Even if it were so the administration fund of the unified society is not for one year or two years.  It is for so long as the Act remains on the Statute Book.  The Minister, if I may say so with all respect, was arguing in his last speech as if the administration fund was going to last only for one year, and that the year in which compensation was being paid out.  The Minister knows as well as I do, and probably much better, that that is not so.  I go further and say that, even if it were so, for the sake of £20,000, neither the Minister nor this House would be justified, if I may put it that way, in inflicting an injustice upon men who have done more to build up this service than any other officials connected with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I should like to make, arising out of the remarks of the last speaker, and that is in connection with the number of societies who have dipped into the administration fund beyond what they were entitled to.  I think it will be found on analysis that those are societies who did not engage a sufficient number of the sub-agents or part-time agents for whom appeal is being made in this amendment.  The real hardship would be that the men who had made a success of their societies and drawn small remuneration are now to be thrown on the scrap heap because a few societies who employed very few of this type of people had got insolvent.  I can confidently say that if a plebiscite of the insured people were taken throughout the length and breadth of the country I am sure they would be in favour of giving compensation, irrespective of the cost, to the people who succeeded in building up this insurance industry.  The work of those people has been dealt with by the various speakers.  They have been espionage agents, compelling people throughout the country who were hostile to the Act to conform to it. The amount of service that they rendered, in that way, in bringing people into insurance will have to be continued on some similar lines if there is to be any hope for the future.  The unified society will not be the success that is expected unless agents are employed in it in a similar capacity to those who were employed in the approved societies throughout the country.  I hope that Deputy Davin is wrong in his estimate that 500 people will be the number required.  I think in the 26 counties 500 would be a very small number.  I have experience of those societies, and I have been a member of a committee of management of one society that has been working over 11 counties. You would want to secure a force like the Civic Guard to do the job that these agents have done for national health insurance in the past.  And they have got very little thanks for it.  The acid test of the Minister's sympathy is to be found in his <Col N="1230" /> attitude towards this amendment.  He says that it would cost £30,000.  That is his computation of the amount that would be involved, but I say, having regard to the nature of the work that these people have done, that is a very meagre amount.  The real kernel of this whole case is, does the Minister believe that these people are entitled to compensation?  Does he not think they are as much entitled to compensation as the higher officials are? If he believes they are entitled to compensation, and if he believes the insured people are prepared to pay them compensation, even to the extent of reducing the statutory benefits, as I believe, if necessary, people would do, then he ought to pay adequate compensation to those officials who lose their positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>From the observations of the Minister, I gather that he fully realises the hardship that will be caused to those part-time employees by the provision of the Bill which deprives them of compensation.  The only reason he has hardened his heart against the appeal made to him is the fact that there is no money in the administration fund to provide the necessary compensation.  But it is to be remembered that this particular hardship, with which everyone sympathises, is brought about by the proposal for unification embodied in this Bill and put forward by the Government and, incidentally, I may say, supported by Deputy Norton and his colleagues.  They gave their benediction and their votes to this scheme of unification which has brought about these hardships.  I suggest that as it is in connection with the State's action towards approved societies that the hardship is being involved, and because the State itself, by reason of these proposals, is going to make a substantial saving in administration expenses that it would be a generous and a just thing for the State to pay this compensation.  If the administration fund is not sufficient to pay compensation to those men who undoubtedly are going to suffer a hardship, then some part of the savings that are to be effected by the <Col N="1231" /> State, and which will be recurrent, should be applied in paying people, who are hit so very hard, such compensation as everybody admits they are entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, upon this amendment and many others, is relying upon the argument old Mother Hubbard used very effectively to the dog.  She told the dog the cupboard was bare and he could get nothing. I think the Minister overdid the point about the administration fund.  In 1912 the administration fund was 3/5 per person per annum.  It was then fixed by regulation, and it is fixed by regulation to-day.  There is no difficulty whatever in increasing the amount.  In 1912 it was 3/5.  In 1933 it amounted to 4/5 per person per annum, an increase of 30 per cent. between the years 1912 and 1933.  When we consider that the volume of the work has more than doubled and the cost of claims has increased and that many regulations have added to the complexity of administration, that postage has increased, and that all other charges have increased, this 30 per cent increase in administration charges this year, as compared with 1912, is very low indeed.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister increasing the administration grant by 35 or 40 or 50 per cent. as compared with 1912; and if he did so it would be only reasonable in all the circumstances of the case.  The Minister says that this will cost £30,000.  I am rather sceptical as to the amount, but let us assume the figure is correct and that £30,000 is the sum that will be involved in paying compensation to those part-time people.  My amendment seeks to have these people compensated and the Minister says it will take this one sum of £30,000.  As Deputy Morrissey says, while you will only have one payment of £30,000, the administration fund is going on and will continue under your scheme of national health insurance.  We need not even ask the administration fund to bear this £30,000 at all.  The method by which the money is to be raised, by way of compensation, is set out in Section 22.  There is nothing <Col N="1232" /> to prevent that money being borrowed from the Insurance Fund.  If the Minister agrees to pay this £30,000 necessary to pay compensation to those people who will lose their livelihood as a result of the passing of this Bill it could be raised in that way.  If the Minister is prepared to look into that matter, between now and the Report Stage, we should be ready to withdraw the amendment at this stage in order to enable him to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been looking over a list of local agents, mostly in the South of Ireland.  I find that they do not get anything like a livelihood, even for one month in the year, out of their part-time service in insurance and, therefore, I do not see any reason for this compensation.  I have a list here for one county, where the employment of these people is set out as also their normal occupation, and the amounts they got in 1931-32.  In one case the amount is £16 9s. 0d.; in another £8 13s. 3d.; in others, £4, £6, £11 15s. 6d.; £1 9s. 3d., £3 6s. 7d. and so on.  On another list I have for a county in Munster the figures are:&mdash;£9 13s. 6d.  One man is put down as £150 a year, but he is a full time agent and is entitled to compensation.  The return gives other figures as £29 13s. 6d; £10 12s. 0d.; £4 11s. 0d.; £8 11s. 0d.; £25; £13.  In another county the figures are £1 11s. 8d; £1 5s. 0d.; £10 11s. 0d.; £8 0s. 0d.  There is nothing like full-time, or whole-time employment even for a month in most of these examples that I have quoted. There is a representative from the North of Ireland receiving £16 3s. 0d. There are several teachers on this list, one getting £16 3s. 0d. and another £4 11s. 0d. per year.  On that basis, I think no case has been made for compensating people who merely got casual employment and pay of that kind.  I do say there are some border-line cases.  I say that as the result of the speech made by Deputy Norton on Second Reading.  He cited the case of a man who had £1 from one source and 18s. from another.  There are border-line cases like that.  Probably hardship will arise in those cases but <Col N="1233" /> you cannot legislate for border-line cases.  From what I have said and from the particulars I have just now quoted, it will be seen that the amount of money the vast majority of these agents get from this source is a mere bagatelle in their annual income.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 31:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>Where a person employed by an approved society at the date of transfer was not given employment by the unified society then the period between the said date of transfer and the appointed day shall be taken into account in the calculation of his compensation (if any) as if he had been employed up to the appointed day.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to provide equal treatment for all employees of approved societies who are not taken over by the unified society.  The Bill provides a period of three years within which the various approved societies must be taken over.  It is, of course, obvious that the different approved societies will be taken over at different times.  Some of them will be taken over immediately, some later, and some not until the last minute.  The result will be that in the case of a society which is taken over immediately, or almost immediately, an employee of that society who does not get employment in the unified society will be deprived of his employment, and consequently the period during which he might have been allowed to stay on, if it was not taken over until some period later, will not count towards compensation. It would appear rather unfair that in the case of one person who is taken over immediately he loses three years' salary and loses three years' towards compensation.  The proposal embodied in the amendment is that all employees of approved societies will have their periods reckoned practically from the date of this Bill until the appointed day, so that everyone will have equal treatment and an equal period of time counted towards compensation.</P>

      <P>I take it that this amendment would mean compensating some official who would not be taken over for a period of service he did not give.  The officials will be compensated for the service they gave from the date of the transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point to be raised in support of the amendment is that a person's compensation should not be dependent on the mere chance of his transfer.  One person may be taken over immediately after the Bill is passed, but another person may not be taken over for three years. The person not taken over for three years gets these three years added to his service for the purposes of compensation.  The man taken over immediately loses the possibility of retaining his employment for the period of three years, and also loses the chance of having the three years reckoned for the purposes of compensation.  This is, if you like, only a rough method of dispensing rough justice all round, so that the <Col N="1237" /> matter may not be left purely to chance.</P>

      <P>I see no case for accepting this amendment at all.  It has been the practice up to the present that the Act was carried on from one year to another which necessitated the introduction in June of each year of an Act continuing it for another year.  I do not see any sense in it at all.  It causes a certain amount of uncertainty because nobody knows whether, in fact, the Act is going to be continued, and it led sometimes to a rush of applications at one period of the year and was a very unsatisfactory position.  That position arose in the past in view of the fact that the Government was not altogether satisfied with the Act and, indeed, I think that each year, when the continuing Act was introduced, the Minister announced that it was the last time it was to be introduced.  Now that we have made up our minds as to the utility of the system we propose to continue it for five years so that there will be that period during which the Act will be in continuous operation and all uncertainty removed on that score.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Bill being introduced each year is concerned, it must be remembered that there is a considerable amount of money involved.  There is practically a five years' lease in this Bill, and the House is entitled to know to what extent its commitments are involved and what is <Col N="1242" /> the amount of money.  It has cost the State a considerable amount of money. When it had the five years' run from the beginning it is quite possible that some public attention would have been drawn to it, but the House ought to be made aware each year as to the likelihood of its continuance and the policy connected with its continuance.  The fact that such a long period has elapsed without any applications being made rather mystifies me in connection with the Minister's statement that there is a rush.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the figures on the Second Reading discussion. There is no case for the one year period.  Full information is given to the House.  There is a quarterly return of all applications granted, together with a return of any advances from the Exchequer, which has been made on foot of guarantees and the amounts recovered by a realisation of the assets.  The only other information that might be given would be a review of the working of the Act.  That can be equally well done, I think, on the Minister's Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a practical disadvantage, and that is the element of uncertainty and, consequently, there is at the relevant periods of the year either a demand that applications should be speedily considered and dealt with or else the withholding of applications, because there did not seem to be any prospect of getting them through in time.  That has been the experience, I think.  I see no case at all, if we decide that this type of legislation is desirable, why it should not be put on the same footing as all other types of legislation &mdash;that is, be introduced and given the effect of law for a definite period or until repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been continued from year to year for a period of seven or eight years.  I recollect those periods of uncertainty mentioned by the Minister.  They were speedily resolved by the then Minister introducing an Act to continue trade loans for another year.  Our experience in connection with moneys advanced under trade loans legislation has not been particularly happy.  I hope that the experience in the future will be better.  The corrective of having the Act introduced yearly will not interfere with any person who intends to engage in business and has a good <Col N="1244" /> sound proposition to put before the Minister.  Is it likely that a person will delay until March or April next before putting forward a proposal which would then put upon the Minister the onus of continuing the Bill for another year.  I do not think that is likely at all.  Having had seven or eight years' experience of this Act I see no great disadvantage in having it introduced yearly instead of passing it now for a period of five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the position, this measure, if it were to be in operation for 12 months, would come up annually under the Expiring Laws Bill.  If there was any particular issue that a Deputy wished to raise in connection with these trade loans he would then have an opportunity of doing so and of getting definite information from the Minister. The Minister's alternative to that is, that such an issue can be raised on the Estimate for his Department.  My difficulty in connection with that procedure, as I pointed out on the Second Reading of the Bill, is that a great many matters are raised on a Minister's Estimate about which we get no information at all.  It is quite within the Minister's jurisdiction to reply to certain points raised as well as to refuse to reply to others.  Consequently, we may raise some particular issue on the Estimate for the Minister's Department, and for reasons of time, or some other cause, we may get no information whatsoever. We have had an unfortunate experience in connection with this Act, due to the fact that a large sum of money has been lost.  It is, therefore, eminently desirable that in future a strict scrutiny should be exercised by the Dáil over the moneys advanced. That is all we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All that sounds very well, but this money was lost two or three years ago.  In fact, there has not <Col N="1245" /> been that scrutiny which the Deputy speaks of by the Dáil, either before or since.  What happened was that a yearly Act was introduced at the end of the summer session.  It was rushed through all its stages in the Dáil in the one day and then sent off to the Seanad.  Because of that you could not have the scrutiny or the discussion the Deputy speaks of, or that he thinks should take place.  If the Deputy wants to scrutinise anything in connection with this he can do that at any time.  There are quarterly returns issued and an annual statement published, and there is always the opportunity of getting information by way of Parliamentary questions. A motion can also be put on the Order Paper.  Deputies, as well, have the opportunity of raising anything they like on the Estimate for the Minister's Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows quite well that if one puts down a Parliamentary question the amount of information given is exceedingly limited. One cannot scrutinise loans issued under this Act by way of Parliamentary question unless one raises the matter on the motion for the adjournment, and that is not desirable.  With regard to the Minister's point of putting down a special motion on the Order Paper, there are so many motions down for discussion that one could never know when a motion dealing with a matter of this kind would come up for discussion.  I have seen motions appear on the Order Paper for months, and no one appears to know when they are likely to be reached.  That is not a desirable method of dealing with this.  I am speaking now as a business man, and I submit that what I am suggesting is necessary in the interests of the State. This is a commercial transaction on the part of the State.  It is necessary that the State, and those representing it, should scrutinise those loans at intervals as banks and other bodies dealing with money do in the ordinary course of business.  All that the Dáil asks is that such scrutiny should be exercised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before paragraph (c) to insert a new paragraph reading:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No loan shall be so guaranteed or made amounting to more than 25 per cent. of the net resources of the borrower.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> The amendment which has just been defeated was an attempt to restore a safeguard which in the past has proved ineffective.  The amendment in my name is an attempt to provide a new safeguard.  In moving it I do not wish to tie myself to the figure of 25 per cent. nor necessarily to the expression &ldquo;net resources&rdquo; if some more suitable expression can be found. What I mean by &ldquo;net resources&rdquo; is the surplus of assets over liabilities, whether of an individual or a corporation. The need for some safeguard of this kind seems to me to be obvious.  The record with regard to these loans and guarantees is exceedingly bad.  We have heard that out of the first £340,000 advanced or guaranteed £215,000 was lost.  If we went on the same proportion in regard to this additional million there would be another £600,000 lost.  That being so, I think we ought to make a serious attempt to protect the interests of the taxpayer.  When Deputy McGilligan was speaking on the Second Reading of this Bill, he made a statement that there was only one loan fully repaid of all the loans made.  I presume that that means all the loans made prior to 1932.  He also said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If one leaves out the loans that were made to public utility concerns, there has not been a successful loan yet.</P>
    <P>He then asked:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Has there been a case of a company keeping its commitments up to the schedule first arranged?  I doubt if there is a single case.</P>
    <P>He also remarks:&mdash;</P>
    <P>...in the main the concerns operating on Trade Loans (Guarantee) moneys have not alone that facility but are also nearly all in tariffed industries.</P>
    <P>Later on he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I certainly think that if the test on which the Committee has been obliged to rule their decision was this: What would they do with their own money?, we would not have even the £350,000 or £400,000 of State money granted, but that it would be much more nearly one-third of that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> It seems to me that the root trouble with all these loans and guarantees has been that there has not been enough clearness of thought as to the principles on which the loans or guarantees should be made.  We have heard that, in every case the Advisory Committee was consulted, they passed judgment on the loan or guarantee and agreed to it.  But it is no good having an Advisory Committee, whether it consists of civil servants or business men, unless they have some sort of notion as to the principles they are to go on.  As a matter of fact, the way, apparently, in which these loans or guarantees were made was so speculative that the advice of a committee of business men would not be of much use, if any.  If you go on a visit to Monte Carlo and decide to spend a couple of weeks speculating on the roulette tables, the fact that you have a committee of hard-headed business men to consult does not make your chances any better than if you went alone, and I think that is the parallel that applies to what is going on in connection with these loans and guarantees.  It is a fearfully dangerous thing to make a 12 years' loan at all.  It is a terribly long period during which to tie up money, and the fact of this Bill being subject to reconsideration, after one year or five years, seems to me to be of much less importance than the fact that these loans are for such very long periods, and that there is at present no guiding principle as to the proportion which such loans should bear to the capital of the person or institution borrowing.</P>
    <P>I suggest that some sort of measure, some sort of yard-stick, ought to be agreed upon.  If 25 per cent. is thought too little, let us have 50 per cent., and if it is thought desirable to proportion the loan rather to the amount of capital invested in the particular undertaking than to the total resources of the individual, or company, that might be a matter for discussion and consideration as to which was preferable.  I am personally more attracted by the idea of proportioning them to the total resources, because, if a man has £100,000 and has £10,000 in a particular business, it is naturally safer to give <Col N="1251" /> him a bigger loan in that business than the man who has nothing in it at all. It is conceivable that a man might wish to keep, for reasons of his own, part of his capital employed elsewhere.  The former Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts have turned out badly, and actually they are being enlarged by the present Act, because hitherto certain facilities have been available only for corporations and not for individuals.  Now, those are being made to individuals also.  Hitherto there has been a limitation which prevented such loans being made for working capital.  There had to be fixed assets against them.  That limitation is being removed, and all that makes it much more essential that there should be a safeguard of this type introduced.</P>
    <P>At the present moment, for all we know to the contrary, a man may get a guarantee for a company which has no money at all.  It may be that the plant has been erected with borrowed money, and he may come to the State to get money to enable it to go ahead. I suggest that, when making these loans, the principle ought to be that, even if the business turns out to be a failure, if it turns out to be an unprofitable business, the State should get its money back.  We should not take it for granted that, if the business fails, the State loses its money.  That is not the way in which loans are made by a bank or by any business concern.  You only get your modest return for all loans.  It is not as if you were investing and taking a half share in profits and the situation ought not to be that, if the business is a roaring success, you get your money back, and if the business is a failure you lose all your money.  I suggest that, normally, however great our desire to encourage Irish industries, we should not have money lent to industries at the expense of the State unless there is reasonable ground for believing that the State will get that money back, even should the industry not be a success, and that there is something solid there by which the State can be recouped even if the industry turns out not to be profitable and has ultimately to be abandoned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that an amendment of this kind would be most undesirable, indeed, and it is probably moved by the Deputy, because he has not quite grasped the procedure which is followed in the administration of the Trade Loans Acts.  Each loan must be considered on its merits.  I think that is the first cardinal principle that we must get accepted.  An application is made and it has to be considered on its merits.  It would be entirely undesirable that a loan, which was associated with an industrial enterprise, which had every promise of success behind it, and was as sound as any likely to be undertaken in the country, could not be guaranteed because of the insertion in the Act of some limitation of this kind.  The practice has been, undoubtedly, to regard 50 per cent. of the total capital requirements of the project as the maximum in respect of which a guarantee could be given, but even that maximum might be departed from on occasion and might be departed from quite justifiably on occasion.</P>
      <P>In every different industry, the proportion of capital which would be represented by the fixed assets to the total capital will vary.  In one industry you might have 80 per cent. fixed and 20 per cent. working capital and, in another industry, you might have quite the reverse.  The main things to secure are: (1) that industrial development is going to be helped and (2) that the State has reasonable security for its guarantee.  I do not know that the second consideration can always apply because a substantial amount of money might be invested in the erection of a factory and its equipment with machinery, but, if the industry fails, the amount that would be realised by the sale of the factory and the machinery would, of course, be substantially less than their cost, even though it might be a new factory and new machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, I think, also, is misreading the history of the Acts.  I do not think the Acts were bad at all.  I do not think that a mistake was made when this legislation was first introduced. I think that many mistakes <Col N="1253" /> were made in the administration of it, but, even if that had not been the case, I think that the history of the firms that were assisted under it would probably have been no different, in any event.  I do not want to say it in any party spirit, but, in fact, there were a number of industrial failures up to 1932 and not all were enterprises which had been assisted under the Trade Loans Acts.  The circumstances of that period must be taken into account, and, if you take out of the list of failures the big ones such as the Glass Bottle Works, the Drogheda Meat Factory and Alesbury Brothers, the total amount lost becomes quite small in comparison with the total guaranteed.  I do not think there is any necessity at this stage to go into the history of the guaranteed loans that were secured by these three concerns, but I do think that the Administration at the time were open to criticism.  They were, in fact, criticised by the Committee of Public Accounts, as well as by members of all Parties in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Different circumstances now exist. Concerns that might have been regarded as doubtful 12 or 15 months ago are now making substantial profits and there is no reason to think that situation will not continue.  It is desirable that the State should be certain of getting back its money if the guarantee has to be made good. Even if this limitation that is now suggested had been in the original Acts, and if the amounts guaranteed in respect of the Glass Bottle Factory, the Drogheda Meat Factory and Messrs.  Alesbury had been only 25 per cent. of the total investment, the 25 per cent. would not have been recovered.  Nothing was recovered in the majority of cases.  If there was anything recovered, it was a very small amount indeed.  That was something that arose out of the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>In my view these Acts are good, and they can be used in a manner that will facilitate industrial development here.  Any restriction of the kind suggested by the Deputy would only militate against such development. <Col N="1254" /> If the Acts are wisely administered, and if the assistance under them is confined to the types of cases that deserve to be assisted, we can turn them into an instrument for good and we can protect the State against all reasonable prospect of loss.  No one can estimate the circumstances that may exist ten years ahead.  These loans will be for ten or 12 years, and circumstances may arise in the course of that period which we could not possibly foresee when we decide to give a guarantee.  I think there should be no limitation at all.  The procedure laid down is so elaborate and is so designed to protect the State that the main complaint against the Acts is that it is almost impossible to get a guaranteed loan.  Anyone who has experience of the attitude of industrialists towards this legislation will agree that that complaint is voiced much more often than any other.  An applicant has to undergo a rigorous examination in regard to his proposals and a considerable time elapses before any application is decided upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  We get a charge upon all the assets of the concern, even though we guarantee a loan of only half of the total capital invested.  Half is the general practice, but it can be departed from if occasion seems to justify it. We give either a lower guarantee or a higher guarantee.  It is most undesirable to have a rigid rule in the Act.  Anyone who has any experience in this respect will see at once that to tie oneself up in that way would be to limit one's usefulness.  An Act could be badly administered with the 25 per cent. maximum the Deputy suggests, and it could be badly administered even with a 10 per cent. maximum. You could introduce a safeguard by inserting words that will prevent the possibility of loss by bad administration, but assuming that the administration of the Act is going to be sound, and all the indices point in that direction, then it is much better not to be tied up so that you can deal with all the cases that deserve to be dealt with.  Ordinarily speaking, the safeguards are regarded as too severe and too numerous, with the result that delays, vexatious from the point of view of the applicant, often occur.  A long time elapses between the making of an application and its consideration, and during that time the applicant has to deal with every possible kind of criticism that could be advanced against his application.</P>

      <P>This raises to a certain extent the whole future administration of these Acts and their utility in the State.  Ministers thought fit to pass certain commendation upon the introduction of the previous Acts and certain criticism on their administration. I want to examine what the Minister means by bad administration. He mentioned three cases, Alesburys, the glass bottle factory and the Drogheda Dead Meat Factory, in which the State lost money and he said these three cases were criticised by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>I do not think he is right in regard to the third.  With regard to the other two, what was the criticism?  It was that under the old Act administration had been such as the Minister is now going to establish.  It was not anything more than that.  A certain position had been accepted for the security of the State's money.  That the State should have been put in a position where it should have no preferential security was what was complained of.  But under this Bill the State is not getting any preferential security at all.  The Minister is taking entire responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the meaning of bad administration about which the Minister has spoken?  Let us take it with regard to these three cases.  Does it mean that once loans were advanced on the security given that there was not sufficient care in looking after the business?  Because if that is so there is a complete misconception of the old Act.  There was no condition and no responsibility on the part of the Government to look after this business after the loan was given.  There is <Col N="1258" /> nothing in the old Act about that.  At any rate it is quite impossible for civil servants to administer business and the Minister knows that.  Where was the bad administration?  The Minister made use of the phrase &ldquo;vexatious delays in the granting of the money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I remember the time when the case of the Drogheda Dead Meat Factory came up.  There were investigations into the application.  The Advisory Committee were not satisfied that the application came within the heads of the Act and then there were delays and I heard the old complaint about Freemason influence.  I asked them to remake their scheme and they did remake it.  They were then told to get more working capital and there were further delays for some months.  Then we agreed that the thing should have a chance.  There was a particular doubt in our minds.  There was this thing in favour of the application that there had been much talk in this country for years about the necessity of having a dead meat industry and the insurance that such a factory would be against an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>Advice was given to us as to the running of the Drogheda dead meat industry, and we began to realise from the very beginning that the care and attention that was paid to the purchase of cattle and particularly the care and attention that was paid to the marketing in England were going either to make for the success of failure of this business.  With a great deal of reluctance&mdash;because it looked like interference in private business&mdash;we did investigate who it was that was going to be the real manager and we made considerable reservations with regard to individuals.  In the end we refused to accept one person who was proposed as manager.  However, the money was given.  Under two points that had been put up&mdash;that there was not enough working capital and these other matters I have stated&mdash;there were delays.  Working capital was afterwards raised after the State had advanced the money and this let the State in for more loss.</P>
    <P>The industry failed simply and entirely because there was not a <Col N="1259" /> manager fit to live on the premises, to look after the cattle as they came in, to see whether there were good purchases made and to look after the selling end of it in the Smithfield Market. Instead of that there were as to the delays made in the sanctioning of the money stories about Freemason influence. The Minister speaks now about vexatious delays.  If there had been more &ldquo;vexatious delays&rdquo; those individuals who sank their money in that factory might have been protected from loss.</P>
    <P>As to what the Minister means by bad administration, I submit there was no bad administration on the part of the State.  But whatever conditions there were then, whatever obligations were insisted on, these obligations are now entirely removed from the Minister.  He is swimming out now into new adventures entirely on his own responsibility.  These conditions not so much to get reasonable security for the State as to get individuals properly interested in the business are not now obligations on the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Ringsend glass bottle case was badly administered!  The loan was criticised by the Public Accounts Committee on the ground that it was not within the four corners of the Act. Here we had a case of a body of laymen, on the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, another layman, telling me that the loan was not within the four corners of the Act.  I happened to have the advice of three separate Attorneys-General on the matter and I felt on that point that I was basing myself well.  I did not care what the Comptroller and Auditor-General said on the matter of law.  I had the opinion of the legal advisers of the Government on a point of law rather than the opinion of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and a body of laymen on the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
    <P>But at any rate the limitation was there and that limitation is now being removed in this Bill.  The criticism as regards the administration is the opinion of a body of laymen against that of the views of three Attorneys-General. <Col N="1260" /> That cannot be said in the future because the Minister is removing the handicap in the lending of moneys.  What were the prospects of success for the glass bottle business? It is quite clear to anyone that (1) a tariff on merchandise bottles in this country and (2) a particular measure passed in this House which insisted on the capacity of the bottle being marked and that that marking under the regulations we established here could be more cheaply done by the bottle makers here than elsewhere were important factors.  The market for one line of bottles seemed to be a good security for its success.</P>
    <P>But, as a matter of fact, the factory broke down when there were orders lying on its shelves.  The biggest cause and the chief explanation of that breakdown was because there was sabotage on the part of the workers. Indeed there was most expert sabotage. There was the case of a gas tap turned on at one time and so fixed with regard to time that it required considerable expert knowledge to find out why the heat was not at the proper point.  That was not merely sabotage, but sabotage done by an expert in sabotage.  That was because there was a collection of men at Ringsend who held that there was no bottle made in the world equal to the old bottle made at Ringsend and these men were against the introduction of machinery. A number of men came in to me and told me that there was never a factory in the world where machinery had been introduced that had not failed. These men had the same idea as the men who went about breaking machinery 100 years ago.  It was that sort of mentality and a certain amount of bad management of the concern that brought that factory to an end. Where has the State mismanaged? Where has there been bad administration on the part of the Department? If there is anything it was on the one point that certain limitations in the Act were not adhered to.  That was the criticism by the Public Accounts Committee.  I will deal with that now.</P>

      <P>No.  That again was said.  I told the Committee that I had some doubts about it as a business proposition and I asked the Committee to see me.  They had a certain consultation with me.  In what I am saying now I am open to correction, as I am only speaking from memory. They came to me and they said that they had to weigh this as a business proposition and they told me they had grave doubts about it as such, but they sent no formal rejection to me.  I never gave a loan where the Committee had opposed its being given. The Committee knew that I had given that guarantee publicly.  They met me to discuss the matter of this Drogheda loan.  After the discussion they said: &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;  They took the view of the proposition as a future insurance against a foot and mouth outbreak and also a means of trying to put on a fairly good basis a thing that had been spoken about so long&mdash;the question of having a dead meat business in this country.  They said &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;  I do not say that they gave it their blessing in any sort of a cordial way.  It was a moot case and they came to consult me about it.</P>
      <P>Now there is the case of Alesbury Brothers.  What was the position in the case of Alesbury Bros?  There was some question of the payment of the old company so as to get reconstruction of the company.  Again the only point that was queried by the Public Accounts Committee was the legal question as to the application being within the four corners of the Act.  And again I had advice on that point from our legal advisers.  I had my doubts about that business as a business proposition but that was recommended by the Committee.  That is queried by the Public Accounts Committee on a legal point as against the advice of our legal advisers.  Why did that fail?  Bad management on the part of a person who is now trying to manage the State. That is all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not taking it that I was accused of falsehood, because I cannot be accused of falsehood in that particular case.  There are the three cases picked out by the Minister.  I want the Minister to attend to what I said the last day and which I now repeat, that if one leaves out the loan to the Dundalk Harbour Commissioners, the loan to the Waterford Harbour Commissioners and the Mitchelstown Co-operative Society, which paid off its loan in about one and a half years, I do not know that it can be said that there is a concern which is at the moment meeting its liabilities in regard to interest payment and repayment of principal as arranged on the first schedule.  I made that statement before and one of those concerned thought fit to write a letter to the papers afterwards.  The last phrase in the letter admitted what I had stated, because it wound up with the statement that this person knew of his own firm and some others which were, not making payments according to the original schedule, but making them according to an amended schedule.  That is my point.  They had to get amendments.  The schedule of repayments and the payment of interest and the rest were always arranged after consultation with them at the beginning.  I suppose that is part of the vexatious delay, part of <Col N="1263" /> the hardship to which they were put. They had to wait until these things were arranged because we were trying to deal with them in a businesslike way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to get this clear, that although I do think we tried as well as we could to procure reasonable protection for the State money advanced, that was not our main object.  Our main object was to get the business successfully going.  We always felt when we went into this that unless we were only to give a loan of so much money as would eventually result from the sale of the assets at scrap value we could not get security.  We never let it go so low as that.  What we did look for was to get the corporation or group of individuals deeply involved with their own money, because we wanted to get their personal effort, and whatever business capacity there was, put into the business.  That is the main thing.  You cannot really look for security to the fixed assets unless you go to the point that you only lend what you would realise at a scrap sale afterwards.  The best security you can get is the security that the business is run as well as the person was capable of running it, and you get that by getting the person to put his own money into it. That is no longer here and that is the great defect in this proposal.  The Minister said that even if we had Deputy MacDermot's amendment in operation in respect of the old trade loan guarantees and that on the average only 20 per cent. of the loan was secured by fixed assets and that we had looked to the industrialist to supply even 80 per cent. of the entire capital, even then if the business collapsed we would not have recovered the 20 per cent. from the assets.  Even the 20 per cent. would be lost.  So it would.  That is possibly an exaggerated statement.  I do not know if normally we recovered as little as 20 per cent.  That, however, is not the point.  That is not the aim that there should be behind these Acts. The aim should be to get the successful working of industries.  The best way to get the State money protected is not to go on the basis of estimating <Col N="1264" /> the percentage to be put up by the State and then estimating the percentage to be put up by the person on a fixed basis, because you will not get that.  That percentage will be far too low for the ordinary loan.  You must see that the corporation or group of individuals put a considerable sum of money into it.  When it comes to the point of the Drogheda Meat Factory when it depended on whether the man was in his premises at seven o'clock in the morning, instead of taking the nine o'clock train from Amiens Street, the man that has his own business will be on the premises at seven o'clock, while the man operating with State money, when a cold morning comes, will not bother about it.  You must get his effort involved and his capacity engaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy's point not be met by providing that the guarantee or the loan should not exceed 50 per cent. of the total amount invested in the business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nearer to it. You will have to insist that a person invests a sum of money in the business, not that he has any resources which must be involved in the business.  I think the Deputy's amendment can be changed, but the principle has not met with any acceptance from the Minister &mdash;none at all.  He must have principal to lend for the plant, machinery and working capital.  In the end, there is no hold on the individual in these circumstances.  That is what I object to.  I think the whole thing is very much of a gamble.  We recognised it as such when we introduced this Act.  I think in my first speech in 1924 I said that.  It is as big a gamble as tariffs. It has this advantage over tariffs, that whatever loss occurs is seen at once and you can be more or less finished and done with it at a certain time; whereas if you tariff an inefficient industry that only means that the charge on the population, instead of being indicated by a sum of £50,000 over two or three years, is an annual charge which is hidden, nobody having any idea whether the business is going well or not because it can lumber along in an inefficient way under a protective tariff.  Although it is a gamble I think <Col N="1265" /> this way is to be preferred in dealing with industry to the haphazard tariff business.</P>
      <P>The Minister is clear that these concerns are profit making.  I wonder could he get a bank to adopt that point of view?  Has he ever approached a bank to know for what sum it would allow the State to off-load the remaining trade loans guarantee cases in the present tariff conditions?  If the Minister thinks that these are profit-making concerns where obviously they were not, that would be an interesting investigation to make to find out for what sum in respect of the loans on moneys previously guaranteed, would any finance corporation, any investing corporation, or bank take on the remainder of the loans.  It might be an eye-opener as to what he considers to be profit-making concerns.</P>
      <P>In the end we got the criticism that in the old days it was almost impossible to get a loan.  It was not almost impossible to get a loan.  Quite a number of these things went through quickly, relative to the documents which had to be examined, the resources to be brought into them, and the examination there had to be as to the prospects of the business.  Of course the tremendous complaint was that people were not able to get a loan.  I do not know now what the calculation is, but it is on the files of the Department. There must have been close upon 1,000 applications in the early years of these Acts.  I doubt if 100 or even 50 went to the advisory committee because there were 900 foolish applications. People wrote up to say &ldquo;I understand you have an Act under which you can grant money.  I want some, as I am going to run such and such a business.&rdquo;  That was the type of appeal which came and which the Minister is going to get with greater frequency than that with which I got them because all the conditions are gone now and he can not merely guarantee but grant moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to say that it was almost impossible to get a loan.  You cannot say that, because the implication there is of terrific meticulous examination, and in the same breath say that there is bad administration; the two things <Col N="1266" /> are not compatible.  I think quite a good line was steered as between the two extremes of delay and of coming to sudden and ill considered decisions. If the Minister is taking that as his headline, that there were vexatious delays, that it was almost impossible to get a loan, and that it was because of the old restrictions, then I think he is definitely out for a big gamble on this business.  At any rate it is surely worth while his taking some hint of the experience that there has been before.  It is on the files.  He can disassociate it entirely from individuals. He can deal with it in conjunction with the officials who were previously dealing with this matter, and find out what the difficulties were. I think he will find that the difficulties were mainly in the people who got the loans.  It can be definitely said that there was scrutiny, and yet the record is what has been referred to here, that there has been so much money lost.  I should like to see some amendment put in.  Twenty-five per cent. is far too low.  It will probably restrict to a very great extent indeed any dealings under this Act at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite understand the extreme anxiety on the part of Deputy MacDermot and Deputy McGilligan.  Those two gentlemen are so anxious to relieve and end unemployment that I can quite understand their anxiety to throw forward their so-called safeguards, which are really obstructions in the way of getting industries going in this country.  We are in an entirely different position now and industries are in an entirely different position now to what they were even twelve months ago.  They have now a five years' guarantee that they have a sympathetic Government which is going to see them through. That is an entirely different position. We know what their position was before.  We heard Deputy McGilligan talking here about firms that had got a loan under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act and could not pay that back.  We know why.  We know, for instance, why the waterproof factory in Glanmire found it difficult to repay their loan.  We know they had a difficulty in repaying it and <Col N="1267" /> we know why&mdash;because we had a Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time who had so little knowledge of the matters with which he was dealing that he put a tariff on material coming in which was not made in this country, and placed the Irish firm in the position, to put it in plain words, of having a preference given in this country to British made material as against the Irish material.  We had a definite proof of that&mdash;a 25 per cent. tariff on waterproofs.  We know the change and we can see the change. We can see that firm on its feet now. We can see that firm employing from 100 to 130 people.  It was closed down for four months before Fianna Fáil came into office to reopen it.  I know the handicaps, because I have been week after week with the Department of Industry and Commerce and elsewhere looking for trade loans for people who were anxious to start industries in this country, but found they had not sufficient capital for the job, and found that because of the red tape that was provided under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act they could not get ahead.  I know one man whom I brought up here some five months ago.  He was anxious to start a spade and shovel factory.  He came up here and found it practically impossible to get any loan under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  He went back and sold the home which he had made for himself and his wife.  He sold it for £750 and put that £750 into the industry.  At the present moment he has 18 hands employed and is making money.  Those are facts.  If that man could be given a trade loan of £500 or £600 he would provide employment for from 60 to 70 men at smithwork.  We know the manner in which, within the last nine or ten years, motor cars and lorries have driven blacksmiths practically out of existence.  They are walking around now idle, on the dole or begging.  I quite realise the anxiety of Deputy McGilligan and Deputy MacDermot to bring their jeremiah prophecies into effect by trying to introduce here not safeguards but obstructions.  I quite realise it.  We know the facts: we can see the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> I am glad that the Minister is not accepting this amendment, or any other amendment which is going to hamper us in putting industry on its feet here. I consider that the money that has to be thrown away each year on unemployment relief grants would be far better spent in starting industries in those towns if possible.  For instance, you see £3,000 or £4,000 spent on unemployment relief, spent on digging up good roads to make them better, or work of that description which is not necessary.  If that £3,000 or £4,000 were given even as a free grant to an industry to put that industry on its feet, and if that industry provided employment for only 100 persons, that money would have been better spent than £3,000 or £4,000 spent on unemployment relief.  To my mind that is the only way of tackling the problem of unemployment in this country. Even if a firm went down afterwards, if you take their wages bill for the period they were working and deduct that from the loan they got, you will find it was a good investment.  That is the way to look at it.  You throw away £3,000 or £4,000, and two or three months' work is provided.  The money is gone and the men are idle again, looking for another £3,000 or £4,000 to provide more work for them.  It may be, as Deputy MacDermot said, something on the Monte Carlo style&mdash;I am sure he is a good gambler&mdash;but I consider that the odds are something better and something safer.  Even if all the money were lost, if the wages bill is higher than the money that has been spent, then, in my opinion, good work has been done.  You have, I would say, at least something better than a 50 per cent. chance that, in the industry which is started with this money, the wages bill will be not alone for three months but for ten or eleven years.  At least the people have this safeguard now, that if they start an industry here they are going to get protection for that industry for the next five years, and I think the next 25 years.  Having got through the muddle that the Government took over when it came into office we could go through anything.</P>

      <P>I do not think that <Col N="1269" /> Deputy Corry could have listened very carefully to the speech made by the Minister, because if he had, he would have learned that even in the case of the small borrower the result of taking these loans was to impose upon them a burden that they found it very hard to bear.  It is quite possible Deputy Corry would think it wise to stop an ordinary businessman from doing so, who thought it better to realise his assets than face the fixed burden of a State loan.</P>

      <P>That remains to be seen.  If the State were to act in the spirit that Deputy Corry wishes, they would be much better advised to make investments direct, and to become industrialists, rather than indulge in mere speculation.  Deputy Corry would not pursue any inquiry into the business capacity of persons who wanted to borrow.  As long as a person was inspired to start an industry it would be the duty, in Deputy Corry's view, of the State to advance the money without further inquiry.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said nothing about that and I gathered that he would think that any precaution, on the part of the Department, would be extremely unpatriotic.  The Minister defended the change in regard to working capital by citing the case of a man who might come to the State having invested all his capital in fixed assets.  He pointed out if that man had come to the State, in the first instance, he would have got a loan, and that it is unreasonable that because his capital was in fixed assets he should not get a loan.  I suggest in that case he should put into the Bill the protection that we want, and at the same time, avoid the dangers of which we are afraid.  The Minister should agree to insert a clause providing for an advance not exceeding 50 per cent. of the total amount invested in the business.  That would not happen in the case of a man who had already put his money into fixed assets.  On <Col N="1270" /> the other hand, it would provide a very reasonable protection.  I would say, from the business point of view, that 50 per cent. should be the extreme limit that the State should give.  I appeal to the Minister to introduce something of this kind into the Bill and enable me to withdraw my amendment on that understanding.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot's amendment seems to me to be quite impossible.  I have listened to the discussion here.  Deputies seem at variance and are talking about different things.  The difference has not been made quite clear between private temporary accommodation and private capital.  It seems to me in some of the instances given as if the State had gone in for company promoting.  I do not know how far the Minister wishes to draw a line between a person who requires temporary accommodation, and a person who requires capital.  If a person requires temporary accommodation he ought to be able to pay that back in a certain number of years.  If he requires capital and amortises it in 12 years, as Deputy MacDermot said. I think that is a loan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely taking the Deputy's adaptation of the Minister's phrase, and I am suggesting that 12 years to pay back the capital of a company is quite impossible in these days of stringent conditions. I think the Minister does not realise what a blot it is in trade circles to put out about a place that it has a mortgage upon it.  However, I do not see how the Minister could do it any other way.  The State must have some security.  At any rate, the State seems to be coming in now somewhat on banking lines.  I think most of the people who approach the State in these matters have been turned down through the ordinary channels of credit.  If there is any moral to be learned from it, it could be drawn from the notice exhibited in an American restaurant recently.  It <Col N="1271" /> read: &ldquo;We have lately made arrangements with our bankers.  They do not sell soup and we do not cash cheques.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have lately made arrangements with our bankers, by which loans guaranteed by this State, under these Acts, are taken up by them on terms most favourable to the borrowers.  That is a point that Deputy McGilligan should have brought to his notice.  He asked if I had attempted to get any bank to buy the right of repayment&mdash;the right to secure the repayment of any of these loans guaranteed under these Acts? It is an interesting point, because I can give him some information upon the matter.  All these loans were guaranteed by him, not by me; and, in fact, all the banks are willing to take them over, and to take them over at a reduced rate of interest.  That is an interesting sidelight upon the improved prospect of industrial concerns in this country since Deputy McGilligan crossed the floor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For whatever period they were guaranteed.  Deputies who have spoken on this matter are entirely under a misunderstanding.  A loan could be given in error, an Act could be badly administered, but there is no necessity to put all this into an Act as a safeguard.  The whole scheme of this Bill is to try to facilitate its administration by removing some of the causes of delay which were regarded as safeguards heretofore.  This Bill is not entirely my own production.  When we introduced last year the Trade Loans Act again, I mentioned we had under examination the whole system of trade loan guarantees, and were concerned whether we should be able to amend them.  We have taken officials from the Department of Industry and Commerce and from the Department of Finance and constituted them a committee to go into the history of all the cases, to examine the present position, and to consider it in relation to present day development, and to make recommendations in the matter.  Their recommendations <Col N="1272" /> are embodied in this Bill. It is their product, although the Minister is finally responsible for it and must defend it.  I mention that because it indicates that it is not some revolutionary idea brought in here by a hard-pressed Minister anxious to get factories established to justify his existence.  This Bill is based upon six years' experience of those who had direct contact with the administration of the previous Acts.  It is not intended to guarantee the whole of the capital of any undertaking.  We want power to guarantee the capital that is going to be invested in fixed assets or the capital that is required in liquid form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shall endeavour to secure the State.  We shall endeavour to ensure that each undertaking is one that is going to succeed.  We shall investigate applications as fully as applications have been investigated before, no matter what the nature of the purpose to which the loan to be secured is to be devoted.  I gave, on Second Reading, the type of case I had in mind: A man who decided to embark upon an enterprise and who invested a considerable amount of capital in the enterprise, who built a factory, installed machinery and commenced production and then found, as people very often find, that he had underestimated the building costs or the equipment costs or the capital requirements of the industry&mdash;that he had left himself in a position in which his working capital was too small to ensure success.  We have had such cases and we have had to say to these people: &ldquo;We cannot help you.  If you had come to us before you built the factory, we could have given you a guaranteed loan in respect of the whole cost.  As you built your factory, or bought your machinery first, we can be of no assistance to you.&rdquo;  Very often, the machinery is bought first. Valuable machinery may be offered for sale at a very cheap price.  Somebody will say: &ldquo;There is an opportunity I can get now which I may never get again.  I should buy it at the cheap price and have it available.&rdquo;  He buys it and then he comes to seek his guaranteed loan.  He finds he cannot get <Col N="1273" /> it.  That is the position.  It will be for us to see that as regards loans guaranteed in such cases&mdash;we will not guarantee the whole of the capital&mdash; the State does not lose.</P>
    <P>We had a discussion of cases in which the State had lost.  I do not want to initiate a discussion on these cases.  I do not want to say anything about them with the exception of one case in respect of which Deputy McGilligan said that failure was due to bad management on the part of the person who is now Minister for Lands and Fisheries.  Who told him that? From what source did he get that information?</P>

      <P>He was asked to go down and undertake the management of that concern.  He was told that the stock-in-trade amounted to so much. He was told that there was so much timber there to be turned into the work of the factory.  Not merely was he told that, but it was shown to him in the accounts of the company.  Money was paid for assets and they were not there. That was dishonesty, if you like.  I think that no other term could be applied to it.  Certain people got away with money upon false representations &mdash;by writing up the value of the assets to a ridiculous extent.  They got the money from Deputy McGillgan and that enterprise started off not as it was <Col N="1274" /> intended to start, with liquid resources, but burdened with a load of debt which it could not possibly carry, so much so that another charge in favour of a bank had to be inserted in front of the State's charge to enable the enterprise to carry on at all.  It was bound to fail.  The burden of debt upon it was so heavy that it could not possibly pay the interest on it much less pay it off, even if working to full capacity and selling at a profit everything turned out.  One man went down and tried his best to put the enterprise upon a basis that would enable it to carry on. When he found he could not do that, that the burden was too heavy, he had the courage to make recommendations which might have saved the greater part of the enterprise if unexpected developments had not taken place and if a fire which occurred a couple of weeks ago had not terminated it.  I think that it was most unfair for the Deputy to make that allegation here because he cannot back it by any statement made to him by the board of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one other point that I want to mention.  Deputy MacDermot referred to the question of the State investing in industry and said that it would be preferable to have the State invest in an industry than to have guaranteed loans raised by industrialists in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Better than to do it in the spirit of Deputy Corry's advice to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that both methods may be required.  Not merely may we require this Act enabling us to provide long-term loan facilities, but we may also have to provide machinery by which industrialists of another kind may get capital invested in their undertakings&mdash;I mean put into the business, left in the business and remunerated in proportion to the profits.  We are examining the possibility of meeting that particular deficiency in our financial organisation. It may involve legislation, or it may <Col N="1277" /> not.  We propose to try to get that deficiency filled in, in any case.  I am clear that this amendment is most unwise.  One could contemplate places where any overriding limitation might be defined as an impediment to the proper utilisation of the Acts.  Ordinarily speaking, our practice has been 50-50. Our practice will be to guarantee not more than 50 per cent. of the total capital.  There may be cases, and one could contemplate them, where the working capital is very small in relation to the fixed capital, where one could safely guarantee a large amount, and where one might have to do so to get some enterprise established in this country.  I am quite certain that it will never be the case that we will guarantee all the working capital and all the fixed capital. I am prepared to give a guarantee that if any such case is likely to arise, I will come and inform the Dáil, because it would be an exceptional case, and I cannot contemplate that if we are going to put up the whole of the capital we will not want a greater interest in it.  There should be no overriding limitation.  These Acts have suffered in the past from too much limitation and too many safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to draft an amendment for the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I understand the Minister's reason against this, as far as he had any, it was that there were certain cases which came under his notice of people who had put money into the plant.  He adverted to that notice, and then came along and said that the Minister was forbidden by the Acts to give grants against these fixed assets.  It is an easy and a simple change to make, to allow money to be granted against fixed assets, whether they have been purchased or installed prior to the application for the loan.  At any rate, it secures that there are fixed assets against the loan. It secures that in the main no money is to go for working capital, and that an industrialist, if he has any capacity, will be made put the money into the business.  That is a simple change to make in the Act.  It is not the change <Col N="1278" /> that has been made.  The change made is to wipe out all the limitations.  I wonder how many cases of that type have occurred.  The Acts have been going on since 1924, and were renewed year after year with the proviso which allowed for particular overlapping such as the Minister described.  There was no reason at all for any wide-awake prospective industrialist not seeing what the Acts were for.  If that was the difficulty I do not see why it would occur.  That was the only argument extemporised by the Minister.  It cannot be met by extemporised arguments. It is not met by the point Deputy MacDermot's amendment is designed to meet.  All we have is a promise that in exceptional cases where you must supply the whole, or nearly the whole, of the fixed and working capital, the Minister will come and make a statement to the Dáil.  That is no good. The cases will be very rare in which the whole, or nearly the whole, of the capital, will be required.  Cases may be frequent in which a considerable amount of working capital will be given or secured.  To that extent there is a diminution of the amount the individual will put up, and to that extent a diminution of the interest he will take in the business.</P>
      <P>The other point the Minister made was that the banks give a lower rate to those who can give a guarantee. That is given because the bank rate has gone down.  If the Minister says he is responsible then he is taking more on his shoulders than he can claim.  The bank rate has gone down because of world depression.  The Minister has a lot to answer for for the depression in this country.  Beyond these extemporised arguments he makes no substantial case except that the banks now give a lower rate to those with the guarantee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking, sir, of the necessity for getting people's interest involved in a particular industry if it is to be kept right and I think that Alesbury's is a relevant example.  The last point the Minister made was that an extra charge had to be inserted.  In more than one case the Minister may have it.  The point was made by some Deputy as to the amount of loss incurred in the <Col N="1282" /> Drogheda Dead Meat Factory.  The loan there was guaranteed and said to be £70,000.  £24,000 was realised but the amount guaranteed and the final or gross liability to the State are two different things.  You cannot cut your losses in these cases in the way in which business men can do it.  When you get involved in such a case, there comes a point where most business men would say that it would be better not to go any further and that to continue would only be throwing good money after bad.  Business men in such a case would say: &ldquo;we are closing down&rdquo;.  The State never can say that because there are always such questions as that of unemployment arising.  In the case of Alesbury's it was said that the whole of Edenderry was at stake.  You continue on in the hope that you might get somebody else to take on the business and you go on running it at a loss for weeks, or for months as it was in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of the dead meat factory, there was a question of its being sold at one time and the whole thing was scrapped.  There was tremendously good machinery and good plant there and there was the question of delay in order to get a sale at scrap prices.  The liability which the State takes on its shoulders in a guarantee and the gross liability it is faced with at a particular point are two different things.  The Minister is only saying in relation to one case what could be said almost universally. If Deputy MacDermot is going to withdraw this amendment and if he does it without better reasons or without better satisfaction than has been given and if we are going to wipe out of this new code the limitation with regard to the preclusion of working capital from the scope of the scheme, then, there is a tremendous and unjustifiable example on foot and the mathematical chances are that there will be far more lost than was lost previously.  It is bound to happen.  The Minister is in the position to give this money, either to guarantee it or lend it, and he is faced with the question of getting employment.  Once it gets going, it is almost impossible, no matter how hopeless the position is, to close down, <Col N="1283" /> because you are then faced, sitting in an office, with the unemployed in your mind's eye and so many people walking the streets because you would not let it go on.  When you have so many channels through which to pour money I think the chances of losses have been immeasurably increased beyond what they used to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <P>This amendment is, in a sense, a drafting amendment.  I mentioned on the Second Reading that it was intended to have a permanent chairman with a panel of business men to act on advisory committees constituted as required.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree with me that in transactions of this kind special experience is necessary. If the Minister could have a panel of different trades on which he could draw representatives to assist the committee in investigating demands made by any particular trade rather than getting a special committee to consider a special demand from a trade, it would be advisable. Matters of that kind require special experience in the particular persons who are investigating them and I should like to see one committee carrying on the investigations&mdash;and that an experienced committee&mdash;and then having the right to call for representative men in particular trades in order to assist the committee in its investigations in any particular trade.  I think the Minister would find that that would be the preferable way <Col N="1285" /> to get the information he desires.</P>

      <P>It is now clear to me that the Deputy's amendment is based on a misunderstanding.  Every application will go to the Advisory Committee in the first instance.  This section does not deal with anything relating to the application.  The application, as I have said, goes to the Advisory Committee who will make a recommendation on it.  If its recommendation is accepted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, it is only at that stage that Section 5 will come in.  There then comes the question as to whether the loan should be financed by an advance from a bank or from the Exchequer.  We are taking this power to make advances from the Exchequer because of the considerations that I mentioned before, though I do not think it will ever have to be exercised.  The question as to how the loan is financed is not a matter for the Advisory Committee.  It is a matter for the Minister.  Before there is any question of financing a loan there is an examination of the application by the Advisory Committee.  It is only after that has been done that a decision, as to how the loan is to be secured, is arrived at.</P>

      <P>If the procedure as established is now taken to be the law and to be compulsory procedure then it is all right.  Deputy Good's point is one that was often raised here before. It is this.  What is the Minister bound to consult the Advisory Committee about under Section 1 of the Principal Act?  Only this.  If the Minister after a consultation with the Advisory <Col N="1288" /> Committee &ldquo;is satisfied that the proceeds of any loan proposed to be raised ... are to be applied towards or in connection with the carrying out of any capital undertaking&rdquo;&mdash;it is now &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo;&mdash;or in connection with the purchase of articles manufactured or produced in Saorstát Eireann required for the purposes of any such undertaking, and, that the application of the loan is calculated to promote employment, etc.  These are the only things under the Act that the Advisory Committee is called upon to advise the Minister on&mdash;not as to the chances of success or anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take that point. In connection with that certain things were put forward previously, that in the carrying out of a particular operation, say the building of premises, employment would be given.  It was put that the Advisory Committee might consider that that came within the scope of this.  There may be a point of difference as to whether it would or not.  It was often raised in my time. We said that we had a certain procedure and that we were going to abide by it.  It was frequently pointed out that it was not obligatory under the Act.  What Deputy Good's amendment seeks to get is this: if there was consultation with the Advisory Committee; to find out if certain conditions precedent were established, if the loan is required in connection with the purchase of articles manufactured or produced in the country and is calculated to promote employment.  There is the other point: the terms and conditions under which a loan may be made. There are intermediate to these whether, after these conditions precedent have been satisfied, the Committee advises that the loan should be granted.  That is entirely different, but it is something more than they are bound to consider under Section 1 of the Principal Act.  It is a matter that was raised in the House in 1926. When I saw the amendment in Deputy Good's name I thought there was a <Col N="1289" /> familiar air about the whole thing&mdash; that it was the point aimed at, to make obligatory and compulsory on the Minister the procedure which is now established and which can be evaded, and yet keep within the Act.</P>

      <P>I possibly could do it more successfully than the Minister is trying to do at the moment.  Let us get the point clear again.  The Minister is bound to consult the Advisory Committee with regard to what is in Section 1 of the Principal Act but on nothing else.  Is not that a fact?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the conditions under which the Minister might previously guarantee and they are brought into Section 5 of the Bill. Therefore, this has to do with Section 5.  Now we are not proposing a guarantee to him but a grant and the question of the terms and the conditions is not what Deputy Good is aiming at at all.  There are two other things aimed at&mdash;that before he grants, instead of guaranteeing he should get the Advisory Committee to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that, or even to take it another way, that after the advisory committee have been consulted as to whether this is a capital undertaking for the purchase of articles manufactured in the Saorstát or an undertaking which is likely to give employment, there should be consultation on the point as to why they should be given a grant rather than a guarantee or whether you should grant or guarantee at all.  The third thing I mentioned does not arise and Deputy Good does not want it to arise <Col N="1291" />&mdash;consultation as to the terms and the conditions on which the loan is to be granted.  That clearly is a matter for the Exchequer or whoever is in charge of the Exchequer.  There is the intermediate point of consultation with the Committee on the net point, as to whether there shall be a grant or a guarantee.  It is not a bad thing to have the advisory committee passing judgment on that point.</P>

      <P>The point in Section 5 is that where he gives a guarantee he can also make a loan if it is considered advisable to do so.  That is the stage where all has been settled. It has been decided that the company should get this loan.  The terms and conditions upon which it should get the loan have been decided.  It is merely a question of whether they will get the loan from the Exchequer or from some bank.  What has the Advisory Committee to do with that?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>Before Section 6 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A properly audited balance sheet and profit and loss account shall be furnished to the Minister for <Col N="1293" /> Industry and Commerce at least once a year by every borrower under the Principal Acts and under the Principal Acts as amended and extended by this Act and shall be laid by the Minister before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This amendment explains itself.  It is an attempt to get more information for the Dáil about advances and guarantees than has been available in the past.  I understand that there is a quarterly return made showing the loans that have been actually made but I do not think any information is given to the Dáil to enable it through its individual members to form an opinion as to the soundness of the business.  I should like to know whether the Minister would see any objection to such information being given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is an entirely indefensible proposal.  There is adequate power to enable the officers of the Minister to get all the information necessary in regard to the finances of a company but that we should publish that information concerning the accounts of the company to members of the House is I think entirely out of the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it would mean giving information to rival firms that would be of considerable value to them. It would be doing something in relation to the company that every business man would protest against.  The proposal that we should use our power under the Bill to compel a company to give information about their private accounts for the purpose of revealing these to the public is out of the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so in the case of public companies but these are not public companies.  They are private companies and they are under no obligation to publish their balance sheets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I maintain that <Col N="1294" /> when a private company comes to the State for accommodation it should be certainly called upon to give whatever information is necessary to enable representatives of the people to judge of the soundness of the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy should bear in mind the effect that would have on the credit of the undertaking as well as all the information that would be given to other undertakings, rivals in business.  If a man had to publish all this information he would be a darned fool of the worst type to come to seek a guaranteed loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite right that the obligation imposed by the amendment would have the effect on most small companies that they would certainly avoid seeking State aid. That might be a good thing, but publicity of some type should be the consideration given by any of these people who get State aid for that aid. It was the principle accepted by the House generally with regard to the biggest undertaking that was brought before the House&mdash;the Shannon Electricity Supply Board.  If there has been any complaint about that it has been that the publicity has not been given as was intended.  If it had been given in an up-to-date form, as it is hoped it will be given in future, there might be a considerable amount of difficulties obviated.  Part of the objection the Minister has made may be met.  It is evident that these companies will present sheets of this type to the Minister because he gets them. At least, it has been the practice that he gets them.  I am not sure that what is presented would come under the description given here, but the Minister certainly gets not merely what could pass under the phrase &ldquo;a properly audited balance sheet and profit and loss account,&rdquo; but a considerable amount more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should not that be published to the Public Accounts Committee, if not published to the House?  They are the body who inquire, year by year, into the working of this Act.  They <Col N="1295" /> are the people who are set up to investigate certain matters.  I agree that this is not distinctly in line with what they are supposed to investigate, but it is somewhat on the line that they are disposed to investigate, and there is a big distinction between the two points.  The Public Accounts Committee was originally intended merely to decide whether certain moneys had got into the proper hands, the hands being defined as the hands for whom the Oireachtas intended the particular moneys or subventions, but quite a different type of inquiry is, in fact, year by year, established by the Public Accounts Committee and it would be nothing outside their ordinary practice &mdash;nothing, at any rate, very abnormal to their ordinary practice&mdash;to have this included as a matter for their consideration and examination every year. If they found anything which warranted comment from them, they could make the comment, and I think they could be relied on not to comment unless there was something of such an anxious and disquieting nature as would cause their comment to be justified.</P>
    <P>I think there is a great deal more to be said for this than to have it simply turned down in the brusque way in which the Minister has turned it down.  There should be some way in which, to a financial group or some financial committee of the House or to some committee on industry or the Public Accounts Committee, publicity could be given, and I think it is no harm, particularly now when we are entering on a career of giving the Minister liberty to give, not merely money against fixed plant and machinery, but even working expenses, we should ask some publicity in return. The return as published to the House &mdash;I do not know whether Deputy MacDermot has ever seen it but, having been interested in the preparation of it, from time to time, I know it&mdash;gives no information to the House. It is typescript and it merely states the name of the firm and the amount, and I think it is supposed to state what the purposes are&mdash;but that has been very scantily defined up to date&mdash;<Col N="1296" /> the terms and conditions on which the loan was guaranteed or granted, some statement as to interest payment and so on.  After that, there has to be a statement made, in cases where loans go bad, of the payments that have been made from the Central Fund and any repayments made into it but, certainly, the information as given to the House up to date has been of the scantiest type.</P>
    <P>Nobody, in fact, has got any information. The information that has been given came out on discussion on the Estimate when it was discussed or, and more frequently and always better, on the annual discussion which took place on the renewal of the Trade Loans Acts.  Again, I think, Deputy MacDermot might be well advised to accept the Minister's point of view that to put these accounts in all their nakedness before the Oireachtas might possibly be asking too much at this stage of the country's development but there might be some body to which these accounts might be presented which would have some responsibility to the House and be elected by it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would arrange for this information to be given to the Public Accounts Committee, or, as I should prefer, to a specially constituted committee of this House, I would quite willingly withdraw the amendment, but if I have to choose between the amendment and the amount of information given hitherto&mdash;I have seen the typescript Deputy McGilligan spoke of&mdash;I should stick to the amendment.  I think it is outrageous that such power should be in the hands of the Minister as we are putting there, without a system under which information would be available to the people here who are responsible to the electorate for the proper management of the country's finances.</P>

      <P>The Minister asked why should there be a demand for the publication of accounts so long as the company was meeting its interest obligation and its obligation to repay the principal.  I can think of four of the undertakings which failed and about which statements could have been made at certain times, with regard to two of them, that they had paid in full their interest and had met their obligation with regard to repayment of capital and, with regard to the other two, that they had certainly paid all interest and had met, in the main, their obligations with regard to repayment of capital, and, yet, the four failed.  Merely to say that the repayments are being made does not, in every case, prove a healthy condition in a company and that is what Deputy MacDermot's amendment aims at discovering. It aims at giving some body connected with the House an opportunity at some period of the year of discovering how the thing is operating. I simply call the attention of the Public Accounts Committee to the statement made that it is possible to get the accounts of all these companies who get any loan from the State under this Act at the Public Accounts Committee through the Comptroller and Auditor-General during the year.

      <P>This is a very serious matter.  It is a matter that involves hundreds of thousands of pounds belonging to this country and I submit I am entitled to an answer from the Minister.  The Minister has been invested by this House with very great responsibility and to this extent I agree with the Minister&mdash;the responsibility is his.</P>

      <P>That is not the point. The Minister is merely begging the question.  The Minister does not want to confine himself to a definite answer. It does not matter whether there has been a gain or a loss.  A lot of the money which the Minister is now seeking power to deal with may be lost.  I will not say that if it is lost the fault will be due to the Minister or to his Party.  The Minister ought not to take that line.  He ought to look a little ahead.  He may not always be the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

I would like the Minister to indicate if the Committee of Public Accounts are satisfied it is in the public interest that certain accounts should be submitted to them, that those accounts will be so submitted.</P>

As the practice has been, it would only be the abnormal case in which the Minister would think it his duty to send the details before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Deputy MacDermot has suggested that people should know that one of the obligations that would be put upon them if they ask for public money is that their accounts will go automatically before some select body.</P>

      <P>If certain people are to be given public money for working expenses, if their own capital and interest are not going to be involved, then there should be some annual review and that has been refused to the House.  Let it be that the accounts ordinarily come before the Committee. That body has quite sufficient to do not to concern itself in any detailed way with accounts which, on the face of them, are good accounts.  They will only look into the bad ones, the ones which are doubtful and which reveal an unhealthy position from time to time.  There is one thing I like about Deputy MacDermot's amendment.  The suggestion there is that people who ask for Government money ask for it in the knowledge that they do put themselves into a certain amount of publicity; they subject themselves to a certain limited amount of publicity. Their accounts will go before a selected body year by year, in the ordinary course, not that they are sent for and not as a matter of privilege or anything like that.  That is not the situation, but I think it is the situation that was understood from the Minister's first answer.</P>

      <P>The Minister said some time ago to Deputy MacDermot that he had no executive responsibility upon him.  The executive responsibility is a responsibility which rests upon the shoulders of the Minister, but it is the duty of Parliament to watch the actions of the Minister.  He acts as a member of the Executive Council, subject to Parliamentary control.  Does he not think that in a matter of importance the Parliament should have the knowledge before it which would enable it to know whether the Minister has acted wisely or unwisely?  The Minister surely has got some confidence in himself. If he has confidence in himself why is he afraid his actions should be reviewed by the Parliament with full information before it?</P>

      <P>On Section 3, I should like to ask the Minister if the definition of the word &ldquo;cement&rdquo; as meaning Roman cement, Portland cement or any other hydraulic cement includes white cement and rapid hardening cement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister envisages the company <Col N="1310" /> manufacturing Portland cement, white cement and Roman cement.  I very much doubt that.  I do not suggest that the Minister should not have power to include these cements if necessary, if they have to be thrown into the pool, but I suggest that he might as well leave them out for the present.  They are very small items and only mean additional confusion to the trade for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously we could not leave them out now, because it would mean introducing another Bill to insert them at the stage when we were getting cement produced from works here.  At that stage undoubtedly we shall have to have power to regulate all kinds of cement coming in, so as to ensure that the stoppage of imports of one kind would not be offset by considerably increased imports of another kind which conceivably might occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite preposterous that anybody would use white cement instead of Portland cement, or rapid hardening cement. They are in distinct classes by themseleves and there is absolutely no fear of one being substituted for another. They could not be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not preposterous. Somebody would be able to get cement within the definition that would be suitable for the other purposes.  I think the Deputy himself has some experience of the ingenuity of persons desiring to import articles in avoiding Customs definitions.  We have to cover all classes of cement in order to ensure that we shall have the position under control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot quite agree with the Minister when he speaks of the ingenuity of people with regard to Customs duties.  I should like to point out that the fault is not all on one side. There are some dreadfully loose definitions of things.  In fact, I think people are not yet clear as to what a number of things in the Customs Act of 1932 really mean.  I suggest to the Minister that it is a closer definition of articles that he really wants.  However, what I <Col N="1311" /> am driving at is this, that everything but Portland cement ought to be omitted from the scope of the licence for the present.</P>

Formal application in the sense meant here has not yet been made, but a number of groups have intimated their intention to put forward proposals under the Act, and those are proposals which no doubt will be the subject of applications later.  In the meantime of course, we will have a large part of the process of examination dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it, arising out of what the Minister has said, that there are certain things that really are not mentioned here and would immediately occur to the ordinary individual.  The Minister mentioned, when introducing this Bill, a cement factory for the eastern section of Ireland and a cement factory for the southern portion of Ireland, possibly followed by a cement factory in the west.  It occurs to me that any person who is putting up a cement factory might say to the Minister: &ldquo;I am going to put up one factory in one part of Ireland and supply the whole of the country from that.&rdquo;  Is that going to be a question of providing negotiation between the Minister and the manufacturers, or is that going to be inserted in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another question that occurs to me which the manufacturer would raise with the Minister and I see no mention of it here.  You have in <Col N="1312" /> Northern Ireland a factory that could go very near supplying the whole needs of the country.  I take it that the Minister does not look upon the end of importation as impossible.  In that way you might have a factory inside the boundary, and I take it that the Minister in negotiations would make it perfectly clear that that position would not be afterwards prejudiced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the output of a factory is concerned there is power in the Bill to fix a maximum output, and make that a condition of the licence.  That would probably be done, but at the same time it seems to me that, provided we do not merely issue one licence only, there is no reason why we should not allow a factory to make as much cement as it likes. Suppose a man comes to me and says: &ldquo;I am prepared to build a factory in County Mayo to produce 200,000 tons of cement.&rdquo;  I might tell him &ldquo;go ahead, but we are going to give a licence for a factory in the east and for a factory in the south, and you will have to sell in competition with them.&rdquo; That might be decided, but ordinarily the intention would be to put a maximum limit on the output of a factory, so as to ensure that although some element of competition might be there, the total sold under all the licences would be equivalent to or somewhat in excess of the total estimated requirements of the country per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is suggested that a factory had to work between a maximum and a minimum prescribed output, that they had to guarantee a minimum and could not go beyond a maximum output, they would be in an extraordinary and very onerous position.  Perhaps I am discussing Section 12; I will wait until that section is before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I want to have cleared up.  The applicant has to state the area within which he proposes to manufacture cement.  The Minister was asked whether that word &ldquo;area&rdquo; had definite reference to the area from which the material was to be drawn, which would seem to be indicated by the use of the word &ldquo;manufacture,&rdquo; or whether it had reference to the distribution area.  The Minister's reply was somewhat vague.  We might envisage a situation in which there might be two or three factories.  The total output of the three companies might be somewhat in excess of the amount laid down as the total output in the country.  Let us assume that there are three factories and that we would want the three, each producing 100,000 tons.  Each is to get, according to the Minister's statement, a licence for something more. Let us suppose that each gets a licence for 250 tons extra which would leave a surplus of 750 tons in the whole <Col N="1315" /> country.  That is all manufactured, but one can manufacture cheaper than the other two.  Are we to have a provincial tariff to protect sales?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we would have one factory selling 100,000 tons and the others left with some on hands. Suppose that continued for some years, and it was demonstrated that one factory could distribute apart from its base, what would the output then be placed at?  Is there a possibility of putting that into the Bill?</P>

He introduced a Bill in the month of November which derided this proposal of manufacturing cement in the country.  Then we got a Second Reading speech based on this idea&mdash; that we were getting cement at far too cheap a rate from outside countries, that those outside countries were losing money on the business, that that was a scandalous thing, that that might be <Col N="1319" /> ended by them some time and that, in order that it should end, the Minister would make it end immediately.

      <P>I should like if the Minister would develop this question without disclosing anything that he thinks would be detrimental.  We should like to know if he thinks that the maximum price will be anywhere near the world price.  The Minister said that he was giving nothing away. Deputy Good suggested the other evening an addition of £1 per ton on the present price.  Costs fluctuate, but would the Minister say what the factors would be in considering the fixed maximum price?  Electricity and labour have been mentioned.  I do not know whether the Minister could give a closer indication or not.  It would relieve the minds of a lot of people to know that cement was not going to increase considerably in price in the period intervening between now and the opening of a factory.</P>

The price mentioned in every case was substantially less than that prevailing in a number of European countries.  I admit that that bears no relation to the price at which cement is being imported into this country.  Russian cement is coming in here and is being delivered at 27/6 per ton.</P>

I do not think that we can possibly get home-produced cement as cheaply as we are getting some of the cement coming in here.  We can, I think, get it more cheaply than that same cement is being sold in the country of production.  I certainly do not contemplate any substantial increase in the average price of cement following the introduction of its manufacture here.</P>

      <P>I think I can.  In fact, I think I am in order at present in this particular discussion.  There was a proposal held out under another proposition that we could get cement at less than the price prevailing here. We are now faced with a particular scheme in which the Minister is going to allow a minimum to be charged higher than what now prevails. Supposing that the minimum or the maximum be increased, is that a breach which will warrant revocation?  Is that the only hold the Minister has; revocation of the licence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is up against is that there are three institutions to be established here, each with a capital of £400,000, involving £1,200,000.  Supposing the Minister gets an indication of a ring, and there are all the conditions essential to a successful ring, and finds prices growing, he is faced with the proposal either to revoke the licence or to fine and fine until he gets the thing done. Then he is immediately faced with throwing out 400 men from each place into the coldness of the world which will cost far more than the little extra price charged to the unfortunate purchasers of cement.  Is there any way of getting some outside intervention in all this, not revocation of the licence, and not a fine, but letting in a certain amount of cement against the people operating here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

That is a better situation.  I wonder will we get the business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of this part of the Bill is to provide for difficulties that may arise in the construction of cement works.  These works are very big.  Ordinarily, I think we would have to assume that anyone proposing to establish the works would have to promote Private Bill legislation, in order to get power to acquire land, to work tramways and, perhaps, overhead rail or rope ways.  In order to avoid the delay and expense associated with Private Bill legislation we put this section into the Bill which enables the Minister to give the power by order, when certain conditions prevail, following local inquiry.  In fact, I think we will have to introduce an amendment to this section on the Report Stage if, after examination, it is not clear that the right to operate railways and so on is conferred.  It can be reasonably assumed that a branch line or a railway siding will be a necessary adjunct to any cement works.  We may have to introduce an amendment to deal with that.  All we intend to provide here is the right of acquisition of land necessary say in the construction of a railway or in a development of the <Col N="1325" /> works.  I do not contemplate that we would give an order for the compulsory acquisition of land under which there is a limestone deposit.  If there was any such order necessary it would be given under the Mines and Minerals Acts and not under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will settle with the parties to whom he is going to give the privilege of manufacturing cement.  I suppose they will then be allowed to go round the country testing different limestone rock, and deciding which is the most suitable.  If they find that rock in a certain area is suitable, the Minister will commandeer it irrespective of the rights of the owner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy understands that we have power already, in the case of persons wanting to work minerals who are unable to get agreement with the owner because of difficulty about the price or because the owner is not available or that there are a number of small owners.  We have power to give a licence to work under the Mines and Minerals Act which was passed in 1931.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the case of minerals.  The power mentioned in this Bill does not relate to that. Assuming that a company has determined to make cement at a particular place where they have the raw materials, they may have to erect a railway sliding to get connection with the nearest railway or an overhead ropeway.  The company could obviously be bled by people round about.  They might be charged an exorbitant price or be held up indefinitely by difficulties such as locating the owner of the property or something of that kind. It is to meet difficulties of that kind that this section is inserted.  In other words, this Part of the Bill is similar to the type of Private Bill introduced by the tramways company, or by <Col N="1326" /> large-sized undertakings of that kind, where such difficulties had to be contended with.  This is quite common form in Private Bill legislation. Ordinarily, we would leave it to people to get these powers by Private Bill legislation.  In this case we assume&mdash; and I think rightly&mdash;that such legislation would not be defeated if the Government had given a licence to the people to manufacture.  In any event we do not want action delayed, or to put upon the licensee the expense involved.  That is why we provide for a Ministerial order following an inquiry.</P>

I suggest to the Minister that he should simplify the licensing regulations.  He is, no doubt, aware of what has occurred where licences have to be obtained for other materials.  It is no uncommon thing to find that when a licence is issued for a certain quantity the importer has to take a ship which would hold twice that quantity.  He goes back to the Minister and, by the time he has got his licence altered, the ship has gone.  There are other variations of that and it is the commonest thing to find that the market has risen because, whenever there is any delay, a person nearly always finds that the market has gone against him.  I would suggest to the Minister, if he could in any way see fit to do so, to give some sort of a general licence which would be flexible within certain limits and for certain times.  This principle of getting a licence within a very narrow period, in which the maximum and the minimum are strictly controlled is not conducive to good buying for the quantities that are required nowadays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point about which I should like to ask the Minister.  Of course, I can see no difference between a licence, upon which a person will have to pay, having regard to the number of tons he will import over a certain period, and an import duty on cement.  I have adverted earlier to the fact that it would be very desirable, as soon as possible, that the people should know what they have to face.  I should like to ask the Minister does he contemplate charging different rates on cements coming from different countries and does he contemplate charging cement from the same country at different rates where the purchase price is different?  In other words, what is the Minister's basic idea in charging an import licence? If it is merely to cover a very small cost in connection with the administration of the scheme, I scarcely think that it is worth while to fix a considerable duty, because that is what it comes to, that is going to be placed on cement.  I should like the Minister, <Col N="1328" /> if possible, to give us the underlying principle, at least, in which it would be calculated.  Does the Minister wish to bring the cost of cement to a common denominator in this port? The Minister has spoken of Russian cement that was bought at 27/6 a ton.  Would he put £1 a ton duty on that and 2/6 duty on cement from another country?  I should be very pleased to have enlightenment on these matters from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, it would be much simpler if we just put on an import duty and had a licence provision, but it would not serve our purpose as well as the scheme in the Bill.  In so far as the scheme is complicated, it is so perhaps because of an undue anxiety to impose a number of safeguards such as the provision about the publication of licences and the conditions attaching to them and with a view to ensuring that the same conditions will apply under similar circumstances to all people.  In fact, however, what the Deputy says is correct and an import duty with a licence provision would be equally good.  We could have an import duty on goods imported at any time to any port unless there was granted a licence to import free.  That is not what we want however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to make this scheme effective, we must have power, first of all, to permit cement to come in to one part of the country through particular ports and not through others. If we had a cement factory, say, in Cork, established six months before a factory established in some other part of the country was in production, we would have to prevent it coming into the area served by the Cork factory.  There might also be question of the price at which cement will be available at the factory in production.  There might be a great disparity between that and the price of the cement that is imported. In order to prevent that disparity we take power to impose those fees.  The purpose of the fees being to secure that the price of the imported cement will be uniform with the price of the home-produced cement, on the assumption <Col N="1329" /> that the importing firms would be prepared to continue dumping cement in here at uneconomic rates. If they were not doing so ordinarily there would be no other restriction on the importer of cement than that he had to get a licence.  It is only in the case of cut prices that there would be any question of a fee.</P>
    <P>We had to devise a system that gave us control not merely of the imports but also gave us control as to the point of entry here and we had to have a system designed to secure a level price and also certain power in the matter of the country of origin. At the present time, apart from the emergency duty on British exporters, there is no restriction on any country. It is conceivable, in view of the way in which world trade is developing that we may have to follow the example of other countries and to make special bargaining arrangements with other countries, by which we might agree to take a defined quantity of cement in return for a defined quantity of butter.  We do not contemplate developments of that kind for some time and unless the forthcoming London Economic Conference was a complete failure it would hardly be likely that such arrangements would be made, but there would be power to do it here.  There are three main reasons for this, one, to get cement produced here by being in a position to restrict imports; two, to be in a position to direct imports, in so far as they are allowed in at all, into particular parts of the country; and three, to see that there will not be any great disparity in price.  We will probably try to raise the price of cement from the present level up to the level at which Irish made cement will be made available on the figures mentioned in the licences for a period of time, in preference to having a sudden jump, if there is to be a jump.  We could start gradually raising the price of cement by the operation of these fees in order to avoid that jump.  It is quite conceivable that we may not be able to raise the price in view of the fact that dumping may have ceased by that time.</P>

      <P>I welcome that part of the Minister's explanation, because it clears up a certain amount of misunderstanding. I would still urge on him that if these regulations are to be carried out in the way laid down here, then I would describe that as being an unnecessarily clumsy way of bringing about the object the Minister has in view.  If the Minister wishes to control <Col N="1331" /> cement in a certain area he can very easily impose a condition in the licence that it will not be sold outside that area.  In other words, if there is a cement works producing in the eastern portion of the country, and he still wishes to leave the south and west to get in cement, I think it would be necessary and desirable and less clumsy if he imposed a restriction that the cement was not to be sold outside a certain area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say why it is necessary, in the period between the present and the setting up of these factories&mdash;of their putting testing material on the market&mdash;to put a charge on cement coming in.  Why is it necessary to license it?  Why is it proposed to penalise building?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Minister does not see it from the same point as I do.  Any additional cost that is put on cement will increase the cost of building, and if there is an increase in the cost of building, then less building will be done.  This scare, if I may so call it, in connection with cement&mdash;this unrest is having reactions in the industry.  Take the case of people who, at the moment, are contemplating the expenditure of considerable sums of money in building. If the price of cement, which is a very important item in building, is likely to be raised in the future, then these people will seriously consider whether it is desirable to proceed with their building.  That condition of things is having reactions on the industry at the moment.  What I am anxious to point out to the Minister is this: between the present period and the setting up of these factories, why is it necessary <Col N="1332" /> to cause this uncertainty, this instability, if I may so put it, in the industry?  I do not know that the Minister for Finance is going to derive very much benefit from it.  It would be unfortunate if he should, because if so, it is going to increase the cost of building and lessen the amount of building work done.  It would also, of course, increase the amount of unemployment, which would be very undesirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make the Minister's answer for him, not as he will make it to-night, but as he did on the 4th May.  Deputy Good asks why, prior to the erection of cement factories in this country and before they are in full working order, we should have a licence fee charged on the cement coming in.  Here is what the Minister said on 4th May:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We must be prepared to contemplate a rise in cement prices following the establishment of that industry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later on he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We do not want a sudden increase in price.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words: we do not want the people suddenly to realise that we were getting supplies from outside at so much per ton, and that there will now have to be a big increase in price. The Minister has a better plan: to increase it by an odd shilling here and an odd shilling there by way of an import licence and of getting people used to the fact that cement really is a thing that they ought to pay so much for.  It is in that atmosphere we are getting our Irish cement industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A very lucid explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the answer the Minister will give to-night, but that is the answer he gave on 4th May.  Deputy Good then asked, by way of reducing this to an absurdity, if the Minister was looking to get any advantage for the Exchequer from this import licence, and said that if so then he was going to place a very serious imposition on house building. <Col N="1333" /> The Minister faced up to that frankly on the 4th May and said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In any event I see no reason why the benefit of the price cutting war going on at the present time should not accrue to the Exchequer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He also said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If foreign countries are insisting upon selling us cement at a loss there is no reason why the full benefit of that reduction in price should be enjoyed merely by those who buy it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A scandalous system of economics&mdash; that only those who can buy cheaply should get the benefit of that cheap purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are spending more on house building than anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Out of public funds a very large amount is being spent at the present time to secure the construction of roadways, houses and other buildings.&rdquo;  In other words: on our election posters we will be able to say that we supplied so much for housing, but we will not say a word about the little bit of extra charge put on in the case of cement.  No, but other people will say it for you.  We are getting the two sides of the case presented to-night.  The Minister is now trying to run away from some of the things he said on the 4th May.  He is not at all certain that the price of cement will not rise.  The whole basis of his argument on the 4th May was that we were living in a very unsafe and insecure position: that foreign people were selling their cement at lower than the cost of production in their countries: that that was a scandalous business and might stop one of these days, and for fear it would stop soon we would stop it immediately.  That may not be the complete argument the Minister used then but it certainly is not a perversion of it.  The other things which flow from it came out with the utmost naivete&mdash;that we do not want to give the people a shock by a sudden rise in the price of cement or wish them suddenly to realise the difference in price when cement is being produced here compared with what it was when brought <Col N="1334" /> in from abroad.  The policy of the Minister is to raise it bit by bit&mdash;to drug the people into insensibility. The Minister's answer on the 4th May frankly revealed as I said at the time what I considered to be a mad system of economics.  I cannot see why we should not let the madness operate in some cases to our advantage in the peculiar system we are in, instead of operating always against us.  We are having it definitely to our disadvantage in the case of butter and we are having it a little to our advantage in respect of cement.  Why should not we have a balance?  We are going to pay a little bit extra by reason of having three distributions instead of one; consequently, we must have an import licence.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell seems to have misunderstood the effect of this section we are discussing.  He referred to it as a temporary method.  It is temporary only in a very limited way, temporary in this sense that it will be only for a period that any licence will be granted for importation.  That is what is envisaged but otherwise the licence is full and complete.  The Minister answered me on another paragraph, and he will understand that what I have said is accurate enough, that the import duty and the fee charged on the import licence are only going to be prior to the establishment of our cement industry.  After that, all these import licences will be done away with and nobody will be allowed to import cement.  Nevertheless should that newly-established Irish industry&mdash;under foreign control I believe&mdash;raise its prices to an unreasonable degree then we will start the importation of foreign cement once more.  I would like to have that repeated here because it is certainly a matter which should be brought to the notice of those who are going to make cement here at this enhanced price&mdash;the fact that there is a limit to the price they can charge, and that if it goes beyond a certain figure the full tide of imports will be allowed to flow in upon them.  That is the one chance we have of keeping down their prices to something like an economic figure.</P>

      <P>What Deputy McGilligan has said to Deputy Good on my behalf is accurate enough.  We do not, however, propose to increase the price of cement immediately by the full amount that Deputy McGilligan contemplates.  As for its effect on housing I would again remind the Deputy that a £450 cement house built under the Housing Act of 1932 would be increased in cost by one-half of one per cent. if cement is increased by 4/- per ton.  Therefore, the increase in the cost of housing having regard to the fact that the total increase in the price of cement would not be much more than 4/- is very slight indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Two and a half per cent. In regard to Deputy McGilligan's final point I would only say that ordinarily a person who had a licence to manufacture cement subject to a maximum price and who exceeded that price would first of all have to be convicted of that offence in court.  He would, no doubt, appeal from the minor court to a higher court.  On conviction his licence could be withdrawn; in which eventuality we would have to make other provision to supply the requirements of the country.  That would be to allow imports to take place until some other provision had been made.</P>

      <P>Which of these things is being produced at a profit at the present time?  Surely when you have a situation like that where you are exchanging goods which have not been produced at a profit for other goods which are being sold below the cost of production, you would require to be a very brilliant accountant to be able to strike a balance and say with safety that either you are getting your cement at a reasonable price or at a sacrifice price on the part of those who are selling it to you, or at too dear a price on the part of those who are purchasing? Particularly is that so when Deputy McGilligan relates this question to the cost of house building.  House building for the populace is being done by the State with public money. While to the individual, who is importing cement, and using it for production purposes, it might seem that he is under a hardship in having to pay a higher price, the State is affected by the situation I have just <Col N="1337" /> described.  Who is to tell us that the State is under a disadvantage in having to pay that higher price in these circumstances?</P>

We are paying, possibly in goods that are being produced here, a price which we do not get eventually.  We are selling at lower than the cost of production. We are paying that in any event. That is our method of payment.  That stands against the cement so that we can leave that out.

The section says: &ldquo;There shall be payable in respect of every import licence a fee calculated by reference to the number of tons of cement authorised by such licence to be imported and at such rate per ton as the Minister may, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, fix in respect of such licence.&rdquo;  Can the Minister give some information as to what the volume of this tax is going to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The position is as I stated.  On the passing of the Act the fee will be small.  The amount will be so small as to be negligible.  That fee will be operated to maintain uniformity of price and mainly for that purpose, subject, of course, to the possibility of the whole plan being used to direct trade into particular channels.  I do not contemplate that we will have home-produced cement for more than 12 months ahead so that any question of raising the price of cement gradually, so as to have an even break <Col N="1338" /> into the use of Irish cement, would scarcely arise for some months to come but I do not contemplate that there will be any increase in the price of cement for a considerable period and possibly not at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>This is more of the element of uncertainly that adds to the difficulty that the Minister quite recognises in connection with a big industry.  You are dealing with very big industries in the building and allied industries which employ something like 80,000 people, and even ten per cent unemployment means 8,000 unemployed, so that one must be really careful in dealing with an industry of that magnitude and in seeing what are the reactions on it.  For that reason, I am anxious to get from the Minister something that will do away with the element of uncertainty that is having its reactions at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it cannot be done.  I will say this, that the price of cement will be no more uncertain in future than it was a month ago and the Deputy knows that a month ago the price at which cement might be offered for a particular contract could not have been estimated and was frequently reduced after the first tender had been submitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Minister that there was no difficulty whatever in fixing the price of cement when estimating for building, but, when you pass this Bill, I see very great difficulty. I see a further difficulty in the economic argument of the Minister. The Minister says we are going to <Col N="1339" /> sell our commodities to certain countries and take from those countries cement in return.  If you are going to limit the purchase of cement to certain countries, it is very hard to know what it is going to cost.</P>

All these things are adding difficulties to a big industry and, I am afraid, to unemployment, and I am anxious that the Minister, when he looks into the matter, would agree to leave over this whole question of licensing for the time being.  Let us face the problem as soon as we have a commodity of our own, but, until that period arrives, let us enjoy all the benefits that we can get from other countries through a cheap supply of cement.  We do not produce it here.  Let us get every advantage we can through taking it from other countries at a price very considerably lower than the cost of production.</P>

    <P>the word &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; means an institution or organisation in Saorstát Eireann which affords medical, surgical, or dental treatment to human beings, and includes any institution in Saorstát Eireann for the prevention, treatment, or cure of human disease, injury, or deformity and any institution for affording asylum to mentally defective persons, or to expectant mothers, or mothers with their children of less than five years of age, and also includes infirmaries provided by local authorities (whether as parts of county homes or otherwise) for the care and treatment of aged and infirm persons, and also includes institutions for carrying on medical research, but does not include any institution or organisation conducted by persons for their private profit;</P>

      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 1, line 47, after the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; to insert the following words &ldquo;and infirmaries not so provided but to which such persons are sent by any local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to bring within the definition of a hospital an infirmary provided for the care and treatment of aged and infirm persons who have become eligible for relief and who are maintained at the <Col N="1342" /> expense of the local authority.  The section, as it stands, covers county home infirmaries, and, where a local authority has entered into an agreement for the reception and maintenance of aged and infirm persons in an extern institution, as has already been done in Cork, I understand, it is proposed to make such extern institution, if it is an infirmary, eligible for grants from sweepstake funds in the same manner as the infirmary of a county home.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I should like to put a few questions to the Minister.  Section 1 enlarges very much the definition of hospital and it enlarges very much the class of persons or the class of institutions which can benefit by the money which is derived from these sweepstakes. One of the things which is entirely new is that money can be given to an institution for affording asylum to mentally defective persons or to expectant mothers or mothers with their children of less than five years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary how many of these institutions are there in existence.  I think if there are any, they are very few in number.  As I read the section, there is no power to endow a completely new institution out of the Hospitals Fund. It must be an institution which is a going institution before it can make any application to the Minister.  I think that is perfectly clear.  The word &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; means an institution or an organisation which affords medical, surgical or dental treatment, etc.  That shows that it is an existing thing which is actually affording such treatment at the moment and no money, in consequence, is available for any new institutions which, it might be throught, ought to be endowed out of the Hospitals Fund.  It seems to me that if the Parliamentary Secretary's intention is that a new institution of this nature could be established in any part of the country, that ought to be made clear in the wording of the section&mdash;that power ought to be afforded clearly and definitely.  I think <Col N="1343" /> that power of endowing such a fresh institution does not exist now.</P>
    <P>This section has enlarged the number of possible beneficaries, but I notice that while institutions for the care and treatment of aged and infirm persons, expectant mothers and various other classes of that nature can benefit under this Bill, institutions for the blind cannot benefit.  I was rather in a hurry with the amendments I put in.  I did not know there would be so much time for amendments and I submitted my amendments at the shortest possible notice.  I would like to know, if I propose an amendment on the Report Stage enabling some of this money to go to institutions for the blind, will the Minister be prepared to accept it? Further, the money may be given to nursing organisations.  That is the existing law.  It was pointed out to me a couple of days ago that nurses are not a very well paid body.  It is very difficult for a nurse to make any provision for her old age.  There is an institution for helping aged and infirm nurses.  As nurses are a very necessary part of hospital work, it might be advisable that some grant, not an enormous grant, might be made to an institution which would afford an asylum to nurses during long continued illness or when they are too old to perform the duties of their posts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, previous legislation on sweepstakes granted financial assistance to provide institutional treatment for mentally defective persons.  I think there is no departure in the Bill in regard to that class.  Under the extended definition of &ldquo;hospital,&rdquo; all homes catering for the unmarried mother class and children up to five years of age will be entitled to financial assistance. There are three or four such institutions in the Free State at the present time.  On the point as to whether it would be possible to provide entirely new institutions, existing bodies can embark on the provision of entirely new institutions.  I am so advised that existing bodies can <Col N="1344" /> do so.  There is a further departure in relation to the infirmary portion of county homes.  As the Deputy probably knows, in our county homes there is what used to be the body of the house under the old workhouse system, and also the hospital portion. The hospital portion is now called the infirmary.  Many of these infirmaries that are intended to provide accommodation for chronic cases are in a very bad condition.  The facilities afforded to these poor old people who have not much prospect of recovering, but who at the same time are under treatment, are very unsatisfactory.  So far as the infirmary portions of the county homes are concerned, it is intended to make money available out of the sweepstakes for their improvement.</P>
      <P>Institutions for the blind are not included in this definition and I think it would be a matter for consideration. If we could have an amendment proposed on the next stage it might be considered advisable to include such institutions.  It is a matter on which I have a very open mind, and I would be glad to give it further consideration. The same to a great extent will apply to nursing institutions.  We must bear in mind, however, that the main purpose of the Bill is to provide money for the voluntary hospitals and for the extension and equipment of the county and district hospitals under poor law authorities, and also mental hospitals. If we extend the definition too far there will be, of course, a wider distribution of the moneys at our disposal and there will be the possibility that it will take a considerably longer time to get sufficient funds to carry out the very big scheme of hospital reorganisation that we have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the Minister reads this carefully he will see &ldquo;any institution for affording asylum to mentally defective persons, or to expectant mothers&rdquo; means an institution which is in existence at the present moment.  I suggest that this matter should be reconsidered by the Parliamentary draftsman or the law adviser to the Department in order to see if it is perfectly clear.  It would necessitate merely a drafting amendment. <Col N="1345" /> I gather the Parliamentary Secretary's intention now is that local bodies would be able to establish new infirmaries.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that in drafting the amendment he would have that matter carefully considered.  As far as the blind are concerned, it seems to me that blind persons are just as much in need of public assistance as hospital patients.  Blind institutions are institutions which require a certain amount of money and they do a tremendous amount to alleviate the lot of the blind.  For instance, there is the question of the library for the blind.  That library is a very expensive matter.  I welcome the statement from the Parliamentary Secretary that in carrying out this Bill executively his primary consideration will be looking after the original hospitals in the stricter sense of the word, and still if there is any money over, or if there is any money available, I would suggest to him that he would consider the question, and if I bring in an amendment enabling institutions for the poor blind to benefit that he would accept that amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether the question of providing pensions for nurses has been pressed on him.  Because on previous occasions when bringing in amendments in the case of the previous Hospitals Bills I was pressed very strongly into bringing in an amendment by which pensions would be provided for the hospital nurses.  I was very sympathetic indeed towards the proposal. But I pointed out on that occasion that the Bill as originally introduced by me did not contemplate such a provision nor did the Bills subsequently amended pretend to give pensions either.  I pointed out to those who came to me what the position was and I said: &ldquo;If you get an actuarial account saying what the cost of the pensions would be I will do so, otherwise I cannot alter the Bill; but if you bring to me an actuarial statement showing the amount of the money that would be spent on that I will alter it.&rdquo; I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether it has been put up <Col N="1346" /> to him on the present occasion to include pensions for nurses in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had representations from nursing organisations to have provision made on the financial side of the scheme for pensions for nurses.  That has been since the amendments to the Bill were circulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, very like the position in which you were placed in that respect.  I have not found it possible to agree to have such an amendment inserted.  However, if there is any strong feeling in the House on the question, or if it is felt that such an allocation would come within the intentions of the Bill, we can discuss the proposition at a later stage.  As I said a few minutes ago, when replying to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, if the money is made available for all purposes for which there is a demand at the present time, I think the original purpose is bound to suffer as a result.  We must draw the line somewhere.  So far as the blind are concerned blind persons' schemes are in operation in almost every county in Ireland and requisite facilities are afforded to the blind for the training mentioned by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney; and these schemes are being financed by the local rates. I am not satisfied that adequate provision is not already made.  However, if the Deputy can show that adequate provision has not already been made, we can discuss the matter with greater freedom at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I know that at the time the Bill was introduced an institution for the relief of the blind did make application to come in within the scope of the Bill and I explained to them that they were not eligible as a hospital, that they were an institution. But this is an institution which, I understand, does good work, and there may be other institutions of a similar nature throughout the country where nobody but blind persons are helped.  I think one must have <Col N="1347" /> reached a certain age in order to receive a blind pension.  I am not talking now of these cases, but I think there is a certain age limit.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>An institution which receives a blind boy or girl of five or six years of age, trains them up to earn their own livelihood and teaches them to read is, you will admit, a very beneficial thing.  It is not curing sickness nor curing an infirmity, but it is doing away with a considerable part of the evil effects which result from such infirmity.  All I ask is to have these included.  The Minister need not give these institutions anything; this simply enlarges his powers, and if there is no institution that shows it is in need of financial assistance, then he need not give anything. In fairness to the Parliamentary Secretary I must say that since the first application was made to me I have heard nothing since about it.</P>

      <P>Section 1 is the part of the Bill where there is a definition of the word &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; as an institution which affords medical, surgical or dental treatment to human beings.  That would bring all hospitals under the scope of the Bill, whether they are hospitals which have participated in the sweepstakes or have not; they may at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is merely a definition of &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; for the purpose of the Bill.  Further on, the Deputy will find in other sections of the Bill the processes required to become entitled to participate in the Sweepstake Fund.  The fact that &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; is defined as it is in Section 1 does not mean that all hospitals will participate in the funds.</P>

Then there are institutions for the housing of incurable patients, patients who are likely to live a certain length of time but whom there is no hope of curing.

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said the point I was making did not arise on this section.  I venture to suggest, with all respect, that it does.  This section is one which defines &ldquo;hospital.&rdquo;  Various sections of the Bill deal with the control of hospitals.  My point is that it would be quite easy, no doubt, in later sections to make certain that that control is not meant to apply to any hospital, <Col N="1349" /> except it participates in the sweepstakes, or applies for grants.  It would be much better, as a matter of parliamentary procedure, to make it quite clear, even in the definition, that we are only proposing to deal with hospitals which apply for a grant from the Hospitals Commission.  That is why I am raising the point on the definition section, and I venture to suggest that it is here the point does really arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the point raised by Deputy Davitt about the treatment of the deaf and dumb, I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should leave no doubt that it can be dealt with.  It would partly come under the head of &ldquo;treatment,&rdquo; but there is this to be borne in mind, that if children are taken at four or five years of age they can be trained and become useful citizens, but if they are left in their home surroundings, and there are no central institutions to deal with them, or the institutions are not well-funded to deal with them, when they are about 12 or 13 they become idiots.  There ought to be a definite provision in order to prevent them developing from being merely deaf and dumb at the age of four or five into idiots at the age of 12 or 13.  There ought to be a definite provision to enable the Ministry, if it thinks fit, to give help to institutions of that kind.  The other point is the one raised by Deputy Thrift.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary make it clear that it is not his intention by this Bill to give any control over hospitals which do not apply for a grant?  He has said nothing on the matter.  I gather that it is his intention not to seek that control and that he will definitely exclude any assumption of it.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), to delete all words after the word &ldquo;Act,&rdquo; line 23, to the end of the sub-section, line 56.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is that this Bill will not apply to any sweepstakes which have been sanctioned and are being held under the existing law. In other words, it makes this Bill not retrospective, as Section 4, in its present form, does make it retrospective. I would press upon the Parliamentary Secretary as strongly as I can the desirability of not making this Bill retrospective.  We must bear in mind that there are still the proceeds of three sweepstakes which have not been allocated and that the money now standing there as the result of these three sweepstakes is not the property of the Parliamentary Secretary, or the Department, or the Executive Council, or the State.  That money is the property of the participating hospitals to some extent, and to another extent it is the property of local hospitals which were capable or competent to receive portions of it.  These are the owners of this money.  They are the complete and absolute owners of the money.  To put it in a legal phrase that is easily understood, they are tenants in common of the money.  The actual shares in which they are to participate are not yet decided. Under the existing Acts, under which sweepstakes are held, schemes were brought forward which were sanctioned by the Minister and had the full force of law, and under these schemes this money was collected and became, as I have said, the property of the <Col N="1352" /> hospitals to which I have referred. There was, indeed, a Committee of Reference which was to decide in what shares the participating hospitals were to receive this money as between themselves. The Committee reported to the Minister for Justice and the Minister is not the owner, nor the complete controller of this money.  The Minister, under the existing law, is nothing more than an arbitrator deciding in what shares this money is to be divided amongst the hospitals that own it. That is the existing state of affairs.</P>
    <P>If this Bill goes through, this money is taken away completely from its present owners.  It is confiscated from its present owners and it is placed in an entirely new fund.  That is a very bad principle indeed.  Retrospective legislation, I think, is to be avoided as much as possible, and retrospective legislation in financial matters, changing the ownership of property, is to be, in my judgment at any rate, avoided under all circumstances.  In consequence, I would press upon the Parliamentary Secretary as strongly as I can that it is more than desirable that this Bill should not be in any way made retrospective.  Whatever scheme the Parliamentary Secretary may have in his head, it cannot be necessary for the carrying out of this scheme that this Bill should be made retrospective. There are certain hospitals which are entitled to benefit and, as the law stands now, are the owners of the money and should benefit to the extent to which it would be allocated to each one of them.  Those hospitals that were participating and benefitting under the last schemes will require all the less benefit under future schemes, they will require all the less money out of the fund which is to be collected by means of future sweepstakes.  It would be a very bad principle indeed if this Bill were made in any way retrospective. These Public Hospitals Bills have always been regarded as non-political and non-Party measures.  I sincerely hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will regard this Bill in the same light. I can assure him that there is a very strong feeling, both outside and in this House, against making the Bill retrospective, and I would ask him to consider <Col N="1353" /> and to respect that strong feeling and not to make this Bill retrospective.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has made a very strong case against retrospective legislation.  I think it is most atrocious in dealing with a large amount of money that retrospective legislation should be engaged in.  The Minister for Finance introduced it last year.  He put a tax upon the Grand National Sweepstake of March, 1932, which was not included in the income tax year 1932-33.  It should not have been interfered with as far as the previous year was concerned.  Having succeeded in that form of legislation the Government are now prepared to go a great deal further.  I want to lay a few figures before the House, but I also want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether there is any truth in a statement that has been appearing in the daily Press to the effect that the proceeds of two of the sweeps that were intended under the Bill to be held up and put into this new fund, are going to be released and paid to the hospitals.  May I ask is what has been appearing in the Press a fact?</P>

      <P>I am going to deal with the figures in regard to that.  I want to say with regard to the first four sweeps that £2,018,000 was distributed. On that there was no duty.  We come then to the proceeds of the two sweeps that are now proposed to be released and paid to the hospitals and that the Government were going to hold up.  Those are the Grand National of 1932, and the Derby of 1932.  These amount to £1,480,143.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>Say so and have done with it.  All I want to point out is that there is now going to be very <Col N="1354" /> usefully released a sum of £1,480,000. That brings us to six of the sweeps. There have been no less than ten sweeps passed by the Minister for Finance.  Of these there are four, including the present Derby, that will have to be paid.  The Cesarewitch of 1932 and the Grand National of 1932 should be paid, and there is no rhyme or reason for holding up these sums amounting to something like £1,300,000.  I am not a prophet, but I am told that the Derby will be almost equal, if not equal, to the Grand National.  When that amount comes in, as it will do the week after next, the total amount that the Government will then be putting into the Trustee Account and holding up from the hospitals, and which the hospitals require to go on with the schemes that they originally hoped to finish, will be not less than £1,803,000. It is nothing less, I say, than a disgrace that that amount of money is going to be put into an account and held up, for the Minister for Local Government to do whatever he likes with.  That is really what the meaning of the Act is, that he is going to put this amount into an account in the name of trustees who are to be no more than office boys.  He is to tell them where to invest it.  If they do not know where they are to invest it they have to ask him, and he, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, will tell them where they will invest it.  That is what I read out of the Bill.  The Government took very good care, when they were in retrospective mood with regard to the holding up of the money, to take hold of all that could come to them.  For the last four sweepstakes they have got no less than £825,633, and if next week's Derby yields anything like what the previous one did they will have got £960,000 at least.  The Government are giving £100,000 for milk to poor children, with which I entirely agree, but they are giving no credit for the means by which this money is raised.  There was not a single word in the Budget about the £825,000 from the four sweepstakes since this duty was imposed.  Let me mention&mdash;and I <Col N="1355" /> think it is only fair that I should mention it at the present moment when people are talking about unemployment&mdash;that there are no less than 3,800 people employed on the sweeps. They draw not a large salary many of them, but still they are drawing sufficient to keep the home fires burning. In addition, last year for the first time the revenue of the Post Office cleared itself.  I have not any doubt that the reason why they were able to clear their accounts was because of the amount of money they had made out of the sweeps in postage stamps and telegrams, which was a very large amount indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say that I entirely support and back up what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has said, that it is a great shame that not less than £1,800,000 will be put in the hands of trustees, for the Minister for Local Government to do what he likes with, because at least three of those sweeps have gone through the ordinary legal formulæ. As far as this section is concerned the Committee of Reference is done away with.  I hardly feel calm enough to say what I should like to say with regard to what the Government has done in connection with this Committee of Reference.  I am not a politician, thank goodness, and I would have been very pleased to think that there was no political game in this.  There were three men appointed&mdash;they were not friends of mine and I did not agree perhaps with their appointment&mdash;who had made themselves familiar with the details of hospital maintenance and management.  They had got all the figures from the various hospitals throughout the Twenty-Six Counties at their finger ends.  Not only that, but one of the men had gone to four foreign countries, inspected the hospitals there, and made himself absolutely <i>au fait</i> with all the modern developments of hospital building and management. Without a moment's notice those three men, who had made themselves acquainted with this work, were told to go, and in their place three men were put in who did not know anything about hospital management.  I do not think anything more disgraceful could be done by a Government than to <Col N="1356" /> descend to a political dodge of that sort.  I am very glad that I am not a politician, because I could not possibly stand over that.  A man who is rejected at an election has got a job at £800 a year, and he knows absolutely nothing about the work.  The man was taken off a farm and put into a job he knows absolutely nothing about.  I defy anyone to stand up and offer any sort of decent apology for such an action.  The Committee of Reference has to end if this Bill passes, as I suppose it will.  The Committee of Reference is to terminate.  Within a month or two before its termination the Committee of Reference, which was working and could have worked off another couple of these schemes because they had all the details at their finger ends, is sacked, and other people are put in.  It does not matter about the cost because the other men were costing as much, but at all events I consider that it is an extremely disgusting thing to put three men out when they had made themselves familiar with the details of these schemes, and to put in three men who, I venture to say, know absolutely nothing about what they are put in to do.</P>

      <P>It has been said here to-night that the moneys are the property of the participating hospitals. The moneys were contributed for the benefit of the Free State hospitals, and the moneys are going to be devoted to the benefit of Free State hospitals, and to the purpose for which the moneys were raised and not any other purpose.  I am quite sure that Deputy Sir James Craig, not being a politician, will agree with me that we have reached a condition of hospital chaos, and that some co-ordination is necessary.  If there is to be co-ordination it must be brought about before the money is distributed.  Before they get the money they require for their particular schemes that co-ordination should be brought about.  Suppose <Col N="1359" /> we did not do that and continued to distribute money according to the recommendations of the Committee of Reference what safeguards have we or what control over their Boards in future?</P>
      <P>Is it quite true that it was a condition of previous legislation that 25 per cent. of the beds in the hospitals should be available free of charge to the poor?  But when these hospitals get their money and get the capital necessary to carry on their extensions and to provide equipment, and get their endowments, is there any provision in the existing law that can compel any of these hospitals to continue to make provision that 25 per cent. of the beds shall be for the poor?  I am not aware of it. Hand over the money first.  Tell them to equip and build away; and then ask them: will they be good enough to take in the destitute poor.  We are aiming in this legislation at making sure that when the money is given to the hospitals it will be made a condition that a certain number of beds are free to the poor.  And if that condition is not observed we will take powers, under this Bill, to secure that the payment of the endowment will be discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested that we are actually confiscating the money belonging to the hospitals.  The hospitals do not own this money.  The fact that hospitals become participating hospitals in the sweep does not entitle them to the money.  Under existing legislation the <Col N="1360" /> representatives on the Committee of Reference come to the Minister for Justice with their report.  He is not bound to accept or to act on that report, or to make his distribution in accordance with it.  He consults the Minister for Local Government. What is the revolutionary change we are making?  The Minister will consult the Hospitals Commission, and if he is satisfied the money should be allocated on the recommendation of the Committee he makes the allocation according to the recommendations. That is the revolutionary change that politicians are complaining so much about.  Already upwards of £3,000,000 has been distributed to voluntary hospitals without any plan of co-ordination.  We had the report of the Committee of Reference in whom Deputy Sir James Craig has such a lot of confidence, in which they complain of lack of co-ordination, and of the chaotic conditions prevailing under the hospitals system and the necessity for setting up such a Commission as we are setting up under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and supported by Deputy Sir James Craig cuts across the whole principle of the Bill and is not acceptable.</P>
