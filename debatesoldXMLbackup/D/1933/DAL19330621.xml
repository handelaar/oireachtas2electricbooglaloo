      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if in future he will insist on the regulation that all labour should be recruited through the local labour exchange in the case of contractors for housing schemes which are being carried out by local authorities, seeing that Government funds are being provided for such schemes either by way of loan or grant; and thus prevent the possibility of contractors being intimidated by local political clubs to employ only men belonging to such clubs.</P>

      <P>There is no regulation in force requiring contractors for housing schemes to recruit labour through the labour exchanges. While it is advisable that labour should, where possible, be recruited from these sources, action taken by my Department has been limited to a recommendation to local authorities, that this course should be followed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Davitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware of the fact that Michael McArdle, of Haggard Street, Trim, Co. Meath, who was recently employed to do work as a mason for Mr. Sargeant, building contractor, at present engaged in constructing houses for the Trim Urban Council, was prevented from taking up work owing to intimidation by members of a local Fianna Fáil Cumann, and whether in view of this fact, the Minister will withhold the grants under the Housing Acts in respect of these houses, until the regulations governing the employment of men in such cases, through the labour exchange, are complied with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information as to the allegations made by the Deputy.  There are no regulations requiring the recruitment of labour for housing contracts through the labour exchanges.  The position generally as to the recruitment of labour for these schemes is as explained in my reply to Deputy O'Neill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertEDavitt" hpid="Dr. Davitt Dr. Davitt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Davitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the fact that in this case a petition was signed by 30 ratepayers asking that this man should be employed on this particular scheme as it was part of the contract with the contractor that local labour should be employed where possible; is the Minister aware that Michael McArdle was not employed owing to any charge of incompetency; that no charge of incompetency was preferred against him and that handy men living nine or ten miles away were brought in to work on the job, the only difference between them and McArdle being that they were members of a Fianna Fáil club and he was not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether in view of the policy of the Government with regard to peat fuel development he will consider the advisability of taking steps to compel local authorities to use peat fuel in establishments under their control; whether he is aware that in many areas where there is a plentiful supply of peat fuel coal is used in such establishments, particularly in the cases of Letterkenny Mental Hospital and District Hospitals in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have already been addressed as to the advisability of substituting turf of suitable quality for imported coal in the institutions under their charge.</P>
      <P>The general question of the utilisation of peat supplies is at present being examined by the Peat Development Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Reconsideration of the position of local authorities must wait on the results of the consideration of the general question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertEDavitt" hpid="Dr. Davitt Dr. Davitt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Davitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether any conclusion was reached as a result of the inquiry held by the Department Inspector into the case of the assistant county surveyor, County Meath, who was suspended over nine months ago by the Meath County Council on the report of the county surveyor; and, if so, if he will state what were the findings of the inquiry and why were they not transmitted to the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The conclusion reached in this case was that, while the officer had been unsatisfactory as to the manner in which the duties of his office were performed, there was not disclosed such a dereliction of duty as would warrant so severe a penalty as dismissal and forfeiture of pension rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was also apparently the view of the county council themselves, as although they suspended him they decided recently to rescind their resolution. <Col N="848" /> No salary was paid or will be paid to him in respect of the period during which he was suspended.</P>
    <P>When a local authority suspends an officer under the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, the suspension can only be confirmed or removed by the Minister and before the Minister comes to a decision he has to investigate the subject matter of the suspension.  The investigation is not necessarily or usually a public one and is merely to enable the Minister to decide the question.  The investigation in such cases is directed to ascertain the facts of the case and these are already in possession of the county council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertEDavitt" hpid="Dr. Davitt Dr. Davitt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Davitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the fact that the county council had to wait ten months before receiving a report of any kind; is he aware that an inquiry was held by his Department; is he aware that in the interest of the assistant county surveyor himself as well as in the interest of the county council it was not fair that the result of the inquiry should not be communicated until after the lapse of such a long period?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken) (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to the satisfaction of statutory conditions and freedom from statutory disqualifications Unemployment Insurance Benefit is payable in the proportion of one day's benefit to each unexhausted contribution to the credit of the claimant's account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>John Delaney claimed Unemployment Insurance Benefit on the 5th October, 1932, and at that date he had 104 contributions to the credit of his account with the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  He, therefore, received payment of 104 days' benefit, this being the amount of benefit to which he was entitled having regard to the contributions to his credit. <Col N="849" /> Information has been received that Mr. Delaney was formerly engaged in insurable employment for which no Unemployment Insurance contributions were paid, and this matter is at present under investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 19 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  There shall be allowed as from the 5th day of August, 1933, in respect of spirits imported into Saorstát Eireann a rebate of one pound two shillings and sixpence for every gallon computed at proof.</P>
      <P>(2)  In lieu of the excise duty payable on spirits distilled in Saorstát Eireann there shall as from the 5th day of August, 1933, be charged, levied and paid for every gallon computed at proof of spirits distilled or manufactured by any other process whatsoever in Saorstát Eireann an excise duty of two pounds ten shillings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no necessity for me to read the amendment, and I shall confine myself, therefore, to a very few remarks in support of it.  The distilling industry in this country has been crushed almost out of existence.  Some people appear to think that this duty of 72/6 has been imposed upon this <Col N="854" /> industry by our own Government in the first instance, whereas the fact is that this tax or duty on spirits was a war duty only, or was intended to be a war duty only, imposed by the British Government in the year 1920.  Since that date almost one half of the Irish distilleries have had to close down. Many of these establishments were giving decent and reasonably well-paid employment in their respective areas, but, as the result of this unjust imposition, as I have said, almost one half of them had to close down.  It must be remembered also that the distilleries which have survived, like the ones that have gone down, are in the main the property of Irish capitalists who have invested most, if not all, of their capital in these enterprises.  I am not going into the relative merits of the Irish spirit and the Scotch spirit, but I do make provision in this amendment for a reduction in the tax on spirits imported into Saorstát Eireann of £1 2s. 6d. in every gallon computed at proof, and in relation to the Irish distilled whiskey I suggest that the duty be reduced by the sum of £2 10s. I would make this appeal to my farmer Deputy friends, that in supporting this amendment they will be very largely helping the farmers who grow malting barley in this country.  In the eastern portion of the county I come from many farmers have found the growing of barley to be one of their most lucrative propositions.  In the harvest immediately prior to the imposition of this tax of 72/6 it is estimated that the distillers of Ireland used close on 400,000 barrels of Irish-grown barley. This, I understand, represented almost one-third of the available crop of malting barley grown in this country, both north and south.  Under present conditions the distillers in Saorstát Eireann scarcely require five per cent. of this crop.  That is one illustration of the very disastrous effects of this impost of 72/6 per proof gallon.  I also understand that this represents the equivalent of something like £350 tax on every acre of barley grown in this State.  That fact alone should make a very strong appeal to farmer Deputies in this House.  Ten years ago it is computed that the revenue the Irish <Col N="855" /> Free State derived from the distilling industry was something like £1,000,000 per annum over and above what it is now.  That has been one of the disastrous results of the imposition of this tax of 72/6 per proof gallon.  If the industry is to be saved, and if we are to prevent further loss to the revenue, I suggest that we should get an immediate reduction, or a reduction as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made, so that our product will be kept within the purchasing power of the people.</P>
    <P>Last evening, when speaking on another aspect of this brewing and distilling industry, I mentioned the fact that in Great Britain, notwithstanding the fact that the British people are suffering possibly worse than we are suffering from economic and industrial depression, the Imperial Parliament thought it wise and prudent to reduce their taxation on beer.  I also suggested last evening that that would not be a bad example to copy, so as to bring the price of that commodity&mdash; just as I say now to bring the price of this commodity, namely, whiskey&mdash; within the purchasing power of the people.  There may possibly be a stronger argument, from the point of view that there are more consumers of beer in the country than there are consumers of whiskey.  Nevertheless, I rely mostly on the equities of the case when I suggest that this amendment should be passed by this House.  The fact that we have an amount of Irish capital invested in this industry should make at least some appeal to the members of this House. The fact that they have always given, and, if they had not been interfered with to this rather serious extent, would continue to give reasonably well paid employment, should carry some weight.  I suggest, sir, that the House, in all the circumstances, should pass this amendment in view of those facts I have just related, and again in view of the fact which I cannot help stressing once more, that the distillers are large buyers of home-grown barley, That should make a great appeal to all Deputies, whether they represent the cities and boroughs of this State or <Col N="856" /> whether they represent an entirely agricultural section of the community.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the matter any further, but I do hope that the Minister will be able to see his way to grant some reduction, if he is not able to give the reduction I suggest, which I understand would represent to the consumer something like 4d. per glass.  If he is able to do that, he will be doing something to help the industry along.  There is another aspect of the case, too, which I understand was mentioned yesterday.  If those distillers were approached, and the whole question were put into the melting pot once more as to the price they are prepared to pay for home-grown barley, I do think that in their own interests they would be agreeable to pay the increased price, that is to say, if they feel that the prices they are paying now are inequitable prices, and that they would be justified in giving the increase.  In view of the fact that an almost similar question was discussed very fully last evening, I do not propose to delay the House any further than to move my amendment, and hope it will receive the consideration of the Minister and his Government.</P>

      <P>I spoke yesterday on the other aspect of this matter, the question of beer and stout.  Just like Deputy Anthony, I have no particular interest in supporting this amendment. Perhaps Deputy Anthony has a greater interest than myself.  Perhaps he does occasionally take a bottle of stout or a glass of whiskey; I do not take either.  Yesterday I dealt with a particular aspect of this question, the making of illicit whiskey.  I submit that so long as a tax of this kind&mdash; which is purely a war tax and has no relation now in this country, whatever it had in 1920, when it was imposed for the purpose of paying the debt incurred as a result of the European War&mdash;is in existence, illicit distillation will continue.  On equitable grounds, without putting it any further, the time for that tax has passed away, and it should be brought into proportion to what it ought to be under normal conditions. Take it in relation to illicit distillation.  The reason why illicit spirits are made in large tracts of the <Col N="857" /> poorer districts of this country is the relation between the economic price of spirits and the price of them with this abnormal tax.  There is no doubt that is the motive power behind it.  So long as this tax, the purpose of which has passed away, remains and is imposed by the Government, so long will illicit whiskey be made.  There is no doubt about that.  There is another aspect that follows from it, which is not just quite relevant here.  We have seen and watched the development of that matter in America.  It is clear to anybody who dwelt on the matter that it is going eventually to break down the entire social order in America.  I merely want to refer to that in passing.</P>
      <P>There are various aspects of this thing.  There are, for instance, districts where illicit whiskey is made, and that is due to the terrible gap that exists between the economic price of spirits and the price at which spirits are sold to-day because of this inflated taxation.  Yesterday Deputy Norton was dealing with the beer tax and he put very forcibly, clearly, justly and equitably the right of the poorer classes to get at least a reasonable amount of spirits or liquids whenever they require them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy did not; but he was dealing with beer and, as beer contains spirits, really he was dealing with spirits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that in many districts, particularly in the more remote and the poorer districts, where they live long distances from a medical practitioner, they have a local tradition that when someone takes ill, for example, when someone is attacked with influenza, and when they have not the means of sending for the doctor, the most advisable thing to do is to use spirits.  It is utterly impossible for poor people under present conditions to get any spirits for medicinal purposes.  It would take the price of two sheep now to buy a bottle <Col N="858" /> of whiskey.  It is all right for the man with £600, £800 or £1,000 a year.  It does not matter to him whether a bottle of whiskey costs 3/6 or 16/-; he can pay either price.  But it is a serious matter for the poor when a bottle of whiskey costs 16/6.  That really is prohibition.</P>
      <P>Yesterday Deputy Dillon talked <i>ad nauseam</i> about the finding of this money.  One reason why I oppose this tax is that the modern tendency of Chancellors throughout the world is to maintain excessive taxation.  They have developed a rapacity for imposing taxes for some specific purpose, some temporary urgency, and then, year after year, the appeal is made that we must maintain those taxes, because if we do not, where else are we to get the money.  So long as assemblies of this kind submit to that battle-cry from Chancellors, so long will those Chancellors, year after year, open their mouths wider and wider until taxation will have reached the pitch when the whole financial system of the country will break down and chaos will ensue.</P>
      <P>At the moment there are sixty countries represented at a Conference in London, and they are trying to get themselves out of a mess for which they were originally responsible.  Yesterday Deputy Dillon asked where were we to get the half-million required. When this Bill was introduced the same Deputy asked solemnly if he would have another opportunity of discussing it.  What is his object in discussing it further unless he is going to resist this increasing burden of taxation which is being piled on the backs of the people? We were told that additional taxation would not be imposed.  That is the old battle-cry, the old die-hard battle cry.  We have the Chancellors of the world opening their mouths wider every year, until ultimately the taxpayer breaks down.  I maintain that this is an exorbitant tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another inequitable aspect of this thing.  This tax was imposed in 1920, and for years honest men, good citizens, worked industriously to earn money in order to invest it in premises so that they could carry on this business legitimately.  Now they find that as a result of these taxes the premises <Col N="859" /> in which they invested enormous sums are decreasing in value, and they find their business being taken away from them through the actions of the Government.  Is it just or equitable, when a man invests all his money in premises in order to carry on this business legitimately, that the Government should drive him out of business through harsh taxation?  The price of spirits should be brought into some relation with economic values in the country.  From the social standpoint it is necessary that we should make some effort to restrict illicit distillation of whiskey.  It is also necessary that we should endeavour to bring Finance Ministers to their senses, and we should restrict this effort of theirs year after year to gather in more money by way of harsh and unnecessary taxation.  It is for reasons such as these that I am supporting the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House will congratulate Deputy McMenamin on his new found liberty as a member of the Opposition.  I thought during the Deputy's speech that somebody would have pulled his coat and told him he was now in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  If he had been in Deputy Anthony's Party one might have understood the extent of the licence which he would get.  In a Party of two the Deputy could always be sure that he would never be in a minority.  But, Deputy McMenamin being a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, the situation is quite different.  I suppose everybody except the Deputy found his declarations extremely interesting. He talked about Chancellors of the Exchequer opening their mouths wider and wider; he spoke of their greed, raking in money from the taxpayers. Never once did the Deputy advert to the fact that although efforts were made here time and again during the last ten years to secure reduction in the taxation on beer and spirits, they never were successful.  The Deputy is surely aware that when Cumann na nGaedheal were in office his own Minister for Finance consistently refused to yield to that demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy possessed some political constancy he might have.  Of course, if the Deputy wants to change from Party to Party, always looking for the bone with the most political meat on it, that is a matter for himself.  Apparently, the Deputy cannot be in a Party long enough to have a Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy would look at the speech made by the ex-Minister for Finance, Mr. Blythe, in 1928, I think he would find it cancelled out his own speech to-day; and if he does not, I am sure some of the colleagues of the ex-Minister, who have not yet thrown Mr. Blythe overboard, would repeat the sound arguments which Mr. Blythe used on that particular occasion.  Then the matter raised in this amendment is quite different from that raised in the amendment yesterday, and which was supported from these benches.  The case made by Deputy Anthony for this amendment was strangely unconvincing.  The Deputy said that at the present the tax upon an acre of barley, used for distilling purposes, is £350.  If the Deputy worked out that figure I am sure he must have been astonished at the result he got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>It represents that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It represents that.  The assumption is that the produce of an acre of barley bears a tax of £350. The Deputy knows perfectly well, because he is not at all a bad mathematician, that that figure is absolutely absurd.  He might as well tell us that the water contained in the spirit is bearing a tax of £100 per acre in relation to the £250 on the acre of barley.  That figure is quite unconvincing. I do not know how the Deputy was trapped into using such a grotesque argument as that.  If he <Col N="861" /> could find an acre of barley carrying a £350 tax I suggest he ought to see the curator of the museum about it.</P>
      <P>Whatever case there is for the second portion of Deputy Anthony's amendment there is no case at all for the first portion.  The first portion asks us to grant a rebate of £1 2s. 6d. on every gallon of imported spirit; in other words the legislature is to relinquish its claim to this extent on the import of foreign spirits.  Whatever case there may be for reducing the taxation on spirits distilled in the country, there is no case whatever for reducing the duty imposed on spirits distilled outside the country.  The only case for the first part of his amendment would be that we should let in spirits here at a lesser rate than we are doing to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people have cultivated a taste for Scotch whiskey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody has a right to cultivate his taste as he wishes, but to ask the legislature to reduce its duties because of that is to ask the legislature to do what the Deputy knows is impracticable.  But even the second portion of the amendment is not at all on the same footing as the amendment proposed yesterday in relation to the duty on beer and stout. Beer and stout are pre-eminently the drinks of the working class people. Very few, relatively speaking, of the working classes consume spirits because, for other reasons, they are too dear.  At any rate, I think that on balance it will be found that as a matter of ordinary national development, encouraging the taste of the people in a particular direction, most people would say that you should encourage that taste in the direction of beer and stout as distinct from spirits. I think the result, on the whole, would be very much better.  The case as regards the tax on home-distilled whiskey is not as strong as the case for reducing the tax on home-brewn beer and stout.  These latter are consumed in substantial measure by the working class people.  The commodity on which the Deputy seeks to secure a reduction of duty is not at all consumed to the same extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> Having regard on the one hand to the cost of the remission to the Exchequer, and having regard to the relatively negligible benefits that would accrue to the people, although we supported yesterday's amendment, I do not think there is any case made out for this amendment.  Both sections of the amendment hang together, and so long as they do there is no case, on any ground, for accepting an amendment which involves the lowering of taxation upon imported whiskey.</P>
    <P>As regards the value of this amendment, as compared with yesterday's, I do not think there is nearly as strong a case for this amendment as when we were dealing with commodities such as yesterday's amendment dealt with, and which are consumed so largely by the working class people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a hypothetical question.  I hope that the House will not allow any part of the amendment to be withdrawn.  It was put down as a contribution by Deputy Anthony to the present budgetary and economic position.  Deputy Anthony is a Deputy who, as Deputy Norton pointed out, is supreme in his own Party.  No other mind but his has formulated this amendment&mdash;at least I hope not&mdash;and he must stand or fall by his amendment as placed upon the Paper.  My particular objection to this amendment, and one that ought to prevail with this House, even if there was no other objection&mdash;and I am not approaching this from the point of view of the temperance advocate, or from the point of view of the person who believes we should imbibe freely; I am approaching it from the point of view of the person so eloquently castigated by Deputy McMenamin, that is, the person who has to provide the wherewithal to run the country&mdash;is that, if accepted, it would cost the country half-a-million pounds.  I am sure Deputy Anthony, before he put down this amendment took the trouble to study the returns of the Revenue Commissioners.  He did not put the results before us, and he <Col N="863" /> did not tell us where otherwise we are to find this £500,000.  Quite true, I have to make the plea which has been castigated by Deputy McMenamin.  I have to ask where I am to get the money from.  I have to make that plea because succeeding generations of public representatives and succeeding generations of the people have decided that the Government has to accept greater and greater social responsibilities and, therefore, since the Government has to accept these greater responsibilities, it has to ask the people to pay for those responsibilities.</P>
      <P>This £500,000 might not be required if we had not to provide so generously for old age pensions.  I do not want it to be taken that I am suggesting that our provision for these services is overgenerous. No, but it is as much as we can afford at the moment.  Whether it is great or small it has to be paid for.  The same applies to our educational service, to our police service and to every other function undertaken by the Government which has to be paid for.  The sum total of the cost of these functions is such that this £500,000 is essential.  It is not for the sake of collecting the duty that I ask the House to reject this amendment but in order that Governmental services may be maintained and for no other reason.</P>

      <P>I expected yesterday when an amendment practically similar to this was being discussed, that some of its advocates would refute the statements I then made. Deputy Morrissey pretended to. Deputy Morrissey has found in his 12 years service here that the readiest means of refuting a statement when he has no argument against it, is by abuse.  He is a past-master in the art of abuse without infringing the rules of order of the House.  He has been well trained in that line.</P>

He said that all his voters in Donegal were under the influence of poteen.  Deputy Dillon very rightfully excluded his voters from the particular stigma that attached to those of Deputy McMenamin.  To-day Deputy McMenamin told us that a man in Donegal would have to sell two sheep to get the price of a bottle of whiskey.  I suggest that such a man would be better off if he ate the two sheep.  They would do him much more good than a bottle of whiskey.  If, in order to carry out the provisions of this amendment, the Minister for Finance removed the bounty from sheep and lambs, the people in Donegal would not be thankful to Deputy McMenamin for his support of this.  I do not know much about poteen.  I got a taste of it once in my lifetime.

      <P>It was far more effective than the way Deputy Morrissey crept around my argument yesterday.  When we hear Deputy Anthony as an advocate of the gentleman who goes into a bar and wants a &ldquo;Scotch,&rdquo; whether he is a representative of the farmers, or whether he be a gentleman who talks here with an accent which nobody in this House could understand but himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know which.  At any rate, I cannot understand Deputy Anthony coming in here and asking the Minister, for every gallon of Scotch whiskey ordered by these gentlemen with these accents throughout the country, to put a tax of £1 2s. 6d. upon the unfortunate taxpayers.  Does <Col N="865" /> Deputy Anthony want the ordinary workers in the City of Cork to pay their share of the £1 2s. 6d. tax that he wants taken off those who have cultivated this &ldquo;taste for Scotch,&rdquo; as he put it himself?  Does he want it clapped on to the poor man's tea and sugar? Then the Deputy, who wanted to have the duty on Scotch whiskey removed, went on to talk of Irish barley.  There is no doubt that he is a Party in himself. The same argument that I used yesterday applies in this case.  Neither the brewers nor the distillers have yet stood up to the statements I have been making here for the last four or five years.  We want to know what the distiller and the brewer have done with the 37/6 per barrel that they have taken off the price of the Irish farmers' barley.  Deputy McMenamin yesterday said the duty had no relation whatever to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No wonder Deputy McMenamin came in here instead of practising law.  He tells us that this extra profit of 37/6 per barrel more than in 1921 or 1922 has nothing to do with the duty imposed.  Did Deputy McMenamin ever hear of profiteering? We know that the brewers could reduce the price of the pint of stout by 1½d. and still have 5/6 per barrel more profit than in 1922.  The same thing applies to whiskey.  The price of Irish barley from 1919 to 1922 was 52/- per barrel and the distiller and the brewer made a profit then.  I never heard of them boasting that they were philanthropists.  They made their profits then.  The price of Irish barley for the last four years has been 14/6 per barrel.  Only for the efforts made by the Minister for Agriculture last year the price of barley here would have been 10/6.  Deputy Dillon waxed eloquent on that point.  He wanted to know yesterday why we did not increase the demand for barley, and he has been here morning, noon and night bewailing the one successful effort that was made by the mixing scheme to increase the price of barley.  Another Deputy of his Party told us the hens would not lay because they were fed <Col N="866" /> on Irish barley&mdash;a Deputy from my own constituency, a barley-growing constituency. However, that is beside the subject.  I would not have alluded to it but for Deputy Dillon's nonsensical question, &ldquo;Why not increase the demand for it,&rdquo; when he is doing his utmost to prevent a demand for it. When the brewers and distillers cease to profiteer, when they say, &ldquo;We are prepared to pay the Irish farmer the cost of production for the barley he produces; we are prepared to go further than that and to give a little reduction in the price of the article we are putting on the market&rdquo; let them then come to the Government and I will support them.  I will support them after doing that, after disgorging the 37/6 per barrel extra profit they have got from 1922, when the price fell, up to 1932.  They complain that consumption has fallen.  No wonder.  No wonder the Irish farmer, who got 52/- per barrel for his barley then and who paid for a few glasses of whiskey in the public-house before he went home, and who, during the last harvest, when he went into the same market got 14/6 from the distiller for his barley, and when he went into the public-house found that the whiskey was the same price as it was when he got 52/-.  That is no wonder at all.  No amount of personal abuse by Deputy Morrissey or anybody else will get over that fact.  All the twistings and turnings by the Deputies on the Opposition Benches will not get over that fact.  Those Deputies are very careful to keep away from the whole kernel of the dispute and the argument.  Until the breweries and distilleries in this country cease profiteering at the expense of the unfortunate Irish farmer they cannot expect anything from the Dáil, composed as it is, mainly of Deputies representing agricultural constituencies. They can expect nothing else from them.  They have not passed on that reduction in the price of barley to the consumer.  Neither has that reduction been passed on to the local publican. It has been held where it is by the mammoths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made a suggestion here yesterday and I give it again for what it is worth <Col N="867" /> and that is let the brewer and the distiller come together and give a guaranteed price of 30/- a barrel for Irish barley.  Let them then take £1 per barrel off stout and they will still have 2/6 per barrel left over, 2/6 more than what they had in 1919, 1920, 1921 or 1922.  We do not grudge them that. If they do that then I will be prepared to go with other Deputies to the Minister for Finance and to argue with him for a reduction in duty.  I will fight for that reduction and I will vote for it here just as well.  I do not want to see the brewing or distilling industry in this country going down.  Though I am as much a teetotaller as anybody else, even though I might spend as much in a public house as anybody but not on whiskey or porter, I am putting up that argument.  Let the brewer and distiller first guarantee that the man who tills his land and employs labour gets his cost of production for the article.  Let them do that before any Deputy comes in here with an argument like the arguments we have heard. Deputy Morrissey is a great opponent of what is known as sweated labour but during this debate the Deputy has not opened his lips to say that the farmer and the farm labourer should get the cost of production for the barley they produce&mdash;that they should get at least their wages out of it.  Deputy Morrissey knows very well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want the Deputies who come in here looking for a reduction to tell us where they are going to get the revenue instead&mdash;where is this duty to be got instead?  Deputy Anthony last night gave one item on which revenue could be raised.  I should like to see ground rents taxed. I have made an appeal to the Minister for Finance already to tax them. I hope he will do so, but it is not by taxing that we will deal with ground rents.  We have another plan for them.  Apart from that, Deputy Anthony comes in here with an amendment asking for £1 2s. 6d. a gallon as a rebate for those who have cultivated a taste for Scotch whiskey. Now I am sure that those who have cultivated that taste for Scotch will be very grateful to Deputy Anthony, but if the Minister accepted that amendment and put 1d. per lb. extra on tea or 1d. or 2d. extra on sugar, the labourers of Deputy Anthony's constituency would neither be grateful to the Deputy nor to those who cultivate a taste for Scotch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let those Deputies go back and tell the brewers and distillers in their constituencies to give a guaranteed price of 30/- per barrel for barley.  That will only be 15/6 per barrel of the 37/6. Let them go further and reduce the price of the barrel of stout by £1.  I am sure that I and many other Deputies on these benches and all over the House would support them in getting the Minister for Finance to take off another £1 per barrel.  That would bring the price of the pint down to 6d.  Let the Deputies do that and we will support them, but let them not come here on behalf of individuals.  I cannot see any argument at all in the case they are putting up.  Surely to goodness they are not going to argue that the distiller and brewer are paying a higher rate of wages to-day than in 1919, 1921 or 1922?  The cost of production has not gone up.  They are selling less spirits and beer because they are turning it into a luxury.  I say they have not reduced the price of their product to meet the reduction they have made in the price of the raw material.  That is the whole issue, and until those Deputies <Col N="869" /> go back and do that I for one will give an amendment like this determined opposition here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>This amendment to-day has, to my mind, no merit.  The amendment moved yesterday by Deputies Rice, Morrissey and O'Sullivan, and by Deputy Anthony as well, had some merit intrinsically because it would be a desirable thing to reduce the duty on porter if from the revenue point of view it was possible to do so. I said yesterday evening, and I say it again now with reference to this amendment, that if Deputy Cosgrave, who is the responsible authority for finance in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and whose views on revenue matters would carry weight as a distinguished ex-Minister for Finance, came in here and said that after his experience of Revenue administration he was prepared to say that in the event of his forming a Government to-morrow he would remove this duty to the extent of £1 per barrel off porter or 22/6 per gallon off whiskey&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Had Deputy Cosgrave done that he would go a long way to rebut the estimate made by the Minister for Finance as to the liability that the acceptance of these amendments would impose on the revenue. But Deputy Cosgrave has not taken that course.  He has not taken that course because, being a responsible public man, he feels that he could not do that.  He feels that he could not recommend the Government or the Dáil to make such a reduction if he were to be responsible for the revenue. That objection, to my mind, is fatal to this amendment.  But there is another objection to this amendment which I do not think would apply to the amendment standing in the names of Deputies Morrissey, Rice and O'Sullivan yesterday.  I cannot think that as a matter of policy we should try to make whiskey attractive as a beverage. I think that where a commodity such as whiskey can be made to yield a very <Col N="870" /> substantial revenue we should not hesitate to exact it.  Personally, whiskey and beer are beverages I do not enjoy.  I am by no means a teetotaller, although I have great respect for those who are; but I cannot say that I can look with equanimity at any man with modest means habitually consuming whiskey as a beverage because, with the times that are in it, even supposing we reduced the duty to 52/- per proof gallon it remains an expensive commodity and a commodity which normally is not taken exclusively for its beverage attraction, but because it is a stimulant.  It comes under quite a different sphere from beer, and I cannot imagine, taking into consideration the amount of Scotch whiskey imported into this country, how we could seriously consider making a concession of this kind in respect of whiskey at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry dwelt at some length on the increase in the price of barley, and he pointed out that I had criticised the Cereals Bill, although I said in connection with the amendment yesterday that it was desirable to increase the demand for barley.  The difference that exists between Deputy Corry and myself is that I like to examine all the consequences of anything that I propose to do, whereas Deputy Corry only likes to look at the attractive consequences of what he proposes to do.  His motto is: <i>ruat coelum</i>, but increase the cost of barley! Tear down the State if you can put 10/- a barrel on barley!  I do not think that is a reasonable attitude to take, and the reason I opposed the Cereals Bill was that the increase in the cost of barley brought about by the Cereals Bill and kindred legislation resulted in a material increase in the price of feeding stuffs and other raw materials to the agricultural community and industry.  I believe, and I still believe, that whatever advantage the barley grower has got from the Cereals Bill legislation, the egg producer, the cattle feeder, the cattle breeder and every other section of the agricultural community have been made to pay out of all proportion to the advantage to the barley growers.  To my mind, it would have been of far more economical <Col N="871" /> advantage to give the barley growers a bonus per barrel on the barley produced than to put the Cereals Bill into operation.  I do not want to pursue that argument, because it only came in as a result of what Deputy Corry said, but, perhaps, he will understand now the reason why I support a project in one set of circumstances and not in another.</P>

      <P>No, that is not the reason.  To come back, however, to what I was saying: There is one man on the Opposition Benches whose special knowledge and valued opinion will carry more weight than that of anybody else in support of this amendment. As I said, I refer to Deputy Cosgrave who was a Minister for Finance of this State and understands the matter from a revenue point of view.  If Deputy Cosgrave had said last night that, in his opinion, the Minister for Finance's estimate was grossly inflated from the practical revenue point of view, a very different situation would have arisen.  If he gets up now and says that the revenue will suffer no irreparable loss as a result of this amendment it will be different.  Even so, I would still oppose this amendment but if he had said it last night it would alter the whole case.  He has not said it, however, and I believe that he has not said it because, being a responsible man and knowing what it is to be responsible for the revenue of the State, he knows that he could not say it, and that is the reason I opposed this amendment.</P>

In connection with sub-section (1)&mdash;the first part of my amendment&mdash;I want to state that there is no desire on my part, and neither is that desire expressed in this sub-section, to increase the amount of Scotch spirit imported into this country.  It is a well known fact, however, that for a very considerable period there was a certain volume of opinion in favour of excluding Scotch <Col N="872" /> whiskey altogether but it was thought more prudent then and I think it is the general opinion even now that it would not be a very good thing for this country to do for the simple reason that it might cause retaliatory measures to be taken on the other side.  What Deputy Corry says on this Bill, or for the matter of that on any other Bill, does not cut any ice with me because we have begun to regard Deputy Corry as the buffoon of this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 19 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 25 of the Finance Act, 1932 shall be construed and have effect on and from the 5th day of August, 1933, as if there were inserted before sub-section (5) thereof the following sub-section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Entertainments duty shall not be charged or levied on any entertainments as respects which it is proved to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that the entertainment consists solely of a number of races between greyhounds in each of which two or more greyhounds are released from a trap or box in pursuit of a mechanical hare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to have greyhound racing tracks exempted from the entertainments tax.  I do not know whether the majority of the members of the House are conversant with what I might call the greyhound industry, and whether they are aware of what an important part of our life and of our exports it is.  I think I would not be far wrong in saying that it is one of the most important and one of the most valuable industries we have in this country.  I think it will be admitted that the racing tracks are so many market places for the sale of greyhounds. They are, so to speak, the showgrounds for greyhounds.  I think it will be admitted also that, if we accept the fact that it is an important industry, and that it should be fostered <Col N="874" /> and developed, we ought to do nothing which will retard that development, but rather should give every assistance in our power towards its development. I do not know whether all members of the House received a circular which was sent out some short time ago by the body which is responsible for the greyhound industry in this country.  I want to deal first, sir, with the effects which the entertainments tax had on the attendance at the race meetings. I think I could not do better than to give a particular case.  Let me take the case of the racing track in my own constituency, Clonmel, and I will be able to demonstrate from actual figures the very great falling off in the receipts.  For 18 meetings held in 1931 at Clonmel, the average receipts per meeting were £115.  For 18 meetings for the same period of last year, 1932, the average receipts were £58, a drop of almost 50 per cent. That, I contend, was very largely due to the entertainments tax.  Let us remember that the tax is 20 per cent. on the gross takings.  I should like to emphasise that the Government takes in tax of one form or another roughly 10/- out of every pound that is paid at the entrance gates of those tracks. As I say, those tracks are, in my opinion, absolutely essential to the sale of greyhounds.  When we take into consideration the effect on this particular industry of the entertainments tax and of the dispute between this country and great Britain it will be realised that the industry is to-day in a very bad way.  On the question of sales, let me again take the track in my own constituency at Clonmel.  For the months of April and May, 1932, that was immediately before the start of the economic war, there were 130 dogs sold&mdash;those dogs were sold on the track&mdash;at a total of £5,592.  This year the sales to date amount to only £406.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>For how many dogs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>For six dogs.  I can let the Minister have even the names of the dogs, if he wishes, and the amount which was paid for each.  That will give an idea of what has happened and what is happening.  I think the Minister himself will agree that if it <Col N="875" /> is at all within his power to do so it is absolutely essential that this entertainments tax should be removed, and that we should try to help those tracks to carry on under very difficult circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I want to try to demonstrate how important the industry is.  There were 23,708 new registrations of greyhounds in the Irish Stud Book in the year 1931-32.  There are over 30,000 families engaged in the breeding of greyhounds in this country, and the export value of greyhounds in the year 1931-32 was roughly half a million pounds&mdash;that is taking sales both private and public.  In addition, I am sure that there are greyhounds sold and exported of which there is no record whatever.  It must be remembered that this industry is very largely in the hands of the small farmers and workers.  The breeders of greyhounds throughout the country are, as I say, the agricultural labourers and small farmers.  The only opportunity that they get of displaying those animals is at the local race tracks.  Of course, there is another aspect of the matter, and that is that those race tracks, particularly the smaller ones, have been of very great benefit to the towns where they are situated.  I myself know that the town of Clonmel, a town that was very hard hit for a number of years as the result of the closing down of a number of industries, and the wiping out of others for one reason or another during the different troubles we had in the country, was in a very poor way, and the population of the town was dwindling, although it was at one time one of the most prosperous towns in the south of Ireland.  There was practically no industry of any description until this greyhound racing track started.  It has been of great value to the town, and to the traders of the town.  It has given, both directly and indirectly, a good deal of employment at fairly decent wages.  It must be remembered that it is not only on the evenings that the actual races are held that those tracks are used. They are used practically every day in the week when greyhounds are brought in for trials.  A man who has a greyhound <Col N="876" /> can, for a few shillings, have that greyhound tried out to see what his value is.  I do not want to labour the point.  I have figures and statistics here with which I could delay the House for a considerable time, but I do not think it is necessary.  I am sure the Minister himself is better acquainted with the facts than I am. I understand that the matter has been put before him very clearly and very forcibly.  I just wanted to give the few figures I have quoted for the information of the members of the House who are not conversant with this industry. I sincerely hope, for the sake of the industry and for the sake of those engaged in it that the Minister will be able to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself unable to accept the amendment.  It is quite true that there has been, possibly in the case of the smaller tracks, some falling off in attendance, and a considerable falling off in sales.  But that is in no way due to the effect of the entertainments tax.  Rather is it due to the changed conditions on the other side of the water.  There was, undoubtedly, a great demand in England for Irish dogs at the time when greyhound racing was a flourishing enterprise in Great Britain, at the time when greyhound tracks were generally maintained in close association with the totalisator machine.  Consequent upon the Interim Report of the British Commission which was set up to inquire into this matter, and which recommended that the totalisator should be banned from greyhound tracks, the attraction of these tracks from the point of those who went to them to bet decrease very considerably.  With that decrease there was a consequent decrease in the demand for Irish dogs. It is due much more to that fact than to any other that the smaller tracks in this country have been hard hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it may be said that the smaller tracks have been hit, I cannot, on the figures which I have before me, and which I do not think it advisable to disclose to the House, convince myself that there is not available for the general purposes of the State considerable room for tax in connection with this sport.  The acceptance of this <Col N="877" /> amendment would cost us some thousands of pounds.  The Budget has been balanced, with a nominal balance of something like £32,000.  We could not possibly do anything which would jeopardise that position.  Matters have been calculated to the nearest penny. So far as we can see, all the estimates have been carefully pruned and cut down.  Further taxation has been imposed. As much as could be justifiably borrowed has been borrowed, and, consequently, every penny piece that we anticipate we should get from the existing taxation must come in; otherwise, the budgetary position will be in danger.  On that ground alone, even if the case for this amendment had greater merits than it has, I would still be in the position that I would be compelled to refuse to give anything like the general concession asked for in the amendment.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the precarious position, in some cases, in which the smaller tracks are.  I am not anxious to close them down, and I am investigating the matter to see if I can give them some relief which will not be anything like widespread relief or a general remission.  I have not got all the information that would enable me to formulate proposals.  I do not bind myself to introduce proposals on the Report Stage which will give relief, but I will look into the matter in order to see if anything can be done in the case of the small tracks.  I am perfectly convinced from the figures before me that, so far as greyhound racing in the larger cities is concerned, it has not been adversely affected.  Even if it were, I know the profits made in past years by these concerns have been of very great dimensions indeed.  I am satisfied they are running at the moment at nothing like a loss.  I think the profits are still considerable, and the State, in view of the fact that it is taxing other forms of amusement, to which some people, I not being one of them, might take less objection than has been taken in certain quarters to greyhound racing, could not possibly give the general remission asked for in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>While I regret the Minister cannot see his way to accept the <Col N="878" /> amendment, I feel that we can be satisfied at the moment in the hope that he may bring forward something on Report to deal with the critical position of the smaller tracks.  Admitting, as he now does&mdash;he did not admit it last year&mdash;that this is a business of very considerable importance, it is difficult to understand why the Minister will not accept the amendment.  Exactly the same case can be made for exempting greyhound tracks from entertainment tax as was made for the exemption of horse racing.  Horse racing was exempted purely and solely to give a fillip to the horse breeding industry. That is an industry in which there is a great deal of capital involved, but the persons interested are few in comparison with the persons interested in greyhound breeding.</P>
      <P>The breeding of greyhounds is very widespread and, as Deputy Morrissey said, it is almost entirely confined to small farmers and labourers.  In North Kerry there is not a labourer's cottage nor a farmhouse where you will not find at least one dog and in some places you would be nearly eaten if you went into the yard, as there are at least half a dozen dogs prowling about.  It has become an important industry.  There is no need to stress the fact that the breeding of greyhounds can only be profitable if there is a local track on which the dogs can be trained and tried.  As Deputy Morrissey says, the local track is really the market or, at least, the show ground where the dogs can be exhibited and put on trial.  The Minister has stated that he will consider the position of the tracks that are in a precarious position.  We will be satisfied with that, although we would much prefer if he would go the whole hog and exempt them entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am gratified to hear that the Minister will endeavour to see his way to make a concession in regard to this matter.  Here is something which is, as Deputy Lynch and Deputy Morrissey pointed out, a valuable growing industry.  I think if the Labour Party were here they would confirm me in saying that this is for the man with modest means what horse racing is for the man with ample means.  The rearing of greyhounds for <Col N="879" /> racing and coursing constitutes an industry in many parts of the country. It will prove a valuable one, and is well within the capacity of a man in a comparatively small way of business. There is no doubt that greyhound track racing is assuming an even more important position in the greyhound breeding business than coursing.</P>
      <P>I think the case made to-day for a concession is a particularly strong one. I hope when the Minister looks into the matter and weighs carefully the advantages that the small man will get from it, both from the point of view of profit in breeding and amusement in attending the greyhound racing meetings, he will be able to see his way to exempt this amusement from the operations of the tax and defend his doing so on the ground that it is a harmless amusement taken in moderation and, in addition, is a valuable adjunct to a growing industry which may prove to be of great value to the smaller farmers in the agricultural community in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I hope to be able to say something on the Report Stage in regard to them.  I may possibly bring forward an amendment granting some remission.  I say &ldquo;possibly&rdquo;&mdash;I do not go any further.  It is not a simple matter.  There are a number of tracks that can well afford to pay entertainment tax, but as to the smaller tracks I feel we are taking more from them than they can afford.  The question is, can we relieve them without having to relieve everybody.  In the present Exchequer position we cannot afford to relieve everyone.  I am trying to find a way whereby certain smaller tracks will come in under a special proposal.</P>

      <Col N="881" /> (e)  any games or sports which are ordinarily played or contested out-of-doors by two or more persons or by two or more groups of persons and do not involve the use or participation of horses, dogs, or other animals or the use of mechanically-propelled vehicles.&rdquo; (James Fitzgerald-Kenney.)</P>
    <P>9. Before Section 19 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  In this section the expression &ldquo;entertainments duty&rdquo; means the excise duty referred to by that name in and chargeable under Section 1 of the Finance (New Duties) Act, 1916, as amended by subsequent enactments, including this section.</P>

      <P>These three amendments seek to exempt certain forms of sport from the entertainment tax.  No. 9 covers the subject matter of Nos. 8 and 10.  It includes not only the games referred to in amendment No. 8, but it also covers boxing contests in No. 10.  I suggest therefore that the whole question could be discussed on amendment No. 9.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might say so, and if you examine it, I think you will find, that what is covered in amendment 9 is not quite the same as what is dealt with in my two amendments, 8 and 10.  It is quite true so far as amendment 8 goes, it is covered by amendment 9, except that amendment 9 is wider than amendment 8.  Amendment 9 would take in such things as billiards and other games of that nature not covered by amendment 8. Amendment 8 deals with games or sports ordinarily contested out of doors. Amendment 9 does not.  It is not at all so wide as amendment 10 for this reason.  If you look at amendment 9 you will see that it says &ldquo;Entertainments duty shall not be charged or levied on any entertainment as respects which it is proved to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that the entertainment is promoted by a club duly affiliated to or under the direct control of either the Irish Amateur Swimming Association or the Irish Amateur Boxing Association.&rdquo; That is confined to entertainments promoted by clubs.  But some of the most important boxing entertainments carried out are not promoted <Col N="883" /> by clubs at all&mdash;for instance international boxing.  It is not promoted by any club affiliated to any boxing association; its profits do not go to any club, and its losses are not borne by any club.  My amendment takes in entertainments promoted by amateur boxing associations.  I am sure that Deputy Traynor intended that his amendment should not be limited to any particular class of boxing entertainment. But if accepted in its present form it would be limited, and international contests which I am sure he might wish to include would not be included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9.  I am encouraged in moving this amendment by the belief that it will be unanimously accepted by the House. That, I am sure, includes even the Minister for Finance.  I am also encouraged by the fact that I myself believe that the exigencies of the period, that enforce this tax, have almost passed away, and that being so, I rather feel that the Minister will not be able to put up any great case against this amendment.  Boxing and swimming are possibly two of the most impoverished from the point of view of finance of all sports participated in by the people of this nation.  Everyone will agree with me, when I say, that education is regarded to-day as of primary importance to every nation. Second in importance to education, and in fact inseparable from it, is the cult of athletics.  If you go to any architect in any country of the world to-day, and ask him to make plans for a college or an educational institute, you could rest assured that, included in his plans, would be generous accommodation for athletics.  75 per cent. of the outdoor space would, I feel, be allocated to athletics.  If education and study are to be successful there must be some <Col N="884" /> relaxation,, and that is the reason why every education institute is so concerned with making provision for athletics.  There must be relaxation also for the workers, and the relaxation for the workers consists in going to exhibitions of boxing and swimming. Even although they may not be able to participate in the sport themselves, still if they ever indulged either in boxing or swimming, their minds will be running as actively on the sport as those of the contestants themselves. Without sport, education and study would be far from being successful.</P>
      <P>We all know the old type of professor, who was usually described as being hopelessly absent-minded, so absent-minded from the long hours of study into the early morning, that he sometimes forgot that there was such a place as bed.  We all know the old story of the professor who went up to his bedroom, put his clothes into the bed and hung himself up on the nail.  That is something that might possibly happen were there no relaxation through the medium of participation in some form of sport, or even acting as a spectator who shouts his side to victory.  Any young man who participates in boxing has to take part in practically every form of athletics. He has to take up running, both on the flat and across country, swimming, cycling, and almost every imaginable form of athletics.  As a result of that, the body beautiful is produced. Unfortunately there are not as many of these in our country as we would like to see.  But generous participation in athletics will always make for that.  For that reason alone I ask the Minister to consider this amendment sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Swimming is one of the most impoverished sports that we have in Ireland.  Swimming in Ireland is fifty years behind the times.  In the capital of the Free State you have one public swimming bath that was constructed fifty years ago and which has been only very slightly improved since.  There is one other swimming bath that is no more modern in construction or architecture than the one I have mentioned.  Nothing has been done to facilitate the young men in <Col N="885" /> becoming any more proficient in swimming than those of 50 years ago. I can give an example of that. Almost 30 years ago our swimmers were in the forefront in that pastime. One of them, a brother of Deputy Dockrell, who is in the House at present and who is a great authority on swimming, and will I hope support this amendment, competed at an international sports in Paris and won a race in competition against the cream of the world's swimmers.  I believe that was because at that period the facilities here were as good as the facilities afforded in other countries.  While we have stood still, however, the other nations have advanced, and unfortunately our swimmers, while they have endeavoured to surmount the terrific odds they have to contend with, have not got anywhere near the time of the swimmers of other nations.  That, I suggest, is due to the fact that we are not progressive enough.  If this particular tax were persisted in, it would almost remove any hope that we shall ever advance beyond the stage in which we are at present.</P>
    <P>To come back to boxing for a moment, many young men in Dublin would participate in boxing if they had the opportunity, after they had gone through their training, of appearing in competitions and competitive fights in public.  That is something that they all look forward to.  To run an entertainment from which money would be expected, and from which a tax would also have to be paid, would be a hopeless undertaking for any small club.  The result is that boxing, as far as the smaller clubs in this city are concerned, has very nearly ceased.  Young men who have had the opportunity of training and becoming skilful boxers have made a world-wide name for the Free State in athletics.  I suggest that in that respect they have done as much as, and possibly more than, our politicians in securing world-wide recognition for this country.  Boxing teaches self-control and develops will-power, and because of that I wish the Ceann Comhairle would suggest having a gymnasium here in which Deputies <Col N="886" /> might learn self-control and develop will-power, etc., which would be an advantage from the point of view of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>Originally the date I had in this amendment was 30th June.  I was requested, however, in conjunction with other Deputies who have put down amendments to this Bill, to bring it forward to 5th August.  I suggest to the Minister that he might restore my original date of 30th June, if he is giving the sympathetic consideration that I feel sure he will to this amendment, because the 5th of August to Swimming clubs would be of very little value.  The season will be coming to a close and whatever might be secured could not be secured by that particular date.  The Minister would lose very little as a result of the change and the clubs would gain considerably, because it would mean that at least they would not be forced still further into debt.  I move my amendment with great hope that it will be considered favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything that has been said in the well-reasoned speech of Deputy Traynor.  I should like just to say in passing that, if the Deputy's views are accepted and there is going to be a gymnasium here in which we are going to spar, I should be allowed to choose my sparring partner, and I think I would take the Minister for Local Government in preference to Deputy Traynor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to this amendment, I will first deal with my support of amendment 10 because I think amendment 10 is an amendment which will commend itself to the House.  I put down amendment 10 separately for that reason because it does appear to me that there is a stronger case for the sport affected by amendment No. 10 than there really is for any other class of sport.  As Deputy Traynor has remarked, Irish amateur boxing at the present moment stands very high.  In the last few years we have done very well at the Olympic Games. That is the position if we take the Irish Amateur Boxing Association or <Col N="887" /> the championships which were decided before the Olympic Games.  As showing the high-water mark reached in boxing in the last few years we find that the Irish heavy-weights won twice and the cruiser boxers won on one occasion.  That shows that Irish amateur boxing is at a very high peak.</P>
    <P>There was one remarkable thing the other day when the Italian team came over.  The Italian team is looked upon as the strongest boxing team.  That team met, not only one Irish but three Irish teams.  It met a team in Dublin and was beaten by that Dublin team.  The Italian team went down to Ballyhaunis and there they met a second Irish team not containing a single man who was on the first team. There the Italians won by a narrow margin of one.  Then the Italian team went to Cork and in Cork they met a third Irish team which contained not a single man who had appeared in any one of the other contests, and the Italians were beaten in Cork.  That shows that at the present moment not only is Irish boxing in an extremely good way, but that it is not a matter of our having one outstanding man in one particular class.  We have men in practically every class who are so close, one to another, that it is very difficult to say who is best.  I might mention too that it was very remarkable that the heavy-weight champion from Italy, who bore the famous historical name of Medici, was knocked down by the runner-up in our heavy-weight championship.  That runner-up was a young Gárda who comes from Sligo, and he is obviously not yet at his best.</P>
    <P>Irish boxing is in a very happy position at the present moment except in one single respect.  It is in a most unhappy position financially.  I have got some figures here which I am sure the Minister has already received.  They deal with the visit of this last Italian team.  The Irish Boxing Association was a sum of £177 to the bad on that contest, and of that £177 a sum of £83 is because of the tax.  In other words, the loss would be only half of what it is if they had not paid <Col N="888" /> the tax.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to another matter &mdash;open air tournaments.  International open air tournaments can only be held in the summer time.  All that the hire of Dalymount Park came to was £35. Until this tax was imposed the I.A.B.A. was able to get during the winter time German and other teams, and they were able to take, as they did on two occasions, the Theatre Royal for these teams.  Of course, the expenditure on the taking of the Theatre Royal is very heavy and it was impossible for them to attempt any international test last year because the international test would be out-of-doors.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing for sports to have an international test, a very excellent thing.  It gives men something to aim at and something to work at.  If a man is going to compete on behalf of his country for anything, he trains hard and puts more interest into it than he will do when he is just going to be top dog in this country.  That would be specially true if you had one man who was outstanding and had no one to compete with here.  I would like to give the Minister just one other figure. The I.A.B.A. had to its credit before the Italian tournament a sum of £173. Now the entire of its credit balance has been completely wiped out.  They say it is impossible for them unless they get this tax off to go on as they have been going.  That is the communication which I received from the I.A.B.A.  I am sure the Minister and other Deputies here have received a copy of the same letter.  In that letter they say: &ldquo;We unfortunately need this money and unless we get it we must go out of existence.&rdquo;  That is not anything in the way of a formula at all. It is quite obvious from the figures that they cannot carry on.  I would like to point out to the Minister that boxing in this country has been going ahead and going ahead in the most astounding way.  Any number of new clubs have been affiliated, not only in Dublin but all round the country.  I mentioned that there was a boxing club in Ballyhaunis.  Two years ago there was none there.  Now they have a very successful club, one that is able to <Col N="889" /> enter into the boxing championships. That is very creditable.  There are similar clubs in some of the smaller towns.  I am not talking now of places like Cork.  I will take an ordinary town like Ballina, which I happen to know, and Clonmel, where they have got most excellent boxing clubs.  In Tubbercurry, in Sligo, there is an excellent boxing club.  It is an expensive thing to carry on boxing clubs.  Boxing gloves have to be bought and there are other considerable expenses as well.  Boxing is not a thing that a man learns by nature.  He must have instructors and these instructors have to be paid.  There are now two boxing instructors in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The progress that boxing has made in the last four years is shown by the fact that the number of active boxers has increased from 300 to 3,500.  It is, therefore, a sport which is increasing in this country.  It is suited to the country and it is a sport in which this country shows very great proficiency. It is now in danger of being put back by this tax, if not of being practically extinguished.  I do not say that the I.A.B.A. cannot carry on because of the tax.  I do not say that boxing will cease, because the universities will still be able to pay instructors.  Boxing will also be carried on by the Army and Gárda, but as a national sport boxing will be destroyed.  I would urge the Minister very strongly to take a sympathetic view of this and wipe out the tax.  I do not know the amount the revenue derives from it.  Neither does the Minister, because I asked the other day and he was not in a position to tell me.  But I am quite certain that it cannot be a very substantial sum.  As far as revenue is concerned, it must be a mere flea-bite.  I would like to point out to the Minister that these taxes on boxing and swimming are really anomalous and unjust at the same time, because there is no tax on ordinary field athletics.  There is no tax on running, weight-putting and things of that nature, and it is an anomaly to have a tax on sports such as boxing and swimming, which are very closely akin to ordinary athletics.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be more logical in his Budget if he relieved the <Col N="890" /> tax on these two particular forms of sport.  I think if he did he would be satisfied that he had done a good day's work for building up boxing in the country.  It is a great thing in a country to have a sport like this in the winter time.  It is a great thing to have the young men trained to boxing and trained to take an interest in it. On its positive side, if I might say so, it is not only developing them physically but also, on its negative side, it is keeping them from association with undesirable persons.  I might point out to the Minister that the success of two of the clubs I have mentioned is due to the patronage and activities of priests.  In Ballyhaunis, for instance, it is very largely due to a priest there who takes a tremendous interest in athletics and it is just the same in Tubbercurry where the parish priest takes a tremendous interest in athletics.  Both these priests value boxing very highly as not merely a physical developer and, as Deputy Traynor has put it, a character developer, but also they value it as keeping the young men out of mischief and getting them to take a healthy outlook upon life.</P>
    <P>I dealt with this at greater length, possibly, than I meant to, but it is hard to remain concise upon such a subject.  The remainder of my amendment deals with all outdoor sports and games.  Again, I do not know what the loss to the revenue would be.  Assuming that the cost would be even the same as last year it might be serious as far as some games are concerned.  It might be serious I admit, but I do not know and I assume the Minister will tell us. About these outdoor games, however, there are some things I should like to say.  Taxation or the entertainment tax most undoubtedly tends to keep them back.  I know that one particular game of football is not taxed at the present moment while other games of football are taxed.  It is quite probable that somebody may get up and say to me that it is the home game that is exempt from tax and that they are foreign games which are being taxed.  As a matter of fact, no matter what their origin may be, they are all games which are being played in this <Col N="891" /> country.  I do not think myself&mdash;I know it is a matter upon which people who are interested in Gaelic football are divided in their opinions&mdash;but I do not think myself that Gaelic football would suffer in the slightest degree if the other games were exempt from taxation and put upon an equal footing with it.  Gaelic football, after all, has now been established very well.  It is on a firm footing and is perfectly fit to stand up on its own legs without any extraneous assistance of any kind. It is a game which is peculiarly suited to a great number of persons in this country.  It is more suited than any other game, because Gaelic football is largely a game of long kicking and, in consequence, the man playing it is not under the same necessity of being in a very high class of training, such as the person who plays the other two games.  A great number of the people who play Gaelic football are shop assistants and clerks and people of that kind who are not in a position to train. Therefore, I think that Gaelic football is a game admirably suited to this country and a game which is founded perfectly solidly and which is perfectly sure of its ground.</P>
    <P>On this question of foreign games, I think that calling a game foreign as an abusive epithet is rather a mistake. For instance, take the case of Rugby football, which is one of the most popular games in England, but, so far as England is concerned, it is a foreign game.  If any Deputy is interested in the history of Rugby football he will find it very completely recounted in an article which appeared in the Cornhill Magazine some years ago.  Briefly, the history is that in the County Tipperary there used to be a football game in which one parish played against another parish and the ball was brought to its destination by using any method the players liked&mdash;either by kicking it or boxing it with their hands or catching it and running with it.  A boy who had played this game in Tipperary was afterwards sent to Rugby College, and while being educated there he went out to play the ordinary game of football, which was, <Col N="892" /> I think, something on the lines of Association football&mdash;that it is a foul if the ball touches your hand and so on&mdash;but this boy became intensely excited and, forgetting that he was in Warwickshire and not in Tipperary, he caught up the ball and ran away with it as hard as he could.  That gave the players and the authorities of Rugby School a different idea, and so the game now known as Rugby was founded.  The old principle that you could either kick the ball or run with the ball was introduced by this boy from Tipperary to English football for the first time.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Rugby is a foreign game so far as England is concerned, but nobody in England starts up to declare that it is wrong to play it because it is foreign.  Take the case of Association football.  That has become a world-wide game.  You see it played practically in every country in Europe. Austria and Spain, I think, are the principal Continental countries in which it is most vigorously played.  In fact, I see now that it has become so popular in Spain that the bull fight has practically ceased to exist, and the place formerly occupied by the toreador in popular estimation is now occupied by the centre forward who is particularly skilled in placing goals. They do not think that they are any the worse Spaniards because it is a foreign game.  I would suggest to the Minister that it would be a very good thing if there was no discrimination by the Government as far as games are concerned.  Let anybody play any game he or she likes.  It certainly will not hurt Gaelic football.  As a matter of fact, I think that, apart from the amendment before the House&mdash;I may be out of order in making this remark possibly&mdash;I think that if the ban were taken off altogether Gaelic football would improve.  However, I will stop before I am out of order.</P>
    <P>The other games referred to are smaller games.  Handball is a good and popular game, and I think that the receipts to the Exchequer would be very small.  I think that gymnastic displays are much the same.  I will return, however, to where I began, and impress on the Minister that boxing <Col N="893" /> has really the highest claim of all, though I do not say that, if the tax is taken off, it will be in a flourishing condition.  It will not.  It has a frightful battle in front of it, but it has absolutely no hope of victory if this clause remains.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very pleasant thing indeed to see both sides of the House more or less united in sport and anything which will help the conditions and the different forms of games, such as exempting them from taxation, will meet undoubtedly with the sympathy of all.  I can quite appreciate the fact that the Minister for Finance is very hard put to it to find every source from which to balance his Budget, and although he may be quite sympathetic to the views expressed here, he may not be able to give those concessions. Deputy Oscar Traynor made a very good appeal, backed up on a larger and wider scale by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. There is no doubt whatever that boxing in this country, unless it is put into a financial state in which it can carry on, will ultimately fall back. We are lucky at the present moment in having associated with amateur boxing keen enthusiasts, both inside and outside the ring.  I remember comparatively recent times when Irish amateur boxers were known as horizontal champions.  At any time when they were brought into the few international contests there were then, they got nowhere at all, due to the fact that their training was haphazard and encouragement was lacking.  In other countries, particularly in America, boxing has risen to the top, because it had an opportunity, and because it had gymnasiums, and expert help and advice.  Sport is the greatest ambassador in the world. Everybody knows that.  Where a country can show fine men, men who can meet the best in the world, whether it is on the track or in the ring, or whether it is in the swimming pool, that country's flag goes up.  I think Deputy Traynor was right when he stated that they can do more for a country than politics.  He referred to the impoverished state of Irish swimming, and he referred to Deputy Dockrell's brother&mdash;G.S. Dockrell.  I can <Col N="894" /> prove, even by my memory of figures, the impoverished state of swimming, both from the point of view of time made in respect of races, as well as financially, to bear out his contention. G.S. Dockrell did the 100 yards in 30 seconds; G.S. Daniels did it in 55 seconds; Zoltan De Halmay, of Hungary, did it in 58 seconds.  The best now in which they could do it in Ireland is 62½ seconds, whereas in America they are doing it in 53 seconds.  Why?  Simply and solely because we have not got the financial push and backing.  If clubs have not got the financial resources the sport suffers.  We have only one swimming bath here, Blackrock.  The rest are only swimming pools.</P>

      <P>It is not big enough for racing.  I have been in Clontarf and swam there myself, and I know it.  I do not wish to delay the House any further.  I think that Irish amateur boxing at the present moment is lucky in its enthusiasts, but that the financial position, being bad, will have bad effects later on.  Hence it is that good material is subject to professional attraction.  They have not got the facilities around them, and therefore if they are making headway at all they leave this country and go elsewhere. We are proud of the achievements, despite hard conditions and hard times, of our athletes.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney also brought in Rugby football in his amendment.  I need hardly say that all games and sport should be placed together, in justice and fairness, as a national asset.  Rugby, a game which I played myself too, has a wonderful attraction for the fighting spirit of Irishmen.  It has become an international game all over the world.  The American game is something similar to Rugby.  It is played in France, Germany, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.  I would ask the Minister to give serious attention to anything in the form of an amendment that will help on our games and help on our manhood.  Let those different clubs that exist, the different forms of sport and games, be able to get into a position in which they will have money and <Col N="895" /> reserves on which they can help the nation through sport.  I am quite sure that the House is unanimous in asking the Minister to do the best he can in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to make a few remarks in support of Deputy Traynor's motion I should like to consider the question of a tax on athletics in its very broadest sense.  We heard here all about Irish industries.  There could not be any industry more profitably developed in Ireland than the physical well-being of the boys and girls and men and women of the country. In ancient Greece the Greeks had an idea that a healthy mind could only flourish in a healthy body, and they proceeded along the lines that physical development and athletic exercise were really part of the education of the country.  I am afraid we have not got as far as that idea here in Ireland. In fact, I do not know if the Government would understand what we are driving at, but there is no doubt that in other countries they are advancing along the lines of the physical development of the whole country.  In Scandinavian countries, and I am not sure that it is not in Germany and some of the other countries as well, it is part of the school curriculum that they are brought from the schools and given instruction in swimming.  Nobody would suggest that the Government could put that in at the moment here, because I do not know where they would bring them to swim.  At the same time there is no reason why they should not aim at that goal, and have that achievement in their minds.  I am afraid that some of the present taxes on entertainments are really tending in the opposite direction.  I have spoken of the physical development of the whole country in the schools.  That is one end of the question of athletics that is not being dealt with at the moment.  Possibly, even, it might be considered that it is out of order on this amendment, but I should like to turn the attention of this House to the manner in which excellence in athletics is to be brought about.  It has to be brought about by many things.  First of all, you must have proper instruction. <Col N="896" /> In order that people should be profitably instructed, they may either have professional teachers or they can have sports promoted such as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred to when he mentioned bringing over the Italian boxing team to Dublin.  The Deputy did not develop an aspect that any of the people who participated in those sports would probably tell you about. No person participates in an international contest or sees an international contest without learning something. I am proud to say that our teams were victorious.  I venture to suggest that if you went to the victorious team in Dublin, or even the beaten team in Ballyhaunis, they would tell you they had learned something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will speak about swimming, because that is the sport about which I probably know most.  I do not wish my remarks to be taken in any narrow sense, because they may apply to certain of the poorer forms of sport to which Deputy Traynor referred.  The Minister may shelter behind what the revenue is going to lose.  I am leaving out of the question what the physical well-being of the country might benefit by it, and I will discuss the matter purely from the aspect of pounds, shillings and pence.  I was connected with a body interested in promoting galas.  Before this tax was imposed we had been in the habit of bringing over a couple of foreign teams and we were accustomed to sending from Ireland to other countries sometimes male and sometimes female teams to participate in functions abroad.  What happened?  There were certain teams due to come here.  There were no hard and fast fixtures arranged, but we were negotiating with a view to having those teams here and Irish teams were arranging to go away.  When the entertainment tax was imposed the promoters felt there would not be sufficient money to pay the expenses of these contests.  Accordingly, teams due to go on tour were told pretty shortly that they could not be sent.  Visiting teams had to be choked off more courteously and they were informed that, owing to the state of affairs in this country, it would not be possible to entertain them.  I do <Col N="897" /> not know what they thought of that, but certainly it was not good for athletics or for the tourist development in this country.</P>
    <P>Facts are brutal things and they have to be faced.  That was what happened in swimming circles.  I am perfectly certain you could go around to minor boxing entertainments and various other entertainments all over the country and you would find that teams that used to be brought here had to be stopped.  Similarly, Irish teams that used to go abroad had also to be stopped.  They have not been sent out since this tax was imposed. I will indicate for the Minister the position of a club that at the present moment is promoting a gala.  If they get a very fine day, an extra attraction, and there happens to be no competing athletic function, probably a profit could be made on the attendance at, say, Blackrock baths.  But if it rains, or if there are competing sports, or the visiting team or individual does not happen to be the draw that was anticipated, a very substantial loss may be entailed.  That sort of prospect has resulted in certain functions having to be abandoned.</P>
    <P>In the case of swimming, the Irish provinces are represented at a meeting and certain championships are allocated to various areas.  It is an extraordinary thing that some of the championships that are allotted to Leinster, instead of being promoted in the form of a gala, have been merely put down for decision at ordinary races in Blackrock baths.  Ordinary bathers have been interfered with for a few minutes until the swimming races are complete and the cost of the medals for the winners has been borne by the local branch.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at considerable length with this question in order to show the Minister that such functions are not being promoted now.  The function Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney spoke of took the form of an international entertainment and it should have been an enormous draw.  It really resulted in a financial loss.  That shows how wise these people are in abandoning the smaller athletic functions.  I am sure Deputies are aware of the attraction <Col N="898" /> that lies in bringing over the best types of athletes from other countries in order to show our people what can be done.  Certain speakers have deplored the fact that swimming has become less popular.  There is a reason for that.  For the last 50 years there has been a continuous improvement in the style of swimming.  The aim is to arrive at the shortest, easiest and quickest method of swimming.  Ireland has fallen lamentably behind in the race because we are not able to send people out to observe the latest improvements in swimming and we are unable to bring people from other countries, noted swimmers, to show the natives here the progress that has been made.</P>
    <P>Lest anyone should despair I would like to mention just one fact.  The present diving champion of Ireland also holds the English championship. That shows we need not despair, and if swimming is undergoing a temporary eclipse, if the Minister can see his way to at least remove some of the handicaps we are labouring under it certainly will be a benefit to that form of sport and to others.  Deputy Minch referred to the question of baths.  I am not going into that question, because it is a very big question, and I think it would be rather out of order in our present debate.  But I would make an appeal to the Minister, and I would point out to him that he is not losing revenue if he does not get it. If you are not getting revenue, not having taxed certain things, the Exchequer has nothing to lose. Certainly athletic development in this country is the poorer by the continuance of these entertainment taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must begin my speech with the usual unpopular pronouncement that the exigencies of the revenue do not permit me to accept, in full, the principles embodied in amendments 8, 9, and 10.  We do secure, notwithstanding what has been said a considerable amount of money&mdash;over £15,000 in one year&mdash;from the imposition of entertainments taxes upon certain outdoor functions.  At the same time I realise, and it has been brought <Col N="899" /> very forcibly to my notice in the past couple of months, that there are certain forms of athletics which have been much more heavily hit than others by the amusement tax.  Boxing is one; swimming is another, and there may be one or two more, but both of these have undoubtedly been heavily hit. I frankly admit that I feel that if we were to continue the imposition of the tax upon the function of boxing and swimming, we should be in danger, not of killing the sport, but of probably destroying the organisation that controls the sport.  And from that point of view I am prepared to meet, to some extent, the wishes of those who made themselves responsible for these amendments.  I could not give the widespread remission asked for, but I am prepared in connection with entertainments in the nature of amateur boxing and swimming and possibly lawn tennis, carried out by recognised associations, to consider them, and, if it can be done, to bring up, on the Report Stage, an amendment that would meet the position of these particular games.  I cannot go further this year.  It is my hope that we shall be able in better times, to extend the remission further, but, in that connection, I would very much like to make it clear so far as I am concerned, and so far as the Government is concerned, that these duties are not imposed because of a desire to penalise any particular game.  I recognise the full force of the argument as to the danger of killing games promoted by Irish athletes, and which are Irish games. But there is this fact; they are entertainments as well as games.  They are not merely games for those who participate in them; they are entertainments also for those who look on and find amusement in them.  A tax on entertainments has been a long, and well recognised, source of revenue to the State and must continue to be so. So long as there is an appreciable amount of money to be got from this source, and the Exchequer knows that, we are perfectly justified in seeking it. On the other hand we would not be justified in carrying that principle to the extent of disorganising the games <Col N="900" /> or of disorganising sport.  I feel there are certain forms of sport that are in danger of disorganisation, not suppression or extinction, because of the tax, and in these cases I am prepared to see whether I cannot exempt them altogether.</P>

    <P>This is an amendment to this section, the purpose of which is to enable the Revenue Commissioners to grant relief when, on account of overlapping <Col N="902" /> of enactments, an article is unintentionally liable to two duties.  As drafted, however, the section would go further, and would prevent the Revenue Commissioners, in many cases, from charging two duties on any one article, even when it was clearly the intention of the legislature that both duties should be charged, or at any rate, put a considerable doubt on the right of having both duties charged. The section, as amended, will afford power to the Revenue Commissioners to achieve the object which it was originally intended to accomplish.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the House would like to know the particular cases we have in mind.  Supposing a duty were imposed by Emergency Order it might possibly be held, if the section, as it stands, were not amended in accordance with the terms of the amendment before the House, that we had no power to impose the emergency duty, or that merely the emergency duty, and not the original duty, should be borne by the article.  It is not the intention of the Government that that position should prevail.  Similarly, articles upon which a specific duty was already charged might be imported as parts of articles upon which a specific duty was already charged because they were manufactured in this country and could be bought as separate components and imported as parts of another article upon the total value of which an <i>ad valorem</i> duty at a lower rate than the specific duty on the component might be charged.  It is not the intention of the Executive Council to permit these articles, which would be chargeable at the specific rate if they were imported as separate articles, to be brought in as the component of an article and chargeable at a lower rate of duty, because the rate of duty upon the composite article might be lower than the rate of duty upon the component part.  The purpose of this amendment is to secure that the Revenue Commissioners, in cases of that sort, will have power to allocate the article to the two categories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement is very refreshing.  At the same time, it does not bring one very far, because, apparently, it gives the Commissioners <Col N="903" /> power to decide.  The Minister has not given us any guide which would tell us along what lines their decision is to proceed.  Does this mean that we will not be able any more to debate in this House whether certain articles should be dutiable or not; that we would be referred to the Revenue Commissioners and told that their decision is final?  Naturally the Revenue Commissioners have their own ideas about certain things.  At the same time, to people connected with the trade, some of the decisions seem very absurd.  The Minister mentioned that an article may be dutiable under one class and also dutiable under, say, an emergency duty.  I wonder if he could be a little more specific and tell us if that is one of the articles about which I have been endeavouring for a long time to get a reply, namely, the cast-iron gutter.  That comes in here as a gutter, and there is no doubt that it is a gutter and that it is cast iron.  Then there is an article known as a channel, that is, a rolled steel channel.  Some individual has looked up what a channel is, and discovered that it was for carrying off water.  The Commissioners then said that a gutter is a channel and a channel is a gutter.  I drew the Minister's attention also to the question of a mangle, the component parts of which, the rollers, would be dutiable as furniture.  Some individual then said it was a machine, and, therefore, the iron was subject to machinery duty.  If that is the sort of thing that is going to be covered by this section, and all discussion and redress is going to be shut out, I certainly think that the section is going much further than the Minister has stated in giving an explanation of the official amendment.  I do not think anybody finds fault with a duty that is clearly imposed by this House, but there are certain border line cases, and there is nothing so important as that people in commerce should know where they are and that they should know there is not a continuous and progressive increase in the articles liable to duty, particularly in the case of certain articles on which duties have been imposed.  I certainly am nervous, <Col N="904" /> and I hope the Minister will be able to allay my fears, that under this Section 32 it will not be competent hereafter to raise a question such as that of which I have given instances.  I do not wish to weary the Minister by keeping him for the rest of the evening going into other instances.  I merely mention this as more or less the line on which I would like a definition as to what, in the Minister's mind, is underlying the idea in this section.  Is it going to prevent all discussion in the future as to what the interpretation of certain taxes means?</P>

      <P>There is just one point in connection with this section to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  It is with reference to the duty which was imposed last year in the tax upon any leather or imitation leather.  I would like to direct the Minister's attention to the rather loose way in which imitation leather is interpreted by the Revenue Commissioners.  At least its interpretation seems to me absurdly in their favour.  The taxes they now claim upon any imitation leather are taxes upon any books bound in boards or cloth and they are charging an absurd duty on rare and essential books bound in imitation leather.  I will bring a specific case up before the Minister if he thinks it would be more convenient.  I thought this was a good opportunity of raising the subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would be good enough to give me particulars of the cases I will have them taken up with the Revenue Commissioners. At the same time I would like to make this clear, that the general intention&mdash;and I think it was quite clearly indicated to the Dáil in the original proposal before the House&mdash; was that this duty would be strictly administered.  It is strictly administered. I do not know in regard to these articles to what degree the books referred to by the Deputy resemble leather or that the Revenue Commissioners hold they resemble leather.  I do not know to what degree, if there is no imitation of leather in appearance, they might be held to be liable. <Col N="905" /> However, if the Deputy would be good enough to give me specific instances I will bring them to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners and consult with the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to whether it was his idea that these should be subject to duty.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general purpose of the clause, I have to say that the clause is designed as relief for the importer.  As the matter stands at present, even where it was not the clear intention of the Legislature to do so, the Revenue Commissioners may have to charge a duty on articles under more than one category.  In consequence, a much higher duty than originally indicated would have to be paid by merchants or a considerable amount of time would be wasted, either the merchant's time on the one hand or the time of the Revenue Commissioners on the other hand, in determining exactly to what category the article belonged.  This section would give the Revenue Commissioners an opportunity of placing the article definitely in one category or another and be able to say clearly to the importer: &ldquo;This is the duty which you are to pay.&rdquo;  It does not mean that a person who imports an article or pays the duty cannot raise the question again.  He can take up the matter with the Revenue Commissioners or with me, and if he does not get satisfaction from either of us, he can raise the matter here. If there is any doubt on the matter, as to any particular point which would seem to occasion hardship, possibly it can be amicably settled here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general purpose of this section is to grant relief to the importer, to facilitate the clearance of goods and to convenience the importer as much as possible, at the same time paying due regard to the requirements of the Revenue.  I have here some instances of what I have in mind.  For instance, as the law stands at present, an article might be liable under two headings. Take a cast-iron wheel.  Under the Finance Act of 1932 it would be liable under the heading of agricultural machinery and chargeable under another heading under the No. 2 Finance Act of 1932.  It might be chargeable <Col N="906" /> under both.  The intention now is that in future and henceforth it will be definitely allocated to one category, so that it will be chargeable only to one duty.  The same holds good in the case of the cast-iron pillar and the brass name-plate which at present would be chargeable under two Acts.  Then there is the duty on brushes.  This would at present depend entirely on the nature and the type of brush.  It might be chargeable under two heads. Laundering boards and clubs would be charged as wood manufacture under the Finance Act No. 4 of 1932 and again under the Act of 1925.  There are a number of anomalies which this section is designed to remove.  It gives the Revenue Commissioners power to relieve them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we are now embarking on an entirely new departure.  I yield to no man in my admiration for the Revenue Commissioners and their staff.  My experience of both is that they are highly efficient and an extremely courteous and considerate body when you go to meet them.  In so far as they can possibly help it, they will expedite your business and they spare no trouble to do so.  But much as we may admire them for the way in which they discharge their functions it is scarcely desirable that we should set them up as a kind of second Dáil Eireann to make law.  That is what we are doing here.  I quite agree that it is very unfortunate that the tariff schedules should be drawn in such a loose way as to make one article liable to several different tariffs.  But then that is not the way we ought to draw tariff schedules.  If anomalies of that kind are there it seems to me that the proper way to manage is to introduce amending legislation as has been done at other times.  There have been some schedules already amended and there are some schedules in this amending Finance Act.  Bringing in legislation amending previous legislation of this kind is a laborious way of doing the job, but at the same time it is clear that we are in this Bill giving the Revenue Commissioners power that I certainly never heard of their having previously.</P>

      <P>This section gives them power, and it never occurred to me before that they should have power to settle a matter of this kind.  If difficulties of the kind the Minister has referred to arise, it is much more desirable that the Revenue Commissioners should place the dilemma before the Minister and ask him to come to Dáil Eireann and have the difficulty cleared up.  Of course, that is cumbersome, but it is the only correct way.  The position brought about here now as referred to by the Minister is one of the faults of the reckless imposition of tariffs.  It is not the fault of the Parliamentary system. If you are going to go in for an ill-considered precipate policy you are going to come up against these difficulties and you are not going to mend it by setting up another Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says, in effect, to the Commissioners: &ldquo;We will put them all in blocks and leave it to you to sort them out and tell the people what to do.&rdquo;  From time to time we tell the Revenue Commissioners that we find we are doing something that we had not intended to do, but we say, in effect: &ldquo;It does not matter; you can straighten it out and whatever comes out in the washing will do.&rdquo;  But it is whatever the Commissioners think we ought to have done that matters. If we considered these tariff proposals with the same degree of care that the Revenue Commissioners give to their consideration afterwards a great many of these ill-considered tariffs would never have been imposed.  In order to make it easier to go on in our mad career of clapping on tariffs we &ldquo;pass the buck&rdquo; to the Revenue Commissioners and say to them &ldquo;here is a tangled mass; please disentangle it and whatever comes out it will do.&rdquo; It is the Minister's duty to examine these and then to be prepared to stand over them.  I have told him, and other <Col N="908" /> Deputies have told him, again and again, that the tariff proposals were half-baked and not properly considered and he had not the proper information when he came into the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, whose good spirits please us so much, simply tossed his head on one of these occasions and said &ldquo;Nonsense.  Deputy Dillon thinks he knows everything.&rdquo;  One thing is certain, at any rate, and that is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce himself does not know much about the Bills he brings in here because he has reduced the whole thing to such a state of chaos that he is obliged to say that the Revenue Commissioners know their business but that he does not.</P>

      <P>It is very amusing to listen to Deputy Dillon but what he says does not happen to be correct. We are not giving the Revenue Commissioners power to impose additional taxation or to make new laws.  We are merely giving them the power, when an article is brought before them, such as a cast iron pillar, to determine for themselves whether it is a gate post and to be taxed, as such, under Ref. No. 20 of the First Schedule of the Finance Act of 1932 or whether it comes under the heading of fencing material and, as such, to be taxable under the Financial Resolutions of the 10th May, 1933.</P>

      <P>Yes.  A cast iron pillar is produced and the question that the Revenue Commissioners have to decide is whether it is a gate post and taxable as such under the Act of 1932 or whether it is part of fencing material and taxable as such under the Resolutions of 1933.  The same would apply in the case of a brush with wire bristles.  The Revenue Commissioners would have to determine <Col N="909" /> whether it is fundamentally a manufacture of iron or whether it is a brush and they would have to determine whether it was taxable as a brush or in the other category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be.  I am not going to put myself in the position of the Revenue Commissioners and settle it for myself but, if it is a brush with wire bristles, I would say that its essential character is that of a brush and I would not tax it as wire but as a brush or broom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they cannot. The purpose is to give them power, not to make new laws, but to determine what class or category an article belongs to.  The Dáil itself has never claimed that power.  If a dispute arises the ultimate tribunal would be the courts and not the Dáil and no form of words in the wit of man could entirely shut out or exclude from one category or another an article which might appear to have dual properties or dual characteristics. The sole purpose of this is to say that &ldquo;In our judgment as Revenue Commissioners, charged with the revenue, we think this article comes under one category and is to be charged accordingly.&rdquo;  If the person is aggrieved he can go to the Revenue Commissioners and take the matter up formally with them or he can come to the Minister responsible for the Revenue or to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if it is a protective duty, and argue there whether this is an article which belongs to some other category than that in which the Revenue Commissioners have placed it.  If it appears, in the opinion of the responsible Minister, that his contention is right, and that, on the other hand, the law as it stands precludes him from taking it out of that category he can come here and have the law amended and take the article specifically out of the category in which it has been placed.  The main purpose is to give power to the <Col N="910" /> Revenue Commissioners to allocate a particular article to one particular category or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand the Minister's difficulty and I think that anybody with experience of cataloguing will understand the difficulty also of determining in what category to place any particular article.  It might be impossible or at least extremely difficult to decide definitely by detailed legislation beforehand whether or not an article belongs to one category or another. Apart from this, however, there are many things in the Minister's reply which have left me in some doubt.  I think he amended portion of the answer he gave, and I think he said: &ldquo;I am informed that as the law stands at present the article, as dutiable under two heads, must be charged.&rdquo; Apparently power is being given now to the Revenue Commissioners to charge it only under one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They feel constrained, as the law stands at present, to charge it.  I should put it this way, that they feel constrained to charge it under every possible head so that, irrespective of whether that was the intention of the Legislature or not, duties would be cumulative.  The Legislature might have intended that they should be cumulative, in which case it would be all right; but if that was not the intention of the Legislature, it would be wrong.  As the law is at present, they feel constrained to charge an article under every head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite clear.  I simply take the two cases. There might be cases where it would be catalogued under three or four heads and that would apply also. However, does not the Minister see the particular case that the Revenue Commissioners are given the power to tax or not to tax?  The Minister also said that power is being given to the Revenue Commissioners of allocating the article to one category or another, but in reality are they not acting as an official court of appeal?  In other words, the Minister is giving judicial functions to the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="911" /> in this matter, and I doubt if he can do that under this particular Bill.  He is giving these functions to the Revenue Commissioners, and I am not sure that there is any power to do so.  The Minister, in one portion of his reply, mentioned the courts and that there is power given to the Commissioners to decide in any particular case that the post in question is not a cast-iron pillar but a portion of a gate, or that a wheel is not part of a cart but a portion of agricultural machinery.  In reality the Revenue Commissioners are in fact, and that is the purpose of the section as I understand it, interpreters of the law, and final interpreters of the law.  I suggest that in future the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister may have some trouble if the Revenue Commissioners are given that particular power of interpreting the law.  I am taking now merely what I understood to be the Minister's meaning.  He said they may allocate; but they allocate only by interpreting.  They may have to do it administratively.  They are doing it more than administratively here because they are having the last word on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is so, because after the Revenue Commissioners have interpreted the law they have to determine whether an article is dutiable or not.  They have to determine it on the appearance of the article, and in accordance with the definitions laid down in the taxing Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

      <P>There is an appeal to the court, and there would be an appeal to the court here because the question might be as to whether the Revenue Commissioners had determined improperly, even if they had the power.  Again, I should like, if I can, to clarify the position.  At the present moment if an article might in any circumstances be held to be chargeable to more than one duty the Revenue Commissioners feel constrained to charge it to every possible <Col N="912" /> duty.  That, I think, is not the position which is contemplated by us. This amendment is to relieve the Revenue Commissioners of the disagreeable necessity of doing that, and the importer of the disagreeable necessity of paying the tax in consequence. It allows the Revenue Commissioners to say: &ldquo;This article belongs to one or, in certain cases, to more than one category and is chargeable to one or more duty as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I take it that the Minister really gave us the kernel of this amendment when he said that it was to be operated as a relieving section.  Of course that would certainly give relief if it is going to go into one section or the other.  I take it the Minister said: &ldquo;You have your appeal to the courts if it is wrong.&rdquo;  I take it just to illustrate the point I have mentioned, and I notice the Minister steadily kept off it, about the mangle. It will be either charged as an article of furniture or a machine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the mangle I made that clear.  Because it is an article of steel manufactured in Great Britain it is subject to the overriding emergency duty, apart altogether from the duty on furniture.  I will put it this way.  Supposing this particular mangle were not manufactured in Great Britain, but in France, it could only be chargeable either as machinery or as an article of furniture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain to the Minister what I mean.  We imposed a tariff of 5/- a sack on flour.  We gave the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to admit flour free of duty, provided the Minister for Finance consented. Here is a penalty for a breach of a condition, and there is a similar condition in the previous Bill.  I propose to raise again what I have raised before.  I submit that there is no necessity for the insertion of this section, <Col N="914" /> because it is not being used.  I have drawn the attention of the Minister before to a situation that has arisen in the County Donegal, where he issued a licence or was a party to the issuing of a licence for the importation of a specified quantity of bakers' flour. There was a condition attaching to the licence that that flour should be used for the baking of bread in a certain part of Donegal.  It was represented to the Minister that the licence was required because this baker was unable to get bakers' flour from Saorstát Eireann on account of the railway strike.  When the permit had issued flour was imported on the foot of that permit, but a large part of the flour imported was not bakers' flour but what was called household flour, and it was imported free of the tariff of 5/- per sack.  The individual who imported household flour on this permit proceeded to sell that flour to the customers of his trade rivals at cut prices, and flaunted before the whole countryside that he had put one over on the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Industry and the Minister for Finance, and that he got flour in free of duty while all the other people had to pay the duty on it.  I believe one or two other permits of that character were issued in the Co. Donegal. With reference to them, I have no information of misfeasance, but I have pointed out to the Minister before that if he goes down and inquiries from anybody in that part of Donegal, which I shall mention to him in private, he will find ample corroboration for what I am saying.  Where that was done is the Minister going to insist on the penalties prescribed by the Act being imposed on the individual who did it?  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Dáil disapprove of the action of the Office of Public Works in paying rates of wages on relief schemes which are lower than the rates prevailing for similar classes of <Col N="915" /> work in such areas where relief schemes are in operation.</P>
    <P>I move this motion because I think this House, certainly those members of the House who protest violently against the mentality of low wages, should be given an opportunity of dissenting from the action of the Office of Public Works in paying on relief schemes the miserably low rates of wages of 21/- and 24/- per week.  I think, sir, I ought to anticipate at the outset some of the erroneous arguments which will be used in this debate.</P>
    <P>Some members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;and the attitude is not confined to ordinary members, but apparently extends to Ministers as well&mdash;are endeavouring to show that so far as the Labour Party are concerned they have tolerated, and it is even suggested they have agreed to, the payment of 21/- and 24/- a week.  I want to correct these misstatements, because they are very definite misstatements. While I hope the correction will satisfy those who have been responsible for disseminating that kind of mischievous and misleading statement, at the same time I wish that those not satisfied with the explanation I am going to give will have the courage to say here what they have been saying outside at the cross-roads.  In November last, when the Estimate for Relief Schemes was going through the Dáil, Deputy Everett on behalf of his Party protested against the payment of 24/- a week on relief schemes, Deputy Everett then having some advance information as to the low rates of wages which the Office of Public Works proposed to pay.  On 6th January last a deputation representing the Labour Party and the Irish Trade Union Congress had an interview with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It will be observed from that that the Labour Party had been protesting to the Government against the low rate of wages which it was proposed to pay on relief schemes.  I was not present at the interview with the Minister for Finance.  Deputy Davin was, and I leave it to him to narrate the views of the Minister as then expressed. <Col N="916" /> If, therefore, we were protesting on the 30th November and on the 6th January against the scandalously low rates of 21/- and 24/-, it will be obvious to every fair-minded Deputy that, so far as we were concerned, the moment we heard of the low wages proposed to be paid we immediately made representations to the House and subsequently to the Minister for Finance.  When the interview with the Minister took place the Dáil had then been dissolved.  It was not our fault if the interview with the Minister did not take place much earlier.  It had been fixed on a few occasions and, because the Minister was not available, the interview had to be called off and later dates had to be arranged.</P>
    <P>Then we had the election.  The House met again on the 8th February. It sat for four days between 8th February and 8th March.  I raised the matter in this House first by way of question and, in view of the flippancy displayed by the Parliamentary Secretary when replying to that question, I raised the matter on the adjournment that same evening.  That shows that, so far as the Labour Party was concerned, not merely did it protest speedily, but it did everything in its power to have these rates of wages increased.</P>
    <P>I must take the House back to the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  In doing so I do not want the House to imagine that this is a complaint against the Parliamentary Secretary. It is true that he has been a rather uncouth mouthpiece of the Government in the Dáil, if one is to examine his defence of this miserably low wage; but then, this whole policy involves the wage policy of the Executive Council, and in that sense I want the House not to regard the matter merely as a censure on the Parliamentary Secretary.  In this matter he is just the instrument of the Executive Council policy.  When this subject was last raised I referred to the instructions which were then issued by the Office of Public Works in relation to these relief schemes.  The instructions were headed: &ldquo;Instructions to Inspectors.&rdquo; It was sought by the Parliamentary <Col N="917" /> Secretary to lead the House to believe that that was a mere routine instruction; that nothing new had happened in relation to the instruction. He said it was something that went out in connection with all relief schemes.</P>
    <P>It is worthy of note that 250 copies of the leaflet were reprinted in October last.  That shows conclusively that so far as the Office of Public Works was concerned this leaflet was reprinted six or seven months after Fianna Fáil had been elected.  Apparently there was so much community of interest between the present occupant of the post of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister and the last Parliamentary Secretary to the same Minister that both of them could agree that 21/- and 24/- a week were good enough for Irish workers in rural areas.  The publication of that document in October, 1932, six months after a Fianna Fáil Executive had been elected to office, is to my mind conclusive evidence that the Executive Council stood over the mentality enshrined in that document.</P>
    <P>What is the objectionable paragraph in the document?  This document, I may mention, is a circular issued from the Office of Public Works, a Government Department that ought to pay decent rates of wages.  It contains this statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The rates of wages in the case of relief works are, where possible, to be fixed on a lower scale than that normally paid to agricultural workers in the district.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a clear incitement to farmers who might pay reasonable rates of wages to cut their wages below the standard fixed by the Office of Public Works in connection with these schemes.  It is a clear expression of opinion also that so far as the Office of Public Works is concerned it considers that this work ought to be paid for on a scale comparable to the wages paid in the most depressed industry in the country.  That is the attitude of the Office of Public Works in relation to the employment of persons engaged on these relief schemes.</P>
    <P>If we ask ourselves the question: Why are low rates of wages fixed for <Col N="918" /> these schemes, we can, I think, get some interesting information in so far as the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned. Replying to my question in the House on the 8th March last, the Parliamentary Secretary said: &ldquo;On minor relief schemes, which were originally designed to deal with and confined to specially necessitous agricultural areas, the rate of wages is related to the wages paid to agricultural labourers in the district.&rdquo;  He adds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In response to strong local representation, grants for minor relief works have this year been made to counties to which they had not heretofore applied; these grants, naturally, carry with them the conditions which have always applied to and been accepted in relation to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The clear meaning of that is that the Parliamentary Secretary wanted the House to believe that these schemes were formerly confined to special necessitous agricultural areas, that in response to special local representations these schemes had been extended to other areas and counties, and that the original low wage conditions must apply even when the works were now extended to areas not regarded presumably as necessitous agricultural areas.  I do not know how the Parliamentary Secretary is going to justify that answer in relation to my particular constituency.  Works of this kind were carried out in the County Kildare in 1930 and 1931.  These schemes in the County Kildare are not new schemes. These schemes in the County Kildare are old schemes of 1930 and 1931 when we had the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in power.  Many of the things that they have done have not excited my admiration or interest. But we do find that in the County Kildare the wages paid under these relief schemes by the same Office of Public Works as that by which they are carried out to-day were that 27/- a week in 1931.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the Official Report that I have.  If the Minister <Col N="919" /> will turn to column 1389, volume 46, No. 5, and looks at &ldquo;Kildare,&rdquo; he will not find 21/-, but he will find 27/-.  The Minister can look at my report if he wants to.  I was making the point that the Parliamentary Secretary tried to justify 21/- and 24/- a week on the ground that these schemes are now extended to areas where they did not formerly obtain.  I have quoted the case of the County Kildare, and I have pointed out that in Kildare in 1930 and 1931 the rate of wages paid under the same kind of scheme of relief works was 27/- a week.  The rate is now reduced to 24/- a week in that particular county.  In the County Meath, in 1930 and 1931, the wages were 27/- a week paid under these schemes.  In 1932 and 1933, under a Fianna Fáil Executive Council, the rate of wages was reduced from 27/- to 24/-.  I will admit, quite frankly, that in some counties the rates have been increased, but if so it is because the rates paid in these other counties were scandalously low in that period.  We have clearly to understand that in Meath and Kildare, under a Fianna Fáil Executive Council, wages had been reduced on these relief schemes from 27/- a week to 24/- a week.  That is not merely on the plea that there is no more money to be paid for them. Take the action of the Parliamentary Secretary himself on this matter.  He has not attempted to excuse his own policy.  Speaking on the 8th March he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There are a great number of very poor people in Ireland to whom 24/- a week which they have received in cash for a week's work upon relief schemes during this year is the largest amount of cash they have ever handled in their lives.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know on what information or what knowledge of Ireland Deputy Flinn bases that statement.  I know this country as well as Deputy Flinn knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy questions that.  Well, all I can say is that his question is too ridiculous to answer. &ldquo;Twenty-four shillings a week which <Col N="920" /> they received in cash,&rdquo; says the Parliamentary Secretary, &ldquo;is the largest amount of cash they ever handled in their lives.&rdquo;  Long before the Parliamentary Secretary came to Ireland the Irish working-class people were able to work for, and received much more than 21/- or 24/- a week.  What I object to is the patronising, supercilious outlook of the Parliamentary Secretary upon the poor mere Irish.  Speaking later he said: &ldquo;In many cases this amount is being paid to people who never had these wages.  I have seen men breaking stones on the side of the road in Clare and Kerry&mdash;men who have never worked before in their lives for wages, and who never had a cash answer to their day's work; men who are working for themselves on piece work and who are anxious and glad to have an opportunity of working at this rate of wages.&rdquo;  I do not represent the counties of Clare and Kerry, but at least I am entitled to say this on behalf of the people of Clare and Kerry&mdash;and there are other Deputies here in this House who ought to stand up and say it&mdash; that that statement is a reflection upon the working-class people of Clare and Kerry.  Here we have attempts made in Clare and Kerry to pauperise the people and to brand them as a pauperised people, and to create, in these two counties, an untouchable class, far below the degree or standard of existence that should obtain recognition from the Parliamentary Secretary. Twenty-one shillings and 24/- a week are the rates paid under these schemes.  One begins to wonder by what process of reasoning or research, or on what principle of reasonableness the figures 21/- and 24/- a week were fixed.  It would appear to be that the Parliamentary Secretary said to himself: &ldquo;The instructions I have got make it perfectly clear that so far as these public works are concerned the rate of wages should be based upon a rate lower than the agricultural rate.&rdquo; One is entitled to expect that the Government would base its standard of value on the needs of the people, and upon the necessity of paying a decent rate of wages, and would not relate its standard to the standard of pauper wages paid in the most depressed parts of the country.  If the <Col N="921" /> agricultural wages were 10/-, is it suggested that the rate under the relief schemes should be 9/-?  Is the only justification for the 24/- rate that it is an attempt to pay a rate of wages lower than was in operation in agricultural areas?  If that is the mentality of the Office of Works and of the Executive Council, then I say it is a mentality that the Office of Works and the Executive Council ought to be thoroughly ashamed of, because if there is any justification for fixing a wage it ought to be on the basis of a reasonable rate, having regard to the nature of the work and the necessities of the different recipients of the wages, and of their being able to discharge as Christians their responsibility not merely to their families but their social responsibilities to the State as well.</P>

    <P>And when I mention 21/- and 24/- per week, I want the House to understand that it is not 21/- per week or 24/- per week all the year round, but 21/- per week or 24/- per week for a very limited period, and with broken time in addition.  There are many times that some of those people receiving 24/- or 21/- a week are compelled to stand off because of inclement weather, and in addition to that when they do work for a week they receive this wage of 21/- or 24/- for a 48½ to a 55 hours week.  They are subject to broken time.  Their weeks extend from 48½ to 55 hours, which may have to be worked down in a drain or in a gripe, and for performing that kind of unpleasant work that is the measure of remuneration the Executive Council thinks good enough for Irish workers engaged in such schemes.  Agricultural wages were suggested for comparison. Everybody in the House will be perfectly satisfied that the agricultural rates of wages were suggested as the basis of comparison, not because they were agricultural rates but because they were low rates.  The agricultural industry was specially selected for comparison because it was known to the Office of Public Works, and it must have been known to the Executive Council, that the agricultural industry was passing through a period of unparalleled depression, and that comparison with that industry would afford an excuse for the further slashing <Col N="922" /> of wages.  One would imagine that since the work in question was drainage work or road work or quarry work, some effort would have been made to compare the rates with road workers' wages, forestry workers' wages, or with the wages of workers employed on arterial drainage schemes.  No, instead, for special comparison was selected the agricultural industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the circular issued this year.  I have not got a copy of the circular for the previous years, but the Parliamentary Secretary has stated that this is the same as that issued by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering how long that principle goes back.  It seems to be an interesting point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say how long the principle goes back, but I do know that it is a disgraceful principle, and the greater the depression in the agricultural industry the greater is the disgrace in my opinion.  If we look at the wages paid to road workers, we find that for maintenance work, the rates paid to road workers vary from 26/- to 37/6 per week.  If we look even at the road work carried out by means of Government grants we find that the rates of wages also vary from 26/- to 37/6 per week.  As a matter of fact, 26/- per week is only paid in two counties&mdash;Leitrim and Donegal.  If we look at the rate of wages paid under the Department of Agriculture in the forestry section, we find that it varies from 25/- to 30/- per week.  If we look at arterial drainage schemes, we find that the rates vary from 25/- to 29/8 per week.  So that, if the comparison had been with the ordinary road workers, even the road workers engaged on Government grant work, or with forestry workers, or workers on arterial drainage schemes, considerably higher rates of wages would have been paid under these relief schemes. Instead of that, the agricultural industry was chosen, and, in my <Col N="923" /> opinion, it was chosen for no other purpose than that it would enable the rates of wages to be depressed in conformity with the depressed standard obtaining in that industry.  I might here mention that there is no broken time in respect of road workers engaged on ordinary road work, whether reconstruction work or maintenance work.  We have, therefore, this comparison: 21/- per week for 55 hours and broken time on relief schemes; on relief schemes on roads we have wages of from 26/- to 37/6 per week, and no broken time.  That is the comparison which I hope somebody will attempt to explain during the debate.</P>
      <P>I said before that this work was carried out under the auspices of the Government.  It was Government work and the Government in a civilised Christian country ought not to get down to comparing its rates of wages with those obtaining in a specially depressed industry.  In the agricultural industry many factors enter into the wages.  There is the providence or improvidence of the farmer; there is his thriftlessness, his inability to handle his industry; there is the possibility of losses in speculations in other ways besides farming.  All those factors enter into the capacity of the farmer to pay a wage.  Surely a wage based upon considerations of that kind is not a wage which ought to be emulated by a Government which frequently talks about desiring to see implemented here a Christian social policy.  There is a bounden obligation on every Government which functions in this country to respect and comply with the fair wages clause.  The fair wages clause requires a comparison with workers engaged in similar work in the employment of decent employers in that area. Instead of that being made a test in this case for ascertaining a fair wage, the agricultural industry was specially selected because it provided the most fruitful excuse for justifying low rates of wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken the trouble to look up some information as to what the cost of maintenance of a single individual is in some of the institutions in this <Col N="924" /> country.  It costs 10/- per week to feed a pauper in the Dublin Union; it costs 8/10 per week to feed a soldier; it costs 7/6 per week even to maintain an inmate in the Dundrum Asylum.  In each of these instances the food is bought in large quantities at wholesale prices, or in some instances is grown or produced by the institution itself. Although it costs 10/- per week to feed a pauper in the Dublin Union, he is housed free, he is clothed free.  The Office of Public Works, implementing the policy of the Executive Council, gives an extra 11/- per week to a man to buy clothing for himself, pay for housing, and to feed a wife and, perhaps, five or six children.  I hope somebody will attempt to explain these figures.  I hope somebody will attempt to show how, in relation to the cost of maintaining paupers in the Dublin Union, they can stand over the 21/- or the 24/- per week paid within 15 or 20 miles of the Dublin Union.  Remember, too, that these people are not paupers.  These people are supposed to be ordinary working-class people, working for a wage the same as any other industrial worker.  If they were paupers, you would find it difficult to justify paying 21/- per week to them. They are not paupers, but ordinary industrial workers.  The only pauperisation about them is the rate of wages at which they are compelled to work.</P>
    <P>I have seen attempts made to apologise for the wage paid on the ground that this work is not ordinary work. It is alleged that all this work goes to farmers to improve their own holdings, that it is given to people to make roads, and that they will subsequently benefit by the roads.  The attempt to justify 21/- per week must be becoming extremely difficult if that is what is being trotted out now as an excuse for this 21/- per week.  This 21/- is supposed to be the agricultural wage.  Nobody can ride away on that fact.  If the man subsequently walks over the road that he made, that is no justification for the miserably low rate of wages which was paid for the making of the road.  That is supposed to represent his wage for 55 hours' work per week, and excuses of that kind, which in any case are only partly true, <Col N="925" /> are not going to whitewash the Executive Council in trying to justify this rate of wages.</P>
    <P>If this question of 21/- a week or 24/- a week could be confined to workers engaged on relief schemes and that it had no other consequences the position would even then be bad.  But the position becomes very much worse when we find that this 21/- or this 24/- a week mentality, displayed by the Government, is being held up as something worthy of emulation by county councils in different parts of the country. We find in Clare recently that a motion was made to reduce the rate of wages on the roads to 24/- a week. We find that in the Cork County Council an effort was made to reduce the rate of road wages there for 3,000 road-men to 24/- a week.  We find that in the case of Waterford County Council a similar effort was made to depress the standard of living of the road workers down to the pauper level of the minor relief schemes.  That is evidence that this policy of paying 21/- and 24/- a week is seized upon by grasping employers, is seized upon by reactionary public bodies and is seized upon by people suffering from the economic disease of a belief in low wages being the cure for the country's economic or industrial ills.</P>
    <P>There was an effort amounting almost to panic recently on the part of some Fianna Fáil Deputies to explain this 21/- and 24/- a week wage. Deputy Cormac Breathnach felt uncomfortable recently.  Speaking at a meeting in Cathal Brugha Street, Deputy Breathnach, chairman of a trade union organisation, said &ldquo;he had seen a placard in various places with the figure 24/- as a weekly wage. That was not the Fianna Fáil idea of what a weekly wage should be.&rdquo;  If that is not the Fianna Fáil idea of what a weekly wage ought to be, I hope Deputy Cormac Breathnach before this debate finishes will come into this House and tell us, if that is not the Fianna Fáil idea of a weekly wage, how he can justify the payment of 21/- and 24/- a week as a weekly wage under the Fianna Fáil Executive Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> We had another distinguished contribution on this question by Deputy Briscoe.  Speaking at Christchurch Place on 12th June, wooing the electors to give him their No. 1 vote for the Dublin Corporation elections, Deputy Briscoe referring to the Economies Bill, made this statement as reported in the <i>Irish Press:</i>&ldquo;Speaking in reference to the reductions in wages he said they made no apology for the Economies Bill.  They had always maintained that there must be levelling down,&rdquo;&mdash;now, listen to the next&mdash;&ldquo;so that the people below could get something.&rdquo;  Deputy Briscoe's belief is that it is quite all right to reduce the rate of wages and salaries paid to a person earning £139 a year, if he is a teacher; that it is quite all right to reduce the wages of £3 4s. a week paid to a civic guard, or £300 a year paid to a civil servant, or £20 per annum if the person happens to be a sub-postmaster in the service of the Post Office.  Deputy Briscoe believes that this is desirable and right and proper, so that &ldquo;the people below can get something.&rdquo;  I hope Deputy Briscoe will come in and tell us who &ldquo;the people below&rdquo; are.  I should imagine that the people engaged on minor relief schemes are &ldquo;the people below.&rdquo;  I want to ask Deputy Briscoe &mdash;and as he is not here, I hope his colleagues will convey my words to him &mdash;are &ldquo;the people below&rdquo; the people who are engaged in minor relief schemes in rural areas?  Are these the people that he referred to at Christchurch place on 12th June?  If they are, and if he justifies cutting public servants in order to help &ldquo;the people below,&rdquo; so that &ldquo;the people below&rdquo; could get something, is this his conception of a right rate of wages to people on relief schemes?  Does Deputy Briscoe want to justify a 21/- rate per week?  He wants to cut the salaries and wages of public servants so as to help the people below.  When you come to ascertain what is the measure of Deputy Briscoe's Government's policy with regard to the people below, it is to give them 24/- a week for 55 hours' work, up to their thighs in mud and mire.  That is Deputy Briscoe's idea of his Government doing something for the people below.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as Deputy Davin interjects, not stamping their insurance cards in addition.  One could forgive Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Cormac Breathnach in the excitement of an election.  But the Minister for Education is not a candidate for election to the Dublin Corporation. He went down to Carlow recently. Apparently, the Minister was feeling the draught there over the 24/- and the 21/- a week.  He engaged in a long diatribe against Deputy Pattison, because Deputy Pattison had the courage to do what the Minister might have had the courage to do in other days, but has not the courage to do to-day, namely, to stand up in this House and outside this House to protest against a wage of 21/- and 24/- a week paid on these relief schemes. I do not want to refer at length to the speech which the Minister for Education made in Carlow.  I hope Deputy Pattison will deal with that, but there are some portions of the Carlow speech with which I want to deal.  I want to deal with these portions, because I think they reveal the puny, jealous, intriguing, inventing mind of the worst type of politician. &ldquo;No complaints,&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;were ever made by these people themselves.  All the complaints have come from politicians interested, who wanted to make a Party cry out of the grievances of the unemployed.&rdquo;  That is what Deputy Derrig, the Minister for Education, said.  I will quote in this House if any Deputy wants it, the resolutions passed by Fianna Fáil branches in this country protesting against a weekly wage of 21/- or 24/-. If the secretary or any prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Executive is here, I wonder whether he could get up with a clear conscience in this House and say that the Party headquarters had not been troubled over this 21/- and this 24/- a week wage.  I wonder what does the local executive of the Fianna Fáil Party in Cork think of it, or will they come in here and say that there has been no agitation in Cork over the 21/- and the 24/- a week? <Col N="928" /> Everybody knows perfectly well that the Fianna Fáil Party, that is the back bench members, who were prepared to talk and tell the truth about it, were for a considerable time in a state of ferment over the 21/- or 24/- a week. And Deputy Derrig, the Minister for Education, comes along and tells us that there were no complaints by those people.  The Minister knows well that he is stating what is perfectly incorrect.  I could quote resolutions passed by Fianna Fáil branches in his own constituency if he wants to hear them.  I am sure his colleagues could tell him with absolute accuracy that many Fianna Fáil branches, to their credit be it said, rebelled and protested against this miserable wage of 21/- and 24/- a week.  We get the extraordinary outlook of the Minister for Education in this phrase: &ldquo;May I say again in conclusion, that the difficulties in connection with this matter had not arisen from the workers themselves or from the small farmers or from the agricultural labourers either, but from the agitators who were trying to exploit and mislead them.&rdquo;  That is the worst cry of the mind of the Tory at his best.  That is the same kind of mentality that the working-class people had always to fight against: they had always to fight against reductions of their wages any time for the last 20, 30, 40, 50 or 100 years.  Anybody who tried to fight the battle of the working-class people was labelled an agitator, and now we have Deputy Derrig, the Minister for Education, going down to Carlow imitating what the Tory of 100 years ago did, branding as agitators those who protested on behalf of the working-class people against a wage of 21/- or 24/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputy Derrig, if he reads his speech again in his calm and sober moments, will readily realise that it is an ill-tempered speech and a speech bristling with untruths.  I think he will realise that his speech is a deliberate misrepresentation not only of the Labour Party's position but of the position of Deputy Pattison in particular.  If I were a responsible Minister I would be ashamed to say that that speech, bristling with so many untruths ever <Col N="929" /> came out of my mouth, and to be a member of the Executive Council responsible for controlling the destinies of this country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up any more of the time of this House.  I did not think that I would speak so long, but I do want to put it to the House that this rate of wages is disgracefully low and that the mentality behind the rate of wages is really worse than the rate of wages itself.  The mentality behind the rate of wages is a poverty-stricken economic mentality and based on a belief that poverty and misery and squalor are to be for ever the destiny and the lot of the plain people.  I reject that mentality entirely and I say that the working-class people of this country are entitled to expect from a Government that talks about Christian social principles some better standard of remuneration than is paid to them to-day.  We have had the issue raised very often as to whether this country ought to be a Free State or a Republic.  So far as I am concerned, I take my stand on this principle in that particular regard, that the people of this country, and they only, have the right to decide the form of government under which our people shall live.  I do not stand for anybody else in any country attempting to dictate to our people the kind of political institutions we should have; but, while I take that view I have just as much contempt for the Cumann na nGaedheal Free State which enshrines a 21/- a week wage as its industrial and economic standard, as I have for the Fianna Fáil Republic if it is going to pay the same rate of wages per week.  So far as the working-class people are concerned they have as little use for a Republic that stands for such a rate of wages as for a Free State which stands for a similar rate.  So far as I am concerned, as long as I am a member of this House I will protest, no matter what form of government exists here, against any attempt on the part of the Government to prescribe a miserable starvation wage of 21/- per week for the Irish workers in return for a hard week's work and as the Government's measure of what is fair and equitable <Col N="930" /> to enable the Irish worker to bring up his wife and family in a decent Christian existence.</P>

      <P>I think it might be desirable if I were to recall to the House and to Deputy Norton, who seems to have forgotten them in the course of his speech, the terms of the motion which he has submitted. The motion is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil disapprove of the action of the Office of Public Works in paying rates of wages on relief schemes which are lower than the rates prevailing for similar classes of work in such areas where relief schemes are in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the exact terms of that motion will bear a good deal of examination.  It is quite clear that they have been very carefully drawn. It is quite clear that they were drawn with the intention&mdash;an intention which, possibly, had not been observed &mdash;of carefully excluding certain questions from the discussion.  It will be noted that there is no reference in the motion to a specific rate of wage. Although Deputy Norton said a good deal in his speech about 24/- a week, the motion says nothing about 24/- a week, and yet this whole controversy originated with the allegation that the present Government sanctioned payment at this rate for works financed out of the funds for minor relief schemes.  As Deputy Norton has reminded the House, it was on this line that the attack was first launched, I think, by Deputy Davin, in the debate of November of last year.  It was renewed by Deputies Norton and Davin at the beginning of March, and I assume that the purpose of this motion is to lead the followers of the Labour Party to believe that the Party is, in fact, continuing that fight.  But that is not the ground which they have chosen in the motion, however Deputy Norton may have changed his attitude in the speech.  As I have said, there is no mention in this motion of any specific rate of wages.  In the motion Deputy Norton does not ask the Dáil <Col N="931" /> to condemn the payment of wages at the rate of 24/- a week, or even at the rate of 21/- a week.  In view of their past attitude and of the speech to which we have just listened, I should have thought that they would have asked for condemnation in explicit terms, and I can only assume that, in their considered judgment when they came to draft this motion, they came to the conclusion that the Party is not now in a position to say that in certain circumstances the payment at the rate of 24/- a week may not be defended.</P>
    <P>In taking up this attitude, it must be said that the members of the Labour Party are quite consistent with their past.  The confirmation of this will be found in the table, to which Deputy Norton referred in his speech, which was submitted by the Parliamentary Secretary in answer to a question on March 24th of this year, and which is included in the Dáil Debates, volume 46, No. 5, col. 1389-90.  That table gives the weekly rates of wages paid to labourers during the three years 1930-31, 1931-32, and 1932-33. From this table, if any Deputy cares to refer to it, it will be seen that in Leix-Offaly the rate of wages paid on Land Commission relief works, which is exactly the same type of work as is now being done under the supervision of the Office of Public Works, 24/- a week was paid in the year 1930-31, while the agricultural rate of wages in that particular constituency ranged from 23/6 to 23/9 per week.  In the year 1931-32 it was again 24/-, and in the year 1932-33 it was the same, while the rate of agricultural wages varied within the limits of 21/9 to 23/6.  We heard no complaint from Deputy Davin during the years 1930-31 and 1931-32 about this rate of wages.  I have read very carefully&mdash;as carefully as I could &mdash;the Parliamentary Debates covering the whole of that period, and there is no record there that during these years Deputy Davin criticised the Office of Public Works, the Parliamentary Secretary, or the Government of the time for having paid rates of wages on Land Commission relief works and minor relief schemes of 24/- a week. <Col N="932" /> It would appear that in 1931-32, at any rate Deputy Davin concurred in the implication contained in the terms of the Labour Party's motion that in certain circumstances payment at the rate of 24/- per week is not indefensible. I am not putting it any higher than that.  Again, take the case of Cork. Cork also figures in the table which Deputy Norton has referred to.  In Cork the estimated rate of agricultural wages in 1930-31 and in 1931-2 was 24/6 per week.  The rate paid on Land Commission relief schemes in the same year was 24/-, or a shade below the agricultural rate.  As Deputy Norton, like Deputy Davin, in 1930-31 and 1931-2 did not object to labourers engaged on those schemes being paid at a rate lower than the agricultural rate, we must also presume that he, like Deputy Davin, is prepared to concur in the implication contained in the labour Party's motion that the rate of 24/- a week is not in certain cases indefensible.</P>

      <P>In due course.  If Deputy Norton is assuming the role of the one just man who must save Sodom and Gomorrah we will leave it at that. In the case of Donegal, in 1930-31 and 1931-2 the rates of agricultural wages were estimated at 21/9 and 21/3 respectively, while the rate paid on Land Commission relief work was 22/- for each year.  It is not quite correct to say that we had no protest from the Labour Party concerning the rate of wages paid in Donegal, because in fact Deputy Cassidy did in 1930 venture to protest; but Deputy Cassidy received no support from the Labour Party in that protest, and in the following year he was silent.</P>

      <P>In Mayo for the years 1930-31 and 1931-2&mdash;and Mayo, it will be admitted, is a very significant county&mdash;the rate of agricultural wages was 22/- and 21/9 respectively, and the rate of wages paid on Land Commission schemes was 18/- in 1931 and <Col N="933" /> varied from 18/- to 20/- in 1931-32.  The Deputy, who at that time was chairman of the Labour Party, sat for Mayo, but during those years and under his leadership that Party made no protest against the rates of wages paid on relief schemes in Mayo, even though the rate paid on such schemes was then definitely lower than the prevailing agricultural rate for that county, which is particularly significant in view of the terms of Deputy Norton's motion.  Again, in 1931-2 in the County of Limerick, which at that time, as now, returned a Labour Deputy to the Dáil, the rate paid on Land Commission relief schemes was 24/- per week, whereas the estimated agricultural rate of wages for the county was 25/3. Similarly, in Longford-Westmeath in 1930-31 and 1931-32, when the rates of agricultural wages varied from 22/- to 23/6, the rate paid on Land Commission relief schemes was 20/-.  Once more, as in the case of Limerick and as in the case of the other constituencies to which I have referred, there was no protest from the Labour Deputy who represented the constituency during those years.  Likewise, in Wicklow in 1931-2, when the estimated agricultural rate of wages was 26/-, the wages paid on certain Land Commission relief schemes was 24/-.</P>

      <P>I am taking those figures from the table which Deputy Norton has referred to.  I have not yet had any remonstrance from Deputy <Col N="934" /> Everett.  I have not heard from him that he questions the fact that in 1931-2 the rate of wages paid on Land Commission relief works was 24/-, as returned in the table.  In regard to Kildare, I asked Deputy Norton, when he was reading that table, if there was any other figure for Kildare than 27/-. In Kildare in 1931-2, when agricultural wages were 25/9, the rate of wages paid on Land Commission relief works was in some cases 24/- and in other cases it was 27/-.  I think there is one other county to which I might make reference, and that is Wexford.  In that county in 1930-1 and 1931-2 the agricultural rates of wages were 23/6 and 22/6 respectively.  There were no Land Commission relief works carried out in the County Wexford in those years, but if there had been it is quite clear from the previous examples which I have given that the rate of wages paid on the schemes would have been strictly in accordance with the terms of the circulars issued by our predecessors in 1930-1 and 1931-2, regulating the rates of pay and conditions of work on relief schemes, and stating that: &ldquo;The rate of wages in the case of relief works carried out by the Land Commission should not in any case exceed the rate paid locally to agricultural labourers.&rdquo;  Therefore, if there had been minor relief schemes carried out in County Wexford in the years 1930-1 and 1931-2, in accordance with the terms of the circular the payment on those schemes would have been at the rate of 23/6 and 22/6.  The circular goes on: &ldquo;And if the rate normally paid to labourers employed by the Land Commission is in fact that paid locally to agricultural labourers some reduction should be made in the case of labourers employed on relief works.&rdquo;  It is quite clear, therefore, that, as I said earlier, the terms of the Labour Party's motion are quite consistent with the Labour Party's attitude in the past with regard to this matter.  Both from the terms of their motion and from their previous silence we must inevitably draw the conclusion that the Labour Party has always recognised that in certain circumstances and for certain classes of work <Col N="935" /> payment at the rate of 24/- a week or even so low as 18/- and 20/-, provided it is in Mayo and not in Kildare, apparently, is defensible, and in fact has been acceptable to members of that Party.  Accordingly, I submit that the whole case which Deputy Davin, at any rate, made in the debates on 30th November and on 1st March, in regard to this matter, falls to the ground, he having already acquiesced over a period of years in payment, in his own constituency, at the rate of 24/- a week under relief schemes for precisely the same class of work as was intended to be carried out under those schemes.  It may be, however, that I do the Labour Party more than justice when I credit them with the virtue of consistency.  There may be another reason for the rather curious terms in which their motion has been drawn. Deputy Norton on occasions recently drew attention to the fact that in some matters we have had the support of the Centre Party in this House.  That is quite true, but we never angled for that support.  We have been glad, as we shall always be glad, to have the support of that Party or any other Party for our proposals on their merits.  Any proposals which we have submitted to the House have been submitted because the Government felt that these proposals were in the best interests of the community as a whole. They were not drafted or submitted to placate this or that Party, to secure the support of this or that section. Can Deputy Norton say the same about his motion?  Is it not clear in every word that it is intended to secure the support of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, to make it easy for that Party to vote for it without covering its members with confusion in view of their past record and their policy in regard to relief schemes?</P>

      <P>Let us take the general consideration that arises on the motion.  The first thing we note <Col N="937" /> is that the Labour Party is now asking the Dáil to disapprove paying rates of wages on relief schemes which are lower than the rates prevailing for similar classes of work in areas where relief schemes are in operation.  The first question which must arise in this connection is a question that it will be difficult for the Labour Party to answer.  In the years 1930-31 and 1931-32 the rates paid on minor relief schemes under our predecessors were in many cases less than the rates paid for ordinary agricultural labour.  Not merely were these rates paid, but members of the Labour Party as a whole must have had full knowledge that such was the case.  I am certain that Deputies Davin and Murphy, who are conspicuous in this House for the attention which they pay to the affairs of their constituents, must have been well aware of the position in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin at that time was well aware that the rates of wages on minor relief schemes were in some cases lower than the rates paid to agricultural labourers.  I have no doubt that although Deputy Davin was aware of the fact, he made no protest. No doubt he was familiar with these conditions, conditions that Deputy Norton would describe as wage-slashing conditions; but Deputy Davin and Deputy Murphy and Deputy Everett and every other Deputy who was looking after the interests of his constituents eagerly sought to secure the largest possible allocation which could be made for their constituencies out of moneys voted for minor relief schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>During these years, when these moneys were being eagerly sought and when they were much more plentiful than they are now from the taxpayer's point of view, the Labour Party did not see fit to put down a motion in the terms of the motion we are now considering.  There was no question then of asking the Dáil to disapprove of the payment of lower rates of wages on minor relief works than prevailed for similar classes of <Col N="938" /> work in the district.  When we ask ourselves why, the only answer is that the Labour Party felt that in view of the general nature of these works, the circumstances under which they were carried out, and the primary object for which they were undertaken, which was to relieve destitution and distress rather than to execute works which would be in the public interest or would inure directly and immediately to the service, convenience or advantage of the community as a whole, it was quite justifiable to pay a lower rate of wages upon them.</P>
      <P>The next question that arises&mdash;and it is one to which I think Deputy Davin proposes to address himself and upon which the Parliamentary Secretary will listen to his remarks with some interest&mdash;is in what way do the relief works carried out by the present Government, and financed out of the Vote for minor relief schemes, differ from the schemes carried out by our predecessors in 1930-31 and 1931-32.  In view of the terms of the motion and the history and record of his Party, I thought Deputy Norton would have been particularly careful to point out how the works carried out under us differed from the works carried out under our predecessors and for which they paid rates as low as 18/-.</P>

      <P>In Mayo they paid 18/-, at a time when Deputy O'Connell was leading the Labour Party and Deputy Morrissey was still a member of it, on Land Commission relief schemes.  Deputy Morrissey was silent then.  I am very anxious to find out what is the essential difference between the works carried out in 1932-33 and those carried out by our predecessors. I am anxious to know what has made the members of the Labour Party so vocal on this matter.  No attempt was made by Deputy Norton, who proposed the motion, to indicate the difference. Upon Deputy Norton lies the responsibility of explaining it and refuting any objections or criticisms that may be <Col N="939" /> made.  It might be expected that by way of justification for this motion and by way of explanation of the change of attitude on the part of the Labour Party, some member of that Party would explain any radical difference between the two classes of work.  I say it is impossible to show any difference in the fundamental character of the works carried out by this Government and by our predecessors.  They are essentially the same; they are a continuation, an extension, a development of a service which was initiated many years ago for the relief of a type of poverty which tended to lapse into absolute destitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for a service of this kind was first recognised in 1891, when the Congested Districts Board was set up.  That Board spent large sums of money in carrying out minor relief works in the years it was in existence. When it was abolished its activities were taken over by the Land Commission and were financed by periodic allocations out of Votes for the relief of unemployment.  These functions of the Board, when we came to take charge, were for the better co-ordination of the work of relief, taken from the Land Commission and were placed under the control of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  I would like to point out that the functions of the Congested Districts Board in the first instance were restricted to certain scheduled areas.  In those areas when the Board was superseded by the Land Commission the allocation of the grants in general were continued to be restricted to the same areas.  When the first Fianna Fáil Government took office early in 1932 it had, in the first few weeks at its disposal, to make a very hasty survey of the conditions then prevailing in the country.  It had found that unemployment, destitution and distress were very much more widespread than our predecessors had permitted the community to know. The question of providing relief on a very much wider scale than had hitherto been done emerged at once as an urgent matter.  After a hurried survey which was made as searching and as <Col N="940" /> accurate as almost continuous labour could make it, the following allocations were made:&mdash;Increased grant for housing, etc. (private persons), £100,000; additional free grant to local authorities for housing, etc. (minor relief), £350,000; special grant for relief of distress, £150,000; and special Road Fund works, £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>The problem of dealing with distress, however, had only begun with the allocation of the moneys.  It was found that the machinery that existed was entirely inadequate to provide for administration and for the proper expenditure of these huge sums of money.  At last, by efforts&mdash;and I say it in view of the attacks which have been made upon him here&mdash;which I think I might describe as superhuman, the Parliamentary Secretary &mdash; Deputy Flynn&mdash;succeeded in co-ordinating all the spending agencies that could properly used for this work.  He formed a plan out of the chaos that he found existing and succeeded in getting as many useful public works under way as the existing organisations attached to the local authorities could properly undertake.  In this way the machinery was provided for the proper expenditure last year of virtually all the moneys voted by the Dáil for major relief works and road works proper. Notwithstanding these efforts, however, and notwithstanding the allocations which had been made to them out of the major relief grants, there were still one or two counties in which something more required to be done. Virtually all the useful public works that could be undertaken in these counties were under way.  There still remained a measure not merely of temporary distress but of almost absolute destitution to be dealt with&mdash;destitution which had been created by the gradual decline of the agricultural industry over the preceding ten years, and to deal with this there was no more money left in the principal Vote for relief, and, so far as could be ascertained, there were no more works of the character upon which money could be properly expended.  There was, however, still left unallocated some portion of the grant for minor relief schemes, and it seemed that in the <Col N="941" /> counties to which I referred there might be found work of a nature analogous to minor relief works on which the money might be spent.  I should like to emphasise that these were counties in which, as in the case of Kilkenny, Wicklow and Kildare, minor relief works had never, or at any rate very seldom, been carried out before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, this created one difficulty because the people of these counties in general were not familiar with the basis on which minor relief works were carried out; and the kind of labour employed upon them, in these particular counties differed in character from the classes of labour employed in the districts for which the schemes were originally intended.  In Kilkenny, Wicklow and Kildare those employed were whole-time labourers whose sole means of existence was employment for hire, whereas as a general rule in the other counties those employed in relief works were smallholders or sons of smallholders.  At the same time it should be noted, and it is very pertinent to notice in view of the criticisms made, that those engaged in Kilkenny, Wicklow and Kildare were in the main agricultural labourers who, for the most part, would normally be employed at agricultural wages.  Apart from this, however, the essential quality common to the schemes everywhere, whether they were being carried out in the Counties of Wexford or Kildare or in the Counties of Mayo or Donegal, was that they were works set on foot not primarily for the purpose of carrying out work which the local authorities or the State would undertake because of any return these bodies would secure from them, but simply because there was destitution to relieve, and it was thought advisable to exact some work in return for the money disbursed.  Thus in the case of Kilkenny, the work carried out consisted of: (1) accommodation roads which are maintained by the county council and as a rule serve a number of farmers' houses or give access to their lands; (2) minor drainage works designed to benefit the owners of <Col N="942" /> farms; (3) river embankments, works designed to protect the lands of farmers from flooding.</P>
      <P>We now arrive at this conclusion: that the position of the Labour Party as inferred from the terms of the motion and from its silence in the years 1930-31 and 1931-32 in regard to rates of wages is this: that they admit that in certain cases, particularly in the years 1930-31 and 1931-32, it was justifiable to pay lower rates of wages on relief schemes, or to put it in the terms of the circular issued in 1931 by the Land Commission: &ldquo;That when the rate ordinarily paid to labourers employed by the Land Commission is in fact that paid locally to agricultural labourers some reduction should be made in the case of labourers employed on relief works.&rdquo;  It seems to me that when we arrive at these conclusions, and bear these facts in mind, we must also arrive at this conclusion: that the Labour Party, in putting down this motion, did not seriously intend that it should have practical application, because in its terms there is no specific reference to any existing position.  It is a mere abstraction and should, therefore, be discussed as an abstraction. Upon that basis might I propose now to discuss the merits of this motion.</P>
      <P>The motion deals with the rates of wages paid on relief schemes, which immediately raises the question of the purpose of relief works in general.  In that connection it seems that a certain amount of confusion of thought has arisen, due, no doubt, to the form in which the Relief Votes have been presented to the House.  We speak of unemployment relief, and in some cases would seem to take the view that the sole and final end of these Votes is to provide employment.  But that is not the origin of the Vote at all.  There are many people in this country who are unemployed, who have nothing to do, who from many points of view might be better if they had something to do, but the Dáil does not vote huge sums of money to set those people to work; it does not even pass laws to compel them to work, for the simple reason that these people, though idle, are not in distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> The Dáil votes the money for relief schemes, not for the purpose of providing work as an end in itself, but for the purpose of providing work as a means of relieving distress.  It is true that it would be quite open to the Dáil to relieve this distress in another way, quite open to it, if the resources of the community permitted, and if there were not on certain grounds strong objections to such a procedure, to vote sums of money to relieve distressed people at so much per head, without asking from the recipients any modicum of work in return.  It is not certain indeed that in the narrow monetary sense this would not be the most economical way of relieving destitution.  That would be, of course, to leave out of account altogether the larger moral considerations upon which the State has decided, that wherever money is given some return in labour will be required.  This return in labour, it is to be emphasised, however, is merely a secondary purpose to the State's decision to relieve distress.</P>
    <P>The State, having determined that so far as possible distress is to be relieved by the provision of employment, the next question that arises is as to the nature of the employment to be provided. Naturally this should be, so far as possible, of a kind which would yield the maximum return for the money expended.  Therefore, in the first instance, an endeavour should be made to provide employment by public works of a productive and self-remunerating type.  Housing schemes and water-power development are cases in point.  If sufficient works of this nature cannot be undertaken, either owing to restriction in demand or to a limitation in the capacity of existing organisations, then works of general public convenience and utility should be considered, such as the construction of trunk roads, which might be said to serve the population of the country as a whole.  When the immediate possibilities in this direction have been exhausted, works in which the element of public utility and convenience is more localised might be undertaken, such as local <Col N="944" /> public health works, local improvement and development schemes and trunk roads.  The common feature about all these schemes, however, is that they are works which will yield a full social and economic return to the community as a whole, and they are, therefore, works of a kind which the community as a whole would undertake in due course for its own use, benefit and ultimate social and economic profit, apart altogether from any urge to provide employment. They are, therefore, unquestionably works in the execution of which every element, including labour, should be paid for at the full market rate.</P>
    <P>It will be readily understood from that, however, that as the experience of the past 12 months has shown, the demand for such works is not very elastic, nor is the organisation which would supervise and carry them out capable of easy, rapid or efficient expansion.  The possibility of relieving distress by providing employment of this nature is, therefore, relative. Accordingly, it becomes necessary to go further afield and to undertake other works in which the element of general public value gradually shrinks until it disappears altogether, and men are made to work, not for the return which their labour will yield, but for the sake of the moral discipline which the execution of work involves. In these circumstances men are set to clean up boreens, to clear out drains around fields, to make rough accommodation roads, to trim hedges, and to do, in fact, any odd job that may lie to hand, and which may be undertaken, not for its own sake, but merely as an excuse for paying wages. This position is very nearly, if not absolutely, approached in the case of works carried out under minor relief schemes.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious, however, that at this end of the scale, where work is undertaken merely as an excuse for paying wages, the considerations which must be weighed are quite different from those which apply at the other end where the work is undertaken for the public profit and benefit which it yields.  In the latter case the works themselves represent full value for <Col N="945" /> money, whereas in the case of destitution relief, the works themselves are almost valueless.  It then becomes a question of distributing to the best advantage the resources which are available to the State for the relief of destitution.  It becomes entirely a question of making the money go as far as possible and on the principle which the judgment of hunger and suffering through the ages has formulated in the aphorism that &ldquo;half a loaf is better than no bread.&rdquo;  It seems to me that the moment we get into this region, where there is a limited amount of money available and widespread distress to be relieved, the rate at which the money is given out must have regard, not merely to the rates of wages prevailing in the district, but also to the assumed necessity on social and moral grounds of insisting on a definite return of labour for the money expended, for in this case the purpose of the relief is to provide a subsistence.  I presume that, in the opinion of most people, it is better to keep men at work than in idleness.</P>
    <P>Considering this motion now merely in the abstract form in which it has been submitted to the House, provided the task required is not incommensurate with the remuneration offered, is not of a kind which would be normally undertaken by public authorities for some public purpose other than the relief of distress, is undertaken purely and simply for the relief of distress and for no other reason whatsoever, and that the rate of wages is such as will provide against want and destitution and, at the same time, induce the recipient to seek other work of a kind in itself more desirable, from the point of view both of the man and the community, then I think there is a good case for using the money devoted to this special purpose in such a way as will ensure that, during the period the destitution exists, the men who are in receipt of relief from public services will be employed as long as possible.  On this basis it seems to me that some distinction must be drawn between the regular employee of a public authority, carrying out the works of public utility to which I have referred, and the person <Col N="946" /> who by the mere accident of organisation is working under the supervision of an officer of the same authority in carrying out work for which the urge, from the point of view of public utility, is comparatively little.  It may happen that under this scheme both men may be shovelling stones, but one may be doing it with a serious constructive purpose, executing a serious work of public utility, while the other may be doing it merely in fulfilment of a condition for the receipt of relief money. The point which I want to make is that a distinction may be justifiably made in the respective rates of remuneration paid to these two classes of persons.</P>
    <P>This motion denies that such a justification can exist in any circumstances. If this motion were to be accepted, it immediately condemns the whole basis upon which minor relief schemes have been administered in this country for the last 30 years.  It may be that that condemnation would be just, but if it were to be accepted by this House, it would mean that, instead of asking people to give some labour in return for the money which they received it would be better for us, much more economic, as I have said already, from the mere narrow monetary point of view, to abandon altogether the idea of exacting labour for money and to adopt holus bolus the system of the dole which has been adopted in England and elsewhere.  I think that in view of the special circumstances under which relief schemes have come into being, in view of the fact that in general the work done by people under minor relief schemes inures directly to their own immediate personal benefit and advantage, that would be a great mistake.  I believe it would mean wholesale deterioration in the employable qualities of our people, particularly in the districts where destitution exists.  I believe also that, in general, relief for destitution would not go nearly as far as it goes at present, though in consequence of it the burden on the State would become so large that it would be impossible for them to take any just measure to relieve the distress which undeniably exists.</P>

      <P>County Meath has <Col N="947" /> been referred to by Deputy Norton as a county that received some relief money during the past year.  I want to place myself in the dock for having been one of the instruments by which that money was brought into the County Meath.  The Minister has explained the unusual circumstances in which money was made available. He has explained that the money was voted by the Dáil for relief schemes in the congested areas; that towards the end of the year it was found that too much money was voted and that some of this was available for relief schemes in other parts of Ireland.  We were told when this Government took office that the Estimates were prepared and that was one of the Estimates that was taken over from the old régime.  The wage mentioned was to coincide with the average agricultural wage paid in the districts.</P>
      <P>In applying for that money to the Board of Works we were aware of the fact that only 24/- a week would be paid to the workers engaged.  We went to the workers concerned and we told them the circumstances in which the money was made available. We told them that the wage would be only 24/- a week.  We put it to them whether we would accept the money at that wage or whether we would let it go back into the Exchequer.  In every occasion in the County Meath the workers asked us to accept the money and that they would work at 24/- a week rather than let it go back to the Exchequer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Norton has tried to force the opinion on the House that this is trying to set up 24/- a week as a wage standard.  He has referred to Deputy Everett and something which he said during the debate on the relief schemes.  But I would like to point out to Deputy Norton that he will find in the course of the debate in this House on the relief schemes on the 1st March, 1933, Vol. 46, No. 2, Col. 107, that Deputy Everett said &ldquo;I know that it is not <Col N="948" /> the policy of the Government, having adopted the policy of maintenance, to force men in the present wave of unemployment to accept 24/- a week. I have advised men that it is better to take 24/- a week than to have to live on 5/- or 6/- a week home help.&rdquo; Now Deputy Norton looks upon the back benchers of Fianna Fáil as men who usually tell the truth.</P>

A wage of 27/- was paid for drainage under drainage schemes, but I would like to point out that while the Labour Party were closing their eyes to the fact that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were reducing wages at that time, the Fianna Fáil members of the Meath County Council were helping to keep up a higher standard of wages, which was at that time 35/- a week.  That is the wage that was then paid and that is the wage that has been continued since.</P>

      <P>I know one village in <Col N="949" /> Meath in which 80 per cent of the population of the village had been idle for the ten years while the Cumann na nGaedheal Government had been in office.  Some of this money was brought there.  They accepted it and worked at 24/- a week, not because they believed it was a standard rate of wages but because they believed it was a relief grant and so they worked for it. We realise the poverty that exists in the working man's home.  We realise quite well the anxieties that are met with in the home of the working men in order to balance his weekly budget. We know the heartbreaks that are endured and we know of the miserable outlook of the unfortunate working man who is working at low wages and we are not so inhuman as to stand up here and declare that we stand behind an uneconomic wage, or a wage of 21/- or 18/-, or 24/- a week.  In voting on this motion we do not stand up for a wage of 24/- a week.  We do not proclaim that that is an adequate wage. We merely proclaim by our vote that the Board of Works could not do anything else under the peculiar circumstances in which this money was obtained and made available.  Perhaps when we are voting in the Lobbies we may be left alone and the Labour Party will be accompanied into the Lobby by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  Let us hope that Deputy Norton and the Labour Party will not see the ghosts of the past when they see around them the Cumann na nGaedheal members who reduced the wages in the old days and who asked men then to take 24/- a week.</P>

Every dead wall in the City of Dublin&mdash;we can see it coming in here from the country&mdash;is plastered with placards bearing the words &ldquo;24/- a week.&rdquo;  Why is it only placarded in Dublin?

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but from the speech of Deputy Norton to-day I really do not believe that the workers in Dublin believe that the low wage is the only wage that is going to be paid under works provided by this Government. I do not for a moment believe that the workers, either in the City of Dublin or down the country, believe that we are going to set up a standard rate of 24/- a week.  This Party has always stood for an economic wage for the people.  Now, when this country is about to become a self-contained economic entity we ask the people to stand by us and we ask the workers to stand by us.  Some sacrifice may be necessary, and the workers of the country are not so unpatriotic as to refuse to make a small sacrifice when <Col N="952" /> called upon to do so.  We are not asking them to work for 24/- a week. I would not be a member of a party that would deliberately ask people to work at an uneconomic wage.  I have stood by labour in the past, and, please God, will continue to do so in the future; but when a motion such as this is introduced in this House, which would force members of this Party, who have loyally stood by labour in the past and will continue to stand by labour in the future, into a wrong lobby so that Deputy Norton and the Labour Party could go down the country and say that we have been wage slashers and to enable them to send out that through the country when they have been silent for so many years while other people were doing the same thing&mdash;a thing which we do not intend to keep on doing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They will find out that even in politics honesty is the best policy; and if honesty is pursued by the Labour Party, as we of the Fianna Fáil Party pursue it, they will find in the end that it will have better results. Personally, I believe that we are justified in accepting some of this money and sending it down through the country.  We were not pleased with the rate offered.  We do not stand by it. We accepted it simply because we found that 80,000 unemployed were left by Cumann na nGaedheal and we had to provide for them.  A motion was introduced by Deputy Morrissey <Col N="953" /> to provide work or maintenance for the unemployed.  We were providing maintenance for them when we were giving this relief work.  I do not stand for a wage of 24/- a week and in voting against this motion it is not because I believe that 24/- a week should be taken, but because I do not believe in the sincerity of the Labour Party in introducing the motion at the present moment.  I have always stood for the rights of Labour.  I can safely say that this Party has always stood for the rights of Labour.  I am happy in the knowledge that I am a member of a Party which will in future defend the rights of Labour as they have done in the past.</P>

Whatever be the difficulties of the Government in the present circumstances in arriving at the rate that they will pay to workers on relief works, I should like to know from Deputy Kelly&mdash;and I should like to hear some comment on it from the Front Bench&mdash;what he thinks of a Party whose tax officials write to a farmer running a farm along dairying lines, along the lines that give most employment to rural workers, and point out that he is paying too high wages in the dairying industry.  We here in the City of Dublin are paying nearly 50 per cent. over the world price for our butter, and yet the Party opposite write to a dairy farmer and say that the amount of £1 12/- for John So-and-So, the amount of £1 5/- per week for Michael So-and-So, and the amount of 14/- for Patrick So-and-So, <Col N="954" /> are surely excessive for milkmen, and that such work is usually performed by women.</P>

If he thinks that the dairying industry is not able to support a wage of 14/- a week or 25/- or 32/- a week to milkmen employed in it, for the product of which we in the City of Dublin are expected to pay 50 per cent. above the world price; if he thinks that these rates are surely excessive for milkmen, what figures&mdash; if relief wages are to be related to the wages of men&mdash;in a dairying county will he say are suitable wages to be paid to adult males engaged in the dairying industry?  If the wages paid upon relief works are to be referred to the wages paid to women engaged in the agricultural industry, are the wages to be paid on relief works to be based in some way on the wages of 5/-, 6/- or 7/- a week for which the Minister's officials told the farmers engaged in the dairying industry women could be obtained?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to make a very long speech in this matter.  I have got up with the intention of asking a few questions of Deputy Norton or any other member of the Labour Party.  I hope that when they are concluding they will be able to answer them.  The question I would ask is if Deputy Norton has any solution that would provide work at the rate of 24/- a week for three or four months in the year for 10,000 or 12,000 migratory labourers from my county, among whom are about 1,000 women.  If Deputy Norton or any member of the Labour Party can suggest any plan that would give these 10,000 or 12,000 migratory labourers work for, say, four months of the year, I will guarantee to him that not one of them will leave this country.  From the town and district of Swinford 2,500 people leave every year for the harvest fields of Great Britain.  From the Island of Achill about 1,700 people leave, among whom are about 800 women.  I can assure Deputy Norton that if any of those men or women could get a guarantee of 24/- a week for the three summer months, and if Deputy Norton is able to provide a <Col N="956" /> plan to give them work at 24/- a week for the three summer months, the biggest monument that was ever built in the County Mayo will be built to Deputy Norton.</P>
      <P>Regarding what Deputy Mulcahy has said, and his anxiety about the rates of wages which he said are being established by the present Government, he is quite aware that this 24/- a week based on the comparative wages paid to agricultural workers in any district, was established by the Government to which he himself belonged.  He is also aware that during his term of office, when he suppressed the Mayo County Council and put a dictator in to administer the affairs of the county, one of the first acts of that dictator was to reduce the wages of the road workers by five or six shillings a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience during the last 12 months is that many of my own constituents have come to me complaining, not that wages were too low, but that they were too high and that as a result more men could not be employed.  I do not mean to say that 24/- a week represents an adequate living wage or that any Party in the <Col N="957" /> State should seek to establish 24/- a week as a maximum wage.  We are simply faced with circumstances in which we have to cut our cloth according to our measure.  We have a certain amount of money at our disposal for the purpose of relieving distress.  It is our business as a Government to stretch that money as far as it can be stretched so as to employ as many men as possible.  It is far better to have men earning 24/- a week than to have them receiving 5/- or 6/- out-door relief or 10/- or 12/- unemployment insurance benefit.  For those reasons I intend to oppose this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make special reference to the policy of the Government in relation to wages.  Their intention, apparently, is to introduce a wage of 20/- or 24/- a week.  I am forced to speak on this matter to-night because recently, when I considered it my duty down the country to speak as a worker in opposition to this policy, the Minister for Education thought fit to come down the following week-end to launch an attack on the Labour Party and upon me personally as the Labour representative of the constituency of which the Minister is also a representative.  I am sorry the Minister for Education is not here to-night.  I intend later to meet him outside the House and to deal with all the references he made to the Labour Party and to myself in his Carlow speech.</P>
      <P>The first time I heard about this wage of 24/- was shortly after my election as a member of the Dáil.  I was informed about it by a very important supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party in my constituency, the secretary of one of the largest Cumainn in County Kilkenny.  If the Minister for Education wants his name and address I shall give them to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that when Fianna Fáil would take over control we would have absolute freedom and, later, we were told that everything they were doing was a stepping stone towards the Republic.  The Oath has been abolished and now the Seanad is to be abolished.  Everything that Cumann na nGaedheal did when they <Col N="958" /> were in power is to be abolished, everything except the starvation wage of 24/- a week.  The only defence the Minister for Education has in relation to the wage of 24/- is that it was there under the preceding Administration and that Labour never objected to it.  Apparently we are not going to be given an indication that at an early date the Fianna Fáil Government will abolish that starvation wage and set up a standard in accordance with the encyclical of Pope Leo XIII.</P>
    <P>This evening the Minister for Finance referred to the nature of the work.  In County Kilkenny it was actual county council work, not drainage work and not work of an agricultural nature. The actual work carried out in the area from which the secretary of the Fianna Fáil Cumann came to me was the erection of a concrete wall.  No tradesmen were to be employed; no carpenters to make the casing.  County council labourers who usually are engaged on the steam-rolling of the roads were to fill up their slack time completing this wall and they were to be paid at the rate of 24/-, 22/- and 20/- a week.  When I raised the matter in this House last March I was told an error had been made in the calculations in Kilkenny and that the mistake was now being made right and the men would be refunded whatever amounts they were short.  If I had not raised the question I am sure that county surveyors and employers generally, being incited by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government, would continue to lower the 24/- rate until it would reach 16/-, 12/- and finally 10/-, the rate which it takes to maintain a pauper in the Dublin Union.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will note the fact that the Minister for Education was greatly mistaken when he said that no substantial complaint had been made.  He can tell the Minister that the first complaint Deputy Pattison received was from a very important Fianna Fáil secretary in County Kilkenny.  I think it was Deputy Kelly who said he was a member of a Party that <Col N="959" /> always stood for Labour and that he had always stood by the workers.  I have never known of an instance on county councils or any public board, when it came to a question of increasing wages, where Cumann na nGaedheal and Fianna Fáil did not vote in the one Lobby for the smallest possible wage.  In every instance of that sort politics were forgotten.</P>
    <P>I have no friendship for the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and I declare emphatically that there is no ground for the insinuation that this motion was tabled for a political purpose. I dissociate myself completely from any such intention as that. People on the opposite side of the House know perfectly well that I was never a friend of that Party before I came into the House or since.  So far as my national record is concerned, I will not put it on the same level with the record of any man in the Fianna Fáil Party.

      <P>I really think that this Government must, in a matter of this sort, keep in mind the principles observed by such great schoolmasters of the past as Pearse and Connolly. I remember on one historic occasion 15 years ago hearing President de Valera saying in the Mansion House that labour deserves the best that this country can afford to pay.  I believe the President's views are the very same to-day.  It is my opinion that if this Party went against that fundamental principle, it would be wrong. If he maintains that the Executive Council and the Parliamentary Secretary went against that principle, that would be also wrong, but in the circumstances, and the new situation created during the previous ten years, and the ruin led up to by the mournful Minister for Industry and Commerce, McGilligan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Excuse me, Deputy McGilligan I should have said.  The position that we had to face was a new and an altered one.  I admit, and our Party must admit it, that we had no more loyal men than the frieze coated men who fought with us for Irish freedom.  They were true to us then and I believe they will remain true in the future.  Taking my own constituency&mdash;of course, it might be different from Dublin&mdash;I met men there and they said to me: &ldquo;Give us a scheme and we are prepared to work it, not alone for 24/- a week, but for £1 a week in order to take the Government over their difficulties in this historic fight.&rdquo;  We look upon this as not interfering with the standard wage; we look upon it as a real emergency, as a relief scheme, as a kind of dole, but in a different form. If Deputy Norton thinks that 24/- a week would fundamentally interfere with the standard of labour in this country, he would be right to oppose it.  We hold it would not.  It is my personal opinion that, considering the new order and the situation before him, the Parliamentary Secretary has done what he considers wisest and best for Ireland in this critical situation.  In these circumstances, I appeal to the House and to the Labour Party to view the position in that light.  When this historical fight has been successful I, for one, will uphold the old traditional notion that labour deserves the best that this country can afford to give it.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Government are in a bit of confusion about this motion.  They have insinuated that unworthy motives prompted it. One Deputy suggested it had been introduced in order to meet the emergency of the Dublin Municipal Elections.  If the Government had been fair to private members, this motion, and others on the Order Paper, could have been disposed of long ago and now forgotten by the people.  But if this motion coincides with the Municipal Elections, it is the <Col N="961" /> Government's fault and not the fault of the people who put this motion on the paper.  It was rather edifying to hear the Minister for Finance telling us that there was to be one rate of wages for one set of men shovelling stones at one end and another rate of wages for another set of men shovelling stones at the other end.  It was not due to a difference of work, it was due to a difference of name given to the work.  One was work on a major scheme, and the other work on a minor scheme.  He insinuated, although he did not say it, it would be better perhaps from a purely financial point of view that for relief it would be better to pay out money rather than seek any return in the shape of work for it.  I will not comment upon that.  But he added to that remark this, that it would be injurious to our people and would make them unemployable in the future.</P>
      <P>I submit that the greatest damage that could be done to the worker is being done under the minor relief schemes as outlined by the Minister for Finance.  That money is to be paid for a class of work and paid on the admission of the Minister for Finance to persons for pretending to work and is not really for work at all.  The greatest damage that can be done to the worker is to reduce his productive capacity, regardless of the rate of wages.  In the final reckoning the productivity of a nation is the aggregate productivity of the workers of that nation.  If the units of production, the workers, are reduced in the manner indicated by the Minister for Finance the total production of the country would be seriously impaired.  Certain Deputies opposite, amongst them the Parliamentary Secretary, may smile at that line of argument, but I am afraid production in this country is not a very strong point with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly was very eloquent in denouncing 24/- a week as a standard wage, yet he informed the House that the workers in Meath were unanimous in accepting 24/- a week.  Deputy Walsh said that a monument would be raised in Mayo to the Parliamentary Secretary if he could guarantee 24/- a week wages for the migratory <Col N="962" /> labourers for the four principal working months of the year.  But although Deputy Kelly and Deputy Walsh denounce 24/- a week as a standard still we have the declaration that in Mayo they would raise a monument to the man who paid it.  The Parliamentary Secretary is trying for that monument and will have a flag with 24/- a week on it hoisted over him.  If that happened I have a shrewd suspicion how long such a monument would last in Dublin if raised there, even if crowned by the imposing figure of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The wage paid has been explained as being correlated to the agricultural wage obtaining in the district.  While accepting that, how can the Government denounce that standard or run away from that standard when the policy is to reduce the agricultural rate of wages to that level.  Does the Government know that wage paying regulates the economic level at which wages are payable. That is the high-water mark of efficiency of Government which the Parliamentary Secretary applies. Another Government Deputy said, &ldquo;We will raise a monument if we get 24/-,&rdquo; which is another way of informing the House that they cannot get 24/-.  Another Deputy went back to the bawneen age and referred to the frieze coat brigade and how they always stood for Ireland.  Deputy Kelly said they did not stand for this standard.  What voice from the Government Benches is speaking the Government mind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what I was paying three years ago and what I am able to pay now.  Even Fianna Fáil as a Party, do not stand over this rate of wages as a standard rate of wages and merely pay it because it is given, as explained by the Minister for Finance, not for productive work, but to give relief to people who are destitute, yet, it is maintained by the Government that even that wage, paid for destitution rather than for production, is correlated and equal to the agricultural rate of wages paid in the area.  If it is not, will any Fianna Fáil Deputy inform the House that he is paying a higher wage than the wage applauded by Deputy Hugo Flinn of 24/- per week?  They either stand for that standard or they do not.  If that standard is regulated by the wage paid in that area, described in a flippant manner, as if off a platform, as an uneconomic wage by members of the Government Party, then who is responsible for lowering the conditions so that the only wage payable in the largest industry in the country is an uneconomic wage according to the definition of the Government Party?  The Government pay for relief works on the basis of that uneconomic wage.  There is no way that the Government can shuffle out of it.  They have paid this lower rate of wage.  They have lowered the wage standard.  If the Deputy from Mayo were to be taken seriously, and if employers in the eastern counties were to act on the gesture he has made, we could with profit sack the men to whom we are paying up to £2 per week on our farms and employ those migratory labourers so graciously offered to us by Deputy Walsh at 24/-, and we would probably get the monument raised to us instead of having it raised to Deputy Norton.  Like Deputy Mulcahy, I did not intend intervening in this debate.</P>

We know the people who gave us the promise that everybody would be working or maintained, not at 24/- per week, but at a standard wage for working and a standard level of maintenance if they are not working.  We know who gave those promises and they are not forgotten. If the reminders on the dead walls of Dublin show placards with &ldquo;24/- a week new standard,&rdquo; it will bring up some ghosts of the past and not to this side of the House, but to the Government side of the House. Wives, who were promised that Fianna Fáil would do a certain thing, that their husbands would get work, will now have their eyes open.  My only regret in this matter&mdash;and it is perhaps a major reason as we are talking of majors and minors why I intervened in the debate at all&mdash;is that I cannot vote for this motion as I have no means of recording my vote, having been paired with a Deputy opposite.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance in a rather moderate but clearly misleading speech, answered the very strong case put up by Deputy Norton by saying that half a loaf was better than no bread.  That was not the line taken by some other distinguished Deputies who belong to the same Party as the Minister.  I am sure it will be of interest to the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party, who will have more time to read these debates when the debate has concluded and when they receive the reports, to see the conflict that is between the front and the back benches of the Fianna Fáil Party on the issue now before the House.  This Party is accused of putting down a motion for Party propaganda purposes, and the Minister for Finance, as well as the Minister for Education, when speaking in this House, stated that the rates to which we now take exception were paid when the Cumann na nGaedheal Party was in office and that no protest was made by the Labour Party.  That is entirely incorrect, and it is incorrect to the knowledge of the Fianna Fáil Party, even before they came into office and since they came into office.  That Party knows perfectly well that at no time since 1922 did the members of the Labour Party vote for the election of the Cosgrave or Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  We declined to do so because we were entirely in conflict with their political, social and economic policy, as far as we understood the Cumann na nGaedheal Party policy.  For that and other reasons we never supported them in any policy or issue which came before this House, apart from the fact that we never cast our votes in favour of their being put into office as a Government.  The Minister for Education, in Carlow, and the Minister for Finance, here to-day, repeated in parrot-like fashion that this wage was paid during the time when the Labour Party held the balance of power&mdash;during the time when Fianna Fáil was kept in office by our votes.  That again is incorrect.  The first time that this wage was ever paid for work done on minor relief work or schemes was following the passage of the Vote in this House on 30th November last.  It was as a <Col N="967" /> result of this House having passed a Vote of that £350,000 for minor relief schemes as such, and when they were first initiated by this Government. These minor relief schemes, as is well known to every Deputy, and the money allocated for them, were for the first time administered by the county surveyors on behalf of the Board of Works.  That is not denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance continues in his entirely misleading remarks here this evening to state that the same kind of works were carried out in Leix-Offaly, Carlow, Kildare and in other Leinster counties during the period when the Cumann na nGaedheal Party Government were in office and that no member of this Party took exception to the rate of wages paid for that work.  But if the Minister for Finance had, as he should have done, made a study of the nature of the work carried out by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party on what are called Land Commission relief works in Leix-Offaly, Carlow, Kildare, Westmeath and other places, he would find that the work had no relation whatever to the kind of work carried out on minor relief schemes. The method of selecting the individuals who carried out that work bore no comparison to the conditions which came into operation from 30th November last when the Vote for £350,000 was passed by this House.  The Land Commission relief work carried out in Leix-Offaly was carried out and the moneys provided by the improvement Vote of the Land Commission, which, as every Deputy who knows the facts knows, is set aside for the purpose of making roads and ditches on the estates acquired by the Land Commission under the 1923 Act.  The men selected for the carrying out of these works are selected by the Land Commission inspector, who goes to the district, and, as is well known also to the Deputies, preference for that work has been given by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and is still being given, as was admitted by the Minister for Defence here yesterday, to the farmers and the sons of farmers who get portions of <Col N="968" /> the land on the estates divided.  None of these men were ever taken for this class of work through the Labour Exchanges.  I raised a question here yesterday affecting this class of work on the Hackett Estate, Ballycumber, in Offaly.  The Minister for Defence, replying for the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, admitted that preference was given at that work to people who had got holdings up to 30 acres of land on some of the estates, while able-bodied unemployed men not entitled to unemployment insurance benefit or home assistance were ruled out in favour of farmers and the sons of farmers who are not without a bit to eat at any rate.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of comparison made by the Minister for Finance in his misleading speech.  That is the kind of argument used by him for the purpose of drawing a red herring across the issue raised by this motion. When the Labour Party in 1932 cast its votes for the election of the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;without the Labour votes they could not be elected&mdash;they had an assurance repeatedly given by President de Valera in the country and repeated by the Party and given in this House since that the Fianna Fáil Party stood for the democratic programme adopted by Dáil Eireann in 1919.  The statement and pledges publicly made by the Ministers and by leading members of the Party was that the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party on trade union issues was much more progressive than the outlook and attitude of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party was on these issues.  It was for this and for other reasons that we cast our votes in 1932 for the election of the first Fianna Fáil Government.  It is surprising to me to find that when Fianna Fáil is up against this they point to the Labour Party and say, &ldquo;you tolerated this when the Cumann na nGaedheal Party was in power and in that way justified their attitude in paying the same rate of wages for carrying out the same class of work.&rdquo; Now Deputy Kelly is not here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, I would have ventured, <Col N="969" /> if I were referring to him to call the other famous man, Deputy Tom Kelly.  But I am now referring to Deputy Kelly from Meath.  The Deputy quoted an extract from a speech made by Deputy Everett last March.  I would ask the Deputy to go back beyond that date to another date when the issue now raised was discussed.  I would refer him to the speech made by Deputy Everett on 30th November last.  He will read there in column 572 the remarks of Deputy Everett pertaining to the debate at that time on the same issue.  Deputy Everett, protesting against the payment of this 24/- wages which he then for the first time learned about, concluded by saying: &ldquo;I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make it a condition that the county surveyors pay whatever is the county council rate for road work in that area.  If that is not done, you will have endless friction and the scheme of improving the bye-roads will not be the success it should be.&rdquo;  That statement was made by Deputy Everett with the knowledge he had of a strong complaint with regard to this new rate paid for the first time in connection with the carrying out of this work in Wicklow.  I suppose the Parliamentary Secretary for the Department of Finance when he stands up&mdash;and I am glad to see that he is able to stand up here again&mdash;will repeat the misleading analogy that was used by the Minister for Finance.  I would say the Parliamentary Secretary is the parrot of the Party.  It has been stated here that we have not made any proper protest against these rates of wages for those employed on minor relief schemes.  Immediately the members of this Party discovered this circular for the first time at the end of November last&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we took the usual Party steps to bring the matter under the notice of those responsible.  I want to say&mdash;and I am sure every member of this Party can say with me, and can say it with the same truth&mdash;that this circular was discovered by the members of this Party for the first <Col N="970" /> time when it was issued by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to county surveyors and foremen and gangers employed by him on minor relief works after the Vote was passed in November last.  The part of this circular to which we took strongest exception is Section 22, apart from the fact that we object to the employment of these men on such works without having their insurance cards stamped.  Section 22 says:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The rates of wages in the case of relief works should, where possible, be fixed on a lower scale ...</P>
      <P>these are the words to which any member of the Fianna Fáil Party should object&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... than that normally paid to agricultural labourers in the district.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make a confession in his own interests?  Did the Parliamentary Secretary ever read that circular before it was sent out with his authority last December?  Is it because his predecessors stood for that that it went out from him and for the carrying out of work of a different character by Cumann na nGaedheal at the rates quoted by the Minister for Finance here this evening?  I do not believe the Parliamentary Secretary ever saw the circular, and if he wants to get rid of his responsibilities in an easy way, I suggest that the best way to do it would be to confess that he never saw the circular.  If he did see it the crime is much more serious because of the fact that he, with other Fianna Fáil Deputies, protested so much against the rate of wage of 32/- a week on the Shannon works and he should certainly never have accepted responsibility for sending out a circular worded in the fashion in which Section 22 is worded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of this Party, after they had discovered the contents of that circular, held a Party meeting and, as a result, a deputation of four of our members was selected by a meeting of the Joint Executives of the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party for the purpose of interviewing the Minister for Finance.  Failing a satisfactory answer from him, we were <Col N="971" /> instructed to endeavour to see President de Valera on the issue involved. After that decision several attempts were made to make appointments with the Minister.  Owing to other and more important engagements, the Minister, on a couple of occassions, postponed meetings already fixed for that purpose, but finally, after the Dáil had been dissolved, on Friday, the 6th January, accompanied by two other colleagues, we had an interview with the Minister for Finance on the issue now raised in this motion.  I am won-sorry the Minister for Finance is not here in the House now.  I am wondering why he left the House without having said anything about the nature of the interview, which took place on the 6th January last on the issue raised in the motion.  We saw the Minister in his office at 3.30 p.m. on that date. We put the issue to him which we had been instructed to put before him for consideration.  He asked us what we had to say as to the best ways and means of finding a way out of this dispute.  We told him, acting on the advice of the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party, that the only and the proper way out of a dispute of this kind was to pay the same rate of wages on works of this kind as was paid by the local authority for doing the same class of work.  If the Minister for Finance is in the precincts of the House send for him and ask him did he turn down that proposal.  He did not. He said the proposal would receive his careful and sympathetic consideration; that he thought it his duty to get into telephonic communication with his Parliamentary Secretary, who had some responsibility in the matter, and that he would communicate with us at an early date as to the result.  We never heard another word until after the election was over and, consequently, Deputy Norton put down a question for answer in this House as soon as the House met after the elections, seeing that the Minister had not the courtesy to reply to us.  The very fact that the Minister for Finance did not turn down the suggestions which we made makes me feel at any rate that I am right in suggesting to the House and to the Parliamentary Secretary that the <Col N="972" /> Minister was sympathetic and in favour of what we suggested as a way out of the dispute.  If he was not sympathetic and in favour of the proposal he should have turned it down definitely there and then.</P>

      <P>At any rate, I challenge him as to whether or not the version of that interview which I am now giving is accurate.  I regret that I am making that statement in the absence of the Minister, but that is not my fault, because he was aware that this issue was going to be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most of the minor relief works carried out in my area the men selected for employment on them were men who were previously employed on county council work in the area, and they were, as far as I know, selected in all cases through the local labour exchanges. If any man had been offered work on the former works and refused it he would have been refused payment of unemployment insurance benefit.  At any rate, they were selected in that way, and the class of work that were doing, as far as I know, was the very same class of work that had been done by the county council in these areas.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary suggest that the members of this Party could accept a policy which enabled work of the same kind to be done in the same place and under the same supervisor at two different rates of pay?  The county surveyor was the person responsible for supervising all the minor relief works carried out in my area.  I understand&mdash;I am subject to correction in this&mdash;that for that work they received 4 per cent. on the amount expended in addition to the fairly large salaries these gentlemen are already in receipt of.  I know of cases, and reported them&mdash;there was one outside Mountrath&mdash;where two sets of men were engaged, in the same quarry in getting out material, one set working for the county council at a rate of 30/- a week and another set, under the same supervisor, being paid 24/- a week for getting out materials for the making of a bog road.  Does anybody suggest that this Party could <Col N="973" /> stand for the continuance of two different rates of wages for doing the same class of work in the same place, under the supervision of the same man?  That is the issue raised in this resolution, and the Parliamentary Secretary knows it better than any other member of the Government, because it has been pointed out to him on several occassions.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, speaking with a certain amount of irritation &mdash;that is if one can understand the meaning of plain English&mdash;in Carlow last Sunday week, attempted to bolster up this case, and to stick a knife into the backs of certain members of the Labour Party, myself included, by suggesting that for instance: &ldquo;Mr. Flinn pointed out in the Dáil that he had been in constant touch with Mr. Davin on this question.&rdquo; As a matter of fact I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to get the quotation from the official record, &ldquo;and that Mr. Davin and his colleagues were satisfied with the efforts the Government Party made to meet them where special difficulties arose.&rdquo;  I have given the House a very fair and impartial account of the interview which took place between myself and two other colleagues and the Minister for Finance, and we have not yet received the communication from the Minister which he promised to give us on Friday, 6th January last.</P>
    <P>I have only had the pleasure of two conversations with Deputy Flinn in connection with the administration of minor relief works.  Those had nothing whatever to do with the rate of wages paid on those works, but concerned, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, the amount of money that might be made available at a particular time for the carrying out of schemes in Leix-Offaly.  I happen to be, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, in the fortunate position of being able to put my hands on two witnesses who would, I am sure, give their version of what transpired at the two interviews concerned.  I did see the pleasant face of the Parliamentary Secretary on a couple of occasions in the Lobby, when he went to a good <Col N="974" /> deal of trouble to explain the ups and downs of the unemployment situation in the country, and other aspects of the problem of unemployment, of which he has made a particular study. I have not been in constant touch with Deputy Flinn.  He is a very pleasant gentleman to meet in private, but in the House he is a different Deputy altogether.  I could give a description of Deputy Flinn in this House which you, sir, I am sure, would not allow me to get away with, and I do not think that at any rate I would serve any useful purpose by giving that description.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will, I am sure, honour us by intervening in the debate later on, when perhaps he could, if he so desires, give us the quotation which he has in mind.  The men employed on the minor relief works are paid a rate of wages which is supposed to have some relation to the rate paid to agricultural labourers in the district.  I have in mind the case of minor relief work which was carried out a very short distance outside the town of Portlaoghise. Does the Parliamentary Secretary in that case justify the selection through the local labour exchange of men for that work at a rate of 24/- a week, when it was well known that the local rate in that case is 32/- a week?  I asked a question the other day as to the rates of wages paid to foremen and gangers on minor relief works.  The Minister for Finance stated that the rate of wages paid to gangers and foremen employed on minor relief works was between 12/- and 15/- per day.  Mark you, that particular rate was supposed to have some bearing upon the efficiency and competency, if you please, of the gangers and foremen concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is mistaken.  I think he will find that <Col N="975" /> those were men inspecting relief schemes; that they were supervising gangers&mdash;a sort of semi-inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked for the rate of wages paid to foremen and gangers. What the Parliamentary Secretary may have had in mind I am not quite sure, but if the payment of foremen and gangers on minor relief schemes should have some relation to the efficiency and competency of the individual, surely a different principle should not be applied to the men working under them.  I have always taken the line, inside the Party and outside the Party, that the rate of wages fixed in this case, supposed to be fixed by the Parliamentary Secretary, is an issue over which the Cabinet as a body should either stand and defend or remove without delay the obnoxious portion of this circular issued in the name of the Parliamentary Secretary. The Parliamentary Secretary has not yet been given Cabinet responsibility. This is a Cabinet responsibility, and as such should be defended by members of the Cabinet and not by anybody who has not Cabinet responsibility.  I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House, and in that way prevent other Deputies from having their say during the short time at our disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, in conclusion, that the Government of every country is supposed to be, or should be, regarded as the model employer of that country or state.  It is a wrong headline for the Government to give to fix a rate of wages which is at the present time below the rate paid by the local authorities at the expense of the ratepayers to other people for doing similar work.  I want to give a friendly warning to the Government&mdash;it is hardly necessary for me to do so&mdash;that the continuance of the payment of this rate of wages for works of the kind that have been carried out in the past under the supervision of the county surveyor will undoubtedly result, in the very near future, in some cases, in the local authorities reducing their rates of wages for the same class of work to the same low level.  I have met many <Col N="976" /> local councillors of the Ratepayers' Association in particular, and of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party as well, and Deputy T. Kelly will be surprised to hear that there are supporters in my area on the Fianna Fáil side, who take up the line that if the Government are allowed to continue to pay this rate of 24/- a week for doing a certain class of work analogous to the work done by the employees of the local authorities, then there is no good reason why, as was pointed out to me recently, the pauperised ratepayers of the same counties should pay from five to ten shillings more for doing the same class of work.  Realising, as I am sure the Ministry do, that the Government should set itself out as a model employer, I hope they will reconsider the whole issue involved in the dispute which arises in connection with the issue of this circular, and in connection with the matter contained in the motion moved by Deputy Norton.  We are naturally not raising this issue for Party purposes.  When that deputation was appointed we had not in mind that the Dáil was going to be dissolved on the first Monday in January.  We were appointed as a deputation to go in private to the Minister for Finance and argue the whole issue on its merits. If the Minister for Finance had taken our view, as we had reason to believe he did, by the attitude he adopted, there would be no necessity for us to go out in public subsequently and here in this House to-day to raise the matter.  The proof that we have not made this a Party issue is the fact that we did not raise it during the General Election.  I admit that the reason I did not raise it in my area during the General Election was that I had some faith in the word of the Minister for Finance.  I am sorry to say that the lesson I have learned in the school of experience leads me to believe that the Minister's word is not to-day worth what I thought it was worth on 6th January last on the issue now raised in this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have liked a little more elucidation of this problem from the Government Front Bench than we have had already, before I intervened, but, as the hour <Col N="977" /> is getting late, I fear I might not get the opportunity of intervening at all unless I intervene now.  So far as I can make out, from the host of rather conflicting assertions that have been made to-night, the real cause of all this trouble is that the Government did make a blunder to the extent of applying money for minor relief schemes in localities for which such schemes were unsuitable.  If they did make that blunder it is, no doubt, regrettable, and one can understand perfectly well that it is unsatisfactory and intolerable to have men working in the same quarry, some getting 30/- a week and others getting 24/- a week for precisely the same work.  But a blunder of that nature certainly does not call for all the heated condemnation and propaganda that we have been hearing from the Labour Benches for several months.  It is a blunder that is capable of being corrected and I should like to hear whether, in fact, it is being corrected, or has already been corrected, by the Government.</P>
      <P>It is a source of some satisfaction to me that the alleged crimes, committed by the Government, which we have been discussing to-night were committed in the happy period before the General Election.  Deputies of the Labour Party are fond, in their speeches throughout the country, of drawing a contrast between the conditions that obtained before the General Election and the conditions which have obtained since.  They have indicated in their speeches that in these happy days they used to have constant conferences and friendly chats with the Government about matters of policy, and that since the General Election owing, apparently, to, in their view, some sinister influence exercised by the Centre Party, these chats have become less frequent or non-existent. At any rate, these particular crimes were committed when the chats were in full blast and when the Government were getting the full advantage of all the moral uplift that might be derived from these amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the members of the Centre Party are concerned, we have nothing to do with producing the grievances that were complained of <Col N="978" /> to-night.  As a matter of fact, I do not know that we can claim to have anything to do with producing any aspect of Government policy.  I think in connection with any particular matters where we have attempted to exercise pressure on the Government we have been as uniformly unsuccessful as the Labour Party have been successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>We supported it after the event and we are not ashamed of the attitude we took up.  We would do the same again.  It is not the absence of these delightful parlour talks that has caused the crimes that the Labour Party are complaining of to-night.</P>
      <P>I said in the debate on the adjournment before the Easter recess that this Party stood for high agricultural wages; that we regarded the present agricultural wages as absolutely deplorable and, in any attitude we may take on this motion, either in speaking or voting, it is not for a moment to be imagined that we regard 24/-, 21/-, 20/- or 18/- a week&mdash; that we know are actually the agricultural wages paid, even by the best employers&mdash;as satisfactory, because we do not.  If the passing of any motions of this sort in the House would enable agricultural wages to be raised, we would eagerly support such motions. Unfortunately, motions cannot have that effect.  The cause of low wages is the economic condition of the country, and for that economic condition the Labour Party must bear their full share of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard this motion as a bit of humbug. I regard still more the speech of Deputy Norton in favour of the motion as humbug.  Deputy Davin did make some real defence of the motion. His speech was addressed to the terms of the motion; Deputy Norton's was not.  The terms of the motion, however, <Col N="979" /> are in themselves suggestive of humbug, because they are cloudy to the point of being ungrammatical.  I think there is a great deal of truth in the contention of the Minister for Finance that the motion was purposely framed with the object of enlisting the support, if possible, of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party as a whole and, if not, of the less responsible elements in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  Secondly, I regard the motion as a humbug because of the record of the Labour Party.  They cannot get away from that.  The fact that they did not give active support to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, when they were in office, does not absolve them from not having taken the steps that, according to what they now say, they ought to have taken by way of protest against these iniquities. I have not heard anything approaching a decent defence of their attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party took up a very definite attitude all along in regard to the rates paid for minor relief works.  Of course the Deputy was not here and, therefore, he does not know all about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making a bold assertion, because he hopes he will not be contradicted owing to the fact that I did not happen to be here.  These assertions, however, cannot be sustained.  These low wages go back a considerable period, and the Labour Party had every opportunity of making a strong protest against them if they wanted to do so.  Finally, this motion is a humbug, because the people who brought it in have done nothing during the last 18 months to improve the economic conditions of the country.  They had opportunities offered them.  They talk a lot about supposed intrigues that do not really exist, between the Centre Party and other Parties.  One of the first things I did when I came in here was to try to get the co-operation of the Labour Party in turning the Government from courses which were bound to lead to the economic conditions to which, in fact, they have led.  I failed to secure that co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> Later on the time came in this House when the question of the financial revision with England was raised, and I urged that the thing should be dealt with on a non-Party basis, that we should have the co-operation of all Parties.  I suggested that the one fatal course to pursue was to treat the Cosgrave Agreements as invalid and fraudulent. There was then an opportunity given to the Labour Party to help, but they failed to avail themselves of it.  For the agricultural wages and the other things they are complaining of to-night, the Labour Party are every bit as responsible as the Government.</P>

It is a motion apparently drafted by an amateur lawyer.  The Labour Party were offered by me, in no spirit of troversy whatever, but in the spirit of a servant of this House carrying out his instructions and undertaking the responsibility given to him by the House in connection with relief works, a discussion upon relief works, upon wages, upon conditions and upon everything surrounding them&mdash;a discussion of a perfectly free character. I said that everything was an open question, and that anyone who could show us a better method of improving distribution would be gladly welcomed. No one could show us that a more logical basis for regulating wages on relief work could be found.  The matter was offered for discussion; we were prepared to go on with that discussion as well, on the Vote for the Board of Works.  I was prepared to go into it in absolute forgetfulness of the fact that I have been called by a member of the Labour Party in this House &ldquo;a bloody foreigner,&rdquo;&ldquo;a dirty liar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;an ingrained wage cutter.&rdquo;</P>

I told the House that anybody who knew anything that was wrong in this relief scheme, or had any concern in the Government should not keep his tongue quite.

      <P>No; if you had, the motion would be drafted properly, instead of being drawn as it is, by an amateur.  All the Labour Party have succeeded in doing, up to the present, in connection with this matter, is drafting a purely academic motion. Deputies could vote on this motion quite independently, whether wages were 5/- or 55/- per week.  The sole issue raised in this motion is that the Department of the Board of Works, and not any other department, but this one particular Department, which had charge of the relief works of a particular kind, offered less wages than those paid on works estimated to be of a <Col N="982" /> similar kind.  This motion has nothing to do with the rate of wages.  If the wages had been 88/- a week, a person would have to take exactly the same decision on this motion as if they were 15/-.  That is the question which they have tied themselves down to out of the whole range of controversy on unemployment, where they had everything to discuss; all they have chosen to discuss is the purely academic question as to whether a particular department was entitled to pay a lower rate of wages on relief work than was paid in connection with commercial and economic schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only proposition. It does not matter what the wages are, the whole question is whether the State or this particular Department, have a right to pay less upon relief works than on other classes of works.  I have just received an intimation from a friend of mine to say that I must not get excited and recommending me to take it easy.  Very well. It was even raised that had it been the county surveyor who was employing the men in a quarry it would not have been so bad.  If this Department had selected separate people to do this kind of work apparently the complaint would disappear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is the answer.  The Board of Works took over from the Land Commission a specific type of fund, for the relief of a special class of people, to be put on a special class of work, under conditions which had been previously well ascertained and were well known.  They have not, in fact, gone outside that category.  They put these people to do precisely the same class of work as they had been doing for the past ten years and, Rip van Winkle, Deputy Davin, has only now wakened up, after ten years, to the fact that these things are carried out under precisely the same conditions. Here is a Labour leader who admits that for ten years these things have been going on without his knowing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit.  For ten years these Labour leaders who have been in contact with labour conditions, coming here to plead for unemployment show how much they know.  It shows how badly informed they were.  They never found out in the whole ten years how this labour was paid for.  Then Rip Van Winkle, Deputy Pattison, comes along.  I wrote to him a few minutes ago asking him if he would give me a copy of the speech he delivered somewhere in his own constituency, and which was answered later by the Minister for Education.  My reason for asking him for that was that I read a report of that speech in the &ldquo;Cork Examiner.&rdquo;  I am not going to accuse anybody of anything on the basis of what appeared in the &ldquo;Cork Examiner.&rdquo;  But that speech, as given in the &ldquo;Cork Examiner&rdquo; was the most disgraceful speech, from the point of view of the Labour Party, that I ever read.</P>
      <P>I want that speech read to the House with the authority of Deputy Pattison.  I advise Deputy Pattison to read the report of that speech in the &ldquo;Cork Examiner,&rdquo; and if that report is not true, then I advise him to take an action for slander against the &ldquo;Cork Examiner.&rdquo;  The statement is there made that the Labour Party had been up for sale before the last general election.  That is the meaning of it.  According to Deputy Pattison the Labour Party, before the last election, were in precisely the same position that the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; said Deputy Thrift and Deputy Good and the Independent Party were, when they said that the Independent Party and the Independent members had kept the Cosgrave Government in power and that every man had his price.  That is the meaning of the speech delivered by Deputy Pattison.</P>

      <P>What is the price of the Labour Party according to Deputy <Col N="984" /> Pattison?  It was going up and they tell us what they discovered after the last election; they only found it out then.  These minor relief works were going on during the whole period of ten years and were going on under the Land Commission.  The sum of £240,000 was collected in a very ingenious way for the purpose of relief schemes by the previous Government. They had not time to spend it at all and some of it was left over and that money, at these rates, was being paid with the knowledge or in the culpable and privative ignorance of the Labour Party throughout the whole time and not for ten months.  Minor relief schemes did not start with the Vote in November.  How on earth do you think we could get machinery of that kind going if we waited until November to do it?  There was expenditure of all kinds going on taken out of the other Vote.  There were 1,250 separate minor relief schemes run in this country in the last year.  We have had a very careful examination made, and of those there are 11 border-line cases which might possibly be said, upon the strictest examination, to have gone outside the ambit of the previous works done by the Land Commission.  If that is all that is complained of I have no objection whatever.  These are all under review. These are not cases which, on their individual merits, you would turn down, but are cases which are merely made doubtful because, unlike any of the other 1,250 works, these were just works upon which the county councils on previous occasions did think they were entitled to spend some money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specific difference between the works which we are carrying out under the minor relief schemes and the others is that they are works which will not be carried out by the county councils.  1,250 separate works; 12,680 men employed at one time; somewhere between 25,000 and 30,000 men altogether given, not wages, not employment, but just given temporary relief in their necessities.  I am not apologising for the minor relief works &mdash;not a bit of it; I am glorifying in them.  I am proud to have been the instrument of this House in bringing <Col N="985" /> into 12,680 desolate homes, in one particular week, the kindness, the consideration and the charity even&mdash;an ugly word, is it not?&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot said that he was in favour of a higher wage for the agricultural labourers, and so am I.  I would remind Deputies that on five separate occasions I have called the attention of this House to the deplorable and shameful fact, that the primary producers of this country, the small farmer and the farmer's labourer, are the worst paid people in the whole country.  Do not forget that.  How many of them are there?  Farmers, and relatives assisting in agriculture, 533,026; others engaged in agriculture, 139,104; a total of 672,129 engaged in agriculture, against 194,000 of all other producers in the country.  I am glad to call the attention of everybody in the country to this: that the permanent economic condition of this country is represented by the fact that the basic producers of the country 672,000 of them, against 190,000 of all other producers, are living, and have been living upon the standard of comfort which is represented by the sort of agricultural wages which have been made the standard of minor relief schemes.  It is not a temporary condition or a thing produced by our opponents in ten years; it is the remainder of a whole history of misuse of the economic possibilities of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> It is time that the workers in the towns knew what apparently they never heard of before.  I am glad to see the 24/- a week placards put up in the cities in order that the people who are not the basic producers, who are not the agricultural producers, who are not the agricultural labourers, who are not the men living on the five and ten acre farms of Mayo, who are not the men living in the bogs down in Clare and Kerry, will understand that the vast majority of their fellow countrymen to-day are living on a rate of wages which it would be an exaggeration to state is an average of 24/- a week.  It is time they recognised that. It is time that every man in the country, who is obtaining a larger amount of sustenance than that should realise that that is going on.  It is time that the people who talk of hair-shirt politics and economics should know that for 672,000 basic producers in this country the standard rate of wages is not higher than the basis of the minor relief schemes which are administered in this country at present.  The sooner they do recognise it, the sooner that lesson goes home, the sooner we will be getting down to brass tacks instead of stunts like this.</P>

      <P>As I have told the House before, I do not pretend to have imagined that we would create in one year a perfect machine for carrying this out.  There are going to be blunders.  I will say it again.  I deliberately hope that there will be mistakes in detail rather than that whole schemes should be held up and the insurance of overhead expenses put upon them to prevent detail mistakes.  If, for instance, there have been two men working at two ends of a quarry at different rates, it is very objectionable indeed, but it is better that a little mistake of that kind should be made, in ten cases, if you like, out of 1250, than that I should hold up the work. What has meant the trouble here is <Col N="988" /> that we have brought home to certain people who did not know that there were people in this country who were trying to live on 24/- a week the fact that there are such things.  If there had been no relief works in Leix, Deputy Davin would not have known anything about it.  It took him ten years to discover what was going on under his eyes.  The fact is that he did not know.  He did not know, for instance, that minor relief works were being carried out by the Land Commission in January, February, March, April, May, June, July and August.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were election works, then we are doing election works also because we did similar works&mdash;precisely the same works.  Let us take the question of Leix.  This query was sent to the surveyor in Leix:</P>
      <P>Amongst the minor relief works entrusted to your charge are there any which are not covered by the following category: (1) labour as engaged by way of manual labour on the work of cleaning, excavating and embanking rivers, streams and drains; (2) the reconditioning of bridges and accommodation works with the object of improving land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And the answer is &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and that is precisely the definition of the work which previously and very meritoriously was carried out by the Congested <Col N="989" /> Districts Board and the Land Commission as minor relief works.  Deputy Pattison says that the works carried out in his constituency were not of this kind.  I do not know how long it takes Rip Van Winkle to wake up. The work done in Kilkenny under the minor relief schemes was not county council work.  They could not do it, and the reason why I had to employ the county surveyor, not as a county surveyor but as my personal agent, if I may use the term, was because he would be doing work which he could not do as a county council surveyor.</P>

      <P>I might use that term. I am trying to get a phrase for it.  It was a sort of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde position.  As Dr. Jekyll, he carried out certain works for the county council but, as Dr. Jekyll, he could not do my work.  I had to create a Mr. Hyde of a much more urbane and genial disposition in order to carry out minor reliefs in a separate category.  The work done in Kilkenny under the minor relief schemes was not county council work and could not be undertaken by the county council.  If they had undertaken any of my work they would have had to maintain it and they could not do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy mind waiting?  It was constructed with the voluntary co-operation of neighbouring farmers immediately affected.  This voluntary co-operation was a condition of the grant being made available so that the money expended should relieve unemployment in the district to the greatest possible extent.  The embankment was intended to prevent <Col N="990" /> the continued flooding of farm holdings in the locality.  The one particular case that Deputy Pattison picks out as a non-agricultural minor relief work is essentially a minor relief work carried out with the co-operation of the farmers because they thought they were getting not merely the benefit of the wages but the benefit of the work when it was done.  As I said, the thing was brought home to these Deputies and brought home to them unpleasantly, and now they are making it very difficult for me to bring it home as unpleasantly to them again.  Minor relief works were previously done in Leix.  In seven years, £1,233 worth of work was done.  Excluding the Turram bog road, in one year, Fianna Fáil did £3,147 worth.  No wonder Deputy Davin noticed it.  In Wicklow, in seven years, the Land Commission did £236 worth of work.</P>

I have had complaints about the wrong people being employed, complaints that the work did not last long enough and was not carried out in the right places but, apart from professional labour, I have had no complaints about wages.  I believe that altogether there were three political Cumainn that passed a resolution on this matter and they were all in towns.

      <P>If Deputy Rip Van Winkle thinks that I can keep in my mind the date of every letter I received from him and the date of my reply, he is dreaming.  Deputy Rip Van Winkle had better wake up.  I want to make this position perfectly clear to the House.  There may be men in this House foolish enough to think that they can get away with it here by saying that they do not know what the wage conditions for minor relief schemes are.  They may be foolish enough to think that they can get away with the proposal that the people in the country do not know what was being paid to nearly 10,000 of those men who were actually employed during the general election, but any one of them will not be able to get away with the suggestion in the future that they do not know what is going to happen in the future.  The sum of £100,000 has been segregated for bog roads and accommodation roads, and, roughly speaking, for what is going to come under minor relief schemes in the future.  They know the conditions under which they were administered.  Broadly speaking, there is going to be no change.  There may be an incidental change here and there. I mean there may be a levelling up or a levelling down, but, broadly speaking, the system is going to remain the same.  We are going to distribute that work as widely as we can among the people who desire to be relieved upon the basis of agricultural wages. Any Deputy who comes and asks for a minor relief scheme in the future will know precisely what he is getting, will take full responsibility for what he asks for, and for what he brings back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as to one particular point.  It is a point which is worthy of consideration, and perhaps adds a subconscious strength to this particular attack&mdash;the particular phrase in that particularly secret resolution which kept its secret for ten years from the Department. That was issued principally because the Land Commission, in doing a great deal of estate work, did find that in giving a man not merely payment for work on his own holding, but wages <Col N="993" /> on the result of his work, they were acting very liberally.  To the extent to which these works which are carried out under minor relief schemes in the future are of that precise character, in which the direct benefit of the work inures to the man obtaining the wages, that principle is still sound.  But to the extent to which these works get to the border-line of being done by people who in the ordinary case are ordinary wage-earners, then that proposition does not seem to me to be justifiable.</P>
    <P>I was asked at one particular critical moment if I would withdraw that resolution.  I said no.  The reason I would not withdraw it was because it was a very easy thing to do so.  The scheme had been in operation and was completed, and withdrawing it or leaving it as it was would not affect the issue in the slightest degree.  But I propose to look into that question very carefully.  I am not at all sure that that particular regulation is in the form in which it ought to remain.  One thing I am perfectly sure of is this: that that regulation will not continue to exist in the sense in which it will interfere with the people who are what you might call ordinary wage earners upon relief schemes.  I would very much like to suggest sometimes that the House should get a large wagonette and put into it the Deputies from the eastern and more prosperous counties and bring them over to see the almost unbelievable conditions&mdash; the 2,000 years behind the times conditions&mdash;which exist over a large portion of the country to-day.  If we did that there would be an understanding of this wage rate as used in the congested districts for relief works. For instance, we have taken a social cross section of the country from Dublin right through into Mayo.  In Mayo 75 per cent, of the total population are living on farms which are under ten acres, and I think somewhere about 94 per cent. of the total farming population in Mayo are living upon farms of under ten acres&mdash;ten acres of a kind that people who talk of land in Kilkenny, Limerick, Dublin&mdash; and even taking land in some of the prosperous portions of Clare&mdash;have very little conception of.  There is in <Col N="994" /> this country a poverty problem as well as an unemployment problem.</P>

      <P>This debate has been interesting in more ways than one. It was opened for the Government side by the Minister for Finance who was unable to read what is a very explicit motion.  The Minister who normally prides himself on what I am sure he believes to be his inborn keenness and ingenuity, was particularly stupid this evening, or at least pretended to be so.  He could not read the resolution. He did not know just what was meant, and affected to believe that the resolution as drafted was not put down for the purpose of getting a clear cut issue on this question, but for the purpose of, as he said later, securing the support of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  The Minister for Finance, if he wanted to, could easily have understood the terms of the resolution.  I suppose there is not much use at this stage in arguing with the Minister or of endeavouring to tell him what the resolution means. One has probably to rely for an explanation of the Minister's attitude on the old saying that there is none so blind as those who do not want to see.  The Minister said that this resolution was framed to secure the support of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  That statement, of course, is quite untrue, but it is quite on a par with many of the statements made by the Minister in the House for the past month.  We know that on two occasions at least he has not enhanced his reputation&mdash;either in relation to the President's speech in the Town Hall <Col N="995" /> in Rathmines or on the question of the availability of certain statistics which another Minister told him were not available, although the Minister for Finance contended they were.</P>
      <P>I do not care where the Cumann na nGaedheal Party stand on this question. Having regard to their attitude on the question of wages in general and having regard to their authorship of the circular in the first instance, they might very well be allied to the Minister on this occasion.  It would seem to me that there is a natural affinity between Cumann na nGaedheal and the Minister.  The one thing clear from this debate is that there is a spiritual affinity between the Minister for Finance and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party on the question of low wages.  I present the Minister for Finance with the Cumann na nGaedheal Party if he wants them.  I present him also with the Ranchers' Party, the Party which assisted him to deny compensation to part-time officials of the national health insurance societies.  I suppose Deputy MacDermot will lead his legionaries to vote for this atrociously low standard which is now to receive the hallmark of the Government which stands for a Christian State in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he gives the Labour Party credit for a consistency which was unusual.  The Minister was pretty unfortunate in selecting consistency as a virtue which would receive his approbation.  I should like to hear Deputy Breathnach on the Minister's consistency.  I should like to hear the teacher who said he was assured that the President's speech in Rathmines applied to teachers' salaries on the Minister's consistency. If these people are to be the judges of the Minister's consistency in their regard, I think the Minister's reputation for consistency will be badly tarnished by the time these people are finished with him.</P>

    <P>An effort was made by the Minister for Finance in his long carefully-typed speech to say that this work was work of such a nature that it was a matter of indifference whether they got any return for the money expended, that <Col N="996" /> the work was only instituted to improve the workers' moral tone. Everybody knows that that statement is incorrect.  The worker who is registered at a labour exchange can be sent to work on these schemes, and if he declines work on a scheme, his unemployment insurance benefit will be stopped.  He can be compelled to accept work at a lesser rate than he would receive if he were receiving unemployment insurance benefit.  To talk about its being almost optional to work on such schemes is just so much nonsense and the author of the nonsense knows that very well.  The Minister talks about the aphorism which has been established by the evolution of society everywhere, about half a loaf being better than no bread. That is a good election slogan, which can be added to the 24/- a week. Half a loaf for the worker&mdash;that is the mentality revealed in this debate.  It is one thing to give a man half a loaf instead of a whole loaf, but it is another thing, and this is what the Government are doing, to filch from the unfortunate people the whole loaf which they have well earned during their 55 hour week by cutting down their wages to 21/-.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly was very helpful to-night in everything but one thing. He said that in 1931 the wage on relief schemes in County Meath was 27/- per week, but in Meath to-day as Deputy Kelly admits, the men are receiving only 24/- per week.  Deputy Kelly has not explained to this House how it was that 27/- per week was paid in 1931 and that only 24/- per week is being paid to-day.  Deputy Kelly was quite frank about it, a fact which again compels me to pay another tribute to the back benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party for their conduct.  He did not like the wage of 24/- per week.  It was, however, the best wage he could get, but he would like to have got a better wage.  He admitted that he called a meeting of the people affected and they decided to take 24/- per week rather than send the money back. There is the horrible emergency in which Deputy Kelly accepted the 24/- per week.  He would take 24/- per week for the unemployed workers in <Col N="997" /> Meath sooner than resort to the horrible expedient of sending the money back.  Deputy Everett was quoted as saying that he would prefer work at 25/- per week rather than have a man receiving home assistance.  Everybody would prefer that a man should get 24/- per week rather than that he should be forced to live on 5/- a week home assistance, but the case for the 24/- per week is surely getting very thin when that kind of argument is put up to support it.  Deputy Kelly said he believed that the workers would stand for sacrifices.  The workers may not mind sharing in sacrifices, but it is always the workers who are called upon to make the sacrifice. The three gentlemen who were appointed to the Committee of Reference and who are to receive £800 from the Fianna Fáil Government are not to be asked to make any sacrifice at all.  £800 a year for the people on the Committee of Reference under the Hospitals' Sweeps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, sir, but if they had to live on the 21/- a week instead of the £800 provided for them by the Fianna Fáil Government they would then have some idea of what this wretched wage means to the worker and his family.  Deputy Flinn, with that arrogance, verbosity and brass-necked tactics that have so distinguished his conduct in this House, especially towards the Labour Party, talked about professional Labour politicians.  I do not know what Deputy Flinn meant, but in any case, I would much rather be a professional Labour politician, whatever that is, <Col N="998" /> than be a professional dividend hunter, such as Deputy Flinn.</P>

      <P>Deputy Walsh said that there were 12,000 migratory labourers in Mayo who would erect a monument to me if I could provide them with work at 24/- a week.  I would remind the Deputy that the Fianna Fáil Party promised that they would provide work for 80,000 people when they got into office.  One Minister went so far as to say that he was afraid they would not get the 80,000 people in the country, that they would have to send to America for them.  I suggest to Deputy Walsh that that monument should be reserved for the President when he provides work for these 12,000 migratory labourers.  I do not mind if that monument is erected to the President when he provides work for them, but I am very much afraid that as things are going, that monument will never be erected to him in our lifetime.  There is no time left at my disposal to continue the debate further. I will only say that no matter what the result of the division may be, every Deputy who votes against the motion is voting for a wage of 21/- or 24/-, a rate of wages which, notwithstanding the attempt to whitewash it, is disgracefully low.</P>
