      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been drawn to the hardship imposed on over 600 men in Dundalk by the decision of the Umpire on the 24th instant in not confirming the decision of the Court of Referees granting the application of these men for unemployment insurance benefit during the recent curtailment of work at the Great Northern Railway Works, Dundalk; and whether it is his intention to compensate these men in any way for the hardships imposed on them by such decision; and furthermore whether he is prepared to introduce immediately proposals for legislation similar to those introduced and passed by the Government of Great Britain in 1924 by which the interests of employees who do not participate in strikes are safeguarded in the event of trade disputes.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Umpire considered the cases of the applicants referred to in the Deputy's question and decided that they were disqualified for the receipt of unemployment insurance benefit by Section 8 (1) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.  The decision of the Umpire is final.  The Umpire is a Tribunal of competent jurisdiction, and the proposal that hardships arising for the litigants from the decision of such a Tribunal should be met by compensation is one which, apart from the fact that no power to pay such compensation exists, has never previously been made, as far as I am aware, and <Col N="546" /> could not be entertained.  It has not been decided to amend the law in the manner suggested in the final part of the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, may I ask the Minister will he point out to the House what difficulties, if any, there are in having legislation introduced to amend the Act similar to the legislation passed by the Government of Great Britain in 1924?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state what is the average quantity of fresh milk exported daily across the Derry border by Donegal farmers; and whether, in view of the fact that there is a duty of 10 per cent. on all milk exported to Northern Ireland, he will consider the granting of a bounty to exporters to assist them to meet the tax.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> Debate resumed on motion: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister explained last night what was the extent of the changes with regard to this Bill but, so far as I could hear him, he failed to give us any reason for the main change which is being brought about by this measure he introduces.  First of all, I should like to refer to some of the matters that are not the subject of any important change.  Recently, I saw, in relation to this Bill, an advertisement in a partisan newspaper that there were £1,000,000 being given for industry. For the sake of accuracy, it might have been added that it was the same old million, with very little exception, and, secondly, it might have been added that, whereas, previously, there had been a guarantee year by year as measures went through that, if the million pounds had been used for industrial purposes, there would be no hesitation in providing other sums, the so-called million that is being provided now is over a five-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a certain amount of play with the change which, apparently, he considered an important one, so far as the new Bill is concerned, that, for the future, individuals rather than corporations or rather than, as the old Act had it, bodies corporate or incorporate, can get loans or guarantees.  I do not know if he has been advised, as he said he was on that point, that any difficulty had arisen because my experience of the working of the previous Acts was that there was no difficulty whatever when a good individual came along with a good proposition, in having him associate himself with other people sufficiently to enable him to come within the four corners of the old Acts and to become a body corporate or incorporate in order to secure the facilities that were offered. There was, however, as the Minister pointed out, quite a good reason for having an association rather than an individual, when that matter could be <Col N="550" /> so easily arranged, the beneficiary under the Act and it was that you had a continuance and, secondly, that, as you could get two or three people to join rather than a single person, it did mean that you started off with, <i>prima facie</i>, a better case than if there was only a single individual and that you got, when that could be secured, a sharing of the liability and you got, where it was a matter to be looked to, an increase in the security that was being looked for under the previous Acts.</P>
    <P>An additional change to which the Minister drew attention was that there was to be a new type of advisory committee.  We are to have, for the future, a permanent chairman and there is to be a panel of business men.  It is quite possible, if there is going to be a rush of applications, or, rather, a rush of good applications, under the Acts, that it is better to have a larger number from whom to draw than the old limited committee, but even that benefit has its disadvantages because, undoubtedly, the people who served before got to know, after a certain amount of experience, what were the types of cases likely to be brought before them.  They had no difficulty in associating them in the different categories, which could be ruled easily enough, in certain numbers, so that even although, in the end, that may be an advantage it will not, if there is going to be a number of applications, be a completely good thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that another of the changes is that, for the future, no loan under £500 can be granted and his explanation was that, previously, it was difficult to explain to individuals why a loan of under £500 could not be granted. Certainly, he found it very difficult last night to explain to the House what was the benefit in having the upper limit of £500 put on the loan. It seems to me that there are cases where even a small loan might be an advisable thing, and, if the Minister feels that the explanation given to the House last night was sufficient to get the House to pass the upper limit of £500, it ought to <Col N="551" /> be sufficient for the individual applicants likely to come before him looking for loans.  I do not think there is much case to be made for the £500 limit and I think that very few serious cases will come before this new committee where the money sought is under the £500 mark.  There is a second matter and what it amounts to I do not know.  The Minister said that the old type of trust deed is going to be done away with, if, and when, a loan or grant is made, and that the new procedure is going to be something in the way of what he described as an ordinary debenture mortgage deed which he, apparently, thinks will be an easier matter to arrange.  I do not know that there was ever much difficulty in drawing up a trust deed.  At least, I cannot see what the difference is.  The difficulty about a trust deed was that it had to be associated with the particular circumstances of each case. The debenture mortgage deed will also have to suffer certain changes, according to circumstances, and there will be exactly the same delay on the part of the people drawing it up as there was about the old type of deed which was requested.</P>
    <P>These, however, are minor points. The big thing is that, for the future, the prohibition on the amount of money, where it was going to be used by way of working expenses, goes and, for the future, the Minister may either give money or guarantee money whether it has against it fixed assets or not or whether it is specially applied for as working capital or not.  He put one side the old condition with regard to the exclusion of working capital and he said that, of course, it was recognised that there was something to be said for having fixed assets against the money that was loaned. He pointed out&mdash;at least I thought that was the implication of his words&mdash;that in fact, in a case which had failed, the amount secured by the fixed assets in the end came to a very small fraction of the money guaranteed, and, remember, that used to be one of the points on which there used to be argument in the House&mdash;that there was too much <Col N="552" /> rigidity about fixed assets and that the moneys that were loaned against certain fixed assets were rather circumscribed, rather limited, in relation to the value put on the fixed assets.  Anybody knowing anything about the working of this Act must realise that you have to look on a fixed asset not as it appears at the moment when put before you in connection with a scheme that is being promulgated, but how it is likely to appear at the time when the concern is going to be wound up and sold more or less as scrap.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is another side to this and it is an aspect on which the Minister gave no explanation.  It is not so much the securing of fixed property against the money which the State puts out that was the value in excluding a loan or grant by way of working capital.  It was quite a different thing. It was the only hold which the State had on the people who came before them as applicants for their aid to ensure that they would put money of their own into the concern.  This disappears and, surely, it is at the base of all this industrial development work. In what circumstances can the Minister envisage an applicant coming before him with a good proposition about which he will not be able to get either his friends or his bank or some of the small investment corporations, either here or in England, to put up the cash?</P>
    <P>If he fails to get either that man himself or his friends, or the bank which knows him, or some of the small investment corporations to put up the money, what special money of that individual have you tied up with the working of the concern?  Quite a number of them depend on individual effort and individual attention. It comes down to what way the business is being run, and the success or failure it meets with depends on whether the man running it turns up at a certain hour in the morning to see how the business is going, whether he attends during certain hours of the day, and also on the energy he puts in and the attention he devotes to the ordinary working of the business.  Is he likely to do that better when he has a few thousand pounds of his own involved, or when <Col N="553" /> he has several thousand pounds belonging to his near relatives involved or when he is entirely dependent or nearly entirely dependent on State grants?  That is the value of the exclusion of the working capital.  It was not thought that we would get the State loss fully met by any fixed assets, but rather that if you threw the burden of meeting it on the individual when you got him to put up the working capital, you definitely tied up his interest with the successful working of the concern.  That, to a certain extent, disappears now.</P>
    <P>I should have expected that, in proof of the necessity of removing that exclusion, the Minister would have given us one or two cases, known to him, of unsuccessful applications where there was a fair prospect of success and where the only thing preventing the starting of the undertaking was that the individual could not get money of his own or money from his friends or relatives or from the bank.  I do not know of any case in the years from 1924 on, in which the previous Acts were working.  I knew of many cases where they made that representation to us, but when fully examined there was no case, in my memory at least, where a suitable case was made of being prevented from the successful management or the good operation of a concern because of the fact that the individual had unreasonably withheld from him banking facilities or ordinary financial facilities.  We are now taking this step of ear-marking a million pounds put up here under the control of the Minister, either guaranteed or given out, and for working expense possibly, under conditions in which the individual himself will not put up a shilling.  I have heard no case made here as to why that very big step should be taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated, with regard to the old Acts, that they were not availed of to the extent anticipated. That is hardly the correct way to describe it.  It was rather that there was not discovered to be present here the circumstances which necessitated this type of thing in an industrialised <Col N="554" /> country.  It was not so much here that there were not facilities, but rather that facilities ordinarily available to industrialists in other countries were withheld here.  It was simply that there was no great field for the investment of money in this country and, despite all the talk at the beginning, in which I joined myself, as to the neglect of the banks in not giving sufficient facilities to industry, I realised, as the years went on, that if there was any criticism of the banks to be made it was rather that, without sufficient examination into the circumstances, they had given money to individuals who were not likely to make a success of industry because of their lack of knowledge and experience, with the result that when certain industries collapsed the consequent repercussion was very bad.  It is my opinion that it would have been far better to have had a tighter rein on such enterprises and a better examination of the individuals who did get money from banks and who eventually lost not alone their own money but the banks' money, because they had not the capacity or experience to run a business successfully.</P>
    <P>The results of the old Acts, however, should be viewed from the angle of the question put by Deputy MacDermot last night.  There was less than a half a million of the old million pounds used.  There was only one loan which was fully repaid of all the loans made, and that was a very small loan of less than three thousand pounds to a co-operative society, which was repaid in less than two years. With that exception, however, there was not what would be called a first-class result from any of the applications granted under the previous Acts.  Now, as to what operated against success, it certainly cannot be said here that it was because the particular concerns involved were examined in any light-hearted way or because moneys were granted without pretty good examination of the likely results.</P>
    <P>There was certain criticism of the administration of the Acts in this House, but it was almost entirely upon the point that in an Act which <Col N="555" /> set out to preclude the granting of money for working capital it looked as if in certain cases money had been granted for that purpose; but there was never any complaint that money had been given out without proper examination.  It was rather the reverse.  The complaint was rather that the schemes were gone into too critically; that there was too much delay and that the people had to get too much in the way of financial backing either from their friends or from other sources before the State came in.  The complaint was that we required too much in the way of proof of the likely success of a concern before money was granted.  Despite this, it can be said quite definitely that if one leaves out the loans that were made to public utility concerns, there has not been a successful loan yet.  I think the standard of success is this&mdash;has there been any concern other than the two or three concerns who got moneys mainly for the development of harbours, which has been a success so far as repayment is concerned?  Has there been a case of a company keeping its commitments up to the schedule first arranged? I doubt if there is a single case.  Is there one of the concerns, other than the public utility concerns, where the moneys, for which they guaranteed to recoup the State in the way of repayment of capital advanced and interest on that capital, have been fully paid up to this date?  I think they are all in arrear.  Most of them, in the earlier years, came in and got a renewed scheme of repayments and some of them even fell behind on the new scheme.</P>
    <P>I also informed the House, in regard to these old cases, that in the main the concerns operating on Trade Loans (Guarantee) moneys have had not alone that facility but are also nearly all in tariffed industries.  Not only have the concerns involved been engaged in industries specially protected by tariffs but they have had the special facility of the granting of money at a low rate, and yet it is not possible to deny what I have said that with regard to most of the <Col N="556" /> concerns that have been operating on Trade Loans (Guarantee) moneys, there are arrears in the matter of either the repayment of capital or the payment of interest on the outstanding capital on the original scheme, as agreed when the grant was being made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Deputy has just said, I should like to know what was the normal rate of interest charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate varied from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy say what was the average rate of interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The average rate of interest would be at least about five per cent.  It was not as low a rate as we thought might have been granted considering that there was a Government guarantee behind these schemes, but still it was the most that could be got either from a bank or from the individual investing corporations for these concerns.  Now, if these are the circumstances and, in the main, what I have said cannot be denied, I wonder what is the likelihood of success about granting these new moneys, particularly when you are not going to harness up the interest of the individual concerned to the necessity of his providing the working capital.  There was a field for investment in so far as there were tariffed industries before, but it will be said now that there is a bigger field because there are more tariffs.  Have we got to the point as regards industry that people will not go into industry unless they get, first of all, almost prohibitive tariffs to prevent competition from outside; secondly, unless they get a Government guarantee or loan of money to provide the fixed assets, plant and machinery of the concern they are going to establish; but that in addition, even in a tariffed industry, they require that the Government should give them money that is ordinarily called working capital?  If that is so, then it does mean that there is something particularly uninviting about industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> The question of interest has been raised by Deputy MacDermot.  At this moment I think banks, certainly abroad, if not banks here would welcome any industrialist who came along and offered to use the money which banks all over the world have in profusion and which they are ready to lend at very low interest rates.  In fact, I think, it will be admitted as an ordinary axiom that the reason why the rates for the use of money are so low is because no use is being made of the terrific amount of money which is lying idle.  If in these circumstances in these times, with money provided at very low rates of interest in this country, when everything that one can think of is tariffed, and under the scheme which previously allowed a Government grant against fixed assets it is not possible to get industrialists to start here except you give them all the money, working capital as well as money to provide fixed assets, then certainly there is something still to be investigated about Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Is there a proper field for investment here at all?  If there is why is it there is lack of confidence?  Why is it there has been this extra approach with facilities to would-be industrialists? When all that is answered we have to think of the State side.  What security is the State going to have in future that there is going to be any individual effort put into the business started under the conditions I have described?  I think if there was any criticism to be offered on the old Acts it was, not that there was too much in the way of close examination of the people concerned, but that in attempts to get industry going after the 1921-22-23 period&mdash;all these bad years&mdash; certain chances were taken with industries because there was State money at the disposal of the Department. I certainly think that if the test on which the committee had been obliged to rule their decisions was this: what would they do with their own money, that we would not have even the £350,000 or £400,000 of State money granted but that it would be much more nearly one-third of that. But we did take chances&mdash;unsuccessfully. If we are to go on the experience <Col N="558" /> of the old Acts I would have expected that there would be a new code almost definitely tied down to public bodies, harbour authorities and local authorities, and that for the provision of certain works of the public utility type there might have been a fair amount of money put at their disposal and possibly an easing of the conditions under which that money would be granted to corporations of that type. But when we get from bodies, corporate or incorporate, into the provision of working capital.  I think under the circumstances it is a step in the wrong direction.  However, it is a gamble the result of which we shall have to wait and see.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked of &ldquo;other safeguards necessarily imposed by the Department of Finance on the provision of public money&rdquo; and I wish he would develop the point.  What are these?  Certainly any finance department of any government in the world would be expected to rule very narrowly and rigidly indeed against the provision of money for working capital.  Does the Minister mean that, although he is taking out this provision about working capital, in fact the limitation is going to be there because of these safeguards which necessarily will be imposed by the Department of Finance, or is it merely referring to the type of examination which will still have to be conducted with regard to the applicant's previous experience of industry and as a business man and so on?</P>
    <P>When the 1924 Act was before the House and on two or three occasions in later years when we renewed that measure I was asked to make a certain declaration.  I gave that declaration the first year and I repeated it, I think, any time it was asked of me.  It was to this effect: that I bound myself, if my advisory committee recommended clearly and definitely against the loan, that I would not grant the loan; that if they recommended definitely against the guaranteeing of moneys to a certain applicant that I would not give the guarantee.  The House was full of suspicion about the way in which the money was to be administered.  They felt it was not going to be administered <Col N="559" /> rigidly enough, and that too much power was being given.  I definitely bound myself to abide by the decision of the committee, if the committee were adverse, and that I would not always accept the decision of the committee, but that it would have to be subject to other examination.  What I did say was that I gave myself liberty, if I thought the committee had not properly understood the application, and if I thought the application should be amended, to get the applicant to renew the application, possibly to put it in a new form and, indeed, to help the applicant as far as I could to get over whatever difficulties were put before him by the committee.  Still there was the over-riding guarantee that I gave that, if, notwithstanding my efforts through the applicant, the committee still recommended against the grant or guarantee, I would not give the grant or guarantee.  Does the Minister take any such stand with regard to the committee as that, or is he going to regard the advisory committee just as a body to make representations to him which he will decide upon thereafter?  The Minister always has to be responsible, of course, but I think the Minister should indicate to the House whether he feels he is going to be more conservative or more liberal than this panel of business men whom he is going to choose and from whom the committee will be drawn.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken of small-scale concerns and how they are unsuitable for making public issues. That is quite clear, and in so far as there is any attempt made to get a group of industries, say, of the small-scale type which will be in the country spread all over the country, it is a desirable thing.</P>
    <P>Merely to say that the small-scale concerns are not suited in their nature to public issues does not finish that question.  There are bodies known as investment corporations.  They may not be here in any great numbers, but there are financial facilities of this type to be got elsewhere and there are even financial facilities of that type to be got here.  There may come a time when we will be able to say <Col N="560" /> that experience enables us to pass this judgment, that the provision through investment corporations or banks for financial facilities is not sufficient.  But nobody can say that at the moment. It would be useful if the Minister told us of any small concern which failed to get a start by reason of the fact that finance of this type was withheld from it at the beginning and it was faced with the unsuitable alternative of trying to look for a public issue itself or else the alternative of not starting. I know of none prohibited in that way.  Before we begin to give close consideration to the financial provisions that are here we should have some examples to prove the sort of contention that underlay the Minister's statement, although it was not very specifically put.</P>
    <P>I am understanding Section 6 (3) as meaning that the returns that were required in the past will be given in the future, not merely with regard to loans and guarantees entered into prior to the passing of this measure, but even to the guarantees of the new money.  I take it we will get the ordinary report.  If that is so, then there is no change made as far as that part is concerned.  I would prefer to have this measure going back to the old type of the twelve months Act, renewable by special legislation. Where we are entering on this rather dangerous type of experiment, it would not be a bad thing to afford Deputies an opportunity of reviewing the moneys that would be granted during the previous twelve months before we would decide to renew the measure for a further twelve months.  The returns laid upon the Table do not afford such an opportunity.  They give people information on which questions may be based, about which motions on the adjournment may be made and eventually, in a glaring case, a special motion might be tabled.</P>
    <P>A renewal of the Act from year to year would give the House an opportunity on the Second Reading, such as now, of finding out what happened during the preceding twelve months and deciding whether or not there was any change required in the conditions under which these moneys were <Col N="561" /> granted.  To that extent I disagree with the Minister's view that it is better to have this running for a five-year period.  It is a smallish point, but unless he is going to afford some machinery for discussion at least once a year there will inevitably be some discontent.  I am sure he himself will admit that in the early years of this experiment it is better to provide some such opportunity as I have alluded to. If the Minister is not going to provide it in any other way, he should go back to the old scheme of having the Act annually in operation for the ensuing year only.  It does not prevent anybody promoting a scheme.  Anybody interested in industry has seen that the Acts are carried forward from year to year without any trouble.</P>

      <P>I hope we will have from the Minister a statement as to the moneys previously guaranteed.  I want the Minister to tell us how much of the money guaranteed was given to public authorities or a public utility service and, as regards the residue, will he tell us how much is in the hands of concerns that had to get the original scheme of repayment altered to meet their new conditions?  Will he finally tell us how many examples he has had of cases which impressed him as being suitable cases and which failed because the individuals, either through their banks or friends, could not get the amount of money required for working capital?</P>

      <P>When the 1924 Act was before the House I was one of the <Col N="562" /> sceptical ones referred to by the last speaker.  Not without some experience I stated that there was no country in the world that I knew of where credit is so easily obtained as in this country. A short time ago an inquiry was made into the number of shops in this State and figures were produced to show that in proportion to our population we have more shops than any other country in Europe, thus showing that anybody who wants to start a shop has no difficulty whatever in getting credit. Knowing that fact, I was sceptical as to the usefulness of this particular measure.</P>
      <P>What has been the experience of the working of this Act?  The Minister was good enough last night to give us some figures.  Under the original Act the Minister was empowered to circulate up to £1,000,000&mdash;the same amount, speaking from memory, as he has within his jurisdiction under this particular Bill.  That was nine years ago.  Every effort was made during those nine years to give facilities under this Act.  It must be remembered that during that period we were recovering from war conditions, when money was not at all as easily obtained as it is to-day.  Conditions to-day are very much easier.  As the last speaker pointed out, one of the difficulties the banks and other institutions of that character have at the moment is to make use of the money at their disposal.  An extraordinary fact in connection with the monetary history of this country and adjoining countries is that not for a couple of years has money been as cheap as it has been during the last six or eight months and as it is to-day.</P>
      <P>What has been the experience of the House and of the Department of Industry and Commerce in relation to the previous Act?  The Minister told us last night that advances were granted to the amount of £380,000 out of the £1,000,000.</P>

      <P>I am always glad to have useful interruptions if the statements made in them are afterwards supported by facts.  This is an alarming figure that out of a guarantee of £340,000, a sum of £215,000 has been lost to the State.  If these advances had been made by any of our banks, what would be the position of the banks to-day?  We have £215,000 lost out of £340,000.  What is to happen under this new Bill?  What has happened under the old one?  As I understand from the Minister, every demand, every claim, every application, if you like to put it so, was scrutinised by the Advisory Committee and the Minister only recommended advances when these advances had been approved by the Advisory Committee. And even after scrutiny 75 per cent. of the money has been lost! What does this Bill do?  Take Section 5.  It is an extraordinary section.  It reads as follows: &ldquo;Wherever the Minister <Col N="564" /> for Industry and Commerce could, after the passing of this Act guarantee under Section 1 of the Act of 1924 as amended by this Act a loan proposed to be raised by any such person as is mentioned in sub-section (1) of that section as so amended, the said Minister may, if he thinks fit, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance and subject to the limitations imposed by the Principal Acts as amended and extended by this Act, himself grant such loan...&rdquo;  There we have the words, &ldquo;himself grant such loan.&rdquo;  I think, speaking from memory, the Minister told us last night that it was the Minister for Finance made these loans.  I see from this section that it is the Minister himself.  However, that is not very material.</P>
      <P>Now I come to deal with the extraordinary words.  The Minister &ldquo;himself&rdquo; may &ldquo;grant such loan upon such terms and conditions as to time and manner of repayment, rate of interest, security and other matters whatsoever as he shall with the sanction aforesaid think proper.&rdquo;  In other words, in the future, as I understand this particular section, the same scrutiny as has been exercised in the past with such unfortunate results, will not be necessary.  We have the words &ldquo;the Minister himself.&rdquo;  The same language is not used as in the ordinary Acts.  We have instead the extraordinary words &ldquo;the Minister himself.&rdquo;  It reminds one of a certain king that one read of years ago in French history of whom it is related that he constantly repeated &ldquo;The State is myself.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the words &ldquo;the Minister himself.&rdquo;  It is an unusual provision.  For the first time I see it used in this Bill.  If the word &ldquo;himself&rdquo; were left out the Minister would have the power that he desires.  Whether it is to emphasise the fact that he has the power I do not know, but at all events, we have the words &ldquo;the Minister himself&rdquo; for <Col N="565" /> the first time in a Bill.  But the extraordinary thing about it is that he is to have the overriding power of passing over a recommendation that may be or may not be made by the Advisory Committee who, I presume, will scrutinise these claims or applications and he may grant these applications on such terms as he may think proper. The only overriding factor is that the Minister for Finance must agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot put any other interpretation on it.  If the Minister can put any other interpretation on Section 5 I think it would be very desirable for the information of this House that he should do so. I think it is unfortunate from the point of view of the trading community that credit facilities should be made too easy.  We must recollect that in trade we have people who are not prepared to take risks, because they think it is undesirable to take risks.  If capital or credit facilities are too easily granted, we may get into industry people who go into it for the purpose of taking risks which those people who have been engaged in that particular industry for long periods and in some cases, for a number of centuries, do not think it desirable to take.  The result will be that a very serious injury will be done by the encouragement of undesirable people in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I know industry, and I know something about it, for any sound proposition that is put forward in this country there is never any difficulty in getting whatever capital is necessary to start it.  But if you have an unsound proposition put forward it is only desirable that difficulties should accrue.  I think the experience of the Minister's Department in connection with the grants made by his Department will show the truth of that statement. Doubtless, these propositions&mdash; I know something about them&mdash;were put up to the banks before they had been put up to the Minister.  In saying that I am not speaking with any particular knowledge, but knowing the way that business works I am sure that these propositions have from time to <Col N="566" /> time been put up to the banks and these propositions have been turned down by the banks.  Then they come along to the Minister and he has an extraordinary experience.  Having such experience, and I do not blame him personally for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are going to take in possible traders to whom the advantage of this particular Act was refused in the past.  Is their experience as a result of their action likely to be any improvement on what we had in the past?  Therefore, I say to the Minister while anxious to do everything that one can to develop trade and industry to move cautiously along these lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this Bill because I believe it will result in substantial loss to the Irish taxpayer and it is not calculated to do good to Irish industry.  In talking about the results of the previous measures Deputy Good has just mentioned the figures taken from the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. But these figures do not really tell the whole story, because in addition to them we have learned that a substantial portion of the £125,000 which is not to be regarded as lost&mdash;Deputy McGilligan said about 90 per cent.&mdash; was lent to public bodies and not to industrial concerns at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, we have had, the statement from Deputy McGilligan that, in his opinion, there was not a single loan to an industrial concern that had turned out 100 per cent. satisfactorily, that there was not a single case where payment of interest had been made according to the original schedule.  We had, perhaps, a more significant statement than any of these from the Minister himself last night.  He said that even in those cases where the loans had turned out relatively satisfactory, the persons who borrowed had stated that they had found the burden far heavier than they had anticipated. <Col N="567" /> There is a lesson to be drawn from that.  The losses that have been incurred are, no doubt, partly due to the feeling of the late Government that risks had to be taken for the sake of achieving a great object and that purely commercial considerations were not always allowed to carry the day.  In addition to that, I question whether the form of financing allowed by former Acts and which is allowed by this Bill is one that is healthy for the type of industry that is being assisted.  We know that one form of financing granted by the banks&mdash; short-term financing&mdash;is absolutely essential to industry and is of a thoroughly healthy nature.  But I suggest that long-term loans are a very doubtful boon to the sort of industries we have here, that what they really want, in cases where they are entitled to assistance at all, and what would really do them good are not long-term loans but increase of capital.  It is a matter of taste and a matter of opinion as to whether the State should go into industry at all.  I maintain that by making loans under a Bill like this it is going into industry but I further maintain that, if the State is to go into industry at all, the most useful way in which it can do that is not by making loans but by positively investing in these concerns&mdash;by having, perhaps, an investment corporation in some way under the control or the ægis or authority of the State.  Then a struggling or infant industry would not be weighed down by fixed obligations which had to be met year after year.  Whatever money it got would only expect to be remunerated to the extent to which the capital of the man himself, or the company itself, was being remunerated.</P>
    <P>Allusion has been made to the fact that in this Bill, for the first time, the door is being opened to loans for working capital.  That, in my opinion, is a very objectionable feature of the Bill and a feature that lends weight to what I have just being saying.  It is most undesirable that loans should be made to people who have not got working capital.  It is a case of saying to the <Col N="568" /> person who is borrowing &ldquo;Heads you win, tails I lose.&rdquo;  The man or company takes your money and, if they lose it, it is just a lost opportunity to them and nothing more.  But you have lost your money.  On the other hand, if the loan turns out a success, you get nothing but the agreed rate of interest, which is not adequate remuneration for the risk undertaken.  It is for that reason, in addition to the reason that they do not want to be out of their assets over a long period, that they have got to keep their assets liquid, that banks refrain from such business. It appears to me that this Bill is taking risks to an undue extent with the taxpayers' money and that it is doing that in order to confer a false kindness on the sort of industries we have here. In my opinion, in nine cases out of ten in the future, as in the past, the result is likely to be that the people who have money advanced to them will find that a burden has been placed upon them which they cannot carry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be just as well to get the history of the various cases that arose under the Trade Loans Act clearly stated because some misunderstanding may be created by the speech delivered by Deputy McGilligan and the statements, based upon that speech, made by Deputy Good and Deputy MacDermot.  Up to the year 1929, a number of applications for Trade Loans Act facilities were considered and decisions made to grant these facilities.  From 1929 up to the change of Government&mdash;1932&mdash;no applications were granted.  The idea that anybody who could not get financial facilities otherwise because his scheme was too unsound to justify the giving of them could get those facilities under these Acts on the security of the State is entirely contrary to the facts.  A very large number of applications are received.  Most of them are, at first sight, outside the terms of the Act or of a kind not likely to be recommended by the Advisory Committee. They do not even go to the Advisory Committee.  Up to May of this year, 161 cases went to the Advisory Committee and 95 were rejected by that Committee.  When an <Col N="569" /> application is rejected by the Advisory Committee, that ends it.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan said that he had committed himself publicly not to grant any application which had not been favourably recommended by the Advisory Committee.  He was not giving away anything when he said that.  I do not think that there is any Minister or anybody ever likely to occupy a Ministerial position who would not be prepared to give that guarantee because if he has at any time to come to the Dáil to justify the expenditure of public funds to make good a guarantee, he will certainly desire to be in the position of being able to say: &ldquo;The giving of the guarantee was recommended by the Committee.&rdquo;  That is the practice and it will continue to be the practice.  Sometimes, we disagree with the decision of the Advisory Committee rejecting the application but, in such an eventuality, we would consult with the applicants, endeavour to get the application into the form desired by the Committee and send it back as a fresh application to the Committee. But unless there came a favourable recommendation from the Committee it would not go further.  Even when the Committee make a favourable recommendation, it does not mean that the guarantee is given.  Of 64 cases recommended by the Advisory Committee, the guarantee was only actually given in 19.  Subsequent to the examination of the application by the Committee and its recommendation, there came a further detailed examination both in the Department of Industry and Commerce and in the Department of Finance.  My experience has been that any case that gets through all the obstacles to the point of securing the end aimed at is a good case except certain considerations enter into the examination of the application that should not enter. We have had reference made here to the fact that out of £340,000 guaranteed there was a loss of £215,000. Nothing has been lost since then.  I have looked through seven cases.</P>

      <P>I will give the figures later.  Our predecessors stopped giving guarantees in the middle of 1929, and from that date until 1932 no guarantees were given.  Any guarantees given since then were given within the last few months.  I will give the position in respect of these cases.  The guarantee was made good in respect of six cases.  It is not easy to look at the circumstances in which guarantees were given, and to decide what one would do in the circumstances, because one cannot get a complete picture from records, sometimes. From my experience of the way in which the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act was administered during the past 12 months I say deliberately that there is only one case which would have had a chance of success, if it had been under examination in 1932, and not under examination in 1926 or 1927. That was the Allihies Copper Mines where failure was due to the fact that the bottom fell out of the market subsequent to the mines coming into production. The price of copper, which was £83 10s. a ton in 1929, fell to £30 a ton in 1931.  In each of the other cases I have never been able to satisfy myself why the guarantee was given at all, or given in the particular form in which it was given, and I am certain that nobody who examined all the facts in relation to these cases would decide to give the guarantee, knowing quite well that the probability was the guarantee would have to be made good.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot answer that question.  There are only two cases where any arrears of principal and interest payments are due and outstanding at the moment.  It is correct to say that in certain cases the original schedule of repayments was modified, or, in some cases, the State agreed to release from its charge some part of the assets to enable the concerns to acquire additional facilities from banking institutions.  In all cases except two payments in the agreed manner have been maintained up-to-date and, as I stated, some firms are prospering remarkably in consequence of the assistance given under the Acts. In some cases production has been quadrupled and employment quadrupled. Apart from the two cases I quoted, where there are certain arrears of principal and interest, I do not expect that any of these cases will not in due course discharge their liabilities in full.</P>

      <P>I would say the majority &mdash;Urney Chocolate, Killaloe Slate Quarries, Swiftbrook Paper Mills, Carrick Slate Quarries, and a number of other concerns&mdash;are all thoroughly successful cases.  There is no reason to anticipate that there will be any default in payment of principal and interest in these cases.  There are two cases where there are arrears.  In one case the position was created by a fire which disorganised the programme of the concern and postponed the date at which it would earn the profits it anticipated. It is earning profits now, and will be able to do so for a considerable time to come.  In the other case there may be some reason to doubt its success.  It certainly has not got to the point where we would be justified in exercising our right to take possession of the assets <Col N="572" /> for the purpose of selling them, and reducing our liability in that regard.</P>
      <P>Some applications have been granted since I was given responsibility in this matter.  There are, in addition, nine cases where a decision to give a guarantee has been arrived at, but legal formalities associated with the giving of a guarantee have yet to be completed.  There are five other cases under examination, and likely to be granted, and six cases which have been definitely rejected.  There are also three cases under examination and likely to be rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get to the position with regard to the Acts.  Our experience has been that the Acts are capable of doing a considerable amount of useful work.  We had a rather extraordinary speech from Deputy Good.  I am quite sure when he was delivering it he did not see the contradictions in it.  He said that the outstanding characteristic of the present position is that there is an abundance of credit, and that any industrial firm that wanted financial facilities could get them, almost for the asking, from the banks.  Deputy McGilligan talked of the banks being full of money and looking for someone to lend it to.  Deputy Good proceeded to warn us of the dangers that would arise to the State where credit facilities were easily available, and talked of undesirable people coming into industry, being induced to come in by easy credit facilities, disorganising industry in consequence, and to the detriment of those already engaged in industry.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  If credit facilities are easily procurable at the present time, if the banks are, in fact, full of money which they are anxious to lend, we are not worsening the position by the continuation of this Act, or by putting the State guarantee behind certain loan applications.  I do not know that the position is as good as has been described.  It is true that the banks have shown no reluctance to lend money to people to start shops and to engage in other activities of that kind. I am not quite so sure that they have shown the same anxiety to facilitate persons engaged in industrial concerns here.  Certainly I have not seen any <Col N="573" /> evidence of such anxiety where the concerns are new.  Existing firms can get credit facilities of a certain kind, but new concerns have to establish themselves, at their own risk, and over a long period, before the ordinary facilities which will be given, probably without question in other countries, are made available here.  I am collecting evidence upon that point and, if, as is possible, some further legislative proposals come before the Dáil, we may have something interesting to show.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister objects to my interrupting him at this point.  I wonder if he is alive to the fact that successful bankers are always enormously influenced by the personal factor, and that they hesitate to give facilities to people that they do not know by experience for a certain period of time.  That is what influences certain bankers with regard to new enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  But that does not explain why existing concerns which have been getting facilities for a number of years should have their facilities reduced now.  However, there is no necessity now to go into that particular point because it does not arise under this Bill.  We think it desirable, in certain circumstances, where there is a thorough examination of all the conditions by business people and officials of the different Departments of State, that people should be facilitated in getting a loan by putting the State guarantee behind them as an additional security to the lender.  Giving the State guarantee makes it possible to get a loan upon better terms than would be otherwise available. Deputy MacDermot referred to the constant complaint about persons who received facilities complaining of the burden imposed upon them by the obligation to pay the loan in the manner fixed and the rate of interest decided upon.  I have never been able to understand why our predecessors allowed the position to continue in which persons who were getting loans backed by a State guarantee, should pay rates of interest as high as those complained of.  In some cases loans <Col N="574" /> were only made available at 6½ per cent.  I think that was a situation that our predecessors cannot congratulate themselves upon.  The State's liability in respect of interest on loans recently guaranteed is 2½ per cent.  The person who gets the loan may have to pay a higher rate of interest, of course, but the figure that I have given is our liability.  If there is default we have only to pay 2½ per cent. which is very different from 6½ per cent. which was the rate of interest on loans previously guaranteed under the Acts.</P>

      <P>The statement I have made in respect to loans that we have guaranteed is that our liability for interest is 2½ per cent.  The rate may fluctuate in the future.  I do not say of course that it will not.  Undoubtedly the interest now is substantially lower than formerly.  That is the reason why we had a much larger number of applications this year than last year.  The applications were also influenced by the new industrial position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question straight away.  The type of loan that we have been able to guarantee up to the present was not the type of loan that, generally speaking, the banks of this country ordinarily give.  I do not want to misrepresent the position in any respect at all.  The ordinary position of the banks is that they cannot tie up their funds in long term loans; that is the only type which is guaranteed under this Act.</P>

      <P>What prompted my question was the point made by Deputy Good about people, not risking much of their own capital, going into business, and dislocating the old established businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to say, in that connection, is that the change which this Bill effects does not alter our practice in that regard.  We have taken it as a general rule that we should not issue a guarantee for a loan greater in amount than half the capital of the new undertaking.  In other words we require people, seeking a guarantee, to raise as much as we are raising, that is up to 50 per cent. of the total to be invested. There will be variations arising out of different cases.  One type may require a larger investment in fixed assets than in working capital. Another institution may require a very large amount of working capital in reference to fixed assets, but fifty-fifty is our general practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to express the hope that 50 per cent. would be the maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the maximum although we have very rarely departed <Col N="576" /> from it.  That would still be the rule even though this change in respect to capital is made.  The position is we are giving a guarantee on the amount borrowed for the erection of fixed assets.  The other party must put up the working capital.  There is no reason why that should not be reversed. If the other party had the total amount to expend in the case of fixed assets why should not we guarantee the balance of the capital?  That has happened sometimes. People may have bought the machinery, built the buildings, acquired the land and then found that they had under-estimated the case of the total capital required in the under taking.  A man may say I want £2,000 or £10,000 or £20,000 additional for the business.  Our answer to him must be this: &ldquo;If you came to us before you paid for your machinery we could give a State guarantee that would enable you to get that money but as you bought it first we cannot help you.&rdquo; That is obviously an anomalous position. In such a case, in future, we will be able to give a State guarantee when we think it desirable, but we would not as a general rule contemplate any variation of the fifty-fifty arrangement that operated before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite certain it is not.  It is much better to leave the responsibility for the success of the enterprise upon those who are actually running it.  Deputy McGilligan spoke at some length upon the significance to be placed on the fact that the original Trade Loans Acts were not availed of to the extent which he anticipated in 1924. Under the original Act a million pounds could have been guaranteed, and over a period of seven years only £340,000 was, in fact, guaranteed.  He asked questions; he said, &ldquo;Is there a field for investment here?  Is it that there is a lack of confidence in the industrial possibilities of this State?&rdquo; I do not think it is either one or the other.  I think the fact that people have been reluctant about investing capital in Irish industry has been largely due to the absence of any easy means of doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was struck by the fact that in last year, following the conversion of the British War Loan, I received a very large number of letters from people throughout the country who had found themselves with money in their hands to be invested, asking me to recommend industrial concerns here in which they could invest it.  I was not prepared to make a recommendation to them, naturally enough, because it would mean taking certain risks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and leaving oneself open to criticism if the investments were not a success.  At the same time I was aware of a number of industrial concerns that wanted new <Col N="578" /> capital invested; others that were not prepared to seek accommodation under the Trade Loans Act or could not get accommodation by any other means, which, because of their nature, wanted additional capital to come in in the form of invested capital left in the business to be remunerated only on the proportion of capital.  There is at the moment no machinery existing to bring the two classes together. Such machinery might be established by private enterprise.  It has been established in England.  If it is not established by private enterprise certain steps, official or semi-official, to bring such an organisation into existence may have to be taken.  That is a matter which is under examination at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In addition to the type of concern that wants accommodation by way of invested capital there are other concerns that would prefer to get accommodation in this way.  I can give as an obvious example a business which is owned by an individual or a private company.  They do not want to share the ownership with anybody else.  It has been associated with a particular family over a number of years, and they prefer to keep the ownership in their own hands.  They want to extend, and they want to get the finance which will enable them to extend.  They can get it under this Bill.  They would not be willing to accept it in the form of invested capital.  You will come across both cases, and both types of facilities must ultimately be made available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see how that works out.  On the various points that have been raised on the Bill itself I want to say that I think the Bill should operate for five years.  At the present time the Trade Loans Act is continued from year to year, and each year it was announced that it would end next year.  That was a most unsatisfactory position.  Applications were rushed at one period of the year.  If the applicants found that the examination of their case was taking longer than it should they began to get impatient, and pointed to the fact that the Bill was going to expire on a particular date.  Sometimes decisions might have been made with undue haste, or sometimes applications might have been withdrawn because there appeared no prospect of getting them through in time.  They were renewed when the Bill was renewed by the continuing measure.  Either we intend the Bill to operate for five years or we do not.  If we intend it to operate for five years there is no reason for having to introduce a separate Bill each year to secure its continuation.  I think there is ample opportunity available for Deputies to discuss any matters that may arise under it.  It certainly could be discussed on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce; it could be discussed on any of the Finance Bills, or on a special motion. If there appears to be a strong opinion that some other definite opportunity for discussion should be created we could consider the idea of having a separate Estimate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to answer that straight away.  There may be difficulties in that connection, and the Department of Finance would have to be consulted because they are responsible for the preparation of Estimates in the last resort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  As I have said, however, I think that there are ample facilities available for discussion on matters of that kind.  Ordinarily speaking, discussion would not arise except some guarantee had to be made good or circumstances were known to exist which made it likely that a guarantee would have to be made good. On the other question which was raised here as to the wisdom of extending the Bill so as to enable loans for working capital to be given, I think we may as well say it, the sole reason why the limitation appeared in the 1924 Act was because a similar limitation appeared in the British Act of that year.  There was a very definite reason for inserting that limitation in the British Act.  At the time, the British policy was one of deflation.  When the Act was introduced without that limitation quite a number of people stated that it was devised to enable the Government to give effect to a policy of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain people stated that they feared that the British Government would use its power to guarantee loans under the Trade Facilities Act introduced in the British Parliament for the purpose either of checking deflation or assisting a policy of inflation.  Circumstances have entirely changed since <Col N="581" /> then.  Whatever may have been the merits of the arguments used in the British Parliament in 1924, at the present time the general opinion of everybody who has given voice to views on world conditions appears to be that the fall in prices has certainly gone far enough, and that the aim of Governments and economists must be to secure an all-round rise in prices; so that even if the power to guarantee loans were deliberately used for the purpose of conducting an inflation policy in Great Britain, it would not be regarded as bad in these days. Certainly it does not arise here.  To carry out a policy of inflation we would have to inflate not merely the currency of the Free State but the currency of Great Britain as well. We would have to guarantee very much more, certainly much more than £1,000,000, before we could have effected any appreciable result on British currency.  The circumstances are such however that it is well to get rid of that limitation because there are obvious cases, such as those I have mentioned already, where it might be considered desirable that a guarantee should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good is somewhat perturbed over Section 5.  What is the position under Section 5?  I said that Section 5 would be probably inoperative but in theory the position exists that a person might get a guarantee for a loan from the State and yet actually not get the cash.  If a bank says: &ldquo;It is not our function to make long term advances whether they are guaranteed by the State or not&rdquo; and if there is no financial organisation in the State prepared to make these long-term advances, then the Deputy can see quite well that even though the State is prepared to guarantee the loan, and even though the scheme for which the loan is being guaranteed is the soundest possible, the applicant might have nevertheless to do without the money.  If such circumstances should arise there must be power to make an advance instead of giving a guarantee.  At the present time there is no reason to anticipate that that section will have to be used.  The Standing Committee of the Banks <Col N="582" /> has stated the willingness of the members to take up, generally speaking, any loan that is guaranteed by the State under these Trade Loans Facilities Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister then have any objection to the elimination of the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said the section should exist.  It was a flaw in the original Act.  The recommendation to insert such a section was made by an Inter-Departmental Committee which has been examining the matter and I see no reason why we should disagree with the recommendation even though the power is only required in theory.  It should be there, having regard to the fact that the Act is one only for five years.  So far as the liability of the State is concerned there is no difference.  Wherever the Minister for Industry and Commerce can guarantee, under Section 1 of the Principal Act, a loan, he can also make an advance instead and where he can guarantee, Section 1 brings in the Advisory Committee, brings in the sanction of the Minister for Finance, brings in all the checks that have been in operation up to the present, the criticism of which has been that they are too severe.  Even Deputy McGilligan is prepared to admit now that the number of checks, safeguards and restrictions upon the power given to the Minister under the Act are too severe and have led to delay and very frequently the failure of the industries that were applying for assistance and had to wait too long to get it.  Wherever the Minister can give a guarantee, after having had the recommendation of the Advisory Committee and after having got the sanction of the Minister for Finance, then instead of giving a guarantee he can give a loan, but the liability as far as the State is concerned is just the same. If the firm concerned fails, if it is unable to pay the principal or the interest as repayment becomes due the State has got to make good the difference and whether it loses in consequence of the failure of the borrower to repay the money lent to him by the State or in consequence of the necessity <Col N="583" /> of having to repay the amount of the loan which the borrower had received from some outside organisation, it makes no difference.  The loss to the Exchequer is quite the same.</P>
      <P>Section 6 is designed to ensure that the fullest possible information, all the information that heretofore had to be given in respect to loans guaranteed under the Principal Act, will also have to be given in respect of loans guaranteed or advanced under this Bill.  It merely carries into the new Act the same obligation for the fullest possible publicity.  These were the main matters dealt with.</P>

      <P>There is one question which I should like to ask the Minister.  It is with regard to the amount of money made available, this £1,000,000.  Is that entirely new money or has some of it been guaranteed already?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount advanced upon guarantee under the original Act was £340,000.  Now we are putting up the limit by £1,000,000, so that the total that may be guaranteed, without amendment of the Act, is £1,340,000 by the end of the five years. I have stated that it may be necessary, assuming that we give a large number of guarantees or guarantees for particularly large amounts within five years, to amend the Act by deleting £1,000,000 and substituting another figure, as is done from time to time in Housing Acts but ordinarily speaking, assuming everything remains normal, £1,000,000 should be the maximum amount we will be called upon to guarantee within five years. In legislation of this kind where a maximum is stated, once you get to the maximum you can bring in amending legislation but I do not think that will arise here having regard to our experience of the other Act under which only one-third of the maximum was guaranteed in seven years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At present they are in or about twelve years.  There is nothing in the Act which prevents us <Col N="584" /> guaranteeing a loan, say, for 40 years. That has been done in the case of loans secured by harbour authorities where they were able to get money for that term but the attitude of the people who are lending money on State guarantee at present is that they do not want to lend money for longer periods than twelve or fourteen years.  The normal period is twelve years but we could guarantee it for twenty years.  There is nothing to prevent us guaranteeing it for twenty years if anybody can get a loan for that term, but I do not think that is possible unless the loan is secured from some organisation like the Industrial Trust Company.</P>

      <P>This debate has been all about big money.  I have not been the Bill and I do not intend to read it.  In fact I have not read any Bill since I came into this House.  It is all big money that has been spoken of here and consequently I would like to know whether under this Bill a craftsman of ability and ambition, if he wishes to go out on his own, will be facilitated.  Would the journeyman tailor, the journeyman electrician, the ordinary carpenter or the ordinary man who has to put out his hand on Friday night or on Saturday for his week's wages, if he wishes to strike out on his own, be facilitated under the Bill?</P>

      <P>Loans may be granted under this Bill for a manufacturing undertaking, that is, an undertaking the principal object of which is the manufacture or production of goods or articles for sale but we fix a minimum figure of £500.  No loan for any amount less than £500 will be granted.  The reason for that is that the expenses associated with the giving of a guarantee are relatively increased as the size of the loan sought diminishes and below £500 it would be, I think, undesirable for anybody to get a guarantee, having regard to the expense of getting it which would, in fact, mean that the rate of interest charged would be exorbitant.</P>

      <P>With regard to this Section 5, the Minister said, quite rightly, I think, that any such advance was subject to the qualifications specified in Section 1, but it occurred to me as peculiar that the sanction of the Minister for Finance is repeated whereas the other qualifications are not repeated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What it says there is &ldquo;wherever the Minister...could <Col N="586" /> guarantee a loan.&rdquo;  The Deputy has got to consider everything happening which gets the application to that point &mdash;the application being made, being referred to the Advisory Committee, being recommended by the Advisory Committee, the recommendation being accepted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and being approved by the Minister for Finance.  It, then, reaches a point at which the Minister may give a guarantee.  If, at that stage, he decides, instead of giving a guarantee, to make an advance, he has to go to the Minister for Finance for sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>That was just the point I was raising.  There is no difference whatever, as the Minister said himself, in the liability the State undertakes.

    <Title>Cement Bill, 1933&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies will remember that, in the last Dáil, a Bill was introduced, the purpose of which was to facilitate the establishment <Col N="588" /> here of cement-grinding mills.  That Bill had not gone beyond the Second Reading Stage when the Dáil was dissolved and consequently it lapsed at that stage.  Prior to the dissolution, however, I had announced in the House that, in consequence of certain representations received in the Department of Industry and Commerce, we were proposing to examine further the possibility of securing the speedy establishment of a complete cement industry before pushing the earlier Bill further to the Statute Book.  Quite early on taking office, we gave attention to the possibility of establishing a cement industry here. It is an industry which has been established in most countries and an industry for which this country is particularly suitable in so far as we have all the raw materials available in abundance.  We have also got a growing market for the cement, a market, certainly, which I think would justify the establishment of more than one cement-producing plant on an economic basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We found, however, that certain difficulties existed and we originally had the idea of proceeding towards the establishment of the industry in two stages, first, by encouraging and procuring the erection of grinding mills and, secondly, the erection of the clinker plant.  Following the introduction of the Grinding Bill in the Dáil, various representations were made by different parties to the effect that it would be possible to establish the industry completely with very little additional loss of time to the delay that the establishment of the grinding mills would cause and we proceeded to examine the information on which those representations were made.  As a result of that examination, we have satisfied ourselves that there are firms available which are prepared to finance, erect and operate in this country cement-producing plants capable of supplying all our requirements at reasonable prices. Deputies are aware that this is almost the only country in Europe in which there is a free market in cement. Most of Europe and, in fact, most of the world, is subject to a cartel <Col N="589" /> arrangement.  The different markets have been divided up between the producing firms and prices are fixed, generally on a monopoly basis.  Those who were dividing up the world for that purpose forgot the Irish Free State and, at the present time, practically all the competition between the firms in the disposal of surplus stocks is concentrated here, with the result that we, at the present time, are enjoying cement from every country at about half the price at which it is available in the country of production.</P>
    <P>Cement is being sold here definitely at a loss to the producers.  That is, of course, a temporary advantage to us, but it constitutes one of the difficulties in the way of the establishment of a cement industry of our own in so far as we must be prepared to contemplate a rise in cement prices following the establishment of that industry.  We have, of course, no reason to assume that a rise in price will not take place in any event, that those who are at present competing here will not come to an arrangement among themselves which will mean that this market will also become controlled.</P>
    <P>We, however, believe that it should be possible to produce cement here at least as cheaply as it is produced anywhere else.  There are many parts of this country where every natural facility exists for its production.  The raw materials are available side by side with transport facilities and other advantages.  The machinery that is used in the manufacture of cement will work just as efficiently here as it works elsewhere, and the costs generally will not be higher.  There are some people who have gone so far as to say that there is no reason why we could not establish an export trade under various circumstances; but having regard to all the circumstances of the cement industry throughout the world I think that these people are optimists of the first order.  However, there is no reason why we should not be able to supply all our own requirements and give a large amount of employment to our own people as a result.  We have <Col N="590" /> decided, therefore, not to proceed with the original Bill and have introduced this Bill which is now before the Dáil. The Bill provides that the manufacture of cement in the Saorstát shall be subject to licence.  The scheme which we have in contemplation does not appear on the face of the Bill and that is why I think that I should give an outline of the scheme now.</P>
    <P>Taking the market for cement in this country to be 200,000 tons per year, we can contemplate the erection of two cement factories, each capable of producing 100,000 tons.  That would be an economic unit of production.  Up to last year, the market here was growing rapidly, but in 1932, in this country and in every country, there was a very substantial falling off in the consumption of cement.  Those who have studied the question say that it arose entirely out of the present depressed conditions of business which have brought about the postponement of capital undertakings and works of one kind or another, and that it is not due to any change in public taste or to any diminution in the utility of cement as a building material or of its usefulness for any other purpose.  If the market continues to expand here in the future at the same rate as it did in the past, we shall get to the stage where a third and, perhaps, ultimately a fourth cement factory producing the 100,000 tons can be established.</P>
    <P>Our present aim is to have two cement-producing factories.  Certain people say that one plant producing 200,000 tons will be more efficient and more economical than two plants producing 100,000 tons each.  That is true to this extent, that the cement from the one factory will be cheaper at the factory.  Nobody wants it at the factory. It has got to be transported to the place where it is going to be used, and transport costs constitute a very considerable proportion of the price to the ultimate consumer.  It is just as important to reduce transport costs as it is to reduce production costs.  I think that it will be found that a greater number of our people will get cement cheaper if we have two producing units, more or less adjacent to the big centres of consumption, than <Col N="591" /> if we had only one producing unit adjacent to one big centre of consumption.</P>
    <P>Our idea is that, following the passage of this Bill, every person interested in the manufacture of cement here should submit to the Government proposals for that purpose. There will be only one licence issued for a cement factory in the eastern portion of the country, one in the southern portion of the country, and, subsequently, one in the western portion of the country.  I am not attempting to define these areas any more closely than that.  It gives a general indication of what we have in mind.  These licences will be issued to the persons who put up what appears to be the most attractive scheme involving a guaranteed maximum price for the cement.  I have every reason to believe that we will get from different parties schemes which will conform to our idea, and it will then be our job to select from them, in respect of each area, the scheme which appears best suited to the area involved and which will give the best cement at the lowest price.  When that decision is arrived at, a licence will be issued and the construction will go ahead.  I am informed that it will take from twelve to eighteen months to complete the construction of the factory alone.  I should like to say further that it is not proposed to delay the examination of applications for licences.  Following the passage of this Bill through the Dáil, on Second Reading, my Department will be prepared to receive and examine any schemes on the assumption that the Bill will become law so that, when it does become law, all the preliminary work will have been completed and licences can be issued without further delay and production undertaken at once.</P>
    <P>That is the main purpose behind Part I of the Bill.  It is also the purpose behind Part II.  Part III requires a little explanation.  Ordinarily, a company seeking to establish a cement works in this country would have to promote legislation by Private Bill procedure in order to get certain <Col N="592" /> powers.  There will probably be the erection of railway sidings involved, perhaps overhead roadways, and other construction work of that kind, all of which would require this power to acquire property, either compulsorily, at an agreed price or as fixed by an arbitrator under an Act mentioned here.  That type of legislation is quite common and would have to be promoted here, but it is a slow and costly procedure, and in view of the fact that the public interest would have been already fully considered in relation to each one of these enterprises before a licence was issued, we see no reason why these companies should not be released from such obligation by inserting Part III of this Bill which will enable the Minister, following an inquiry or such examination as is necessary, to empower the licensee to effect this compulsory acquisition of property.</P>
    <P>Deputies, in considering that part of the Bill, should bear in mind that these undertakings are going to be big undertakings.  When completed, they will constitute some of the biggest industrial undertakings in this country. Each of the factories, which we contemplate will be established, will require the investment of £400,000 or £500,000 capital.  In the bringing into existence of industrial organisations of that kind certain powers will have to be taken to ensure that there cannot be any vexatious delays.</P>
    <P>Part IV of this Bill also requires explanation.  It is quite obvious that, in the circumstances now existing, there is no prospect of getting a cement industry established here unless we are prepared to exclude foreign cement. Foreign cement is coming in, as I have said already, at less than its cost of production&mdash;roughly, at half the price available in the country of origin&mdash;and the sellers of that cement have shown no hesitation about cutting prices in the most drastic and extraordinary manner in order to get contracts or to maintain themselves in the market. On several occasions recently, information has been brought to me concerning cement contracts available or other opportunities of disposing of cement, of two and sometimes three firms cutting <Col N="593" /> prices in the most extraordinary manner&mdash;one below the other and the other going below the first again in order to get sale.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it is quite clear that we cannot get the industry established here unless we exclude foreign cement.  On the other hand, we cannot do that by a protective tariff.  We may get one unit into production six months before the other and it may not be possible to exclude cement from all parts of the country at the same time.  We may only want to exclude it from a particular part of the country.  At the same time it would be an extraordinary position if we had in one part of the country Irish-produced cement selling at a higher price than cement in another part of the country where foreign-produced dumped cement was still being sold.  It is also a consideration that the price of cement should not jump rapidly.  Assuming we can get cement produced here from 34/- to 38/&mdash;I will say from 32/- to 40/-, so that firms applying for a licence will have a wide margin in which to vary their figures&mdash;and that cement at present is being sold at less than 32/-, or less than the price, at any rate, at which we will be able to get it produced here, we do not want a sudden increase in price.  We think that the increase in price should take place gradually over the 12 or 18 months during which the cement factories are being erected and cement continues to be imported.  In any event, I see no reason why the benefit of the price-cutting war going on at the present time should not accrue to the Exchequer.  Out of public funds a very large amount is being spent at the present time to secure the construction of roadways, houses and other buildings, in all of which cement is used to a large extent, and if foreign countries are insisting upon selling us cement at a loss there is no reason why the full benefit of that reduction in price should be enjoyed merely by those who buy it.  If we can get the benefit transferred in some way to the Exchequer then it can be shared out amongst all our people. For that reason, we have devised the <Col N="594" /> system which is embodied in Part IV of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to give the Dáil some information in that connection. I had inquiries made as to the increase in the price of a house which would result from a particular increase in the price of cement.  I am speaking of any house built out of cement blocks and my information is that a four-shilling rise per ton in the price of cement will increase the cost of erecting the ordinary subsidy house by, roughly, 5 per cent., so that it would take quite a substantial increase in the price of cement to produce a situation which would involve a revision of the housing subsidies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These are rough figures.  Quite obviously it would not be possible to get any precise calculation on that score.  However, the scheme which we have devised here is that, following the passage of this Bill, the importation of cement will be subject to licence and the person getting a licence will be required to pay a fee which will be calculated with regard to the amount of cement he will import.  In a sense that is a tax upon the importation, but it is a tax which may be varied from time to time or in relation to different classes of cement.  It is necessary to have that means of variation because of the abnormal circumstances existing, the fact that cement from one country is sold at one price and precisely similar cement from another country is sometimes offered at half that price, and that occasional lots are being sold sometimes at extraordinary figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Described as similar, shall I say?  I have had one example recently where cement from a certain country for a big contract that is going in another country was quoted at a price which meant that the producers of it were getting 7/- per ton, and seeing that it costs anything from 20/- to 30/- to produce, the loss can be estimated.  What we want to get is a level price for cement here, that is cement of the same quality, and gradually to bring that price up to whatever figure we know to be the guaranteed price at which Irish cement will subsequently be available in a year or two years' time.  The means we have devised is this licence fee, which will be varied from time to time, and which may be different as between one port or another, or between cement from one country or another, according to the price at which it is offered.  It is a licensing arrangement which has been brought into operation in certain other countries and which appears to be working satisfactorily, although I suppose none of them have had sufficient experience of it yet to be able to offer a very conclusive opinion.  So far, however, it appears to be working satisfactorily elsewhere, and it seems to fit the requirements of our particular case with regard to cement.  All the safeguards which are necessary in consequence of an arrangement of that kind are, I think, inserted.  There is provision made for the fullest possible publicity.  Fortnightly returns must be published by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, giving the names of all persons to whom licences have been issued, the fee fixed in relation to the quality of the cement, the country of origin, and the port through which it is to enter.  It is provided that whenever a rate is fixed in respect of a particular consignment of cement, the same rate must be charged in respect of any other licence for the same class of cement imported through the same port from the same country of origin and in the same calendar month.  That provision which limits it to the same calendar <Col N="596" /> month is necessary because of variations which may take place in cement prices in the meantime.  A person applying for a licence must give information as to the net price at which the cement is being purchased by him.  I admit that there is a certain weakness there in so far as a clever rogue might find it possible to deceive the officials of the Department dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>We have, however, taken power to inflict fairly heavy penalties and there is always the fact that if he is once caught he cannot do it again, in so far as a conviction under this Part of the Act debars him from getting a licence at any future date.  The situation, therefore, between the date of the passage of the Bill and the date at which Irish-made cement would be available will be that any person may apply for a licence to import cement.  He will get that licence on the same conditions, having regard to the quality of the cement and the port of entry, as everyone else and there will be the fullest possible publicity in respect of all licences issued, so that he will know where he stands.  The fee will be calculated so as gradually to produce a rise in the price of cement, if such rise should be necessary having regard to world prices, and the ultimate price of the cement available here, up to the point at which Irish-made cement will be available.  After that date cement will not be allowed in except into such parts of the country as cannot be supplied from the cement-producing units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stated that we will have one in the East.  Probably the first to be erected will be in the East.  Possibly the second will be in the South and ultimately the third in the West.  At some stage it may be necessary to license the importation of cement into the West until the market has grown to the point when we could contemplate the erection of another unit. While requirements in that part of the country cannot be supplied from the concerns already established, that <Col N="597" /> licensing arrangement will still operate in respect of cement imported.</P>
    <P>I would like Deputies to examine this Bill, having full regard to everything that we must do if we are to succeed in establishing this important industry.  Because of the particular circumstances existing here, we must effect a degree of State interference that is not contemplated or effected in relation to other industries.  We can have only a very limited number of units in any case.  If we are going to institute the fairly rigid protection necessary in the world conditions now existing, we must have in relation to these units certain safeguards, one being the safeguard of the maximum price to ensure that the economic interests of the country will not be prejudiced by action on the part of the owners of the factories behind the tariff barrier.  I think we can achieve that.  We must also contemplate the fact that the control which it will be necessary to assert may also have to be utilised to ensure that if such cement-manufacturing plants are not owned by nationals of the Saorstát at the beginning, we will have reason to believe that at some future date they will pass into the hands of Saorstát nationals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not anticipate it will.  I have reason to believe that we can get these factories established by external capital if we so desire and that we will have at least a sufficient number of applications for licences to ensure that there will be a competitive element in relation to it.  I believe there is a substantial amount of local capital available for investment in cement factories and it is conceivable that possibly we may be able to get what we consider to be a better position in relation to this industry right at the beginning.  We will have no difficulty in getting the consent of the licensees to the transfer of ownership to Saorstát nationals at a later date.  Despite the knowledge that such a condition may be attached to the licence, I am quite certain we will get <Col N="598" /> applications for licences.  I do not think anyone need fear that we will be unreasonable in that regard.</P>
      <P>The only conditions that may be attached to a cement-manufacturing licence are set out in Section 12.  At first sight they appear to be a formidable list, but anyone reading the section over will soon see that they merely provide for the necessary safeguards both as to the price and quality of the cement on the one hand, the use of Irish materials wherever possible on the other hand, and the encouragement of Irish ownership subsequently.</P>

      <P>I think I explained that.  We can take this point of view, that anyone who likes can come along and manufacture cement here.  So long as we have taken that point of view, nobody has done it and apparently nobody will do it.  The market is extremely limited.  If people are to be induced to invest the very large amount of capital required in the erection of a cement works, it is necessary they should be insured against unreasonable competition, whether that comes from abroad or inside the country.</P>

There is no doubt that if one well-known cement-manufacturing company established a cement-manufacturing works in the vicinity of Dublin to-morrow, or proceeded to do it, there is at least one other well-known company that would do the same thing and the first company would have to contemplate the possibility of a price-cutting war being carried on within the country and no profits resulting.</P>

      <P>It would be impossible at the moment to make that estimate. It will depend, first of all, upon the maximum price which is quoted to us by any firm applying for a licence.  If we consider that reasonable and take it as standard, we have to fix a price that will bear some relation to the world price.  Until we get information on these points we cannot estimate what the revenue will be.  I do not think it will be very substantial.</P>

      <P>I had intended, before the Minister spoke, to raise a particular point.  I will do it now, because it will have application hereafter. According to our Standing Orders&mdash;No. 101&mdash;&ldquo;Every motion for any aid, grant or charge on the public revenue, or for any charge upon the people, shall be considered in Committee of the whole Dáil to be known as the Committee on Finance.  The Committee shall report before any Resolution or Vote of the Dáil is taken, and such report shall be considered on a future day, unless the Dáil shall otherwise order.&rdquo;  Paragraph (2) sets out: &ldquo;When a Bill incidentally involves any aid, grant, or charge upon the public revenue, or upon the people, the motion referred to in this Standing Order may be taken at any time prior to the Committee Stage of the Bill.&rdquo;  There is no doubt this Bill incidentally involves a charge upon the people.  I think that it might be considered that in the main the Bill is nothing but a charge upon the people. Not merely is it incidental, but the subject of the Bill is a charge.</P>
      <P>The procedure heretofore has been that it is always taken in Committee on Finance by way of Financial Resolution. We adopted that procedure in the case of the butter bounty business.  It was afterwards followed by a Bill.  Even if it should be said that it is only incidentally the charge comes upon the people through something else in the Bill, that is a matter for argument as to which is the superior point.  The precedent in this House has been that this is discussed as a financial matter not merely before the Committee Stage but before the Second Reading Stage.  I presume, however, as we have entered on the Second Reading, the point has been allowed go by default, but I hope it will be a matter that will not be allowed to operate again as a precedent. I think it would be better if this had been introduced as a Financial Resolution.</P>

      <P>I will explain it to the Minister.  If £x produces a certain amount of cement, it is available to the people of the country at something over £x.  It is available to us at less than half the cost at which it is available to the people of the country where it was produced.  Where are we?  We would be paying about half the cost of production.  However, we will take it in relation to our own butter bounty business.  The people who are doing this must have anticipated our announcements in the butter business. Why should not we be all mad together instead of having this country peculiar in its madness?  If we are mad enough to have the English people eat our butter at an extra cost to the consumer of butter here, why should we not avail ourselves of that folly in other people?

It is <Col N="603" /> impossible to say how much that will be because one person might offer to make cement at 28/- a ton and we might come to the conclusion that he could not carry out that contract or that for some other reason he was an unsuitable person to get a licence and another application would be accepted at a somewhat higher figure.</P>

      <P>At any cost?  If the Minister says that is the purpose of this <Col N="604" /> Bill, and if he says at a considerable increase in the present price he would be right.  The Minister has to put this case that we should get it at some increase in the present cost, and then we are going to get on to decentralisation of this industry and have three factories instead of one.  This is in keeping with the whole atmosphere of economic folly that surrounds us.  I investigated many cement propositions and I never got the wildest that came before me indicating that the final price of cement, where the materials were raised and manufactured in this country, was going to be anything like 50 per cent. increase in the present prices.  Yet the proposition in this Bill, and the statement made by the Minister here to-night, indicate something like 100 per cent. increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are to get a world price and we are told that we have cement available to us here at half the cost at which it is available in the country where it is made.  Remember we are to have, according to the Minister's own promise, zoned areas. This is the only country which is to get the benefit of all this.  This is the only country which is getting the benefit of the sort of surplus production which cannot be sold in the zoned areas.  The price is beaten down considerably.  The Minister said it was half the cost of production in other countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Available.  The Deputy must bear in mind that the price in other countries may be inflated arising out of a monopoly position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But how was the monopoly position arrived at?  It was arrived at after fierce cut-throat competition amongst the big cement rings all over Europe.  As a result of that, their prices were beaten down until they yielded a very small margin of profit.  The Governments which tolerated the cartel conditions certainly saw that the prices fixed were such as would give a very small margin of profit.  We are going to get cement hereafter in this country at greatly increased prices.  The Minister's fear as to the increased <Col N="605" /> prices is shown in another way.  It would not be a good thing to see these prices increase at once, so they are going to be scaled up over a period of 18 months or two years.  The people are not to be shocked by having the prices increased at once.  We are to do the stepping-out over a period of about two years.  That shows in a sharp way the economics we have got to, because we have the full view concentrated on this one article. Previously, we had the argument in relation to tariffed goods that producers in this country were being beaten down because goods were being sent in here under peculiar conditions. Everybody was dumping.  This country should have been one of the easiest places in which to live during the last ten years because we were getting the advantage of dumped goods.  But you could not get the ordinary man in the street to believe that in relation to his cost of living. We have another angle of view on this matter in relation to flour.  The Minister told us that the price of flour was not going to rise, that any decrease brought about by reason of the price of wheat falling would be reflected here.  Now, in answer to questions reiterated here by Deputy Dillon, we learn that there is a difference of between 4/- and 5/- per sack as between the foreign-produced stuff and the flour sold here.  The Minister told us in a light-hearted way that it was only the leavings of foreign-produced flour we were getting. But here is the real situation. Here, it is not a question of leavings. Here is first class material which people are sacrificing themselves in other countries to sell to us at this dumped price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now going to make our own cement and have increased charges. Further than that, we are going to have a decentralised industry.  That means that at whatever prices we might get cement produced at a single factory, we are going to have those prices increased by dividing out the work over two or three factories.  The Minister's answer to that is that the price of cement at the factory is not what matters but the price at the site <Col N="606" /> where it is going to be used, and that transport costs have to be considered. Has he got any company yet to say to him that they agree with that statement, and that they will not guarantee to produce and distribute anywhere in the country as long as they are allowed to produce in one factory, at the prices that will be charged in the case of the three factories?  I do not think that there is a single undertaker in the way of cement manufacture who would accept the Minister's view on that.  If that view is correct, why only three units? Surely, you would lower your transport costs if you had ten of them scattered at different points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder why? Because you would get below the manufacturing unit.  If we go back along that line, will the Minister deny this simple proposition: that if you get one factory to produce all the cement required in this country, you can produce it far more cheaply than you would get the same amount of cement produced in three factories? What is the necessity for decentralisation in this industry?  If you want to decentralise industry, is not the best way to say that one industry in which the production unit is the whole country should be located, say, in Munster and that in regard to some other industry where the production unit is the whole country, Munster should not get that but it should be diverted to Leinster or Connacht? Why, if we are going to have decentralised industry, should we have every industry decentralised?  Surely that is not part of &ldquo;the plan.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How much does the Minister now recant of the statements he made, when the last Bill was before us, with as much assurance as he has made any statement to-day?  We were told then that the Minister was enthused about making cement from imported clinker, that by far the biggest amount of labour went in the factory as from the clinker stage to the production of cement and that very little went in the raising of the raw material to the <Col N="607" /> clinker stage.  That was the statement on which the last measure was founded. Has the Minister discovered that that was a mistake?  That statement was made with as much assurance as any statement the Minister made here to-day. We were told also, with regard to costs, that it was the raising of the raw material for cement that was making the cost so much.  We are now going to add that on.  At the time that the Minister was speaking of getting cement manufactured in this country from imported clinker, he told us most specifically that the final product would be sold here at a price equal to that at which the best quality Belgian cement was being imported and sold in this country.  Apparently, that cannot be done now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take the imported clinker side of the question, while we would get most of the employment and while we would get spent in the country most of the money involved, we would get cement sold here at very much the same price at which imported good quality Belgian cement was being sold.  Now, to get the smaller amount of employment added and to get the advantage of the smaller amount of money expended, we are going to meet the difference between the price at which Belgian cement can be imported and sold here and this, what I describe as, &ldquo;doubling-up&rdquo; on the price of cement. Is that an economic proposition if the Minister sticks to the old figures? I think that the old figures are entirely wrong.  I never got justification for them.  If we are to take the Minister as speaking accurately on the occasion the first Cement Bill was introduced and as speaking accurately to-day, that is the proposition.  That is the addition we are making to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has found foreign firms ready to finance and to operate cement factories here capable of producing cement at a reasonable price.  What is a reasonable price?  The whole thing turns on that.  When we asked previously about the same reasonable price in another Bill we were told it was the same price as that at which <Col N="608" /> first-class cement could be sold here. Now it is not that.  We have been getting the benefit of dumped cement at less than half the price at which cement is available to the people where it is manufactured, and we are going to pay the difference and to get that price raised by degrees over a period of 18 months, so that the impact will not be too great at once, and the revenue will get some of the benefit of the price-cutting war that is going on outside.  That is the whole purpose of the Bill.  As the Minister mentioned in an answer to Deputy Good's question, while the revenue would not be a great deal, it is clear that Part III of the Bill is to bring up the price at which sales are effected in this country to the world price.  It is the first time any Minister appeared in this House proposing that when we get something outside too cheap we are going to raise it above that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the Minister's line that we are not going to pay any more for things manufactured here.  Tariffs being an imperfect form of getting money, things are going to be produced here as cheaply as outside and we always have hopes of an export market being secured. What nonsense.  Flour, of course, has taken another turn, the excuse being, after the argument, that the millers would be prevented from over-charging. That has gone in face of the facts.  The new answer is that we are getting the leavings of the flour manufactured on the other side.  Here, there is the proposition that the aim of the Ministry is that the price retail here is to be the world price.  We are asked to do that without a clear idea of the number of people to be put into employment, the type of employment it will be, and without a clear idea of what the accumulated costs of building&mdash;and the use there is for cement&mdash; in this country will amount to.  Maximum prices have been spoken of.  I asked if it was fixed prices, and I was told &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; irrespective of labour costs, irrespective of power costs. Surely not.  Then it is not a fixed price.</P>

We have no indication even of the variants of maximum prices at the moment.  I do not know what has driven the Minister to this plan, because he has in his Department a scheme which will not involve the amount of capital that, I understand, this will involve.  He aims, at least, at three units.  They are to be big industrial undertakings, and would not be less, as far as their actual resources are concerned, than £400,000. That means £1,200,000.  I know of one scheme which was certainly there for the Minister to consider, where it was considered an extravagant amount of capital to put three-quarters of a million into the manufacture of cement for the whole country.</P>

The power was to be sold to them in this country.  Why have we got to the stage that there must be three units of £400,000 capital in each?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>One million two hundred thousand pounds for the production of cement.  There was at least one offer to produce and to work <Col N="610" /> up to the 300,000 mark&mdash;certainly to 250,000 tons&mdash;at less than three-quarters of a million, and that was considered as being an extravagant amount of capital, and was criticised for the reason that so much money would be involved, as well as the interest that would have to be paid.  What has made the difference?  Is it the division of the three units?  If so, we must get some economic calculations on the three units.  What is the special advantage of three units, if that is going to involve so much extra capital and not give more labour, or if it means extra final costs?  Again, it may be some of those soft-hearted foreign capitalists who want to come to this country to destroy themselves, one of those people who can expend three-quarters of a million on a single cement plant, or another who would spend less than half a million on a single cement plant to supply this country, guaranteeing that they would be able to produce cement a great deal less than the present cost of Portland cement sold here, and not at a very big price over the cost of French and Belgian cement sold here. What is the Minister's final price in relation to the two prices quoted, even with fixed labour costs and power costs, for the purposes of the scheme?  Has the Minister any comparison?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is definitely an offer involving less capital, and therefore involving less recoupment of capital, for the privilege of supplying all the cement this country seems to want at a particular time, selling it finally at less than the cost of Portland cement brought in, or at a relatively small addition over the cost at which either Belgian or French cement is brought in. Why are these things being thrown aside for the sake of this scheme?  This Bill is not one of which I speak particularly, but monopoly, or quasi-monopoly is what it sets out to achieve.  There is not the slightest doubt that if there is going to be cement produced in this country, it is going to be produced in three zones, with the granting of a monopoly in each zone for the amount of cement manufactured.  These are the only conditions in which cement will be manufactured in this country. It is useful to have this example, <Col N="611" /> because it must bring out, as a basis of industrial endeavour, the limited purchasing power of a small community. That is what people always forget in any industrial proposals that are put before the country.  It is good to have something that comes up here openly in daylight, which shows that if you want to get about 1,000 or 1,200 people employed, you have got to do it at such and such a sacrifice, and you have got to do it because of the economic law that we are only producing for a limited number of people.  You cannot get costs down to what they would be for a bigger number, but even if we could, at the cost of half a million, and that it would rule in other economic proposals, it would not be a bad thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be admitted by everybody that a Bill of this kind is long overdue.  Thousands of tons of cement are imported into this country, especially in recent years, when there has been a great deal of house building, and when many roads are constructed of concrete.  Deputy McGilligan has devoted a great deal of his speech to the question of centralisation as against decentralisation.  As far as I am concerned, I agree with the Minister that zones should be created in the country for the purpose of producing cement.  That will be welcomed in all parts of the country. If factories established are all going to Dublin, then everybody is asking is anything at all to be done for the rest of the country.  The constituency I represent is very much interested in this Bill, and has been agitating that the cement works there should be brought into use.  There is no need to set out the history of these works, which manufactured cement for many years.  The Dublin Corporation took a great deal of that cement, from time to time. Immediately prior to the closing down of these works on the last occasion, arrangements were made through the Local Government Department whereby the Dublin Corporation decided to give a ten per cent. preference to that Wexford cement in <Col N="612" /> order to keep the works open.  The Commissioners, who were appointed after the Corporation was dissolved, knocked that arrangement on the head, and that is the reason why the cement works at Drinagh were closed down.  I am now submitting that Drinagh is worthy of consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot tell you, but I say that Drinagh is deserving of consideration. Ever since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office people have been looking forward to see the Drinagh works opened.  I do not say that the Minister made any promise, as far as these works are concerned, but prominent supporters of his Party, in my constituency, very definitely said before the 1932 General Election, that within three months after the election the Fianna Fáil Government would see that the Drinagh Cement Works were opened.  That statement was very definitely made. As soon as this Bill was introduced and people read it in my constituency they felt genuinely alarmed to find that as far as Drinagh Factory was concerned it has been left out of the picture. Still, no matter how we may read the Bill, there is some possibility that Drinagh will get a chance.  The factory is there; there is plenty of material there, and the men are there, and I suggest to the Minister that when he is in consultation with people who apply for licences to establish factories in this country, Drinagh should be kept to the forefront.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 60 men employed in that works before it was closed down.  The majority of these 60 men are unemployed since, and I think the Minister should give these men consideration. A great deal of hardship prevails in the district, resulting from the unemployment which came about through the closing down of these works.  I ask the Minister, as I have been asked to ask him, and as all Deputies from Wexford have been requested to ask him, to see that special consideration should be given to Drinagh in view of the fact that the skilled men are there and have been working at cement manufacture for many years.  I was speaking quite recently to a representative <Col N="613" /> of the Cement Marketing Company and he told me that his company were prepared to re-open the Drinagh works and give employment to 100 men provided the Government were prepared to permit them to build a works in Dublin and afford them protection. That is a proposal that should get very special consideration.  It is a very serious thing for the people of my constituency. Every Deputy who represents Wexford knows that he is bombarded with resolutions for the last 18 months, and especially since this Bill was introduced in reference to the claims of Drinagh.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider this matter sympathetically.  As far as the question of tariffs is concerned between this and the establishment of the works, the Minister talked of five per cent. increase in the cost of housing. That would be nearly 3d. per week in the rent of a £200 house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Oh, that is a different matter.  I would urgently impress upon the Minister the necessity of giving special consideration to Drinagh. People are looking to the Government to do something to relieve the hardships that prevail there in consequence of the closing down of the factory, and I trust the Minister will do all that is needful in that direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some additional information from the Minister, if possible, in connection with this Bill. He spoke of a market of 200,000 tons. I take it that is a potential market for the Saorstát calculated in a very rough and ready way.  If that is so I would like to ask him what are the importations at three or four of the different ports&mdash;Dublin, Cork and some other places&mdash;because I think that would have an important bearing upon the question.  The Minister spoke of an economic unit of 100,000 tons&mdash;of a factory producing 100,000 tons per year. I would say if anything that that was on the low side.  The Minister spoke about allowing cement to be imported to places where cement cannot be supplied from cement-producing units. That is rather difficult to understand. <Col N="614" /> I would like to ask the Minister how he proposes to arrive at a decision because I take it that cement can be sent from one producing unit all over the country.  It is a question of transport cost.  Is not that so?  I would like to ask the Minister what his idea is as to what would be the governing factor. If for the sake of argument a cement unit was established in the East what would be the formula or how would he arrive at a decision, supposing he got an application from a person to import cement in another part of the country? I think it is important that that should be known.  The Minister has spoken of getting a guarantee about a maximum price from a manufacturing firm which would be prepared to produce cement in this country.  I should like to ask the Minister what the maximum price is.  Deputy McGilligan has apparently elicited the fact that there would be a question of wages, transport and fuel costs, operating on a sliding scale in altering that maximum price.  I should like to ask the Minister is he prepared to tell us what the maximum price exactly means.  Is that at the factory or what is it?  It is a very important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of manufacturing, I take it that the Minister will not introduce the system of licensing until he sees that cement is going to be produced in this country at some no distant date.  It seems to me to be an extraordinary thing that cement imported from foreign countries is going to be subject to a sort of sliding tariff, according to the country in which it is produced.  I do not know whether it is desirable to introduce discrimination as between one foreign country and another, but perhaps the Minister will tell us what the justification for that is.  The Minister has stated that if the price of cement is increased, I think an increase of 4/- a ton was the figure he mentioned, it would only increase the cost of a house by 5.  I am not in a position to state whether that is so or not, but it occurs to me that there is nothing more urgent in this country at the present time than the housing question.  When houses have to be erected by giving subsidies, surely the cheaper any materials can be <Col N="615" /> brought in the better.  I think any increase in cost would mean that either additional rents would come to be charged or additional subsidies would have to be granted.  Of course the Minister may argue that this is only one factor in a house, but it is a most undesirable factor to introduce, especially when the costs of houses are so high at the present time.</P>
    <P>On the Fourth Part of the Bill the Minister has spoken about an importer having to give a return showing what amount of cement he is going to bring in from a particular country over a particular period, and what the quality of that cement is going to be.  I should like to remind the Minister that the position of people applying for licences is most difficult.  They have to make elaborate calculations, which are liable to be falsified, and even if the Minister can deal with that licence immediately there is a grave danger that, where a contract is entered into and shipping has to be arranged, even a delay of a few hours may occasionally mean the loss of a market.  I should like specially to urge that on the Minister.  If he can see some less cumbrous form to inflict on the section of the community who would be bringing in cement under the system of licences, he ought to try and do away with the question of licences altogether. There is no doubt that, first of all, his Department would have to spend a great deal of time examining the applications; the licensees would also have to spend a very considerable time going into details and furnishing returns, in which they could probably more profitably be employed in looking after their business.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about the maximum price at which cement will be sold.  I should like to ask him if he proposes to market the cement through the ordinary channels, or if he proposes more or less to short-cut that arrangement.  I think that as regards the 100 men that Deputy Corish hopes will be employed in Drinagh&mdash;he said there were 60 employed there formerly; it is only an approximate figure, but it will do for the purpose of illustration&mdash;in the production <Col N="616" /> of the cement, if the ordinary channels are to be short-circuited you may find that you have displaced as many men on the quays of the port.  It may be a question of taking something out of one pocket and putting it into another.  Employment will not have benefited, and the cost of cement will be enormously increased to the people who use it.  The question of the distribution of cement will be a very difficult one, and I am sure the Minister will give some more information as to how he proposes to do this under the present scheme and from economic units.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKeogh" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to associate myself with what Deputy Corish has stated on this matter of the cement industry. I do not wish to go into the niceties of the question of distribution or anything like that.  I do not consider that I am sufficiently competent to enter on that side of the question, but I should like for a brief moment to urge on the Minister if he possibly can to include Drinagh in any scheme he has at the back of his mind for the production and distribution of cement. We have in Drinagh an old-established industry, with a tradition behind it, with plenty of raw material, both in labour and natural resources.  We have not there to establish a new industry of any kind; we have an old one waiting to be developed.  There was one remark made by Deputy Corish to which I take slight exception, namely, his remark with regard to the election promises made by Fianna Fáil supporters in the recent campaign.  We know that remarks made in this House very often are not to be taken seriously.  Neither, I suggest, are election promises to be taken seriously or in their entirety when made by any and every possible supporter of a Party.  I never heard any reputable supporter of Fianna Fáil in the last campaign&mdash;and I know and little about it because I went through it&mdash;state that Fianna Fáil would open the Drinagh cement works in two or three months after the establishment of the new Government.  I hesitate to think that any reputable politician, if, indeed, any reputable politician be left, would hazard his reputation in a prophecy of that kind.</P>

Deputy McGilligan, who, I am sorry to say, is not here now, because he adds considerably to the gaiety of nations by his contributions to debates, said in a somewhat exasperated aside in which he interrupted Deputy Corish&mdash;&ldquo;Do you assume that Drinagh will get any consideration?&rdquo;  I do not know what authority Deputy McGilligan has for assuming that Drinagh will not get consideration.  Probably Deputy McGilligan's assumption that it will not get consideration will prove as baseless as some other assumptions to which he has given expression in this House on other occasions.  I do not wish to take up the time of the House further, but I would suggest that the Minister, in formulating any scheme for the production and distribution of cement, should bear in mind the south-eastern area.  By doing so he will confer a benefit on that industry and allied industries down there.  As I have said, we have an old established industry there.  It is not new in any sense of the word.  You have the raw material both in the men and in the lime, which is the basic foundation of cement.  I hope the Minister will see his way, if possible, to include Drinagh in his scheme.  As far as distribution is concerned, difficulties are made very often only to be surmounted, and I am sure the Minister will surmount that difficulty as he surmounted others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his opening speech, said that cement could not be produced here as cheaply as imported cement, and I thoroughly believe him in that.  For years we have been thinking about manufacturing cement in County Dublin, but after expert, long and careful consideration we discovered that cement could not be manufactured as cheaply in Ireland as in Belgium or Portland.  It required a protection of 6/- per ton.  Taking it that our total requirements would be 200,000 tons, the increase of 6/- per ton over the imported article would amount to £60,000.  For argument sake, let us <Col N="618" /> say that in the three units there will be 300 workers employed, and allowing for a wage of £3 each per week, their total wages will amount to £45,000. That will leave a deficit of £15,000 to be made up by the people who buy cement.  It is for us to consider whether that is a business proposition. These are the only remarks I have to make, but I should like to face facts. Cement is being sold here to-day at about 30/- per ton.  I have an idea that it cannot be produced in Ireland less than 36/- per ton.  I say the builder and the purchaser of cement will have to pay that 6/- extra per ton.  Certainly I agree that we should start industries to give employment, but can we do it at such a loss to the taxpayer and the people in general, who have to purchase the article we produce?  That is the point I would like the Minister to consider in connection with this Bill.</P>

      <P>I was interested in hearing what the Minister had to say on this Bill this afternoon.  I am always interested to hear of new manufactures in this State as one interested in building and in the industries of the State generally, but the primary consideration in setting up a business is to see that the figures are satisfactory.  The Minister was exceedingly shy this afternoon about giving any figures on which we might form any very reliable estimate.  I do not like to criticise the Minister too harshly.  He has been an exceedingly busy man lately, but I think, with all respect to his Department, it was due from the Department to advise the Minister of the effect which this increase in the cost of cement will have on building.  I need not tell the Minister&mdash;he has the information before him&mdash;that 90 out of every 100 houses erected in the State at the moment are built of cement.  Cement is the basic commodity used in building at the moment.  Knowing the urgency of the housing problem, it is very essential that we should know before we proceed with this measure what the effect of it will be on housing.  In every quarter of this State there is an urgent call for more and more houses.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is a very innocent man in his own estimation.  At all events I think it is only due to the House, in view of the importance and the urgency of building, that we should know the effect of this Bill on the building of houses.  I hope before this Bill advances through its other stages, that that information will be forthcoming because it is exceedingly important and, as I have said, exceedingly vital.  I need not remind the Minister also that every effort is made by the Department of Local Government to keep down the cost of houses to the lowest possible figure.  We hear widespread complaints, not alone from workers in the city occupying these houses but from every corner of the country, as to the high cost and the high rent of the houses that these poor people have to occupy.  This Bill will penalise all these people.  They will have to pay additional rents for their houses because, as the Minister has admitted to-day, this is going to increase the cost of building.  Let there be no doubt about it.  Everything that increases the cost of building is certain to inflate the rents which the tenants of those houses will have to pay for them.  That will be quite clear even to the Deputy who comes here from the Dublin Corporation&mdash;Deputy Kelly.  I think he will agree with me on that and I say that that is a point on which the Minister ought to have data and information for the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving that aside for the moment&mdash; that information, I take it, will be forthcoming and, when it is, we will be able to deal with it&mdash;let us deal with another aspect of the problem.  We are anxious to set up industries in this <Col N="620" /> State in order to give much needed employment.  That is the object of setting up additional industries and, looking at it from that point of view, let us take one or two figures from the Minister's statement.  He has told us that in each of these factories there will be between 400 and 500 men employed and that they will be practically all nationals.  There will be two of these factories and that means that 1,000 men will get employment.  The output of these two factories, the Minister estimates, will be 200,000 tons a year.  He does not tell us exactly what the increased cost of the cement is going to be when manufactured at home.  I have heard various estimates as to the increased cost when those markets are closed which supply cement to this State at a very low figure at the moment, but the estimate that is generally accepted by the trade is that the immediate effect of manufacturing cement at home will be that the cement will cost £1 per ton additional.  I think anybody who has inquired into the problem will agree that that is not an excessive figure.  It is not my figure. The figure has been given to me.  If we take 200,000 tons, which is the Minister's figure, and take the fact that cement is going to cost us £1 per ton additional when manufactured at home, it means that the State is going to pay £200,000 per annum additional.</P>
    <P>In other words, that is going to be shoved on to whatever cement is used for, and on to housing in particular. Going a little further, the Minister tells us that 1,000 employees will get employment.  That means that every employee in these two cement works is going to cost the State £200 a year.  That is on the basis of giving employment to 1,000 people, but my advice is that 600 people is the outside number that will get employment in these factories and, taking that figure, and the £200,000 a year cost to the State, each man will cost the State £333 per annum.  That is the Minister's proposal.  We are going to get employment for 600 additional men but at what cost?&mdash;£333 per man.  The housing industry, which is in such need of every stimulus that can be given to it at the moment and in need of every <Col N="621" /> economy that can be devised in order to keep down the costs of housing and, thereby, keep down the rents which these people are called on to pay, uses 90 per cent., I am quite satisfied, of the cement that is imported into this State at the moment, so that housing is going to be called on to pay 90 per cent. of this £200,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I do not want to exaggerate the figures.  I only want to take the figures as they appear to me as a business man and, if any Deputy was in my position, he would take these figures in this way and examine them.  I say to any of you practical business men, is this a business proposition?  No man in this Dáil, I can say, sincerely and honestly, is more anxious than I am to establish industries in this State but we must count the cost, and, having counted the cost, is this House satisfied that this proposal is worth the cost? Is it fair, at the moment, to impose on these people, who are anxious to get these houses and in urgent need of houses, a further burden of £200,000 a year?  I say, no, and I want to see something, in view of these figures and in view of these facts, that I cannot see in this Bill before I will vote for it.  There are other factors in the Bill which one would like to discuss but, until I am satisfied by somebody that these figures I have given to the House are inaccurate, misleading and cannot be substantiated, I will leave it at that and deal with the other part of the subject later.</P>

      <P>The penitential season is now over.  I sat here during Lent and accepted all the speeches that were made from the opposite benches, and from the Centre Party Benches in the most penitential spirit, because there was no fast, and I thought we might as well do something for the good of our souls.  That season is over now, and I am not content to sit here and listen every day in the week to a series of speeches directed towards the one thing&mdash;that nothing good can come from these benches.  Everything produced by the Government meets with the same treatment, and I do not know, if I were a Minister, what Bill I should introduce to please the Deputies <Col N="622" /> opposite except a Bill to establish a wax-works, because they might all believe that they would be modelled for the purpose of exhibition.</P>
      <P>Deputy Good, as well as being a fine type of citizen, if he will allow me to say so, is a practical man in the building line, and, when I asked him if the cement house was a good house, he did not give a very satisfactory reply.  He went on to say that this Bill will increase the rents that have to be paid by the poor people in Dublin and in other towns who are waiting anxiously for increased housing accommodation.  We learn from Deputy Corish that the Dublin Corporation supported the Wexford Cement Works for many years.  I well remember&mdash;it must be over twenty-five years ago&mdash; when, under the influence of the Sinn Féin teaching when it had early got itself established in the Dublin Corporation, we were able to give orders then to the cement works in Wexford in order to keep out Belgian cement that we knew was subsidised by the Belgian Government and could, therefore, be easily brought into this country much cheaper than it could be made here.  The Dublin Corporation succeeded in supporting that enterprise, and now we learn here to-night that when the Commissioners were appointed instead of the Corporation they refused to support it, as a result of which the works had to close down.</P>

      <P>Very well, he should have first-hand knowledge then.  What happened in this matter was that the Commissioners decided that they would make a great name for themselves, and they ripped up the pavements&mdash;the Deputy need not shake his head at me, or if he has to shake it he need not shake it so solemnly&mdash;they decided that they would make a great name for themselves by altering the appearance of Dublin, and they ripped up all the well-paved streets of Dublin and re-paved them&mdash;if I can use the term&mdash; with foreign cement.  That was what they did on Dublin, and it was dear old dirty Dublin no longer!  It was clean, lovely Dublin!  Look at the lovely streets!  Look at the beautiful roads! All these roads were made with foreign cement and that was the effect&mdash;that they deliberately closed down the Wexford works to give work to the foreigner.  Is that to their credit? When they established themselves well, they started their building career in this way, that all the houses built for the poor people should be bought by them, and consequently the rent was too excessive.  Working men are now asked to pay from 14/1 to 17/6 a week. How can they do it?  I understand that most of these houses are made of foreign cement also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation is restored now, but with nothing like its full powers.  They will come later on, and I hope everybody listening to me will take notice of that.  Somebody has interrupted me, but I did not catch the interruption.  Maybe it does not matter.  The Dublin Corporation have in front of them a very elaborate housing programme, and they have already built many houses&mdash;Deputy Good will know that&mdash;they have built 700 houses in Cabra, and they are letting these houses, each of which is a three-roomed house with both hot and cold water and every accommodation necessary for a decent workingman's home, at 7/6 a week. That is a big difference.  But we would rather see these houses built with home cement than with foreign stuff, and I think that is the practical way to turn our attention not <Col N="624" /> only for the provision of houses, but for the creation of employment in this country.</P>

But it must be remembered that the figures taken into account are figures including the repayment of capital and interest on the loans.  If these were deducted out of the estimates it would be found that there would be a profit to the ratepayers of Dublin.  We, in the Dublin Corporation, did not have and Civic Week.

      <P>I think they are.  I would prefer to see brick houses, but I am told by those who say they know a lot about it that the cement houses are good enough.  The idea of advertising Dublin at that time three years ago by Civic Week, with gondolas on the Liffey and King Brian Boru's bird cage on O'Connell Bridge, was all eye-wash, because the main concern of the Dublin citizens was to secure decent houses for the inhabitants of Dublin.</P>
      <P>That is why I am so anxious that this Bill will be accepted by the members here generally who are interested in social questions.  Deputy Good undoubtedly is interested in social questions.

But the Deputy could easily give us more information regarding building operations and cement than any man in this Chamber or than any man outside it.  Instead of doing so, he reads out an alarming set of figures as to what it will cost and so on, when he could say &ldquo;these houses, which will be built with the products of these factories that the Minister proposes to erect, will be good houses, will be built cheaply, will give satisfaction to the Corporation and every other body in Ireland which can start building them, and will be satisfactory right through.&rdquo; Could the Deputy not have said that?</P>

It was given to me a long time ago by a very able Dublin physician. He was not diagnosing any complaint that I had at the time, but he took an interest in my welfare generally, and <Col N="626" /> he said to me &ldquo;Never tell a lie, but only tell the truth sometimes.&rdquo;  Deputy Good should only just remember that maxim in his future speeches and it will do.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan, in the course of his remarks, expressed the opinion that all mankind outside the membership of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party is mad, and that the madness of mankind outside the Cumann na nGaedheal Party was the sole explanation of the various measures adopted in other countries and in this country for the purpose of ensuring the production nationally of goods which may be purchased cheaper abroad.  It is good to know, however, that there is an oasis of sanity in the desert of lunacy and that it is situated in this country.  It may be that all mankind is mad except the members of Cumann na nGaedheal, or the reverse may be true.  I want, however, to put forward for the consideration of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party certain considerations which they appear to have left out of account.  At first sight it does seem extraordinary that we should propose to put a restriction on the importation of cement here when it is being supplied to us from abroad at a price less than it costs to produce it, at a price probably less than we could ever produce it for ourselves. Those who read trading and shipping statistics with an accountant's mind, dividing the quantities shown into the total cost set out, getting an average price, and basing all their arguments upon that average price will, of course, be forced to the same conclusion as Deputy McGilligan, that it is foolish and mad to attempt to produce here what we can get more cheaply <Col N="627" /> from abroad.  I submit, however, that in any proper system of national accountancy we must add to the price that we pay for the imported produce the cost of maintaining in idleness the people who might have been employed here in its production, and, in addition, the loss of national wealth that is occasioned by the fact that the goods imported must be paid for in any case and that the wealth that goes out to pay for them is wealth lost to the country, whereas expenditure incurred in production here is of perpetual benefit to the country and constitutes wealth retained at home.  If we follow Deputy McGilligan's argument to its logical conclusion, it gets us to a much madder position than he ever contemplated, because if there is any sense in his logic when applied to cement there must also be sense in it when applied to any other commodity.  If it is foolish for us to produce cement because other people are prepared to supply it to us cheaper than we can make it for ourselves, why should we also be trying to produce beef, butter, milk, eggs, clothing, boots, or anything else?  There is not a single commodity which under modern conditions we cannot get supplied from abroad cheaper than we can produce it for ourselves.  Applying the Deputy's logic, our sole concern should be to produce nothing, to sit here in absolute idleness waiting for these other countries, seeking markets for their surplus products, to supply us for cash or credit with the things we need and, in due course, there will exist here what members of Cumann na nGaedheal would apparently regard as the ideal situation, in which nothing was produced and everything was imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, however, decided upon a different policy.  We have decided to secure the production here of everything which can be reasonably produced, having regard to the facilities available, the size of our market, and the raw materials we possess, and cement is one of these things.  All this talk we have had about the price of cement is based upon misunderstandings and miscalculations <Col N="628" /> of several kinds.  Cement can be produced in this country as cheaply as in any other country.  There is no reason why it should not be.  As I have said, we have the raw materials in abundance. We have the raw materials situated in the most suitable places and under the most suitable circumstances. Factories for the production of cement are being established every week of the year in some part of the world as economic propositions of a size less than the size that would be required to supply the whole of the requirements of this State.  Therefore, our market is one large enough to justify production on an economic basis.  I assume, however, that we cannot produce cement at less than we can buy it at the moment.  That is because cement is being sold in this country, owing to competition for the market here, at a price about equal to half the price charged to persons using it in the country of origin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good made a number of mysterious calculations.  They sounded very impressive but were all based upon something that somebody said to him.  Somebody told him that cement produced here would probably be £1 per ton dearer than cement is at present.  On that statement he built up his whole case.  He multiplied the £1 by 200,000, substracted something from it, divided something into it, took his first thoughts away from it, and in that way told us that the whole scheme would cost anything from £200,000 to £330,000 additional every year.  But the whole argument was based upon something somebody told him, to wit, that cement produced here was going to be £1 per ton dearer than it is at present.  It is going to be nothing of the kind.  The Deputy will be glad to hear that within the last six months I have had in my office representatives of every important cement manufacturing company in Europe and not one of them suggested cement was going to be £1 per ton dearer than we are getting it at present.  They all gave different estimates. One of them, by no means the least important of them, expressed the opinion, and put the opinion in writing, that cement can be produced and <Col N="629" /> sold ex-factory here at a price somewhat less than the 30/- per ton mentioned by Deputy O'Connor.  They may be wrong in that, but I am assuming that the increase, if any, which must take place in the price of cement consequent upon the commencement of production here will not be more than will effect an increase of 5 per cent. in the price of a cement house.  It may be less; it may be there will be no increase at all.  Let us hope so.  I think there is some reason to assume that that is so.  Our proposal is that anybody who wants to make cement in this country shall put before us a proposition in detail, including in it the guaranteed price, whether it is the ex-factory or the delivered price, at which he is prepared to make cement available.  From amongst the various proposals we will select one that appears to be in closest accord with the economic interests of the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to location, I knew that this debate would not end without some reference to Drinagh.  At one moment I thought I would be facing the appalling prospect that we would hear about every place in the country where cement might be manufactured. The fact is that there is practically no place in this country where the facilities necessary for the establishment of a cement works do not exist. The country is practically built on limestone and that is the main raw material required in the production of cement.  Leaving transport facilities or other advantages out of account, there is practically no town or village in the Free State that could not make out a case for the establishment of a cement works, and I am quite certain they all will.</P>
    <P>I am, however, protected.  I am protected in the sense that they do not have to make out the case to me and that is one rather fortunate consideration. We have had to hear various cases made out concerning the establishment of beet works.  In such cases we are faced with the position that we may have to make unpopular decisions in the matter of selecting sites, knowing well that we can <Col N="630" /> please only a much smaller number than we can offend.  In the case of cement I will not be called upon to make any such decision.  Any group that thinks it can manufacture cement can make a proposition to my Department and indicate the price at which they propose to sell it.  Our regard must be merely to ensure not that cement will be produced in a particular place, but that it will be produced under the circumstances and at the price that will be most favourable to the country.</P>
    <P>The situation in Drinagh is well known and the only advice I have to give to Deputy Corish in that connection is advice that I think he probably does not need&mdash;that is, not to believe everything that is told him by the Cement Marketing Company.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell suggested that it was not impossible that the number of men who would be employed in the production of cement here would be less than the number at present engaged on the distribution of imported cement.  I think the Deputy has left one very obvious consideration out of account.  The points of production are going to be very much fewer in number than the points of importation are at the moment.  At present cement is imported through a very large number of ports and harbours in the Saorstát.  The points of production will be two, three, or perhaps four.  The difference between the number of points of production and the present points of importation means that there will be more distributing to be done, and if there is to be more distributing more men will be employed in distribution.  These men may be employed in the future on railways or on cartage work rather than on dockyard work, but it is reasonable to assume that employment is not going to diminish but will inevitably increase if the same quantity of cement has to be distributed from a fewer number of centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended that cement should be marketed in the same way as it is marketed at present.  Very probably the price that will be regarded as the <Col N="631" /> maximum guaranteed price will be an ex-factory price.  It may be in certain cases companies will prefer the guaranteed price f.o.r., or delivered.  I will act on the assumption that there will be a guaranteed ex-factory price and that transport costs will be additional to it.  The ex-factory price will be, of course, lower than the delivered price.  In that eventuality the business of distributing cement or supplying builders with cement will proceed as at present.  The same firms will engage in the work in the future.  The only difference will be that they will get deliveries ex-factory or at a railway station instead of at a port.  It is not impossible that they will get deliveries at a port, because in recent years it has become the practice to deliver cement by sea rather than by rail. Whether that will be adopted here, I cannot say.</P>
    <P>I have been asked about the nature of the guaranteed price that we have in mind.  The price of cement must, of course, fluctuate in accordance with the ordinary fluctuations in the costs of certain other commodities.  The three main things that have to be taken into account in fixing the cost of production of cement are labour, electric power and coal.  When we talk about a guaranteed price we mean a price which is fixed on the assumption that the average level of wages will be at one figure, the average cost of electricity will be at another figure and the average cost of coal will be at a third figure.  That guaranteed price will be liable to be increased or decreased as variations take place in any of these three costs.  We will be in a position to know what variation in the rate of pay or the average cost of a unit of electricity or a ton of coal will justify an increase or a decrease in the price of a ton of cement. There will be no difficulty in fixing a sliding scale.  The essential thing will be that before the price can be altered the State Department concerned will have to be satisfied that the conditions which justify the alteration in price have actually been created.  That safeguard must necessarily be imposed because of the semi-monopoly <Col N="632" /> position which is being created and under which the factories will operate.</P>
    <P>I will repeat, in conclusion, that I propose to proceed on the assumption that this Bill, when it has got a Second Reading, will become law without substantial change.  I may be wrong in that assumption, but I propose to act upon it for the purpose of ensuring that if it should become law there need be no unnecessary delay in getting the production of cement undertaken here. In other words, any firm that is contemplating making application for a licence under the Bill when it becomes law can take the necessary preliminary steps forthwith and bring their proposals to the attention of my Department so that they can be examined there.</P>
    <P>I contemplate being in a position almost immediately the Bill becomes law to decide to whom licences are to be issued and to have them issued with the intention of having the first sod cut within three months of the passage of the Bill and production undertaken here before the end of next year.  That may not be the usual procedure but I think I am justified in following it having regard to the fact that if the Bill does not become law licences cannot be issued. We can get the preliminary work of the examination done even though we cannot give effect to our decisions until the Bill has passed its Final Stage.  I hope to have it put through, however, in order that we can deliver to builders Irish-made cement produced in consequence of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For two reasons or I should really say for three reasons. One is that it is necessary to ensure that abnormal imports of cement do not take place immediately prior to the coming into production of the new cement factories.  We do not want a position to be created in which the person erecting the factory would find the market flooded.  That would create a position in which he would not be able to carry on production for perhaps six or 12 months following.  That is one consideration.  The other is the fact that the price of cement is uncertain and irregular at the moment and in consequence of that we want a stabilised price position as early as possible and to secure for the revenue whatever advantages can be secured for it arising out of these efforts to stabilise prices.  That will be a gradual process so that nobody can contemplate an immediate imposition of any heavy tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme for the licensing of cement imports is an essential part of the whole scheme because it is conceivable that we might have one unit producing much earlier than another unit.  We might find one unit able to supply a part of the country but unable to supply other parts of the country. The licences would secure that cement could be imported into some ports but not into other ports.  That would be for the purpose of keeping up the supplies for the whole country.  I was talking some time ago about applications which we would have to examine on the basis of having licences issued when the Bill becomes law for the manufacture of cement.  Parliamentary <Col N="634" /> procedure requires a resolution to be moved before the Committee Stage which may have certain reactions on that position.  Even if that were the case we would only bring new conditions into operation very gradually so as to have the least possible dislocation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The licences to which I refer are licences for the import of cement.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it will not be necessary to issue these licences until the factory is practically completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister that it will take 18 months to build the factory?  Now when the factory is completed it will have to go through the experimental stages.  You cannot commence delivery at once. The cement must be tested so as to have an accurate knowledge of its quality.  That was one of the difficulties always in the past but it does not arise in the case of the cement the quality of which is known.  Any licensing for the importing of cement will mean, as I understand the Minister's proposition, that the State is going to benefit by means of the import duty on these licences.  Will the Minister tell me who is going to pay that import duty?  I want to say that 90 per cent of the cement is going into housing.  That import duty is going to mean extra cost in the building of houses and that cost will have to be paid ultimately by the unfortunate tenant.  The State is going to benefit by that expense on the tenant.  Is not that so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <P>(2)  the measures requisite to promote the production of pigs of the quality and in numbers calculated to ensure the maintenance of output at a point which will supply, constantly, the demand of the home market and provide for the requirements of the export trade while giving a steady economic return to producers of pigs and those engaged in the handling of pig meats and other pig products;</P>

    <P>(a)  encourage the production of pigs of suitable and uniform type and quality for the bacon and pork trades.</P>
    <P>(b)  facilitate and regulate in the most efficient manner the marketing of pigs intended for <Col N="639" /> home consumption, or for export,</P>
    <P>(c)  ensure the economic production of bacon and other manufactured pig products of a quality suited to the needs of the home and export markets,</P>
    <P>(d) regulate hygienically the conditions under which pig husbandry is carried on and the veterinary inspection ante and post mortem of pigs slaughtered for the home and export bacon and pork trades;</P>
    <P>(5) the manner in which the exports of live pigs, bacon and pork should be controlled in view of the measures which have been or may be adopted for regulating quantitatively supplies of these commodities on extern markets;</P>
    <P>(6)  any matter which, in the opinion of the tribunal, affects the welfare of the pig and bacon industry;</P>
    <P>(7) the administrative machinery necessary to give effect to the tribunal's recommendations.</P>
    <P>This resolution is introduced for the purpose of setting up a tribunal to examine into the whole pig and bacon industry.  For the last nine months, we have had frequent discussions with those interested in the pig industry&mdash; curers, wholesalers and producers. All those interested in the industry feel that something should be done to improve matters with regard, particularly, to stabilisation of prices.  These discussions have gone on for a long time and a number of suggestions have been put up to deal with the problem. The difficulty is to get a competent body to examine these different suggestions and to find out what are the implications and what are the advantages and disadvantages likely to arise from adopting any one of them.  It is quite obvious that in a complicated matter of this kind the Minister himself would not be a judge. The Department officials also feel that before any conclusion could be come to additional information would be necessary from those concerned&mdash; curers, wholesalers, retailers, producers and others.  The only way in <Col N="640" /> which that information can be got is by means of a tribunal set up in this way.  This tribunal could have the same status as say the Tariff Commission, and would be in the position of sending for witnesses and compelling them, if necessary, to produce documents.  Owing to low world prices for some time the difficulties of the pig producer have been very serious. Unless we can get a reasonable price for the producer we cannot hope to have a steady supply of bacon on the market.  As Deputies are aware there are various outlets for pigs in this country, the biggest outlet, of course, both now and for some time, being the home market.  That is to say, we have consumed at home at any rate for the last five or six years, practically two-thirds of our total output.  We have then an outlet for bacon, pork, and live pigs without dealing with the question of bacon, which requires a great deal of minute examination of details, to find out what would be the effect of dealing with bacon, in a certain way, on the fresh pork market, and on the export of live pigs, as well as on the home prices of bacon.  If by any chance the quota system comes in on foreign markets&mdash; and it has come on many foreign markets&mdash;and if it should come on the British market amongst others, possibly we would be limited in the amount of bacon that could be exported.  The question then arises whether we could get rid of our live pigs without putting them through the process of bacon, or get rid of them in the form of pork.  Taking the difficulties that arise and everything into consideration, schemes that have appeared good to me might not on minute examination turn out to be the best for the producers.  I have come to the conclusion that the only way to deal properly with the matter is to set up a statutory tribunal that can examine witnesses, and call for the necessary evidence, in order to have everything sifted out.  The tribunal now being set up will of course report and the report will be examined by the Department of Agriculture and the Minister and eventually I suppose by the Government.  If they think well <Col N="641" /> the proposals will probably at that stage be laid before the Dáil for its consideration, In appointing this tribunal we are not committed to any policy in the matter whatsoever.  The only thing we are asking the leave of the Dáil and the Seanad for is the tribunal to be set up to examine the question.  As soon as it is examined and the report presented it is then for the Government to make up their mind what action will be taken.  I do not think we have power at present to deal with it in an adequate way.  The only power we have is to pay bounties and things like that.  If the question has to be dealt with in a big way we shall have of course to come back to the Dáil again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion as tabled states:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for the purpose of enquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I should ask in reference to this motion where is the urgency?  The conditions which the Minister tried to emphasise have been with us for a length of time, and there is at this moment no more urgency than existed for the motion at any time during the last 12 or 15 months, if it is necessary at all.  To most of us, interested mainly in agriculture, this motion is absolutely unnecessary. Practically every section of it could be provided for very easily in a very simple manner and by a very obvious course.  The great hamper to this industry is as it is to other branches of the agricultural industry that at the moment you have practically the only export market closed.  If that market is restored to its original extent the difficulties that the Minister hopes to lessen by the motion will be provided for&mdash;perhaps not all, but practically all. If there is any urgency for any motion in regard to the pig industry or in regard to any other branch of the agricultural industry, the urgency lies in a settlement of the economic dispute, as far as it appertains to agriculture, and it appertains mainly to agriculture. Speaking in this House a few nights ago the Minister said that he was <Col N="642" /> about to sell some pigs and that he expected to make a profit.  I hope he did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give particulars of the items of the profit&mdash;not the profit on a temporary lot of pigs, but items showing his activities in the pig industry for the past 12 months&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the full facts and figures of all sales and purchases of pigs.  If the Minister can satisfy himself and satisfy the House and, above all, if he can satisfy the ordinary farmers that, on the whole, there was a profit from pigs during the last eight or nine months and that there is a prospect of a continuing profit then any motion such as this will be unnecessary to persuade farmers to develop the pig industry or encourage them to go in for extra production.  The Minister stated that something might be done to stabilise prices.  Again I suggest that the first &ldquo;something&rdquo; that might be done in that respect would be to give us some hope of a return of a free market as far as the export portion of our pig trade is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that he could not be a judge in such a complicated matter as this.  The Minister, who has himself declared that he can make a profit out of pigs, is incompetent to be a judge in relation to this matter. His officials apparently are incompetent to be judges in this matter.  Are we to be told that the Department of Agriculture has not amongst its officials some particular official, able and intelligent enough, and with experience enough to advise the farmers as to what particular breed of pigs would be suitable in particular districts, and as to the various other manipulations in this industry?  It is suggested that the only remedy is to set up a commission. It is not said whether the members of the commission are to be paid or unpaid.  Is it to be a paid commission? Are the members of the commission to be paid?  I get no answer to that question.  If they are to be paid I say <Col N="643" /> it is extraordinarily unjust to inflict a fresh burden which is wholly unnecessary upon the community.  I hope the contemplated tribunal is to be an unpaid tribunal, at any rate if the members are to be unpaid we will be saved the additional amount of extra expense of what I might call this very ill-advised proposal.  But even if they are to be volunteers this commission still is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>We are told in this motion that the present position in pig production in Saorstát Eireann and of the industries and trades dealing with live pigs and other pig products is to be inquired into.  The tribunal is to go into all that.  Is there no official of the Department who could make these inquiries?  I could name several who would be quite competent to offer the Minister some information upon these points.  In paragraph (2) we are told that they are to inquire into the measures requisite to promote the production of pigs of the quality and the numbers calculated to ensure the maintenance of output and provide for the requirements of the export trade. They are to provide for the requirements of an export trade which, at the moment, the Ministry itself are doing their very best to extinguish.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows what the course is.  They are to inquire into measures in connection with the export trade that will give a steady economic return to the producers of pigs.  Was there ever such a quip or such a piece of nonsense talked considering the present situation? Coming to item (3) we are told that they are to inquire into proposals for the reorganisation of the pig-raising and bacon-curing industry.  They are <Col N="644" /> to reorganise the bacon industry.  They are going to tell the people engaged in this business all their lives how they are to run it.  They are to inquire under (4) into the measures which, having regard to the national interests, should be taken to (a) encourage the production of pigs of suitable and uniform type.  We get great encouragement, no doubt, to increase the production of pigs.  Every farmer north, south, east and west knows the encouragement he has received for the production of pigs.  Are we to have a tribunal to advise the Ministry to continue this business?  They are to facilitate and regulate in the most efficient manner the marketing of pigs intended for home consumption or for export; to ensure the economic production of bacon and other manufactured pig products of a quality suited to the need of the home and export market.  I am not assuming, and I do not think that the Minister has assumed, that the reputable bacon manufacturers in this country have not all these considerations in view or that they are not making the necessary attempts to provide the quality of bacon suitable for home and export consumption.  It ought to be within the knowledge of the Minister and apparent to his intelligence that the bacon factories in this country have put upon the British market the highest quality of bacon of any country, yet it is to be open to this tribunal to tell the bacon factors in Limerick, Waterford and other places how to produce bacon.  They are to regulate hygienically the conditions under which pig husbandry is to be carried on and the veterinary inspection ante and post mortem of pigs slaughtered for the home and export bacon trades.  We are to have some sort of persons perambulating into the farmers' byres to see the conditions of the pigs, the way they are fed and housed, how warm they are in winter and how cold in summer, and, eventually, the manner in which they are driven to market and finally killed. There is a provision in a recent Act that provides that nothing but good meat shall be sold for consumption, and I think that is as far as we can go.</P>

      <P>The Minister said this evening that the greater part of the bacon manufactured in this country during the last ten years, I think, was consumed in the country.  I should be very much obliged to the Minister if, in winding up the debate, he would be able to furnish us with the figures, say for the last five years, of bacon production and Irish bacon consumption within the country.  I should be very glad to know from the Minister what proportion of the pigs raised in this country were consumed in this country. I listened attentively to the Minister when he was introducing this resolution, and I think I do him no substantial injustice when I say that the only pretence at justification for this resolution was his own ignorance and the danger of Great Britain introducing the quota system.  A few weeks' patient study could correct the first shortcoming. Surely the Minister will welcome the second as a mark of our Republican sovereignty.  It will proclaim before the world, and in the ears of the patriotic pig farmers of this country, that at last we have gained a true Republican status; that our pigs are going to be dealt with as Danish pigs are dealt with; that our agricultural industry is going to be no longer humiliated by being allowed to operate freely in the British market; that it will in future go forth with the quota badge on its back, as a real independent Republican industry that does not bow the knee to anybody.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that we leave the jocularity of the Fianna Fáil Party on one side for a moment, and deal with the somewhat tragic facts that this Bill reveals.  The first term of reference for this commission will be to investigate &ldquo;the present position of pig production in Saorstát Eireann and of the industries and trades dealing with live pigs, pig meat, whether fresh or cured, and other pig products.&rdquo; Does not the veriest fool in any district in the country know what the present position of the pig industry is?  Does not the veriest fool know the reason for the condition in which the pig industry is?  The pig industry is in a catastrophic condition. It is practically wiped out. Now I suggested that Fianna Fáil drops its facetious tone in regard to this matter.  There is nothing funny about it.  Those who are not hurt by this can afford to laugh, but those whose livelihoods are being taken away by it cannot.  The pig industry in this country is reduced to the condition in which we at present find it because we are embroiled in an economic war, because the market for our surplus of pig products is virtually closed against us by a heavy tariff.</P>
      <P>The second term of reference reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The measures requisite to promote the production of pigs of the quality and in numbers calculated to ensure the maintenance of output at a point which will supply, constantly, the demand of the home market and provide for the requirements of the export trade while giving a steady economic return to producers of pigs and those engaged in the handling of pig meats and other pig products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That paragraph has very little meaning, but such meaning as it has is vitiated by folly, because anyone who knows or understands the elements of the trade must realise that the moment we have a surplus production&mdash;a <Col N="650" /> production over and above our domestic requirements&mdash;we are dependent on the foreign markets for the prices that will rule right through the pig production of the country.  It does not matter what commission is set up here or what restrictions you put in force.  The moment you put that surplus on the markets of the world you have got this problem of competition in whatever market you are seeking to go into.  All you can hope to do, all any sensible man will try to do, is to get as wide a foreign market for his surplus products as he possibly can and make concessions, economic concessions, to get other concessions, just as Denmark is doing, just as Holland is doing, just as every other sensible country in the world is trying to do in order to secure that the highest possible level of prices will be maintained in the foreign market for its surplus.  That is the only way, the only effective way, to keep up the price in the home market.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (3) provides that the President of the Executive Council shall be brought into the discussion and shall be vouchsafed an opportunity of passing judgment on what is expedient for promoting the interests of the pig industry of this country.  President de Valera has many virtues and great distinction, but I have yet to see him in face of a pig or a flitch of bacon, and if I heard him giving an opinion on either I cannot pretend that his opinion would enjoy any measure of my respect.</P>

The <Col N="651" /> feeble jesters of the patriotic Party, the buffoons of the Party of integrity in Ireland, are produced for the purpose of raising a laugh, and the reason they want to raise a laugh is because they want to forget facts.

      <P>We shall be charged with stabbing Caitlin Ni Houlihan in the back, putting obstacles in the way of our patriotic President, who is trying to restore prosperity to our downtrodden people.  No matter what attitude is being taken up in regard to this matter, unless it be one of unqualified admiration, these charges will be made.  It is well to anticipate them so that we may recognise them when they arise.  Sub-paragraph (b) provides that the Government is going to inquire into the best methods for facilitating and regulating in the most efficient manner the marketing of pigs intended for home consumption or for export.  I can tell the Government without any inquiry that the best way to facilitate this operation is to get out of the way and to let those who have been doing it and who were doing it successfully until the Government got in the way, go on doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as regulation is concerned, I think the record of Fianna Fáil in the matter of the regulation of industry in this country, whether it be agriculture or any other branch of industry, is quite sufficient to warn the farmers against inviting them to regulate any part of their industry.  The effect of their regulation of the flour industry so <Col N="652" /> far has been to increase the price of flour from 4/- to 5/- per sack.  The effect of their regulation of Indian meal under the Cereals Bill has been to increase the price of Indian meal by 1/- per cwt. for the farmers.  The effect of their operation and control of the cement industry under the Cement Bill will be to raise the price of cement from 20 to 50 per cent. on farmers who use it and on poor people who are waiting for houses and who cannot get them because money is so scarce.  If, after that record, the farmers are thirsting for more regulation at the hands of a benevolent Minister for Industry and Commerce, then the farmers are madder than I took them to be.</P>
    <P>The next is a strangely typical subsection, just what one would expect from a Minister who knows nothing about the pig industry.  He proposes to ensure &ldquo;the economic production of bacon and other manufactured pig products of a quality suited to the needs of the home and export markets.&rdquo;  I leave him to his hopes. He is undertaking to ensure something that wiser men than he never attempted to guarantee.</P>
    <P>Any man who attempts to make such a guarantee shows by the attempt his incapacity.  Sub-paragraph (d), however, is the jewel of this motion.  It is really delicious&mdash;&ldquo;To regulate hygienically the conditions under which pig husbandry is to be carried on&rdquo;.  One can picture the drawing-rooms and the boudoirs and the beauty parlours that will be provided for the pigs.</P>

That is the kind of academic, impractical, departmental folly that characterises every commission of this kind&mdash;the impractical, silly desire to meddle in your neighbour's business, to get authority to go poking into your neighbour's backyard and trying into your neighbour's affairs, and the readiness to waste time and public money for the purpose of making unnecessary and oppressive inquiries into the way the ordinary citizen is carrying on his everyday avocation.</P>
      <P>In the latter half of that, the Minister proposes to investigate the veterinary inspection, ante and postmortem, of pigs slaughtered for the home and export bacon and pork trade.  I understood that he had ample powers under the Public Health Acts to require any examination to be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister requires a commission to ascertain whether he should have power to inquire into the question as to whether any given pork is fit for human consumption or not. Surely, if the Minister believes, or if there is any ground for believing or suspecting, that there is any danger whatever of pork or bacon finding its way into the hands of the public in a condition unfit for human consumption, he does not require a commission to tell him that he should seek powers to take precautions against that, or does he require a commission to tell him even that about his job?  Surely the Minister knows something about the duties that ordinarily devolve on a Minister for Agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 deals with this quota that the Minister apprehends.  I have already referred to that but Section 6 is strangely characteristic of many measures that have been introduced into this House by the Fianna Fáil Administration.  We are accustomed to <Col N="654" /> long schedules of things to be regulated, of things to be controlled, of things to be brought within the scope of a particular Bill and, at the end of nearly all these schedules, we find a line &ldquo;And any other matter which the Minister may schedule as coming under the control of this Bill.&rdquo;  With a fine display of desiring to go no further than necessity demands, a schedule is introduced, but a saving clause is put in to allow the Minister to go as far as he wants, once the legislation is passed into law.  True to form, under sub-section (6), having set out on a full page of the Order Paper all the subjects the Minister proposes to deal with, he says that, therefore, he should deal with any matter which, in the opinion of the tribunal, affects the welfare of the pig and bacon industry, so that, in fact, if this commission be set up, it will have power to survey the whole condition of agricultural life in this country, it will have power to investigate, in any way it pleases and to any extent it pleases, the whole business of bacon curing and pork production in this country.  In fact, it may be said that, if this tribunal is set up under these terms of reference, it can sit forever and examine anything.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is perhaps the most dangerous thing of all.  We have established that, under Section 6, there is no limit to the extravagances which this commission may commit.  The scope of its excursions over the whole plane of Irish agricultural life is practically unlimited and, for the purpose of prosecuting whatever regulations it chooses to make, it is going to be authorised to recommend, as necessary to the Minister, any administrative machinery he wants.  Deputy Bennett very relevantly inquired, and the Minister was significantly dumb when he heard the inquiry, whether this is going to be a voluntary commission or whether it is going to be another repository for crocks.  The Minister did not answer that question and I invite him now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Civil servants to advise on pig production!  That is the absolute limit, anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that the Minister has had nothing but the same thing from me.  The Minister said, when introducing this, that the Department's officials are satisfied that additional information is required and that they would want the assistance of the manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of evidence, I said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of evidence.  I beg the Minister's pardon.  I understood that this tribunal was to have on it, as most such tribunals or commissions have, representatives of the various interests with which it is proposed to deal.  The Minister will remember that on the Shops Commission and other similar commissions the various interests going to be affected by the findings of the commission have had representation.  The Minister will excuse us if we fell into the natural error of thinking that the constitution of this tribunal would be similar.  Now the Minister says the members of the tribunal will be civil servants.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to this fact, that if the constitution of this tribunal be what the Minister says it will, it will have power to subpoena witnesses on oath and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are to have this tribunal and, presumably, have on it civil servants of high standing and of wide experience.  I should like to know who is going to do the work of <Col N="656" /> these civil servants while they are engaged for this purpose.  If the task set out in these terms of reference is really to be effectively dealt with&mdash;and if I know the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce, if they are set a job they will do it, and do it well and do it thoroughly according to the terms of reference&mdash; if such men are set a job of this kind, it will take them a very long time to do it and, while engaged on what I can only describe as tomfoolery, somebody else must do their work in their own department.  The same will apply to the officials of the Department of Agriculture.  Certain officials are qualified for special departments of the work, so that while we have the good men wasting their time on this rubbish, comparatively inexperienced men in the Department of Agriculture will be trying to do work which they are not fit to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no such men in our Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that a man is not experienced in his own particular line, but I think it will be admitted that if you take the most experienced man in, say, the egg and poultry division and put him in charge of the cattle division, he cannot deal with cattle problems with the same efficiency as with eggs and poultry. The same would apply to a man in the seeds department, if he is transferred to another department, with which he is comparatively unacquainted.  He cannot do the work with the same efficiency.  No matter how brilliant he may be in his own particular division, he cannot do the work as well as the man experienced in the other division. You have got to take men who will command public confidence as members of your tribunal and that means that other men will have to do their jobs in their own department.  As a consequence, the jobs will not be as well done, but the people will have to pay extra officers to do their jobs as a result of this transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second source of expense is that administrative machinery is going to be set up to carry into effect the proposals of <Col N="657" /> this tribunal.  Who is going to pay for this administrative machinery?  I invite the Government to remember that, at the present time, in the name of national emergency, they have asked this Dáil to reduce the salaries of the great majority of the civil servants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten per cent. of the civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten per cent. of civil servants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>About that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should have said public servants.  We are told that the country has been reduced to such a state of bankruptcy and misery that, if disaster is to be averted, drastic economies must be effected, and the first step we take to effect that is to cut the salaries of public servants, while at the same time, we are being asked to set up a tribunal for the purpose of creating jobs for another host of officials.  Is it not far better to pay the men we have as generous wages as possible instead of lowering their wages, and setting up another host of officials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no new appointment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, not here&mdash; because the Minister would not have the effrontery to tell the Dáil frankly that there was going to be.  Is the administrative machinery in this Bill a traction engine or a tractor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy understands the matter properly.  We are not debating that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the whole object here to create regulations for the hygienic upbringing of young pigs? Section 7 lays down that, in the event of endeavouring to improve the hygiene of young pigs administrative machinery is to be set up to that end.  How are any of the reforms to be carried into effect if there is no administrative machinery to put them into effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may not be any administrative machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite understand <Col N="658" /> that the Minister could not, in conscience, allege that there were at this stage.  He could not possibly make a public gesture of economising by reducing the salaries of public servants and at the same time, like the Minister for Industry and Commerce, create a new host of officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing it every day also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I can well believe it.  But, if the Minister is creating a host of new employees, as he here admits he is doing, it is an admission of which he ought to be ashamed, and there is not a Deputy on those benches that dare come down and admit that to his constituents.  If any of the Deputies on those benches admitted it to his constituents, he would be hunted from his constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenJordan" hpid="Mr. Jordan Mr. Jordan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jordan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not say any such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Minister is hearing the voice of prudence from the back benches.  When the back benchers are going down to Athenry or Clare, or their various constituencies, they will have to face the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister got a better price for his pigs because his policy has brought everybody in the country to such a state that they have no pigs to sell.  He deliberately brought about that condition and then he is able to get a good price for his own pigs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister got that price because he smashed that industry in the hands of his neighbours.  His policy created the scarcity that enabled him to get that price.  Last January they could not get a price and killed and salted their pigs and eat them themselves because they could not afford to go to the shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> I do not wish to delay the House unduly.  I think I have told Fianna Fáil sufficient of the truth.  I have extracted sufficient agonised squeaks from those benches to reassure me that the light is beginning to dawn upon them.  They should tell the Minister for Agriculture now that they will not be a party to creating any more hosts of officials, as the Minister plans doing and intends to do, and they should go to him privately and tell him that he is ruining the agricultural industry of this country and that the best thing to do is to change the policy of the Executive Council and bring back prosperity to the farmers.  If he does that he will do more for the pig industry than any commission can do. If he does that we will not want any commission or any administrative machinery, and we will not have to be cutting public servants' salaries in order to provide salaries for hosts of other public servants whom the Minister proposes to saddle on the country under this motion and under other legislation.</P>
