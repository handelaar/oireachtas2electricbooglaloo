      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether, having regard to the report that when many registered voters presented themselves at various polling stations to claim their votes at the recent General Election they found that they had been impersonated, he will introduce proposals for legislation with a view to devising some means of identification of the voter to be presented to the Presiding Officer when application is made for a ballot paper.</P>

      <P>The question of the steps which might be taken to prevent personation, including the identification of electors, was specifically considered by a Committee appointed for the purpose, and I would refer the Deputy to the report presented to the Oireachtas on the 16th January, 1925.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of matters which I should like to raise on this or on one of the subsequent stages. I think as the Minister escaped last year without having any lengthy discussion on the Estimates, he might be willing to answer now one or two questions with regard to the administration of these Acts.  In the first place, I notice that we are renewing the old Act which was passed ten years ago and which was subsequently amended.  The Army Acts which exist at the present time form a substantial volume which I do not think the Deputies of the Dáil have read very carefully but, looking through them, I am satisfied that a great number of the existing Army Acts are out of date. Of course, ten years ago we had not the <Col N="503" /> benefit of the present Government Party's views in drawing up the Defence Forces Bills and a lot of the existing regulations, both in the Acts themselves and those issued under the Acts, are so much dead matter, having no relation to existing conditions and, perhaps, between now and next year the Minister might set some of his legal and departmental advisers to work to ascertain how far the existing Acts could be revised with a view to the introduction of a comprehensive Act to deal with the Defence Forces next year.  For instance, looking through this Act, I notice that there is considerable discrepancy as to the functions of courts martial and the relation of Military Courts to Civil Courts.</P>
      <P>I have heard it stated recently by lawyers&mdash;what value I am to put on the arguments I do not know&mdash;that in a recent case, which is, in fact, still pending, there was not any very clear statement in the Act as to whether the procedure adopted was correct. That officers of the Department of Justice could walk into the barracks of the Minister for Defence and arrest members of the Minister's Defence Forces might be questioned on an interpretation of this Act, and, certainly, if the Department of Justice is to take such steps, I think that the Minister for Defence should be informed and that the arrests of his officers and men in their barracks should not take place without his concurrence and agreement.  Generally speaking, the right of soldiers to be tried by court martial should be upheld as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first Act, I notice that there are many offences which may be tried by courts martial.  They are offences mentioned in the Third Schedule of the original Act such as larceny, receiving stolen property and so forth.  The Minister I think will agree that it is in the interests of discipline that men who are subject to discipline should, as far as possible, be dealt with by judges who are themselves personally acquainted with the discipline which they have to interpret.  That is the first point I should like to impress on <Col N="504" /> the Minister, that he should look through these Acts and see how far they are out of date before this time next year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general administration of his Department which is founded and has its being under the Acts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Deputy should postpone consideration of the administration of the Department of Defence until the Estimate comes before the House.  The Deputy was quite in order in discussing the Acts which the House is asked to continue but it would be better, in order to prevent duplication of debate, to defer detailed discussion of the administration until the Estimates are being debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I had in mind was that there was no discussion last year on the Estimate. There is one corps in the Army which has its existence under these Acts, but which is not specifically mentioned in them, and I think that the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Fitzgerald, brought this corps into existence under these Acts by a kind of subterfuge by which members of this corps became members of the Defence Forces for one day and subsequently continued in this particular corps.  The legality of it may be questioned, perhaps, and I should like to urge just one point on the Minister in this connection, because his Estimate may not come on until late in the summer, and then it may be too late.  I refer to the Officers' Training Corps which was brought into being by this subterfuge I mentioned. Some years ago I asked his predecessor if he would make arrangements to provide that members of the Officers' Training Corps should have the opportunity of devoting themselves to the study of some particular technical section of defence, and the Minister at that time said that that would be done, but in fact, although a scheme was drawn up, nothing has since been heard of it, and although members of the Officers' Training Corps were circularised and asked what particular branch they would like to specialise in, nothing has since taken place.  I understand <Col N="505" /> that the great majority of them naturally put down their names for the Air Service, and I think the Minister would be well advised to endeavour to revive the scheme which was proposed by his predecessor, but never carried into effect.  I think he would find that it would not be very costly, and certainly it would be a popular thing to do amongst the men.  I only mention it now because, if the Estimates do not come on until late in the year, the whole summer season will be lost, and perhaps the Minister might keep that in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to offer a very few observations with regard to this particular Bill.  I think that it is about time that this Dáil and the Minister for Defence ceased introducing, year after year, Temporary Provisions Bills with regard to the Army.  I think it has been voiced time and again from opposite sides of this House, from the Government side as well as from the Opposition side and the middle Benches of the House, that the time had arrived when something of the nature of a permanent Army Bill should be introduced, and that men serving in the Army, who have adopted the military career as a professional career, should get some security and some stability, and that we should cease to introduce, year after year, the hastily put together Act which was rather hurriedly framed in the year 1922.  I am very glad that the Army can now be discussed in this House in an atmosphere free from politics, and that there are no cheap sneers from this or any other side that the Army is his Majesty's Army, and that the Minister is his Majesty's Minister for Defence.  I am glad that we have reached a stage in the history of this country when every one of us is prepared to accept the Army as the Army of the Irish people, and as the Irish Army functioning under the Irish Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one question with which I should like the Minister to deal, and that is the question of regulations arising under this Act with regard to the issuing of commissions to members of the forces.  I understand that <Col N="506" /> regulations are in existence with regard to the issue of commissions, and that those regulations&mdash;I quite see the difficulty&mdash;are framed for the Army generally, and that they set out that commissions will only be given to individuals from the Cadet Service of the Army.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that those regulations were issued with an eye on the Army generally and with no particular eye on the special services or special corps of the Army&mdash;corps that are officered by men carrying diplomas, such as the Army Medical Corps.  Occasions have arisen since the Minister assumed office when it was necessary to fill vacancies to the commissioned ranks of the Army Medical Service.  I am not arguing for one moment that the general regulations governing commissions in the Army should apply to those special services, for members of a particular profession must of necessity hold those diplomas before they get a commission, but I want&mdash;for the information of the House, for the information of the public generally, and particularly for the information of graduates and members of the various universities and licensing bodies of the Irish Free State&mdash;to know exactly what is the present machinery for filling vacancies in what I may term the professional ranks of the Army.  I want to know if, as applies elsewhere, the vacancies are advertised, and if graduates of the different universities are given an opportunity of applying for vacancies.  I want to know if the vacancies in a service which is maintained out of the taxpayers' money, irrespective of political affiliation, are filled purely at the discretion of the Minister, and the avenue is purely open to the Minister's friends whether political or otherwise.  I am asking that question.  There are University representatives on both sides of the House; there are representatives of taxpayers all around this Assembly; I want to know exactly what regulations govern the filling of commissions in the special corps and services of the Army, and what steps have been taken to advertise those vacancies.  If no steps have been taken in the last twelve months to advertise those vacancies I <Col N="507" /> am saying nothing about that, but what steps will be taken in the future to advertise such vacancies and what qualifications are necessary for the filling of them?</P>

      <P>In regard to the question as to the renewal of the Act, for the last year the legal branch of the Headquarters Staff has been engaged in drafting a new Act.  The only reason that we have this annual Act instead of the new Bill here for discussion is that it would be impossible to get it through the draftsman's office this year.  In regard to the case under the Official Secrets Act, everything was done according to law and after consultation.  Regarding Deputy O'Higgins's question, commissions have been granted under regulations that had been in force under the Bill we are now discussing.  There has been no change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, the policy enshrined in the Railway and Transport Bill is a complete repudiation and reversal of the transport policy of the Fianna Fáil Party as declared by the Minister in this House and in the country during the past two general elections.  Deputy Norton quoted at length from documents of this House and from reports of speeches made by the Minister outside the House, quite clearly showing to those who are concerned that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he was shadow Minister in opposition in this House and when speaking for his Party in the country in February, 1932, committed himself and his Party to a solution of this important <Col N="510" /> problem along the lines of unification under public ownership.  There is nothing in either of those Bills to show that that promise, given in this House on behalf of the Party, and that pledge given to the people of the country previous to the general election, are being honoured.  There is nothing in either of the two Bills to show that the Minister is anxious to solve the problem along the lines of unification under public ownership, or along the lines of compulsory unification under private management.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton quoted the Minister, and speeches made by the Minister in this House in 1932, and also quoted from his speech reported in the &ldquo;Irish Press,&rdquo; which was delivered by the Minister on 9th February, 1932, and previous to the general election of that year.  I go back still further to quote the Minister, and to quote him as having spoken in this House on the 13th June, 1929.  I quote from Col. 1378 of a debate in which the Minister took part on that date in connection with the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Minister said, amongst other things:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The railways have fixed assets. They have the lines, the stations, etc., whereas the omnibus companies own only omnibuses.  These have a limited life, and I believe very little hardship would be imposed on anybody if it were enacted that after a particular date, let it be one year or eighteen months ahead, the sole right of running public services on the roads would be vested in that transport board, the establishment of which we suggest.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Where is the provision for the establishment of a transport board in any section of either of the two Bills now under discussion?  Where is the provision for the central or co-ordinating authority that must be set up if we are to have a nationally owned reorganised transport service?  The Minister, speaking in the House yesterday, is reported in the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; to have said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is clear that if the railways are to be maintained and play their part, if only under modern conditions, <Col N="511" /> they must be made part of a wider and centrally controlled transport organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where is the central control provided in this Bill?  The only control I can see, and which the Minister asks for in this Bill, is the power of a dictator, the power first of all to close down, what he has acknowledged in his speech to my amazement, large sections of branch lines of the Great Southern system, to disemploy hundreds or perhaps more railway men without any certainty of giving them compensation, and to write down by from 15 per cent. to 90 per cent. capital amounting to £26,000,000, subscribed by Irish citizens.  I should like that the railway workers of this country, who are still in employment in that industry which in 1924 gave employment to 20,898 citizens of this State, and also railway shareholders, who still have an interest in the preservation of the Irish railways, to purchase a copy of the Official Report of the Minister's speech made in this House yesterday, and to try and find in any sentence or paragraph of that speech anything which would indicate that the Minister had or held or ever held pro-railway views.  In March, 1925, as I said, there were 20,898 able-bodied citizens of this State employed under trade union conditions in the railway industry.  In March, 1932, that number was reduced to 14,128.  Since March, 1932&mdash;the Minister I am sure will be able to confirm this from the records of his own Department&mdash; another 1,000 have been added to the list of the unemployed as far as the railway industry is concerned&mdash; another 1,000 without having received the compensation which they were originally promised under the Amalgamation Act of 1924.</P>
    <P>Now, apart altogether from the speeches and the promises which were made by the Minister when he was a shadow Minister in this House and outside the House on behalf of his Party, I want to say this: I have been listening to members here in this House challenging President de Valera as to <Col N="512" /> his right to proceed on certain lines in regard to the Land Commission annuity question, as to his policy and as to the advisability of his policy.  President de Valera on all occasions, and perhaps rightly, clearly pointed out that he had a mandate from the people to proceed on the lines he was going on.  I want to suggest that what President de Valera asked for, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on his behalf, also asked for, and got as clear a mandate to proceed on certain lines for the solution of this particular problem as he did on the question of the Oath and the Land Commission annuities.  I should like to hear from the President, if he speaks in this debate, what justification there is for a change of policy in view of these very definite pledges announced by his Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The people to whom these pledges were given, and the people who accepted these pledges, are certainly entitled to some explanation, and also the people who are likely to lose, as I am certain they will lose, their employment on the railways.</P>
    <P>We are told, and I am still prepared to believe it, but one has to make certain mental reservations, that the plan and policy of the Fianna Fáil Party is to build up a new economic structure in this State.  Does anybody seriously suggest that they can erect that new economic structure which they have in mind while they have the banking and credit system of this country under private control and ownership, and while leaving the transport system in the hands of the people, who have mismanaged the transport services of this State already?  If you are going to build up a new economic structure in this State you will have to have more control over the banking system, and you will have to have more control than you are asking for in this Bill over the transport system.</P>
    <P>Before Fianna Fáil came into this House the members of this Party gladly supported Deputy McGilligan, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, in taking control of the water power resources of this country.  That was a step which was taken at a time when <Col N="513" /> you had the Seanad much more reactionary than what it is to-day; that was a bold and courageous step taken at a time when there were no Fianna Fáil members in the Seanad, and when there were very few Labour members there.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce came along yesterday and suggested&mdash;and I would not mind if it were at the cross-roads during the election&mdash;that the real reason he could not go forward on the lines of the policy previously announced was that there was not a majority in the Seanad.  I remember hearing the Minister making that statement to a private conference at which I was present, but I never thought that he would come to this House and try and thrust that argument down the throats of intelligent Deputies.  As Deputy Norton pointed out, he did not consider the position of the Party in the Seanad when he sent other Bills to that institution.  He did not consider the likelihood of other measures being held up by the Seanad.  Are we to understand that the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government in the future, and the programme of legislation which they are going to present to this House, will be considered in the light of what the majority of the members of the Seanad are likely to do with those measures?  I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce does he know what the Seanad is likely to do with the Land (Purchase Annuities Fund) Bill?  If he was assured by somebody that was in a position to advise him that the majority of the members of the Seanad would throw out that Bill, would he give the same reason for refusing to present it to the House as he has given for refusing to proceed along the lines of his stated policy in regard to the solution of the transport problem?  That kind of argument is all very well to use at a cross-roads meeting to a gathering of people during election time where the individuals listening to the Minister would not understand the actual position of the Seanad in relation to the constitution of this State. I am not accepting that argument as a sound argument for the refusal of the Government to proceed along the <Col N="514" /> lines previously announced here and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated&mdash;I am glad he did so&mdash;in relation to the Railways Bill that it was not designed to save the railways.  That is certainly a plain and straightforward statement. It makes it quite clear that the Minister never had any right to anticipate the introduction, as promised, of pro-railway legislation into this House.  This is not a pro-railway Bill.  It is a Bill for the partial destruction of the existing railway system.  I refer to the proposal contained in it in regard to the writing down of capital.  That is a matter upon which members in other parts of the House would have a better right to speak than I would, but I just want to draw the attention of Deputies concerned to the proposals presented to the Government and published in the newspapers in regard to the purchase of the railways by the State: proposals which were presented to Deputy Cosgrave when he was President, and subsequently to President de Valera and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I would like to draw attention to this: that the Minister, apparently without any consultation with financial experts and without, as he has stated, agreement with the people who have financial interests in the company, has put in certain proposals in this Bill.  Now, I would like to quote from the proposals which we presented to the same Minister the conditions under which we suggested that the railways should be purchased by the State for the people and run as a national industry, as was originally intended, to be run under public ownership by the Fianna Fáil Government.  We suggested that:]</P>
    <P>the price would be based on the Stock Exchange quotations over a specified period where such existed, and in other cases by agreement between the owners of such undertakings and the Minister with the approval of the Minister for Finance or, in default of agreement, to be settled by a transport arbitration tribunal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> At any rate the suggestion put forward by the Labour Party in regard to the acquisition by the State of the railways was on the basis of the Stock Exchange value of the various stocks over a given period, and we suggested that the period should be not less than three and not more than five years. That may be of interest to Deputies who sit in certain parts of this House and who have repeatedly suggested that the Labour Party stood for a policy of confiscation.</P>
    <P>I said that this Bill had not even proposed the unification of the transport services under private management. The Minister is, I think, wrongly reported in the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; as to what he said in the House yesterday in regard to this matter.  He is reported in the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; to-day as having said in regard to this matter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It (that is, the Railway Bill) definitely required that the road services owned by the Great Southern Railways Company should be brought under the same management and control as the railway service of the company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will the Minister, when replying, point to any section of the Railway Bill which would indicate that that was the policy: that it was his definite desire and intention to have the road services which were purchased by the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways Company run under the direct control and management of the traffic or general manager, of the Railway Company?  The Minister is well aware that the Railway Company, or the directors of the Railway Company, out of the shareholders' money purchased the I.O.C. and Messrs. John Wallis and Co. some years ago. Notwithstanding what may be said to the contrary, I am in a position to repeat what has been said here and elsewhere before: that the firm of Messrs. John Wallis and Co., although owned by the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways Company, has been running in open competition with the railway system itself.  I believe that if the Minister consults the files in his own Department he will find evidence to support that.  I understand the <Col N="516" /> statement that was made by me in this House to that effect some time ago was subsequently denied in very plausible and very vague language by the general manager of the Great Southern Railways Company, but if further evidence of that policy and that procedure is required by the Minister I undertake here and now to see that it is supplied to him.</P>
    <P>Why should any transport company, in particular a railway company, have road services, whether passenger or commercial lorries, without having those services under the direct control and management of the company that is supposed to own them?  I have listened to people quoting cases where the clerical staffs of the Great Southern Railways Company have been instructed to go out and canvass for traffic for Messrs John Wallis and Company.  Is it any wonder, with a policy of that kind, that the railway system is being wiped out and that the Minister is now suggesting that certain sections of it can be closed down even without any inquiry?</P>
    <P>I now come to that portion of the Railways Bill that deals with the number of directors.  The Minister was quoted at length by Deputy Norton yesterday as having expressed the opinion that the management of the company, under the present system, was inefficient.  A statement of a more drastic character, but along the same lines, was made by Senator Connolly some short time ago.  We have here in this Railways Bill a proposal to continue in existence the very same people and the very same system which has brought the railway industry to the verge of bankruptcy. The proposal in the Bill is to reduce the number of directors to seven.  Sir Walter Nugent, speaking at a shareholders' meeting the other day informed them, according to the report of his speech that appeared in the newspapers the following morning, that that suggestion was put forward to the Minister's predecessor, and stated that the Board were willing themselves, strange to say, to have the number reduced to eight, the minimum to be six.  He suggested that the present Minister for Industry and <Col N="517" /> Commerce is merely splitting the difference.</P>
    <P>I think you are not going to have under private ownership an efficient directorate unless the number is considerably reduced.  The Labour Party feels that the number should be reduced to three, and that it certainly should not exceed five.  Does the Minister believe that a body of directors which up to some time ago consisted of individuals, some of whom had reached the age of 89, are the best and most efficient that can be found to manage a transport system under modern conditions?  Does he suggest that any man at the age of 89 could possibly have a proper outlook on the present transport needs of the people?  One director at the age of 89 died in harness only a short time ago.  I am informed that whenever he went to the directors' meetings he said nothing, but attended the luncheon held subsequently.  We suggest that the number should not exceed five under any circumstances. I hope the Minister will agree to reduce the number and accept an amendment to that effect on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quoted by Sir Walter Nugent as having &ldquo;courteously intimated his willingness to consider reasonable amendments, the acceptance of which may modify existing impressions.&rdquo; Imagine the Minister giving that very courteous intimation to the chairman of the company after having accepted the company's Bill practically in its entirety with two or three exceptions.  This is not the Minister's Bill; it is the Railway Company's Bill with two or three exceptions.  I should like to ask the Minister will he accept an amendment fixing a maximum age for the directors of the company who will have the grave responsibility of bringing this industry out of chaos? The reason I make this request is that the directors have made a regulation that all servants of the company, whether &ldquo;quill drivers&rdquo; or engine drivers, have a maximum retiring age fixed-60 years of age in the case of the &ldquo;quill drivers&rdquo; and 65 in the case of the engine drivers.  Surely, if the <Col N="518" /> directors of the company think that their own employees are either mentally or physically unfit to carry on the work of the railway after a certain age, the same argument is good, and has perhaps greater force, for those who are giving the directions themselves.  I suggest that it would be in the interest of the company itself to have a maximum age fixed and that the shareholders would be well advised to see that the Minister inserts some maximum rather than that an old man should die in harness at the age of 89.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal also in this same section of the Bill that the next election for the new Board after the passing of the Bill shall be under the new system of ballot voting and I compliment the Minister on inserting that.  I think that the election of the new Board should not be delayed until the next annual meeting.  There are good reasons why the election should take place as soon as possible or as soon as convenient and I would urge on the Minister to see that the election of the new Board should be within at least six months from the date of the passing of this measure.</P>
    <P>I come now to Section 8&mdash;that portion of the Bill which is undoubtedly the company's section as a whole and in which the Minister asks for powers from this House, without any previous inquiry, for the closing down of branch lines of the Great Southern Railways' system.  When I read this Bill I thought it was a fairly bad Bill, but I was certainly amazed to hear the Minister's own explanation of this section and to hear him claim the powers to close down large sections of the branch lines without any previous inquiry of any kind.  Sir Walter Nugent, I understand, at the shareholders' meeting the other day, informed the shareholders that he had put up a similar proposal to Deputy McGilligan when that Deputy was Minister for Industry and Commerce, and he expressed his gratitude to the present Minister for having now accepted a proposal which, I understood him to say, was turned down previously by Deputy McGilligan.  The whole of Section 8 of this Bill is the <Col N="519" /> company's proposal, not modified as far as I know by the Minister after having received it from the company. I would not have the same objection to the claim put forward for the inclusion of Section 8, if the Minister would agree that a public inquiry should be held beforehand at the expense of the company, and that interested parties&mdash; parties interested in the preservation of the railway system, traders in the locality concerned, travellers on the line and others likely to be affected by the closing down of the branch lines&mdash; should have an opportunity of stating their case.</P>
    <P>The Minister asks for dictatorial powers and I am certainly not prepared to give such dictatorial powers to him, especially in view of the unfortunate statement which he made here yesterday.  I asked him how many, if any, applications he had received from the railway company for the closing down of these lines, and he said none up to the present, but that he had received six or seven applications for the reduction of the services.  But he said that he was convinced that a good case could be made out for the closing down of certain branch lines, and when it was suggested to him that there were objections to the closing down he advised Deputies not to bring these opposing such applications to him. Will the Minister be good enough to say where he got that information, and whether he has examined the figures submitted by the company, and whether he reserves the right to tell them, when they come in with objections, that he will close down these branch lines and will not listen to any objections?  It is a most unfortunate situation that he should pre-judge a situation of that kind in that manner, especially when he admitted that he had not received any application of the kind up to the present.  I have been approached, as several Deputies in this House have been approached, affecting a proposal of that kind, concerning my own constituency. Deputy Moore almost wept tears of blood here yesterday evening at the closing down of what he called the Tullow section.  He counterbalanced that, of course, in another <Col N="520" /> part of his speech by weeping for the poor farmer living in some by-road who would not be able to get his cattle or sheep or pigs along that by-road to whatever fair he wanted to bring them without a motor lorry.  May I remind Deputy Moore that he lived in a part of the country where there were no lorries in the old days and when the good old horse and cart were good enough to bring the cattle and the sheep and pigs to the fairs?  I know he was born and reared in circumstances which compel him to realise that there are other ways and means, as there were in the old days, of getting cattle and sheep and pigs to the fairs and markets without having to get them out along a by-road in a motor lorry.  I wonder did Deputy Moore have any information from the Minister that that particular line is likely to be one of the first to be cut off, and is that the reason Deputy Moore objected to that part of the Minister's statement? I suspect that the Minister had been in previous consultation with Deputy Moore and informed the Deputy that this is one of the lines likely to go, and that that is why the Deputy wept tears about a section that cut across portion of his own constituency. If that branch line closes down and results in the unemployment of the men engaged there, I would advise the railwaymen who may lose their employment by the closing down of that branch line to look to Deputy Moore for consolation if they do not get compensation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in this section of the Bill, in his usual eloquent style, has assured us that all the railwaymen who may lose their employment as a result of the closing down of these branch lines would be provided with compensation. I want to tell the House that the sub-section of this section of the Bill which proposes to provide compensation for those who may lose their employment through the closing down of the lines is certainly copied from the Company's Bill.  There is no doubt about that.  I want to point out to the Minister that the Railway Company can find many ways and means of evading this section, and can find many ways and means of depriving railwaymen, who lose their <Col N="521" /> employment as the result of the closing down, of the compensation which the Minister promises them under this section of this Bill.  Every railwayman of every grade is, and can be transferred from one point to any other point of the company's system, and I venture to suggest that most of the men who are now employed on these lines have been transferred at some time or other during past years from a main line to a branch line, or from a branch line to a main line.  The company have always had the right to transfer employees from any one part of the system to any other.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister deny that under the reading of this sub-section, promising compensation to those who may be dismissed, the company could not, a day, a week, or a month before the line would be closed down, transfer the employees from the section of the line that is going to be closed down, to the main line or some other section that was not going to be closed down, thereby evading the obligation placed on them under the terms of the section?  If the company decided that they were going to close a branch line at any particular date and the Minister sanctioned their proposal, they could easily evade the obligation by transferring the employees concerned, merely leaving a skeleton staff on the branch line on the day it was closed down.   Having transferred the employees to the main line or some other section, they could on the day after the branch line was closed give notice of dismissal to the people who were transferred, and there would be then no compensation for them under any conditions.  I pointed out the amounts of compensation that were provided under the 1924 Act.   I think the Minister can get particulars as to the number of employees who have been denied compensation as a result of methods of that kind.</P>
    <P>One clause in the Bill has been introduced by the Minister to the amazement of railwaymen in this country. That is sub-section (d) of Section 8, which states:</P>
    <P>Such railway company may, notwithstanding any agreement or <Col N="522" /> practice as to the dismissal (in cases of redundancy of employees) of the latest employed of its employees or as to the division of such railway company's railway system into districts for the purpose of the promotion or dismissal of employees, redistribute its employees in such manner as appears to such railway company to be proper, but not so as to impose any undue or unnecessary hardship on the employees of such railway company.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the Minister should in a Bill of this kind bring in a sub-section which would cut across and smash an existing agreement between the unions and the railway companies. The Minister denied yesterday that that was the intention.  The Minister knows perfectly well, and he has plenty of communications in his Department to show it, that the method adopted in getting rid of redundant employees was &ldquo;last man in, first man out.&rdquo;  That has been an agreed policy between the unions and the railway companies. When the Minister was in Ottawa last year, the present general manager of the Great Southern Railways Company challenged that particular procedure. In company with other colleagues I was appointed to wait on Senator Connolly, who was then acting Minister in the absence of the Minister himself. After having explained to him the arrangements which were in existence between the unions and the companies, Senator Connolly&mdash;and I am very glad to have to say so in this House, as I already said at meetings of members of the unions&mdash;stoutly stood behind the principle of getting rid of redundant employees by adopting the method of &ldquo;last man in, first man out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This agreement has been arrived at between the unions and the companies after years of agitation, aye, and in some cases industrial action, and the Minister may take it from me&mdash;and I am speaking for the unions in this matter&mdash;that we are not going to allow this section to remain in the Bill if we can get it cut out.  The general manager, as I say, proceeded to challenge this procedure.  He was told by members of the Board that the policy should be to &ldquo;sack the duds.&rdquo;  Who <Col N="523" /> would be the duds in such circumstances? They would be the members of the staff against whom the departmental head had a grudge.  The duds would certainly never be members of the staff who held the membership card of the famous Molesworth Street Club, and they would certainly never be members of the staff who had acted as blacklegs during industrial disputes. We have a few monuments of that kind as a result of the work of managers in the old days, and the unions are not going to allow this procedure to be challenged by an Act of this House, or to allow an agreement of that kind to be smashed.  If necessary, I shall give an opportunity to members of the House to put their names on record in the Division Lobby as to whether they stand for this policy or not.  Sack the duds!  Of course the general manager of the Railway Company, in explaining that particular sub-section to the Minister, did not explain that that was the policy in the past, and that that was the procedure before the unions became strong enough to challenge it. I think there is no fairer method to get rid of redundant employees than to adopt the policy of &ldquo;last man in, first man out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say what were the grounds which influenced him in turning down the method which his acting Minister stood over during his absence in Ottawa. There seems to be some conflict of opinion, and the only explanation I can suggest is that the Minister accepted this Section 8 from the Railway Company without getting any explanation.  I suggest to the Minister that it would not be unfair to ask him whether he sought the opinion of any union leader or secretary before he put that section in the Bill.  If he thought it right and fit to consult the general manager and directors of the railway company, surely it would be only right and fair for him to consult some of the union leaders as to what they thought of this particular proposal put forward by the companies?  No matter what they thought, we are not going to accept this sub-section in the <Col N="524" /> form in which it now appears in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will, if necessary, after seeing the union leaders on the matter, wipe out this sub-section and leave it to the unions and companies to settle matters of this kind.  There are one or two other minor matters to which I wish to refer.</P>

Consequently I am rather surprised that the present Minister, who supported his own Party in this House at that time, should take cover behind this amending Act which deprived many railwaymen in this country of the compensation which they were promised and to which they were rightly entitled under the original Act of 1924.  I see the Attorney-General smiling, because probably he knows the meaning of this particular Act and the rights to which railwaymen were entitled under the original Act.  I am sure if he takes any part in this debate he will be able to enlighten his own Minister as to the consequences to many railwaymen of the operation of that particular Act.  I am surprised, as I have said, that the Minister has taken cover behind it, and instead of allowing many of the railwaymen, dismissed without compensation, to get compensation by this Act, he is going to arbitration.</P>

I cannot understand why the Minister proposes to exempt from the operations of this Act licensed carrying companies who operate within a radius of fifteen miles of the twelve principal cities or towns, because he knows that the cream of the traffic that may come to the railway companies comes to and from areas exempt under this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has he fixed 15 miles radius?  He gave no reason to the House for fixing that radius.  Does he realise that it is not workable between towns like Drogheda and Dundalk? Does he realise the distance that lies between Drogheda and Dundalk? Let him have a look at the map and he will probably, without advice from anybody, revise that portion of his proposal.  The Minister yesterday, as quoted by Deputy Norton, already expressed himself as being in favour of the municipal ownership of transport.  He said in this House on the 9th December, 1931:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We are strongly in favour of public ownership of transport services with unified control outside the boundaries of the municipalities.  Inside <Col N="526" /> the boundaries of the municipalities we are in favour of municipal ownership of these services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can he give any reason why he did not say five miles or ten miles and why he fixed a limit of 15 miles?  He knows if and when the railway company begins to operate a road service in that area they will be operating in an area with definite conditions laid down before they receive their licence.  They will have to prove to the Minister's satisfaction, before they operate, that they are paying trade union rates, and that their employees are working only for reasonable hours, and they will have to submit their classification of goods to the railway tribunal.  Will all these conditions be applied to the companies that will operate only within the 15-mile area?  Will the Minister explain why they are not placed on a footing of fair and reasonable competition on reasonable lines?  He seems to forget everything he said upon this matter in the last three or four years, and seems to have, consciously or unconsciously, forgotten them since he became Minister.  I think the Minister indicated, although I have no actual quotation from his speech to show that he did, that he would reconsider the point laid down in that section of the Bill.  I hope he will see, when reconsidering the matter, that if there is to be fair competition within the present industry, and that he cannot see his way to provide for compulsory unification or amalgamation of the railway services under one board of control, that all those who operate outside or inside the 15-mile limit will operate on fair and equitable lines and that the conditions imposed on one will be imposed on the other.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to say, in reply, whether he is satisfied that the definition of existing carriers, as laid down in Section 2 of the Transport Bill, is a hard and fast and fair definition. He is defined as a person who carried on at some time between the 1st July, 1932, and the 8th February, 1933.  I ask Deputies to mark the words &ldquo;at some time.&rdquo;  If he is an individual who has been operating within the periods named he will come <Col N="527" /> under the definition and will get a licence under this Bill.  Does the Minister realise that that proposes to give the right, under that very loose definition, to any individual who may have carried on for a week or a month, to get a licence, and then hope that some other carrying company will buy him out, thereby getting compensation which under this loose definition I think would be inevitable?  I ask him to compare that loose definition, and the probability of persons coming under it getting compensation, with a very clear definition under a section of the Bill which defines the right of employees who lose their position to compensation.  There is a very clear and definite section in the Bill that a man must have been continually working for five years before he gets compensation, but in the case of a person who wants the licence all that is required is that he may have operated, at some time, between the 1st July and the 8th February.  There is something wrong there which certainly requires to be put right.  Among the things that the Minister must do is, he must have due regard, in considering the application for a licence, to the question of wages and hours of those who are to be employed by the carrying company.  I hope the Minister will indicate whether it is possible for him to accept an amendment making his own viewpoint upon that matter much more definite.  The reason I suggest that is that the House will remember that the Minister, and the Government, gave an assurance last year, that before granting a licence to the passenger omnibus companies the question of reasonable hours and wages would be considered.  The Minister has reason to be aware, and so has the President, that that promise was not carried out in the spirit in which it was, I understand, given to the people who made representations on behalf of the trade unions concerned, and his own Department experienced considerable trouble in dealing with people who got licences without having complied with the reasonable labour conditions.</P>
    <P>There is another section dealing with <Col N="528" /> compensation to companies which may be bought out on the initiative of an existing carrying company.  It makes provision for the appointment of an arbitrator, but there is nothing clear in the Bill laying down the matters that should be referred to by the arbitrator when endeavouring to fix a fair figure for the company that is being bought out.  Will the Minister indicate what matters the arbitrator will bear in mind when fixing suitable compensation for the company or carrier that may be bought out under an order issued by himself?</P>
    <P>There is another section in which the Minister seeks the authority of the House to appoint the arbitrator.  I suggest it would be far better if the appointment of the arbitrator were left to the Chief Justice.  The Minister would be well advised to relieve himself of that responsibility by accepting an amendment on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 57 deals with the question of compensation to employees of existing road-carrying companies who may lose their employment.  I think it is right to point out that the provision with regard to the period of continuous service makes me feel that very few of those who are likely to lose their employment may have any expectation of getting compensation.  Has the Minister any information to show the number who are likely to get licences and who have been in existence for a period of five years?  If a carrying company has not been in existence for five years, and if an individual who may lose his employment because of this measure has not five years' continuous service, he will get no compensation following the loss of his position. Is the Minister prepared to reduce the period in that case?  He would be well advised to do so.</P>

      <P>The Minister would be well advised to reduce the period if he wants to make it at all possible for the majority of those who lose employment to get compensation.  There is no use in promising compensation to those who, in the majority of cases, will not <Col N="529" /> get it.  I hope that in this instance the same condition will not apply as did apply in the case of the railway men whose positions were affected under the various Railway Acts passed since 1924.</P>
      <P>There is a defect in the matter of making provision for compensation to employees.  In the case of a dispute between an employee, who thinks he is entitled to compensation, and a company, will the Minister indicate what provision is made with regard to a settlement?  Is there any provision for the settlement of a dispute of that kind?  Will the Minister reconsider the matter with a view to making suitable provision for such an emergency?</P>
      <P>This Bill pretends to make provision for the unification under private ownership of all road services in the State. That is merely a pious hope.  There is nothing in the Bill to justify the Minister in making that claim, because unification of the road services, if it ever comes about, will come only under the terms of this Bill through proposals put forward by existing carriers for the purchase of other people engaged in the industry.  The Minister said yesterday that the unification of the road services operated by the Great Southern Company could be brought about by a stroke of the pen.  Will he explain that statement more fully?  He said he had no objection to the unification of the road services; he had no objection to the road services being brought, as they should have been long ago, under the direct control of the traffic or general manager of the Great Southern Company.  Will he accept an amendment which will compel the road services owned by the Great Southern Railways to be brought under the direct control of the manager of that company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a point in Section 9 regarding the provision for the inspection of commercial lorries by members of the Gárda Síochána.  That matter was brought under the notice of the Minister for Local Government by a trade union deputation.  Members of this Party and those engaged in the coach building industry have a decided objection to the employment of Gardai for the purpose of inspecting commercial <Col N="530" /> lorries and omnibuses.  I am sure the Minister for Justice can tell the Minister that there are very few men skilled in this respect in the service of the Gárda.  I do not know that any member of the Gárda, a sergeant, an inspector, a superintendent or even a chief superintendent, would be the right person to employ on work of this kind.  If there was a proper man engaged on that work many of the taxis and omnibuses at present plying would have to be repaired or reconstructed or put off the roads altogether.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to point out that in connection with Section 8 (d) certain things have happened recently in connection with the Great Southern Railways which would seem to point to the fact that were it not that the management knew this clause was going to be inserted they would not have made certain promotions which were recently carried into effect.  I have evidence which can be submitted to the Minister showing where unfair promotions took place, promotions out of keeping with previous procedure.  There were certain promotions made by the general manager and the board of directors of the Great Southern Company which would not have taken place and could not be justified were it not for the fact that they knew that this sub-section was going to be inserted.  I know of one case in which the secretary of my own organisation made representations as recently as last week.  He protested to the general manager against a certain promotion which could never be justified under the agreements which existed between the unions and the company.  I suspect it is the insertion of this section which induced the company to proceed upon lines quite contrary to their usual practice.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to cover most of the important points in the Bill.  The only thing I can congratulate the Minister upon is upon having withheld the publication of these two Bills until the results of the last election were announced.  I venture to prophesy that if the Minister, as he promised to do, published these Bills before the last general election, he would not have received the enthusiastic reception he is supposed to have received when <Col N="531" /> he was addressing a meeting of railway workers in Inchicore.  Would the Minister now have the courage to go out to Inchicore to justify to a meeting of railway men the insertion in a Bill of this kind of Section 8 and support it by the speech he made here last evening?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will take advantage of that opportunity before the Committee Stage is finished in this House.  If he does he will find that he will get a different reception from the railwaymen at Inchicore from what he is supposed to have got when addressing them recently at the General Election.  I am not going to criticise the Transport Bill without saying something in the other direction. I admit that the Transport Bill goes some way to regulate some of those people who have been engaged on pirate services on the roads during the past three or four years, and who while operating as road carriers without licence or without control of any kind, have stolen the best part of the traffic from the Railway Company. These people are the real cause of the bankrupt condition in which the railway companies find themselves to-day.  I warn the Minister that he should not lightly be a party to the closing down of the branch lines on the Great Southern Railways system, and I advise him, and I think he would be well advised, to agree to the insertion of a protective section in this clause, a section which will enable an inquiry to be held at the expense of the company.  The Minister should not, on his own authority and without inquiry, order the closing down of any branch line.  There should be a public inquiry first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A public inquiry for what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>A public inquiry as to the necessity for closing down the line. The Minister yesterday talked about branch lines not paying.  Will the Minister tell us what arguments he can give the House in support of that statement? What information has he got? What figures has he in his possession <Col N="532" /> which justify him in saying that a certain number of branch lines could to-day be closed down by him?  Has he been supplied with any information or any figures by the Railway Company in support of that assertion?  I asked the Minister yesterday had he received any such applications for the closing down of branch lines, and he said &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Then, how could he have in his possession any facts or figures which would justify him in saying that branch lines should be closed down?  Deputy Moore pointed out that if the Tullow branch, in which he is interested, closed down it would be impossible to have a road service run covering the villages and towns served by the Tullow branch railway.  The only way in which a branch service can be closed down is by the making of more roads at the expense of the ratepayers.  That would have to be done in order to provide the people now served by the branch lines with the same facilities as they have been hitherto served.</P>
      <P>I was never opposed, and I could not give any reason for being opposed to bus services and other road services in many areas.  I would not oppose a licence being given for the collection and delivery traffic to and from areas not properly served by a railway system.  The present management and directors of the Railway Company had no vision when they saw the advent of the motor traffic five or six years ago.  That was due to the fact that most of the directors were at that time 65 to 70 years of age, and were unable to see that to-day was anything different from the past, or anything different from the days when they were young, and when they were first appointed on the Board. I do not suggest in any way in making this statement that the hands of the clock should be put back.  I do not suggest that the public who want proper transport services, and are entitled to it, should not have it.  They want service, and when they do they are entitled to it, but they will have it under the strict control of this House by some body or board appointed by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister himself is one of the most hard-working men in the <Col N="533" /> present Ministry.  I believe he is overworked.  I also believe he has created a great deal of additional work for himself in connection with tariffs which have been imposed without any justification up to the present time.  I suggest to the Minister that he should now relieve himself of the responsibility of personally considering all applications from existing carriers for the renewal of their licences or applications for new licences.  The Minister would be well advised to pass that work on to some other body if terms can be agreed on.</P>
    <P>When the Minister suggests that Deputies should not be coming to him asking him not to close down branch lines, then it is obvious that he has already made up his mind that there is a case for the closing down of branch lines, and that he does not want to hear the case against their closing down made by any Deputies, even by members of his own Party.  I would suggest that the Minister should not take the responsibility for dealing with matters that should not be dealt with by the Minister.  I make that suggestion for ordinary reasons, and for the reason that the Minister has other work to do.  I hope the Minister will agree to insert the necessary amendments during the Committee Stage, and that he will give reasonable time for the consideration and presentation of these amendments.  I hope that some of the suggestions I have made will not be made matters where the members of the different Parties will be tied.  If the Minister wants to secure the passage of a better Bill than the one now before the House he will agree to leave these amendments to the free vote of every Party in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech that we have just listened to from Deputy Davin, like the speech we listened to last night from the Leader of his Party, calls, I think, for one or two remarks at this particular stage.  Deputy Norton blamed all the losses, from which the railways are suffering at the moment, on the capitalistic system. We have been accustomed to hear from Deputy Norton on every occasion when economic questions are before this House statements like that. <Col N="534" /> The Deputy tells us in almost stereotyped speech that the cause of the trouble is the capitalistic system. Then he usually winds up recommending that the capitalistic system should be removed in order to get rid of the trouble.  It seems to be a sort of patent medicine dealt out to this House on these occasions by Deputy Norton.  Deputy Davin, who has just spoken, is usually a little more cautious.  He does not put down the loss suffered by the railways to the same cause at all.  He tells us that the troubles arise from the inefficiency of a large number of the directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy suggests, without hesitation, that these directors should be dismissed.  I could not help being struck with the fact that when he was dealing in the next breath with the dismissal of the members of trade unions he made the case that they were not to be so summarily dealt with as the unfortunate directors.  Their case was to be carefully considered by the Tribunal and every opportunity was to be given to them to see that they got fair play.  That is how the trade unions were to be treated.  But I did not hear one single word from the Deputy that that same fair play was to be extended to any of the directors notwithstanding the long service that some of them had in the interests of the company.  Might I remind the Deputy that what we complain of and what we have heard about our railways here is not at all uncommon in connection with railways all over the world at the moment?  As one who has the misfortune to be a shareholder in some of these more distant railways, as well as in our home railways, I can speak with some little authority on the subject.  I study occasionally, when I get the time, the balance sheets of these more distant railway companies and I find that the financial conditions are very similar to those which surround our own railway companies. Coming nearer home, one finds that the head of the board of one of the large railway companies in the sister isle is a well-known economist.  I am sure that he has brought to bear on that position the ability he is known to possess.  Yet, notwithstanding that, <Col N="535" /> we, poor shareholders in that company, are getting no return at the moment on our money.</P>
    <P>It is proposed as a means of getting rid of our directors that we should have&mdash;Deputy Davin recommends it&mdash; postal voting.  Doubtless, he is more optimistic about that proposal than I am.  I see very little difference between that proposal and the method of election which exists at present. Under the postal system, as I understand, every shareholder would send in on a voting paper the names of those he wished to support.  These names would be recorded by the board.  Under the existing system, shareholders, if they are desirous, on reading the report, of supporting the board, are asked to send in their proxies.  The only difference between the proxy and the postal vote that I can see is that the names of the directors appear on one and that they do not appear on the other.  But the principle is the same.  If the shareholders are prepared to support the board, they send in their proxies. Under the postal system, if they desire to support individuals, they will send in their signed paper in exactly the same way.  I hope that the Deputy will get some advantage from this new proposal which, I take it, emanates from his Party.  At all events, I have heard it suggested from that source on previous occasions.  Doubtless, they see in it some advantage which is not apparent to the ordinary eye. It appears to me that these two Deputies consider that there is only one class of persons whose interests should be before the minds of the Dáil when a Bill of the importance of this Bill is under consideration.  That class consists of the employees of the railway company.  I have the greatest sympathy with those employees. There are some 14,000 of them.  But when you come to deal with a problem of this kind, the sacrifices must be borne by all.  That is usually expressed by saying that there must be &ldquo;equality of sacrifice.&rdquo;  As I understand the position&mdash;it has been made fairly clear by the chairman of the company on many occasions&mdash;the employees <Col N="536" /> of the Great Southern Railways Company are at the moment in receipt of wages which are 140 per cent. over pre-war level.  That statement has been made publicly on several occasions by the chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company and I have not seen it contradicted by anybody.  It has been further pointed out that if that figure could be brought down to 100 per cent. over pre-war level, it would be about the same rate of increase as the best paid trades enjoy at the moment. A number of them, I am sorry to say, have a great deal less, but what we look upon as the best paid trades have a wage which shows approximately 100 per cent. increase over pre-war levels.  One would think, when we talk of sacrifice, that it would not have been too much for the railway employees to consider, in the interest of the maintenance of their own employment and in the interests of all concerned, how their wage might be brought down to that figure.  Incidentally, I may say that the chairman of the company has stated that the economies which would be derived from such a reduction would amount to about £300,000&mdash;a very considerable saving.  What do we find?  We find an absolute refusal on the part of the men to consider any such proposal. In fact, the men who enjoy this wage of 140 per cent. over pre-war level are engaged in a strike because the railway companies have attempted to reduce their wages by something less than 10 per cent.  When we talk about sacrifices, let us remember that position.</P>
    <P>Now let us consider the other side of the problem.  I said that there are 12,000 or 14,000 workmen employed by our railway companies.  In Southern Ireland alone, there are 27,000 persons whose money is invested in the company in this area.  In many cases, their all is invested in the company. A little while ago, I had a letter from the wife of a well-known resident of this city, who died some years ago. He had saved a sum of £2,000.  To make the little income which would accrue from that sum safe, he invested it in the 4 per cent. guaranteed preference <Col N="537" /> stock of the Great Southern Railways Company.  That widow continued to receive £80 from that investment up to the end of last year.  At its last meeting, the company passed the dividend on that particular stock as well as on others.  In other words, it is only paying at the moment on its debentures.  What is the plight of that unfortunate woman?  Absolutely penniless. And that is the position, I am sorry to say, of hundreds of people in this State at present.  In these circumstances, it is only fair to say that there should be some equality of sacrifice. In addition to losing the dividends what have those people lost in the way of capital?  In 1925, the capital of the company was valued on the market at £14,000,000.  At present, the value of it&mdash;though one could not attempt to put any number of shares on the market without depreciating the market very much&mdash;is something under £5,000,000.  In other words, there has been a loss of £9,000,000 of capital on the part of those 27,000 shareholders in seven years.  And Deputy Norton stands up and says those are the people who must bear the burden!  All I can say is that if that is the Deputy's idea of fair play to the different interests concerned I leave it with him. I do not think from my knowledge of this House that many will agree with him, either in his words or in his policy.</P>
    <P>There will be an opportunity later of discussing many points in connection with the Railways Bill.  May I say at this stage that I am exceedingly sorry that the Railways Bill did not precede this Bill?  This Bill proposes to put a number of burdens on the motor industry which I will not go into at present. In other words, you are going to add considerably to the expense of the transport industry.  Nobody will question that statement who has given even a superficial study to this particular Bill.  What is the object of burdening the transport industry at the present time?  As the Minister stated yesterday the object is to help the railways.  I have studied the Railways Bill very closely and, except the Minister can explain I cannot see that the railways are going to derive any <Col N="538" /> material benefit from the Bill in its present form.  My difficulty is this.  I am quite satisfied to support this Bill to place these additional burdens on a particular portion of the transport system provided it is going to help the railways and that the railways are going to benefit.  But, if I cannot see as a result of these two Bills that the railways are going to benefit, then I cannot see my way to support at all enthusiastically the proposals in this Bill.  Probably, however, the Minister, when he comes to deal with the Railways Bill, will be able to show us in it factors that do not appear on the surface.  The Minister in his statement yesterday, I am glad to say, was sympathetically disposed towards the railways. That has brought on his head coals of fire from the Labour Party, which is not surprising.  I was also glad to hear from Deputy McGilligan yesterday that the Party he represents is sympathetically disposed towards the railways.  I am not, therefore, without hope that, as a result of these two expressions of opinion, one from the Minister and the other from an important member of the Opposition, benefit will accrue as a result of this Bill to the railways.</P>
    <P>I have heard it stated on many occasions that there is some doubt as to what the railways want.  I should like for the purpose of giving the Minister an opportunity of replying to them to reiterate the claims of the railways.  The relief which has been asked for by the company is set out very clearly in the statement which they issued recently.  The first item they asked for is legislation regulating and controlling freight road traffic by licence and importing a fair allocation of road costs according to user.  The Road Transport Bill before us certainly aims at regulating and controlling freight road traffic by licence, but so far the Minister has been absolutely silent on the financial side as to what burdens are to be placed in future on that particular form of traffic towards the maintenance of the roadways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the railway companies want to contribute more than they are doing they can contribute <Col N="539" /> direct.  They will be the principal operators of road traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see in the Bill, if I might mention it at this stage, a greater incentive to profit for the railways from running on the railway lines instead of on the roadways. That is one objection to the Railways Bill.  I may be wrong, but the only additional revenue that I see for the railway companies under the Railways Bill is to be derived from road traffic and not from railway traffic.  The next item in the relief asked for by the company is as follows: Legislation relieving the railways from the following disabilities arising out of the Railways Acts of 1924 and 1932, viz., the financial burden of carrying on lines baronially guaranteed in respect of which the railway company is obliged to carry on and maintain the same at great loss and without any subsidy.  How far are the railway companies granted relief in that respect under the Railways Bill?  In the Railways Bill the Minister sets out three particular items.  Do any of these items include the £45,000?</P>

I would like to ask the Minister another question in connection with this financial burden, <Col N="543" /> the liability for which is being taken away from the railways.  Will that loan be paid by the State, or does it become portion of the money that is now in dispute between Great Britain and this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave the subject where it is at the moment.  I think it is in very good hands.  The next item I find amongst the reliefs asked for by the railway company is that they should be relieved of obligations to run services on non-paying lines originally constructed out of Government grants and public moneys in respect of which the railway company have received no consideration.  I was very glad to hear yesterday the very definite assurance from the Minister that, so far as he is concerned, if a case is put up to him by the railway company that they should be relieved of the burdens of maintaining lines which are uneconomic, he will see that they are carefully considered and, if possible, support will be given to them from his Department.  The next item is &ldquo;obligations for loans made by the British Government to the Constituent Companies prior to amalgamation and in respect of which the Constituent Companies were unable to meet their obligations at amalgamation.&rdquo;  We have discussed those already, so I will not take up the time of the House further on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no; those are different loans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The loans we are talking about now are different from the loan given to the Dublin and South Eastern Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there were other obligations besides that.  We have spoken of three of which the Government intend to relieve the company. We have spoken of a fourth attaching to which was the appointment of a director.  Are there others?  The Minister has a Department behind him.  I am an individual.  If there are others let us know of them.  Another point mentioned by the company in their statement is &ldquo;Restrictions imposed on the Railway Company in respect of rates, fares, conditions of carriage, etc.&rdquo;  I have the figures somewhere of the amount of rates which are paid at present by the railway companies.  They amount to a fairly considerable sum.  Last year, the companies paid £113,400 in rates to local authorities.  Those rates went largely towards the maintenance of roadways on which their competitors were to run.  Are they to be relieved of that burden of £113,400 in rates in the future?  Supposing a number of these branch lines are closed, will they still be subject to rates, in addition to the other liabilities for the maintenance of crossings, bridges and other liabilities on lines which are unproductive? That is a matter which I think the Minister might consider. That amount of £113,400 is a very important sum.  The last point they make is in respect of certain repeals and variations of the 1924 and 1932 Acts. The Minister doubtless has had a number of interviews with these directors. He knows what these burdens are that are set out in this particular section, and I should be glad to know from him in his reply how far he is prepared to meet the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>How far would the Deputy suggest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I should want, first of all, before I could make any suggestion, to know the particular items that are embodied in this particular proposal. <Col N="546" /> If the Minister will give me those items I should be very glad to study them and to give him my suggestions if they would be of any use to him, but, without the details, I think it would be hopeless for me to attempt to assist the Minister.  As I have said, if I were satisfied that this Transport Bill and the Railways Bill would materially benefit the financial position of the country, I should be prepared wholeheartedly to support them.  I agree that the maintenance of the railways is essential to the welfare of our State, but the railways cannot be maintained unless the financial position is improved, and improved materially. The Minister has made promises&mdash;I will not go back for any number of years&mdash;but I have in my hands a statement that was made by the Minister on 9th January last, and when I tell him that I am reading from the report of the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; he will not attempt to question it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Speaking at Clonmel on 9th January, 1933, the Minister gave expression to the following statement when speaking in connection with the railways: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil faced the situation determined to put it right&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we ask of the Government on behalf of the railways at the moment.  We ask for fair play and we ask for nothing more. I presume that that is what the Minister meant and what the Deputies now behind him support him in&mdash;that they are determined that the situation shall be put right.  The Minister goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Efforts have been made to place the blame for the present state of the railways on the changes of policy effected by the Government.  That was not right.  In fact last year's passenger receipts showed no decline on the previous year, while the fall in the figures representing the value of goods traffic was more due to the cutting of rates than to any diminution in the value of the goods carried.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures given by the Minister <Col N="547" /> yesterday in reply to a Deputy&mdash;I forget who the Deputy was who asked the question&mdash;showed in the last six months of last year, that is the year 1932, compared with the last six months of the year 1931, a falling off in receipts by the railways from merchandise and livestock of £250,000. The Minister will be able to explain what that is due to.  It may not be due in any sense to the policy of the Government, but I question that.  The only other portion of the Minister's speech which I would remind the House about is where he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The principal railway company of this State is not a bankrupt concern. It is going to make for this year all its working expenses, pay its dividends and interests and a lot more besides.&rdquo;</P>

I believe he has made <Col N="548" /> an honest effort to help the railways and that the Bill is going to help the railways.  I wish to appeal to the Minister to insert a clause in the Bill which would provide compensation and pensions for the unfortunate men who were dismissed from the railway service within the past few years. Those unfortunate men, most of whom have large families, are now existing on the rates and drawing home assistance. Over 100 shop men have been dismissed at Limerick, most of them having from thirty to forty years' service.  They were dismissed without any compensation after those long years of faithful service.  I sincerely trust and believe that the Minister will accept an amendment when presented to him to deal with this state of affairs and to help the unfortunate railwaymen who were dismissed without any compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not approach the consideration of this measure with any great enthusiasm.  I am not at all satisfied from having read the Bill&mdash;in fact the two Bills&mdash;that there is either a complete comprehension of the situation or a real attempt to solve it. Those two measures, or one of them at any rate&mdash;the one which has formed the subject of most of the discussion, the Road Transport Bill&mdash;stereotypes the present situation.  It really leaves things as they have been for the last few years, and whatever deficiencies or weaknesses there were in the transport problem during that period are going to remain.  There is no real attempt to correct them.  Whatever attempts there are, are so slight as to effect practically no change.  When the Minister addressed himself to this subject during the last few years, either as Minister or as a member of the Dáil, he spoke merely as a politician, much in the same way as we have heard speeches from the Labour Party.  We are not taken in by the abuse which is going on between the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party over this particular transaction.  We know pretty well that adversity has made strange bedfellows, and they are going to remain, however they may quarrel, in the bed.  The real situation with regard to the railways has been <Col N="549" /> ignored.  In fact, with regard to the transport question, what ought to have concerned the Minister, and what ought to have engaged his attention is what transport is there in this country to be carried, how best and most economically can that be done, and how in all the circumstances ought there to be consideration given to the huge sum of money that has been invested in the Great Southern Railroad and all its branch lines?  It was rather amusing if not tragic to listen to the contribution which has come from the Labour Party, not alone to-day but on other occasions, regarding the Act of 1924.  Yesterday one member of that Party was speaking in such a way as to attempt to proscribe the Railway Act of 1924,&mdash;that it had harnessed on to the Great Southern Railroad all those branch lines, which were dragging it down and making it impossible for it to live. He said a few moments later that he was sure perhaps the very worst clause in all the Acts we had before us, clause 8, ought not to be in operation.  What was it?  The closing of the branch lines.  That is the nonsense the people of this country have had served up to them, by the Labour Party with occasional hear-hears and occasional hurrahs from some of the unfortunate Deputies who have supported them during the last few years.  The consideration with regard to this country is what amount of traffic is there in it and how best can it be carried at the cheapest price and with the greatest advantage.  In all my journeys around the country there was only one town in which I got a clear appreciation of the advantage of the 1924 Act,&mdash;the town of Tralee.  There there was not alone consideration of it but almost unanimity on the part of the people with regard to a clear judgment of the Act.  They had banded themselves together&mdash;shareholders, business people and operatives&mdash;with the result that there was practically no lorry traffic going in and out of Tralee.  The railroad and the railway terminal were in an economic condition and the business people appreciated the real advantage of the 1924 Act, in so far as business men, &mdash;A, B, C, D and so on, each <Col N="550" /> and every one, &mdash;paid the same freight and got the same advantage, no man getting anything more than another.</P>
      <P>One of the claims the railroad company puts up, and I cannot see how it can possibly be conceded, is the fact that they are competing with people who are entitled to bid almost any price in respect of traffic.  When I read about the maximum charges in the Bill I think it is the joke of the whole measure.  Nobody is going to charge anything in excess of the maximum charge, because of competition and so on.  The trouble as far as the railroad is concerned, from my information, is that they have had to deal with people who are prepared to bid under them, and the railroad, by reason of the clause in the Act of 1924 which protects business and commerce, unable to bid a lower price for traffic, cuts its expenses and gives the advantage to everybody else who is dealing with the railroad company.  That is a problem which requires less politics and more business.  If we had less politics in connection with the consideration of this matter and a good many other matters we could approach the solution of them with less fencing and less attempts to cajole and mislead the people.</P>
      <P>Listening here this evening and last night to one of the Labour speeches, I was satisfied there was very little hope of getting a matter of this sort discussed in this House, or getting from people such as Deputies Norton or Davin real, honest opinions about how things should be conducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the situation here with regard to these railroad companies at the moment?  The Minister's speech in January last, and the Minister's speech yesterday, were a nice contrast.  At the one he is speaking to a huge number of people, I expect, each one of whom thinks that he is the rising hope of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;all the rest of them are duds&mdash;and well they might be.  I have noticed an entire absence of any Ministerial support in connection with this measure.  For a short time he was planked with the President but he escaped as soon as was possible. I do not believe the Ministers could stand an examination of this Bill.  If <Col N="551" /> so, the Executive Council has considered this matter very carefully, as we heard yesterday about the equities of the reduction of the railroad stock and so on.  I do not believe the Ministers had before them the history of the company, how the ordinary stock holders started, how the preferences were added on, how the four per cent. guaranteed came after them.  I do hope that the Minister will give, at least a historical account of that before we reach at least the Committee Stage of the next Bill.  What is the situation?  Here is a company, and I suppose the Minister, although he gave a half-hearted blessing to the railroad company yesterday, has some interest in it.  He represents a constituency in which there are more railroad men living proportionate to the population than in any other district, and even considering he had no interest there, the fact that his constituents are there ought to give him some.  What is the situation?  Last year the railroad company got something like three millions for receipts, paying debenture stock and paying their ordinary working expenses.  What is left over?  Forty-four thousand pounds.  According to the Minister yesterday necessary renewals had not been carried out in certain portions of the track.  According to him during the last few years very much money ought to have been spent upon renewals.  If my recollection is correct, I think he went into the neighbourhood of six or eight thousand pounds in that connection.  We have from the Labour Party and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party absolute indifference to the rights or privileges of the stockholders or debenture holders.  Let us ignore that for the moment.  What is the position of this company at the present time? Who owns it?  Who has prior charge to-day or prior lien on it?  The debenture shareholders, who are usually rich men.  Why is it held by rich men? Because it affords a maximum security for the money invested.  It is a much higher price, and the consequence is you have to accept a lower dividend. If, and when, there is a further reduction in the receipts of this company, if <Col N="552" /> next year they are unable to pay even the £3 8/- per cent., the Minister proposes to reduce the dividend upon this debenture stock, and if the Minister's advisers tell him that the situation in regard to the railroad track is such that money must be spent on it, who is going to find it?  Where is it to come from?  Is the State going to put it up?  Is this Bill a real attempt at what is called nationalisation by the Labour Party?  What is nationalisation? Does it mean that the State is going to come in and accept whatever property there is there to put it into order?  Does it mean the State is going to subsidise a concern in order to put people in employment whether or not the results are such as would entitle them to remain there?  I think by this time, at any rate, Ministers of State will have abandoned that idea if they have had it.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to this railroad company is this, as I see it: They are down this year on the receipts of last year, in eight weeks, something like £57,000.  The Minister can contradict that figure if he likes.  Taking the eight weeks as a proportion of the year it would mean if it were to go on at that rate that they would be down something like between £350,000 and £400,000.  If that goes on for the year then I cannot see where the interest is to be paid on debenture stock, and if we are to take the Minister's statement about the renewals which ought to have taken place and that the work must be done some other time in the future, then I put it to him he must consider the question of the debentures from a different standpoint than in this Bill.  Equity&mdash;all these nice terms are of no avail if you want to borrow money on something in respect of which there is no return going to come.  I would strongly advise an examination of the whole transport problem by, let us say, two officers of his Department, whom he knows as well as I do, with an accountant and an engineer added to them, to present to the Ministry, what, in their opinion, would be the best scheme that ought to be adopted in order to give the people an economic transport system and to get the maximum number of persons employed; to <Col N="553" /> save, if it is possible to save, the money which is being invested in this enormous concern, and to meet the natural and normal requirements of the people.</P>
    <P>Listening yesterday and to-day to the talk that is going on from the Labour Party about messing in the railroad company, one might ignore the fact that in practically no country in the world are there prosperous railroads at the present moment.  In the most prosperous countries they have been down, unless in recent years.  We cannot ignore the fact that an army has come in to attack the receipts of railroad companies and that the receipts of railroad companies have been diminished and that their expenses are practically maintained, and that this Bill is giving no relief in that connection, unless it is accepted by the Ministry that the reduction of 12 per cent. on debenture stock is going to be of advantage.  Looking over, as I have said, all the particular regulations that are made in order to prevent, and it is only preventing, not improving, any further attacks in respects of carrying merchandise, there is no other advantage to the railroad company in this connection.  In a very short time, if not at the present moment, the railroad company would be unable to acquire any of these companies or of their property.  Their cash position is not such as would make that an attractive proposition, and it is not likely to improve. Enormous economies have been made, and the amalgamation scheme, which took place some years ago, enabled economies to be made, and it is all nonsense to talk about five or six or seven monuments that are a heritage of the late Administration.  The fact is that people do not bring traffic to the railroads&mdash;either merchandise or passengers&mdash;and you cannot expect directors to mine gold or silver or copper if the receipts do not come in from the goods, and they cannot be expected to be able to maintain the various employees.  A stage may be reached within the next few years if better attempts are not made to deal with the situation, and I do not <Col N="554" /> believe this Bill is sufficient to deal with it, when further inroads will be made on rail employees, and further reductions are almost inevitable in the circumstances.  Do you think for a moment, even members of the Labour Party, that it is a pleasure to railway directors to let men go?  Do you think that if there has been a change in the transport system or transport agencies of the country that people are disemployed in one direction they are not employed in another? In a publication issued by motorists it is claimed that 100,000 persons are at present employed in motor traffic.  I suppose I would be two of those, having two hands employed.  The Minister is probably another.  They probably doubled the number of cars in order to get the number of persons employed.  If five, six or seven thousand men have gone out in railroad transport a considerable addition has been made in the other direction. It is all nonsense to be bringing in that kind of stuff here when the problem that has got to be solved requires sane consideration and a sound judgment in order to effect it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals in this connection are utterly and entirely incomplete.  The advantages that he offers to the company&mdash;to allow it something like £15,000 a year&mdash;are negligible.  Deputy Norton said last night that if the Ministry had £285,000 to give away there were other people to give it to.  It is gone already, and there is no question of the railroad company getting it.  It is the interest on the money which the Minister is graciously foregoing.  I suppose he realises that in a short time he is not going to get that.  I take it from the other portion of the speech that he has made that the position of the company, as Deputy Good pointed out, requires more careful consideration from two angles.  I have here the speech of the Chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company in connection with the position of the director who represents the L.M.S.  I have before me the Act providing for that appointment.  The Act is No. 61 of 1924.  The Minister was otherwise <Col N="555" /> engaged at the time that Act was passed, and as he may not have read it I will quote a portion of it for him.</P>

      <P>Whereas the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company under and by virtue of the Agreement made the 25th day of February, 1904, between the London and North Western Railway Company of the one part and the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Company of the other part scheduled to and confirmed by the London and North Western Railway Act, 1905, is entitled to nominate a person to be a Director of the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company one of the amalgamating Companies mentioned in the First Schedule to the Railways Act, 1924:</P>
      <P>Now there was an agreement.  What was it?  Was it in connection with the loan of £100,000, and if that particular accommodation were not afforded would the railroad company have been liable for the repayment of that sum of £100,000?</P>

      <P>The Minister is the person responsible.  He is standing over this Bill.  It makes an alteration in that arrangement which, as I have said, I am advised leaves the railroad company liable for this sum of £100,000 plus interest.  I have here before me the statement of the chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company, who dealt with that point at the meeting of the shareholders on Friday last, 3rd March.  He is reported in the newspapers on the 4th March to have said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Free State Government of that day, however, for reasons which they fully expounded in the Dáil, passed a special Act in 1924, providing for that London, Midland and Scottish representation, which in their judgment was necessary to conserve most valuable financial advantages.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The reports of the Ministerial statements in the Dáil leave no doubt as to the weight and importance of the financial considerations which induced the then Government to provide by Statute for this representation. These considerations, so far as I am aware, exist to-day in full, as they did then, and it is naturally a source of serious alarm and apprehension to us to feel that the continuance of very substantial and undoubted financial benefits may be in peril or disappear with the enforced removal of the London, Midland and Scottish representation on our Board.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the members of the Labour Party spoke in this debate last night. Listening to him one would think that this was a great national triumph&mdash; getting rid of a Britisher on this Board. What is the position of Deputy Davin with regard to that?  Has he got any Britisher in the trades union which regulates his business?  He is a member of a trades union, that, I understand, has an Englishman guiding its destinies.  I wonder if Deputy Davin and his friends think it a great national triumph to come in here and see this thing, which is going to cost us money happening?  I understand that the sum of money involved is <Col N="558" /> £100,000, and that there are advantages in connection with through rates amounting to something like £20,000 a year.  Are we to throw these things away lightly?</P>
    <P>The other item referred to by Deputy Good was that the losses of the railroad company are even greater than £47,288 per annum.  They were getting something from the local authorities.  It is right to say that we absolved the local authorities some eight years ago of the payment of this sum after 1933 or 1934, but the fact is that the nonpayment of this sum by one year or two is going to be serious for the railroad company.  It practically means that they will be without £50,000 worth of receipts after paying the 4 per cent. preference, but that is beside the point.  I am concerned with two main things (1) that something like 14,000 persons are employed in the railways at the moment and that their continued employment is a matter of grave concern; (2) that if and when further moneys are required for renewals or for other expenditure in connection with railroad work the writing down of the capital of the company, the reduction in receipts and the further difficulties due to losses in income will be all against any borrowing that may be made.  To speak of nationalisation simply means that the national coffers are going to be used as a sort of sieve to make up what might be reasonably expected from commercial or other enterprise.  These Bills, to my mind, will not help the situation.  Deputy Good mentioned some cases of hardship amongst stockholders. I have heard of many other cases&mdash;people who during the last twenty or thirty years, seeking for a safe and national investment and desirous of keeping their money here at home, invested it here at home in the belief that their country would be able to survive the general economic depression and that they would be investing their money well if they put it into this company. Now we see, according to the Minister's statement, that there is very little hope for the ordinary stockholders or for the guaranteed preference <Col N="559" /> or the debentures.  The suggestion that I have made regarding an examination of this question might command very much more political support than the Minister thinks.  It is agreed, I think, on all sides that the country is entitled to a sound economic transport system.  It is agreed, perhaps, that the changes that have been made during the last few years necessitate a different approach to the solution of the problem.  There are districts in the country which were not supplied at all with a competent or efficient transport system some eight or ten years ago and those are now served by various transport services. A question which we might consider is: can each and every one of those individual services, individually owned and individually run, afford a livelihood to each of the persons engaged in them, or would a unified system of road and rail transport, fashioned on a sound basis and managed on a central basis, give as good service and, at the same time, give employment to a considerable number of people and secure for the investors that confidence in the business capacity of the company which is desirable in all cases?</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to say a few more words.  The last six months have been perhaps the worst which the company has known.  If the economic war continues, the next six months will perhaps be even worse, and the Ministry might reasonably consider when and how far they can get rid of their politics and get down to business and realise that the best interests of this country are in the expansion and improvement of the agricultural industry and that it cannot bear any taxes on the exports of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose not to discuss, in the few sentences I wish to speak, the question of the financial provisions of the Railways Bill, but I want to examine one statement made by the Minister and one statement only.  I would like to get to the bottom of it, if I can.  That is, the statement in which he said that the policy of the Government in this <Col N="560" /> matter was essentially bound up in the connection between these two Bills. The Transport Bill contains provisions by which the Minister hopes to secure, as I see it, the transfer of the transport of the country largely to one body which, at present, is the railway body.  But the method that he indicates for securing that transfer is&mdash; and I hope he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that that company should be enabled to buy up existing interests in other modes of transport.  Now, the only way in which I can explain his insistence upon the dependence&mdash; the fundamental dependence&mdash;of these two Bills upon one another is the following&mdash;at least, it would seem to me that this would be the sequence of events that are likely to occur. Whether that was his plan or his reason for thus connecting the two Bills I am not prepared to say, but, as I foresee the future of the matter, it would be this: That if his wish is secured and a unification of the transport modes brought about by the buying out of other interests by the railway company, that would involve a large addition to the capital of that railway company and that, therefore, it would be necessary in the first place to diminish what he believes to be, and what a great many people believe to be, the already excessive capital of that company; and that, therefore, he regards it as necessary to take this other measure, which I regard as an unprecedented measure, for proceeding by force to diminish that capital. The process, therefore, would be that by the Railways Bill we would forcibly cut down the capital of the company. We would give the railway company the power to buy out other existing interests in transport and, if the Minister's object is secured, in order to do that they would have to spend a very considerable sum of money and thus again increase their capital. What guarantee is there, when that has been done, and the company is again brought to the position of having more capital than it can pay dividends on, that another Bill would not follow to again cut down the capital in the method as indicated in the Railways Bill?  I want to ask the Minister if <Col N="561" /> that is a likely forecast for the future of the sort of security that is afforded to the railway company in its attempts to secure the capital which would be necessary in order to carry out his own policy?  I do not propose to discuss the methods of the Railways Bill at all now, but I hope to reserve that for a later discussion.  I do think, however, that it is important to analyse the reasons for what is claimed to be the essential connection between the Transport Bill and what is called the Railways Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the surest indication which we have had yet that these Bills are likely to have the effect that we intend on the transport situation in this country is that, apparently, they please nobody.  Most of the Deputies who have addressed themselves to these Bills and who expressed their opinions on them did so from one point of view or the other&mdash;either from the point of view of the employees or the owners&mdash;and the fact that neither is satisfied is an indication that we are attempting to effect the changes which the situation calls for without regard to the particular sectional interests that are likely to be affected.  Another indication which we got from the speeches is that of which the President spoke at one time&mdash;I mean that the desire to eat omelettes without being under the painful necessity of breaking eggs still persists in certain parts of this House.  A number of people think that it is possible to take out of the present chaotic disorganisation of the transport system an organised, economical system, without prejudicing particular interests, without rubbing certain people the wrong way, and without producing squeals from different sections when injury is inflicted.  We have found here a transport problem which is almost insoluble. It may be that these measures will not succeed in solving it.  It may be, in fact, that we will have to reconcile ourselves to some transport organisation other than we now contemplate, a transport organisation without railways, or if with railways, railways subsidised out of State funds. Whatever the future holds for us I do <Col N="562" /> not know, but these Bills represent the last attempt that can be made to build an efficient transport organisation on the basis of what is there now. If Deputies are not going to face facts or try to prevent people from facing facts, then they must bear some part of the responsibility for the increased disorganisation that is likely to exist in the future if our efforts to translate that disorganisation into organisation at this stage do not succeed.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Cosgrave's speech was intended to do I am not quite sure. Every second sentence of it had a question mark at the end of it.  He flung out a series of rhetorical questions and did not attempt to answer one of them.  He said these measures were not going to improve the position of the railway company or were not going to solve the transport problem. He expressed the opinion that the 1924 Act was the best possible Act that could be passed and is apparently quite astonished and rather displeased that that Act did not produce the prosperity that it was thought would follow from it.  He therefore suggested that we should establish a Committee which would draw up an economic transport system for the country.  He put a further series of questions in relation to the directors of the board.  However, I do not suppose Deputy Cosgrave had any other idea in mind than to discharge his obligation as Leader of the Opposition in participating in the debate.  In any case, I am quite certain he did not intend to get answers to any of the questions he asked.  He did not ask them as if he intended to get answers.  He was careful to avoid, in the most obvious way possible, having to express an opinion on any of the matters to which he referred.</P>

      <P>I am telling the Deputy what the arrangement is.  I am going to make a speech now.  There will be a brief interlude, during which certain things will be put from the Chair, and I will make another start.  Then everybody else can make the same speeches all over again that they made to-day and yesterday.  The main objection to the Road Transport Bill arises out of the provision about exempted areas.  I have not really found that any Party in the Dáil is opposed to the Road Transport Bill as such.  We are all agreed that the transportation of merchandise by road should be brought under control and that that control should be exercised by the institution of a licensing system.  Some of us are also agreed, at least Labour and the Deputies on this side are agreed, that the same authority that controls the administration of the railroads should also control the administration of these road services.  Deputy Davin is not quite sure of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, the main purpose of the Bill is to bring these services under control and to ensure that nobody will be able to start a service for transportation of merchandise by road unless he has a licence to do so and that these licences will be available only, firstly, for those who are running existing services, and, secondly, for those who are running railways, shipping companies or canal services.  Deputy Davin took in question our definition of an existing service. If he can produce a better definition we shall be glad to use it. The Deputy will recollect that these Bills were originally introduced in December.  We took a period of six months before the date of their introduction in December.  The Bills had to be resurrected following the General Election and we took the period between the 1st July and the 8th February and said that anybody who was running a road service between those two dates should be regarded as operating an existing service.  A merchandise service is not like a passenger service.  A man running a passenger <Col N="565" /> service sends out a bus at 8 a.m. and that bus runs all day, irrespective of the number of passengers he may have to carry.  A man running a merchandise service only sends out a lorry if there is in fact to his knowledge merchandise to be carried.  Consequently a merchandise carrying service might one day have nothing to do and on other days have more to carry than it could attend to.  What we are proposing to do is to ask persons applying for a licence to demonstrate that they were running an existing service during that period&mdash;between July of last year and February of this year.</P>

      <P>Not for the whole of the period but during any part of the period.  We are indicating that those who had an existing service on the 8th February are to be regarded as operating an existing service, even though for the week prior to that or for some days prior to that they might not have been engaged in the carriage of goods at all.  The restrictions imposed on these people are quite considerable. It is the fact that these restrictions are there that makes it quite unlikely that any of the developments which Deputy McGilligan foresaw are likely to happen.  Deputy McGilligan mentioned that there were roughly, 8,000 lorries in the country and that of these 8,000 lorries some 6,000 were in the hands of private traders.  He suggested that the operations of this Bill would induce each one of those traders to apply for a licence as a common carrier.  I think that is not so.  The number of private traders who at any time use their lorries for the conveyance of goods for hire is very small.  One cannot imagine large establishments like Clerys or Switzers, or other of those big firms that have motor lorries for the distribution of their own goods, wanting to become common carriers, subject to all the limitations and restrictions which this Bill would impose upon common carriers and leaving themselves liable to have their business compulsorily acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> Deputy Dillon asked what is a common carrier?  A common carrier is a person who must carry all goods that he professes to carry.  The applicant applying for a licence must set out the goods he wishes to carry, the part of the country that he is going to serve, and he must carry in that area these goods when offered by anybody. He must carry them for reasonable hire and must take due care of them in transport.  The railway companies are not common carriers for many classes of goods.  A person who gets a licence under this Bill will be a common carrier for all the classes of goods he professes to carry.  Out of the 6,000 privately-owned lorries of which Deputy McGilligan has spoken, 5,207 are under two tons.  I do not think that anybody is likely to establish a substantial carrying business with lorries of only two tons.  There are a number of persons engaged in carrying merchandise for hire on roads as a commercial proposition; there are people who do nothing else.  These people are endeavouring to compete on an economic basis.  They may not be able, but it would be their desire to carry out their business on an economic basis.  In addition to these, there are privately-owned lorries, and these are used mainly for the conveyance and distribution of their owners' goods, but they occasionally take some other person's goods for transport at remarkably low prices, at any prices they can get for them. These people have a depressing effect upon the transport business of the country, both on the railway companies and private carrying companies. The main objection, however, was the exemption of certain areas. The general principle of the Bill is approved, and the question of the application of this principle in detail can be considered later on.  I think it will be found that the matter to which the Bill proposes to give effect in principle is satisfactory.</P>

      <P>He would like to see the railway acquire control over road services, operating them for the benefit of the railways.  At the same time he thinks that the restrictions upon certain road companies are too great.  He thinks the railway companies should be required to pay more when they acquire the road services.  He thinks the clauses, in respect of employees of road companies, are not wide enough. In other words, he suggests a good number of things that might be inserted in this Bill, but would make it a little more difficult for the railway companies to acquire that control over road services that would enable them to fulfil the policy that he advocated earlier.  The Deputy ought to be careful not to contradict himself.  He cannot face both ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the objection made by Deputy McGilligan, that the operation of this Bill is going <Col N="568" /> to increase the number of common carriers, will be found to have any weight whatever.  Rather, I think the inclination will be that people who occasionally engaged in the carrying business, who own motor lorries but for another purpose, will cease to engage in the carrying business after this Act comes into force.</P>
      <P>I shall get back to the objection to the exempted areas.  I think there is one amendment necessary, in the Bill, to make it clear that the only services that will be exempt from the operations of the Act are those services carried on exclusively in one exempted area, that is, within a radius of fifteen miles of one of those towns.  I admit that as it stands at the present, the section could be interpreted to mean that a service carried on in two areas, where these areas overlap, would be authorised.  That is not the intention. The intention is that the provisions of the Act shall not apply to the short distance distribution trade which exists, or may exist, in any of the towns specified there.  I do not think that traffic is the slightest use to the railways.  I do not think the railways are in the least anxious to get that short distance haulage.  So far as I have been able to ascertain from the railway managers, they are quite content if where two exempted areas overlap it would not be possible for a person to run a service in both areas. That was not our intention.  Our intention was that the short distant service, which I referred to as suburban service, would not be liable to the conditions and would not be able to get themselves compulsorily acquired by the railway company or some other company did not want them.  It is not a question of exemption from the payment of standard rates of wages or standard conditions or matters of that kind.  No such conditions enter into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask Deputy Norton, who spoke about the length of time people engaged in public service vehicles have to work on the road, to read the Traffic Bill circulated over a week ago.  There is there a section which regulates in a very definite manner the hours of service of those people.  Within these areas which we propose should be <Col N="569" /> exempted areas, road transport is performed mainly by local carriers who do not compete with railway haulage.  I do not think anybody these days would be likely to send goods by rail over a distance of ten or twelve miles.  It seems to us that it would be a waste of time and an unnecessary expense to bring in persons engaged in that short distance haulage and make them subject to the licensing provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that true of Bray and Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be true.  We can consider special cases when we are in Committee.  I am not putting forward this exempted area clause as a principle.  We are merely anxious to get the most convenient method of administration.  The intention is to exclude from the scope of the Bill these short distance carrying companies who serve a useful purpose and do not compete with the railways. They are likely to serve quite a useful purpose in the future, and they can be left there without being subject to licensing provisions and without feeling that any damage is going to be done to the main transport organisation in consequence.</P>
      <P>To each of the towns mentioned in the sub-section there is also a regular steamer service, and whereas most of the steamer companies operating these services do themselves undertake a certain road distribution business, they frequently engage these short distance haulage companies.  I do not think it is advisable they should be put in a position where they might be required compulsorily to purchase them out.  It is true there is a certain discretion retained for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but there might easily be a public agitation if the Minister failed to use that discretion in order to compel the purchase of these companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin is quite clearly misunderstanding the proposals of the Bill when he talks about all the most valuable traffic originating or ending in these exempted areas.  That has nothing to do with it.  The only services excluded are services entirely <Col N="570" /> within that radius.  It has nothing to do with traffic originating in one of these areas and ending outside it or ending in one of these areas and originating outside it.  Any person proposing to engage in that sort of transport business would be required to have a licence and would be subject to the proposed restrictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A matter of that sort could, perhaps, be better discussed on the Committee Stage.  Deputy McGilligan asked what good was it going to do a railway company to have men on the pension list instead of on the pay roll.  I am not quite clear as to what the Deputy is getting at, unless he is taking the line that the railway company should get control of the road services without paying for them.  If the railway company acquires a road service, the acquisition price should include compensation for such of the employees as can prove a reasonable case for compensation.  We think five years' continuous service is a reasonable condition to impose when it is a question of compensation for the termination of an appointment.  Deputy Davin can bring forward an alternative proposal and we can argue it out.  I do not know that there is a case of any Act passed here proposing to give compensation for loss of employment occasioned by a public statute where the period of service is less than five years' duration.</P>

I am not standing on five years as a principle.  Deputies should bear in mind that the more difficult and costly it is made for the railway company to acquire these public road services, the less likely is it that the Act will speedily result in the way we wish, that is, the bringing of all these services under the same control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I used the word in the course of this speech. It has nothing to do with the question. Deputy Norton spoke about the wages conditions.  The Bill provides that there may be attached as a condition <Col N="572" /> to any licence that certain wages shall be paid to persons engaged upon the service.  The Deputy seemed to imply that was unsatisfactory and said that he was going to move as an amendment that certain standard wages should be paid.  What does he mean by that? Is he going to set down the number of pounds, shillings and pence which every person engaged in the transport service is to receive, or will he indicate the nature of the wage with reference to something not under our control? It seems to me the only way you can have supervision exercised in matters of that kind is by giving discretion to the person administering the Act.  He and Deputy Davin spoke on this matter as if a similar power exercised under another Act was not exercised.  He seemed to indicate that at the moment there are persons operating omnibus services who are not paying fair wages to their workers.  If there are such persons, Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin should not keep the information to themselves.  We publicly invite it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We invited it at the time these licences came for renewal last October.  Does Deputy Davin know what happened?  Does he assert an objection was not made?  It is undoubtedly the existence of that provision that has tended to prevent undue wage-cutting being introduced into an industry where competition is very keen.  It is where that type of competition exists that the tendency to cut wages unduly operates.  That tendency was in that particular trade, and it was checked by that provision in the Act, but I want it proved before it is asserted that the powers given by the Act have not been used as they were intended to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister then granted licences to bus companies who were paying conductors employed by them 17/6 a week.  To my knowledge, as a result of the representations made, that wage has been increased to 25/- a week; but that does not get away from the fact that the licences were granted when the low wages were being paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has to bear in mind that the Act which came into operation last year was operated so that licences were given to all persons who were entitled to and asked for them in July; but these licences came up again for renewal in October.  It was in October, after the Act had been in operation for three months, that this question of an objection came into operation. Licences were given to persons entitled to them at the earlier date. That was the date which had been fixed at which these licences would be given.  These licences came up for renewal and then it was open to hear objections as to the rate of wages paid or to hear objections on any other grounds.  If objections were then made and sustained the licensee would be required to conform to the conditions which would make it possible to renew the licence.  I think the best course for me to take now is to conclude on the Road Transport Bill.  Most of the things that I have to say relating to the Railways Bill can, I presume, be said immediately the motion for Second Reading is made.</P>

      <P>As far as the Great Southern Railways are concerned they have never suggested that there would be any financial difficulty in carrying out the policy of acquisition.  In fact, their only difficulty has been in respect of goods services.  Until this Bill is passed they could not carry out the policy of acquisition of these services with safety, as a new service might spring up to replace the service which they had bought and paid for.  When the Road Transport Bill of 1932 came into operation the difficulty with regard to the acquisition of the bus services was removed and the company were able to carry out successfully the policy of acquiring the competing services, and the railways company has now a monopoly in its own area of the passenger carrying business.  They have intimated to me that they are willing to carry out the same policy as regards the goods services.  It does not follow from that that every goods service will be acquired or that I will make an order for the acquisition of every goods service in the area.  As to the point made that the railways company may not be in the position to do it I want to say that they have never suggested to me that they would not.</P>

The new Standing Orders appear to be that if a Bill is promoted for a particular interest or for the interest of any individual or locality that that stamps the Bill as a Private Bill.  A Bill having that character may become a Public Bill if it is taken up as a measure of public policy.  For that reason it is not possible to say that this is a Private Bill.  But there is this other characteristic about it that it is introduced as <Col N="576" /> a measure of a public character.  However, there is a provision in the Standing Orders on Private Bill procedure which deals with this matter.  It is Standing Order 60 and the phraseology is peculiar.  It reads:</P>
      <P>When it appears to the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil that the Standing Orders relative to private business may be applicable to the Bill, the Bill then is referred to the Examiner and the Order for the Second Reading is discharged.</P>
      <P>Taking the line between the two principles it would appear to me to be this, that where a Bill interferes with private property and particularly when it affects the interests of another section of the community then the Bill is the type of Bill to which the Standing Orders relative to Private Bills should be applied.  Clearly if it were introduced as a Bill on public policy then all Bills introduced by the Government cannot be Private Bills. It is not a Public Bill and it is not a Private Bill.  It is a hybrid Bill.  But we have precedents to the contrary. Again assuming that the distinction between either Public Bill procedure and Private Bill procedure is this, that once a question affecting private interests comes into a Bill, that would of itself enable the interests affected by the Bill to be heard.  This Bill is clearly one that affects the debenture shareholders as far as I can understand by one Clause of the Bill, and that is supposed to be for the benefit of another class of shareholders.  So that there is the element of public policy about it, inasmuch as there is interference with one class of the community and that interference with one class is intended for the benefit of another class in the community.  It therefore seems to me that this is the type of Bill to which Section 60 of the Standing Orders should be applied.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was good enough to give me notice yesterday on this point.  That is a very laudable practice which I commend to the House generally.  I have given the matter consideration in its various aspects, and I am of opinion <Col N="577" /> that this Bill should be treated as a Public Bill.  The Bill certainly appears to affect private interests but, in so far as it does, it affects them as a matter of public policy.  This is clearly so, as the Bill is put forward by a member of the Executive Council.  I am further fortified in the conclusion I have come to by the cases&mdash;to take a few examples&mdash;of the Shannon Electricity Bill, the Electricity Supply Bill, and the Creameries Bill, all of which affected private interests and none of which was treated as, or considered to be, a hybrid Bill.  The Bill is preeminently a measure of public policy, and public policy, undoubtedly, overrides and outweighs any consideration of private interests that arises. For these reasons I am ruling that this Bill should be dealt with under Public Bill procedure.</P>

      <P>I am accepting the ruling completely but I should like to get a further point cleared up for our guidance in the future.  You have been good enough to state, in a deliberate way, the reasons why you are ruling that this Bill does not come under Standing Order 60.  The first of the two main points you have dealt with is, I think, that this is a public measure introduced in the interests of the public.  Your test of that is that it is introduced by a member of the Government. I am taking that phrase to mean that any Bill introduced by a member of the Government is a Public Bill and can never have standing orders applicable to Private Bill procedure applied to it.  There is a precedent to the contrary but it was before you occupied the Chair and I do not urge that you are bound by it.  There is the precedent of the Dun Laoghaire Harbour Bill.  It was introduced by a member of the Government and had Private Bill procedure applied to it.  If, after consideration, that ruling is to stand as you have given it, it would seem to me to exclude the application of Private Bill procedure to any Bill introduced <Col N="578" /> by a member of the Government.  That may be right; I am not questioning that point at all.  Secondly, you have founded your ruling on the precedents of the Shannon Bill, the Electricity Supply Bill and the Creameries Bill. So far as my knowledge goes, no point was raised on two of these Bills.  A point was previously raised by a Deputy with regard to the Shannon Bill and so far as I remember&mdash;I am speaking completely and entirely from memory and the matter is somewhat old&mdash;the ruling was that it did affect private interests but that it affected them in the interest of the public generally.  It seems to me that that ruling implied that if private interests were affected in the interests of another group of private persons, that ruling would not have been given.  I am speaking now by way of giving notice that, with your agreement, we should have the ruling you have given&mdash;which I accept completely &mdash; developed at greater length for the guidance of the House in future proceedings.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the discussion yesterday and to-day, considerable play was made on speeches delivered by me on other occasions. In fact, it became quite the thing for any Deputy rising to participate in the discussion to start off by quoting some speech made by me either in this House or at some political meeting outside the House. A speech that seems to have attracted the attention of Deputies to a great <Col N="579" /> extent was that in which I described the Government Party as &ldquo;a pro-railway party..&rdquo;  I am very glad to have it established here that we are all pro-railway, that no Party in the House will repudiate the description of &ldquo;pro-railway.&rdquo;  The only question that arises is whether the Labour Party is more pro-railway than the &ldquo;pro-railway party.&rdquo;  The claim of the Labour Party to be regarded as more pro-railway than the &ldquo;pro-railway party&rdquo; appears to be based upon a number of extraordinary ideas which I am anxious to get cleared up. Deputy MacDermot yesterday asked the Leader of the Labour Party a question which was very much to the point and which has not yet been answered.  I want to repeat it, because the whole question of policy appears to me to turn upon this question.  Are there any circumstances whatever under which the Labour Party would agree that a railway branch line should be closed down?  The whole question turns upon that.  Either the whole purpose of our policy must be to keep trains running over every ramshackle line in the country, no matter how uneconomic and no matter how costly it may be to run each train in relation to the traffic carried upon it, or else we have to fix a point at which we will say: beyond that, the particular line or section of line is not worth keeping in existence and the sooner it goes out of existence the better it will be for the country as a whole, for those who have merchandise to be transported and for the railway companies in particular.</P>
    <P>This is a pro-railway Bill and any action that may be taken under this Bill to cut off the main railway system the uneconomic and non-paying sections of branch lines is designed to strengthen the railway companies, to increase the prospect of their providing employment for railway workers and to assure them a longer and more profitable life.  So much attention has been concentrated upon branch lines that we are losing sight of the main lines.  Again let me state the position with <Col N="580" /> regard to the main lines.  This year interest was paid by the Great Southern Railways Company upon their debentures only by devoting to that purpose money that should have gone, in my opinion, to the improvement of the system, to the repair of the rolling stock, to the bringing up to date of the carriages available for the conveyance of merchandise and to other matters designed to secure the improvement of the railways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the railway companies are not earning enough on the traffic they are now carrying to pay debenture interest and provide properly for the maintenance of the systems.  That, I think, applies to all railway companies here.  It applies to railway companies outside this country.  If we cannot modify that position in some way, if we cannot decrease the charges or increase the revenue, within the life of this Dáil we can contemplate these railways ceasing to operate altogether.  We can contemplate the disemployment not of a few hundred men in some section of a branch line, but of the 14,000 men employed upon railways here.  That is what we have to contemplate.  The only reason why we contemplate and propose to facilitate the closing down of non-paying sections of the line is because by so doing we are helping to preserve the rest of the system.  Deputy Norton stated something with which I fully agree.  He said that the question whether a branch line is remunerative or not should not be considered apart from the broader question of whether the whole system is remunerative or not. In other words, he suggested that if the whole system was earning a profit a particular section of a branch line should not be closed down merely because the particular section is making a loss.  I say, and I said it before, that so long as it is possible to <Col N="581" /> do so we shall regard the railway system as a whole, and if the railway system as a whole is earning a profit sufficient to pay its working expenses, to provide for renewals, and for a return on the capital invested in it, then we should not permit, and we should take the necessary action to prevent the cessation of services upon particular parts of it, when these services were required by the public, on the plea that the services were not strictly remunerative.</P>
      <P>But that is not the position.  The position is that the railway system as a whole is not profitable, that we can contemplate a cessation of services on the system as a whole unless we can take action either to reduce charges or increase revenue or both.  We are taking certain action under these Bills which will tend to increase revenue, but there is no possibility whatever of any action being taken which will increase the earnings of the railway company so as to provide for all the expenses that now fall upon them, plus the obligation of paying a return on the present capital.  Consequently, if we cannot take action which is going to increase revenue, we have to contemplate action which will reduce the charges.  What charges should be reduced?  The directors applied to the Wages Board for a reduction in wages in order to effect a reduction of charges in that way.  I do not want to express an opinion upon that because of certain developments that are going on at present, but I should like to say, arising out of Deputy Good's remarks, that it is producing an entirely false picture in the minds of Deputies and of the general public to refer to railway wages as excessive merely because they are 140 per cent. over the pre-war rate, knowing what the present rate of wages is and that a vast number of railwaymen are paid 40/- per week.  If 40/- is 140 per cent. over the pre-war rate, the pre-war rate was scandalous. I think the railway company committed a serious tactical error when they associated their application for a reduction in wages with their pre-war rate, which nobody could attempt to defend.</P>

      <P>It is to his credit.  I assert that these Bills in all parts of them are pro-railway Bills.  I said that we could contemplate doing without the railways.  I did not say that we could do without them conveniently.  I said, on the contrary, that railways are the most economical method of transportation available to us.  I repeat, however, that in an emergency we could get on without them.  We would be inconvenienced, but trade and commerce and the ordinary life of the country would not be made impossible. They might be made dearer and more difficult, but they would not be impossible.  Nevertheless, we want to preserve the railways in so far as they are serving a useful purpose for the country at present, and in order to preserve the railways, to enable them to maintain the present employment and increase that employment, it is necessary not merely to adopt the provisions of the Road Transport Bill, but also to adopt the provisions of the Railways Bill, including the provision relating to the closing down of unremunerative branch lines.  The shutting down of these branch lines will, I think, in time have the effect of increasing and not decreasing railway employment and certainly, in so far as it might make available for renewal work money which is not available now, it should have the effect of increasing employment in Inchicore, and, consequently, Deputy Davin can be assured that I shall have no hesitation in facing my constituents there whether the Bill passes or not.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin quoted at length from speeches of mine which advocated public ownership of the nation's transport.  I explained yesterday why it is that the Bill now before the Dáil is not a nationalisation Bill. It would give me personally great <Col N="583" /> pleasure to be defending a nationalisation Bill, if it were only to hear the speeches that would be made about it by Deputy Good and other members who sit on the benches opposite.  But the fact is that, in our opinion, there were difficulties and objections which made nationalisation of public transport at this time undesirable and less suitable to the present situation than the proposals in the Bill.  That is why the proposals in the Bill before us are not nationalisation proposals.</P>
      <P>On the question of the closing of the branch lines, I want to be quite clear.  I do not want to get powers from the Dáil without the Dáil knowing quite clearly how it is proposed to use them.  We have powers at present under the Act of 1932 to permit the railway company to close down branch lines, sections of the line, or reduce services on them. The powers we are proposing to take here are wider.  I say definitely that if it is shown to me by the railway directors that over any substantial period a particular section of the line has not yielded in revenue enough to pay the working costs on it, then without hesitation I shall make an order for the closing down of that section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy yesterday that we got seven applications for the reduction of services on particular sections of the line under the 1932 Act.  These were applications to take off particular trains, not to close down the line.  In relation to these trains, there were produced to me particulars of the number of passengers who travelled on the trains on each day of each week over a long period.  I found the position was that a train frequently started out with more people working it than were travelling.  There was frequently only one passenger, occasionally no passenger, sometimes two passengers, and only on very rare occasions more than that.  The company was required by law to keep running these trains whether any one travelled or not and <Col N="584" /> the order I made merely released them from that statutory obligation.  It was quite clear not merely that these trains were running at a loss, that the obligation to run the train was imposing a charge on the company which was bound to affect railway employment upon that system and the general prospect of the company's survival, but also that the people in the district did not want the train, that it was not serving any public need; that there had been brought into existence an omnibus service or some other class of service which the people preferred to use and which, consequently, took away from the railways traffic which would have made them remunerative.  I admit that there are a number of branch lines which were never remunerative, and which would never have been built except that grants were available from public funds, or that baronial guarantees were offered.  There are a number of services which, from the day they were built many years ago, were never remunerative, and for which baronial guarantees had to be made good year after year. These services were very often started in the nature of relief schemes.  I do not think it is right that the railway company should have the operation of its main system, which can be made a paying system, jeopardised by the obligation to run services which were not required by the public, and which could never be made profitable under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keyes made a speech here yesterday.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to it.  It was a good speech and, as I think it was the first the Deputy delivered in the Dáil, I would like to congratulate him on it.  It had, however, the glaring defect that the beginning contradicted the end.  The Deputy referred to the Act of 1924 and condemned it.  He said that that Act tied on to the Great Southern Company a whole lot of tin-can railways&mdash;these were his words&mdash;and that the main system was required to carry them dangling out of it for ten years.  He had hardly said that when he proceeded to denounce the proposals in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lartigue was not in the amalgamation.  It was not one of the tin-can railways tied to the main system.  Deputies may like to know something about the Lartigue railway.  I referred accidentally yesterday to a Ballybunion railway porter and I was told by Deputy Rice that there was no such thing as a railway porter in Ballybunion.  There was at one time railway porters there. I want Deputies to appreciate what happened when the Ballybunion-Listowel railway was shut down.  It had an ordinary capital of £22,000 and £9,500 debentures.  That railway was not a paying proposition.  It could not pay the debenture interest.  A receiver was put in and he sold the railway as scrap, realising £1,500 or thereabouts.  I have not the exact figures, but they were not much more than that.  The lesson of the Ballybunion railway might be appreciated by Deputies who are inclined to take a particular line on this Bill.  When the owners of the debentures put in a receiver he could only realise £1,500 on the assets.</P>
      <P>I wish to say something on the question of compensation to be paid to employees made redundant by an order made under Section 8 of the Bill. It has been said that it will be possible for the railway company to evade paying that compensation.  I am inviting Deputy Davin and his colleagues to produce any amendment which will make it impossible for the railway company to evade the obligation in that respect, and I will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with it.  It was suggested that it would be possible for the railway company to transfer men from some other part of the system to a branch line before shutting that branch line, or subsequent to an order transfer persons to another part of the system for a period before dismissing them and, as there would appear to be no connection between the two things, consequently no compensation would be <Col N="586" /> paid.  I want, if possible, to make such action impossible.  The intention is that the company should not have power to do that.  The intention definitely is, where an order is made releasing the railway company from a statutory obligation to run trains on any section of the line, that the employees deprived of their employmen in consequence of the order should be compensated.  The question of measuring the compensation is another matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  That brings me to paragraph (d).  That paragraph was not intended to, and I submit does not, in fact, break any agreement between the company and the trades unions. It is intended to ensure that any agreement relating to the order or dismissal of employees in the case of redundancy will not apply in respect to the railway or the section of the railway to which an order made by the Minister under the Act relates.  In other words, it is intended to provide that if an order is made for the closing of a particular branch line it is the employees on that branch line should be regarded as redundant and compensated and not employees in some other part of the Saorstát.  If that paragraph were not in the section the railway company under the agreement would be required to compensate, not the men disemployed by the closing of the branch line, but to dismiss a similar number of employees latest into the service on some other part of the system.  It is precisely in relation to such manoeuvring that difficulties will arise, that is questions as to whether in fact particular employees were dismissed because of the closing of the branch line or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to put in any safeguard to prevent victimisation. I am sure the Deputy appreciates that if it is to be that it is not the men on the closed line who are to be compensated but some other men on another part of the system, there is every possibility of people disemployed in consequence of an order not getting compensation, because a plausible case might be made that they were dismissed, not because of the closing of the branch line but because of a general decline in traffic. It is much safer, to secure compensation for people entitled to it, that men, if it is a convenient way of doing it, should be disemployed and compensated who were formerly engaged on work on the branch lines.  I am not going to enter into any argument as to the advisability on general grounds of maintaining the agreement that exists between the unions and the railway company.  If I could express an opinion as a private individual, and not as a member of the Executive Council, my opinion might not be at all in support of the maintenance of an agreement of that kind. There is something to be said for it, but I think, as Deputy Davin knows, there is a lot to be said against it.</P>
      <P>It is the fact that from time to time I have received representations from sections of the railway workers against the continuation of an agreement of that kind.  Naturally the outlook and the point of view of the man who is going out first, in relation to such agreement, is altogether different to the man who is going out last.  On general social grounds as well as on other grounds I think there is something to be said against it. It does not arise here.  The only question is whether such an agreement should be enforced rigidly when the circumstances are different to those contemplated when the agreement was made, when dismissals are not due to falling traffic but to the closing down of a section of the line.</P>

If a strong case is made against it I am prepared to reconsider it.  I may say in relation to the closing of branch lines that when baronial guarantees were operative, and when the ratepayers had to make good the guarantees in respect of these branch lines, there were very frequent demands that they should be closed down and that the services should not be maintained upon them.</P>

      <P>I think we can quite easily defend the paying of compensation to railway employees when a section of a line is closed down by Ministerial order, having regard to the general nature of railway employment, having regard to the fact that the services <Col N="589" /> on which these people are employed were services the company were required by law to maintain and having regard to the general social question involved.  It is quite easy to argue that there are other cases of persons who lost employment in consequence of State action that might, in some way, be held to be analogous to the case of railway employees, but there is an obvious argument in the case of railwaymen.  Each case is considered on its merits.  I think the same applies to employees of road services bought out under this Act.  The principle of compensation for railway employees rendered redundant by the operation of national legislation was adopted in the Railways Act of 1924, and is one I think that should not be departed from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said yesterday that this Bill does not provide for the unification of the road and rail services owned by the Great Southern Railways Company, and I said that the only reason why it does not provide for it is because the directors of the Great Southern Railways Company told me that everything that was necessary in the way of preparation for the amalgamation of the three companies into one had already been done, and that it only required the stroke of a pen, and that they would do it as soon as they were requested to do so by the Government, and I said that, here and now, we were requesting them to do it.  If there were other difficulties, legal difficulties, to be got over or other obstacles to be removed, there would be sections in this Bill providing for it.  The only reason that they are not in it is that they are not necessary in our opinion. If we are getting it done voluntarily, why should we compel it to be done? It is my definite opinion that if there is going to be efficiency and, particularly, if there is going to be no reversion to the idea that the prime purpose of the railway directors is to make profits out of the railway, to force back on to the railway traffic that has gone, to stifle all forms of competition for the benefit of the railway, then these railway directors must have direct and immediate responsibility not merely for the operation of the railway system but for the operation of road <Col N="590" /> services, and they should be under one general manager.  The same general manager who directs the operation of the railways should direct the operation of buses and lorries so that there would be unified control and definite co-ordination of all the services.  That is what I mean.  I mean that the I.O.C. and John Wallis &amp; Co. Ltd., as separate companies should be abolished, and that there should be a Great Southern Railways Company, which will, in fact, be a Great Southern Transport Company, operating these services.</P>

      <P>If they do not, we have a new situation.  Deputy Good asked why we did not concede the request of the railway company to be relieved from rates.  I do not see why the railway company should be relieved from rates.  The argument that the railway company should not be requested to pay for maintenance of the roads is to me quite fatuous and <Col N="591" /> unsound.  The railway companies would be quite useless without the roads.  They are amongst the most extensive users of the road and the railways without roads would be very little benefit to anybody.  A great part of the amount they pay in rates goes in maintenance of roads, undoubtedly, but it is the very fact that those roads are there which enables the railways to be availed of, as rail-borne traffic has to be carried by road at some stage.  Deputy Good was also somewhat confused as to the position in respect of the sum of, approximately, £48,000, which has been paid to the Great Southern Railways Company for the past nine years and which will be payable next year, but not afterwards. That payment was made to the railway company because, by the Railways Act of 1924, the liability was also transferred to them of paying dividends on guaranteed stocks to which the baronial guarantees applied. It is quite clear that there is only an additional burden being placed on the company if, in fact, they do pay a dividend on the stock.  If they do not pay a dividend, there is no burden. They have been getting £48,000 a year from the State funds and, in this year, they did not, in fact, pay a dividend on those stocks and, consequently, we must assume that that £48,000, made available from the Exchequer in order to assist in paying dividends on these stocks, was, in fact, used to assist in paying the debenture interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore asked why we were retaining the system of standard revenue.  We are retaining the system of standard revenue because it seems to us that there must be some figure to which standard charges are going to be related.  If standard charges are to be fixed there must be, in relation to those charges, some conception of the revenue to be earned from the railway company, having regard to the volume of traffic likely to be available during the year.  It seems to me that the Deputy when he asked that question had a somewhat different question in mind, but, if we do not relate standard charges to standard revenue, we must relate them to something <Col N="592" /> else, and I cannot think of any other system as suitable as the one now in existence.  Certainly, the mere fact that it is in existence is an argument against changing it unless there are sound reasons for doing so.  On the question of facilitating the railway company in taking up lines after an order releasing them from the obligation to run trains on them has been made, that can be considered, and I have already expressed the opinion that, if an order is made closing a branch line or a section of a line, it is unlikely that, at any future time, services will be resumed and, consequently, there need be no objection to the company removing the rails, but they must maintain fences and rails and bridges which they are obliged to maintain in the present situation.  As to the turning of the permanent way into roadways, I am not at all sure that the suggestion is a feasible one, but it is something that will arise, in any case, in the future.</P>
    <P>The question has also been raised here of the consequences to the company of the removal from the board of the member nominated by the London, Midland and Scottish Company. I said yesterday, and I repeat it here, that, no matter what the consequences may be, we should make that change.  What the consequences are likely to be I do not know.  I do not myself anticipate that they are likely to be serious.  The concession was given to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company in return, we are told, for an agreement entered into which secured for the Great Southern Railway Company certain preferential distribution of receipts from through rates, involving a profit of £20,000 a year.  Whether in fact they are getting a profit of £20,000 a year out of such preferential treatment now I do not know, but I said before and I say again that if the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company are giving £20,000 a year to the Great Southern Railways Company they are getting the best of the bargain. I have never detected in the minds of those associated with that company the slightest desire to give an Irishman anything they could keep from him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> We had of course a lot of discussion about the proposals for reconstruction of the company's capital and we are going to have more discussion upon that.  I do not propose to deal with it at any great length now, but the suggestion has been conveyed that in interfering with the rights of the debenture holders we are doing something without precedent, something that should not be attempted, and something the morality of which is open to question.  I do not believe that.  If we were proposing to acquire the railway companies and offering to buy out the rights of the debenture holders at double the present market price of their stocks, I am sure nobody would question our generosity.  If we undertook to buy out those stocks at the highest price at which they were quoted on the Stock Exchange since the amalgamation took place people would consider it reasonable enough. The highest price at which debenture stocks have been quoted since the amalgamation was 75.  We are proposing to reduce them to 85.  The present market price, as I have mentioned, is £35.  I have already pointed out, and I repeat, that a gilt-edged security earning four per cent. interest is worth more than £35 to-day.  £100 stock paying regularly £4 per year return and secured upon valuable assets would be quoted in or about par at present money prices.  The fact that Great Southern Railways Company debenture stock paying 4 per cent. interest, on which a default of interest payment has never occurred, is being quoted at £35 and not at £100 is an indication that the commercial community do not believe there is any sound prospect of the company being able to pay that interest for any prolonged length of time.  If, therefore, by reducing the charge upon that stock by 15 per cent. we increase the earning prospects of the company, increase the value of its assets, and give it a reasonable prospect of being able to enjoy a long and profitable life, then we are, in fact, improving the position of the debenture holders and likely to increase the sale price of their holdings.  What the position is likely to be in that respect I do not know.  I mentioned the fact <Col N="594" /> that immediately following the publication of the Bills the market quotation for the debenture stocks showed a considerable jump.  It has gone down again, due possibly to a variety of causes, but the tendency should be for the value of those stocks to appreciate, because there is a better prospect of a dividend&mdash;even a dividend at the lower rate&mdash;being payable upon them for a much longer period than apparently was contemplated.  I may mention here that the railway company probably could not in this year pay the debenture interest at all if adequate provision were being made to maintain the rolling stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The admission of the company themselves that upon their branch lines there are considerable arrears of maintenance and that to bring those branch lines up to first-class condition would involve an expenditure of some £800,000; the fact that on the admission of the railway company and to the public knowledge the arrears of work to be done upon rolling stock are considerable; that railway stations have not been painted; that the general overhauling of carriages and other equipment which should take place has not taken place, apart altogether from the fact that more up-to-date equipment has not been secured. Even the maintenance of the present equipment in a reasonable state of repair would, in my opinion, not be satisfactory, because if the railway companies are going to attract and retain traffic they will have to give continuously improved services to their customers.  The whole question of the equity of the scheme of reconstruction depends upon the provision made in respect of debenture holders.  I have mentioned the origin of that scheme. It was prepared at the instance of the Great Southern Railways directors by a <Col N="595" /> prominent firm of accountants.  It was presented to me by those directors as&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as a proposal for the reorganisation of capital, with a view to discovering whether as such it was in accord with my ideas.  I accepted it as being equitable, having carried out certain rough tests to check its equity.  It is, of course, guesswork. Does Deputy McGilligan pretend it is possible for anybody to estimate the future earning capacity of the Great Southern Railways without engaging in a very considerable amount of guess-work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at any time is it going to be possible for somebody to say that for the next ten years he could estimate with certainty what the earnings of the company are going to be.  If it were possible to do that we could eliminate a lot of the guess-work, but the fact that it is impossible to do so makes it inevitable there must be guess-work.  We did apply the obvious tests.  We said that if we assume the same relationship between total capital and standard revenue to exist between present revenue and what the reduced capital should be we get a figure substantially lower than that contained in the Bill&mdash;about £3,000,000 less.  If we take the market price of the stock, I think it was Deputy Good who admitted here to-day that assuming all the holders of stock were willing to sell at the market price you could buy the whole of the railway and all its debentures for less than £5,000,000.  As he stated, if in fact there was any serious attempt to sell the stock, the prices would fall very considerably lower even than they are to-day.  Consequently, considering the estimate which the commercial community of Ireland have fixed upon <Col N="596" /> the value of the various classes of stock, considering the actual earnings of the company and their prospective earnings for many years to come, it seems that this proposal prepared by those accountants is equitable on the face of it.  I am prepared to admit that there is a case for alteration in respect of some of the minor stocks set out in the Schedule.  I think a very strong case could be argued against applying precisely the same considerations in respect of those minor stocks as in the case of the major stocks.  If anyone produces strong arguments against the scheme set out there or produces another scheme which can be shown to be a more equitable distribution of the burden, I am quite prepared to consider it on its merits and if necessary to amend the Bill accordingly.</P>
      <P>Those I think were the main matters which arose out of the discussion that took place yesterday and to-day.  I do not know if it is desired to discuss at any greater length the detailed provisions of the Bill.

    <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;the Dáil declines to give a Second <Col N="597" /> Reading to the Railways Bill, 1933, until an independent tribunal, after hearing the evidence of all interests affected, has considered and reported whether a reduction in the capital of the Great Southern Railways Company is necessary and, if so, what reduction in the various denominations of stock would in all the circumstances be fair and equitable.&rdquo;</P>

First of all, I would like to ask members of the House now that they are fresh from the last jeremiad of the Minister with regard to the hopeless position of the railways to remember what has already been done, and I propose to read again the Minister's own view of the actual situation announced in January of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo; and from other papers not describing themselves thus but which generally give more truth. The best evidence, of course, is the Stock Exchange quotations, not the statement made here yesterday of a funny test that nobody would put a penny into any railway if railways were to be built up again and there was a public issue looked for.  The Minister said that the railways, even though they are pretending to earn a certain amount of money and paying out debenture dividends, are, in fact, only doing that by terrible depreciation of their locomotives, their rolling stock and their permanent way&mdash;as black a picture as ever was painted.  The Minister, when speaking on the other <Col N="598" /> Bill, said that the situation had not altered in its essence in the past twelve months, and that these proposals now before us might have been made at any time in the last year.  Of course, he had to say that because he wanted to avoid one item which occurred in the last twelve months, and which had seriously affected the railways.  That is his statement.  The situation has not altered in its essentials in the last twelve months, and yet he is reported as having said in January of this year:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Though the railways' earning capacity had been diminished by excessive and uneconomic road competition, they were, nevertheless, in a position to pay all their working expenses, interest, wages and something more.  If properly organised and conducted they had many years of useful and profitable life in front of them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It does not sound like a make up. The &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; report is a little more detailed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dealing with the railways, Mr. Lemass said unified control of all public transport services would be established as soon as possible with efficient direction and adequate maintenance.  From the G.S.R. and other railways had been taken to pay interest upon shares, money that should have gone to the maintenance of the permanent way and rolling stock.  Fianna Fáil was a &ldquo;pro-railway Party.&rdquo;  It was essential to the development of the State that the railways should work in harmony with Fianna Fáil's policy of industrialism. The position though serious was not hopeless.  Though the railways' earning capacity had been diminished by excessive and uneconomic road competition, they were nevertheless in a position to pay all their working expenses, interest, wages and something more. If properly organised and conducted <Col N="599" /> they had many years of useful and profitable life in front of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a serious situation but not hopeless, though the railways' earning capacity had been diminished by excessive and uneconomic road competition. And the reply we have just got is the reply of the Government and the best reply to the excessive uneconomic road competition.  Take out these redundant services.  Compensate the people who own them, and superannuate or give some sort of compensation to the employees.  That is the way to deal with the excessive and uneconomic road competition. That is what the Minister said in January of this year.  Now in this month I think the picture he has painted must be described as hopeless. The whole revenue of the railways gone, the rolling stock, permanent way and locomotives all depreciated and all in a bad state of repair, branch lines unsafe for anybody to travel on ....</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Sorry.  &ldquo;Stretches of branch lines unsafe to travel on except going at the rate of 15 to 20 miles an hour.&rdquo;  But the man who was in a responsible position on 9th January of this year could say what I have read.  And the organ of his Party on March 1st has this to say about the future of the railways:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Bills to save the Free State Railways and to control road transport are published to-day.  They propose many important changes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then there is a lot about the directorate.  It then goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The new Bill strives to give better foundations for recovery.  If, after fair trial it proves unavailing, the State can take further steps. But the eventual salvation of our railways will be the ruralisation of industry throughout the land.  In the foundation of local factories and the widely distributed increase of population now in progress there are the elements of a brighter future for our railroads than they have known for generations past.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> So bright that we are going to reduce the capital of these railways.  In facing that bright prospect they will write them down from £26,000,000 to about £12,000,000.  That is the test of the bright prospects the country has. There is a funny way the Minister can speak and then have the brazenness to even attempt attacking a Deputy like Deputy Davin for facing both ways. Of course the situation is clear.  The Minister had said on a public platform on 9th January, and the Bill had been promised to us by 1st January, if he had published that Bill, he knew very well that his Party's prospects and his own personal prospects were not going to be enhanced.  We got the statement from the Minister&mdash;I think nearly every statement he made that seemed to be beneficial to the railways was immediately laid-off with another statement which showed pessimism&mdash;in addition to what I have remarked upon that nobody would put a shilling into the railways if they had to be built again, and all the talk about depreciation of rolling stock.  We are told that it must be recognised that there was traffic&mdash;the Minister had some phrase enlarging on that, but I have forgotten it&mdash;permanently and definitely lost to the railways.  Later he gave a picture of the railways as outworn and obsolescent.  I wonder is that the position that we have got to face up to?  I think it is unfortunate that there has been so many expressions of opinion founded altogether on the present circumstances of the railways, leaving people outside to believe that there is a consensus of opinion in this House that the railways are doomed as the main carrying agency of the country.</P>
    <P>There are three main classes of people affected in any discussion of measures that have to do with transport, particularly a measure dealing with the railways.  These three classes which have certain peculiarities are: (1) railway servants; (2) the shareholders, and (3) the travelling and trading public.  Deputy Davin talked yesterday of the seven thousand monuments to the 1924 Act, the seven thousand railway employees rendered redundant by the operations of that <Col N="601" /> Act.  The last time that I had figures from Deputy Davin was in December, 1931.  He said that the employees, who previously numbered 17,234, had been reduced to 13,400.  If we take the Deputy's phrase, &ldquo;monuments to the 1924 Act,&rdquo; we have this position, that there are 4,000 railway employees who were adjudged by the Railway Tribunal to be redundant, and these 4,000 people got compensation under a scheme which now has the benediction of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce although it was supposed to be iniquitous, both in so far as it put a terrible burden on the employees to prove that they were put out of employment by reason of the operation of the Railway Act, and, secondly, because it did not give them fair conditions until they had proved their case.  It is now accepted, in this 1933 measure that we are discussing, that those who have been put out of employment by reason of the operation of the 1924 Act, whatever the number be, are at the moment in receipt of compensation under a scheme adopted by the present Government and first put forward by the late Government.  Then there are the shareholders.  I do not know what their numbers are, but they are certainly not less in number than the railway employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is the travelling and the trading public. They can be counted in numbers as representing the whole population of the country.  There are peculiarities about the situation of all three classes, but mainly two.  It must be remembered, and should always be remembered with regard to railway employees, that they occupy a peculiar position.  Railway employment was always regarded as having something in the nature of permanency attached to it.  To such an extent was that so that railway employees, after a probation period had been passed, were not liable to deductions on account of unemployment insurance and not open to its advantages afterwards.  In the case of railway employees who at the moment lose their employment it should not be forgotten that they have no unemployment insurance money to <Col N="602" /> tide them over the period of unemployment, and that many of these men were drawn into the ranks of railway employment because of the permanency that attached to that occupation.  That is a matter that should be remembered.</P>
      <P>Similarly with regard to the shareholders. The legislature long ago made provision that if three per cent. was paid in any of the last ten years preceding the investment of funds on the ordinary stock of railway companies in Great Britain or Ireland that the preordinary stock of these companies was subject for investment of trustee moneys.  Later, I think by Court order that reached a point that if any dividend was paid on the ordinary stock of railway companies, then the preordinary holdings of these companies were open to the investment of trustee securities and investment funds under the control of the Courts.  As a result, most railway securities of the pre-ordinary type are in the hands of trustees.  People who have made, or attempted to make, certain provision for dependents, widows and orphans are the types of people who mainly hold railway stocks.  That fact should be equally remembered with the other fact that I have stated with regard to railway employees.  The travelling and the trading public are in a peculiar position.  As I have said, in numbers they really represent the whole population of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrialisation of the country, if it is going to proceed, requires that transport charges should be kept at the lowest possible point.  The employees naturally desire to keep their wages as high as possible and their conditions of service as good as possible.  If you want to make that concrete, what they want is&mdash;it is a natural desire&mdash;to keep wages as high as they were forced up to at the peak point reached during the war years; they want conditions and hours kept as they were fought out and won out, not by themselves in this country, but by English unions with which they were associated, relating hours and conditions and so on to the conditions of the good, big dividend earning English railway systems.  The public in this country wants to get both its travelling and trading <Col N="603" /> cheap.  I suppose a trader wants mainly safety, security and punctuality in delivery.  The passenger wants safety, speed and convenience.  Both want convenience.  In this case that is going to mean door to door carriage of both goods and themselves. There is no doubt that while the shareholder suffered in recent years and while the railway employee found his wages or earnings driven down, the public have made greater and greater demands for cheaper and more convenient transport, reaching a point where, so far as road vehicles are concerned, they were getting, and still are getting, transported under cost.</P>
    <P>But even in these conditions of excessive road competition, with wage conditions fixed and maintained as they were at the peak point and with the shareholder being depleted of the earnings on his money that he had a right to expect, it is quite wrong to say that the Great Southern Railway system is outworn and obsolescent: that its rolling stock, etc., is in such a state of repair that really one cannot have any hope for it.  Can one say that of any system that earned £3,600,000 gross receipts in the year before the one we are in?  Is there any sign of bankruptcy about a company which gathered in three and a half million pounds in gross receipts; which has a road track in this country of over two thousand miles; of nearly three thousand miles of single line of rail; and carried&mdash;leaving out last year which was an abnormal period&mdash;nearly thirteen million passengers; two and a half million tons of goods, and two and one-third million head of live stock? That was not a bankrupt concern to start with.  A concern which has the property of which I have spoken and which has the use of that property is not a bankrupt concern &mdash; thirteen million passengers, and it was on the passenger side that they were being most definitely beaten; two and a half million tons of goods, and two and one-third millions of live stock, with gross receipts earned of £3,617,000.  It is too early to say that that system has passed its day.  Is anybody in a <Col N="604" /> position to say what is to replace it if we take the other ill-considered decision?  Has anybody thought out the economics of road transport?  Is anybody yet in possession of the data that will be required to work out the economics of road transport?  It is not going to be the system that is operating on the roads that will help the railway system to put upon it the thirteen million passengers, the two and a half million tons of goods and the two and one-third millions of live stock catered for by the railways. Remember that if any more of the cream is skimmed from the railway traffic, the railways will not last and provision has to be made somewhere for the thirteen million passengers and for the two and a half million tons of goods and for the two and one-third million of live stock to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Why this House should casually come to an opinion, just because there has been a bad year, and even a succession of bad years, with a completely depressed community and an economic war forced upon them, and with unlimited road competition against them&mdash;why they should say that a railway system cannot make its way under other and more normal circumstances I cannot see.  Unlimited road competition is one of the things from which the railway companies were said to be suffering before this and in 1932 a measure was introduced into this House and is now in operation to effect a change so far as passengers carried by road were concerned.  The Minister yesterday told us that, in effect, the Great Southern Railways Company in its zone had achieved a practical monopoly in the carriage of passengers either in their own railway carriages or in their own buses.  Now it was on the passenger side that the greatest harm was done through unregulated road competition and, if they had this monopoly, their situation should have been better than it was and probably would have been better than it is if it had not been for the peculiarly adverse circumstances that came to operate on them during the last year.  The Minister himself, on the 9th January, talked of the <Col N="605" /> uneconomic road competition.  That could only refer to the carriage of goods, and we have his idea with regard to the mending of that.  Supposing that a year hence the Minister can say with regard to the goods traffic what he said yesterday with regard to passenger traffic&mdash;that the Great Southern Railways Company over its own zone has become the virtual monopolist of the goods traffic of the country&mdash;will not that improve the railway company if there are not adverse circumstances?  At any rate, there are two definite reasons there for hoping that the railway situation will be better.  There will not be any longer merely the railway systems as they used to be, but a system catering both by rail and road for passengers and also for goods.  They will be under the same company, but the old receipts ought to be flowing in and the passengers and live stock and the merchandise ought to go back to the height or the peak point which they previously reached unless there is to be a further decrease in the carriage of passengers, merchandise and live stock and that that is to be a permanent feature of Irish life.</P>
    <P>There have been steps taken previously to consolidate the railway situation. The Minister said yesterday that eight measures have been brought in affecting the position of the railway companies.  I want to refer to one of these measures, but particularly to the one upon which all the other measures were built&mdash;the 1924 Act.  The 1924 Act consolidated the railways system in the country.  If Deputy Davin were here he would retort: &ldquo;Yes, at the cost of the employees;&rdquo; and to that I would retort that whatever employees went out, and a good number of them had been rendered redundant by that Act, were compensated and they were compensated on the scale now adopted by the present Government.  What else occurred?  I used to boast of the one and a quarter million pounds reduction in expenditure that had been achieved under the 1924 Act.  I have got to boast more now.  At the annual meeting of the Great Southern Railways Company this year, the chairman, taking up year by year the <Col N="606" /> economies that had been effected, said: &ldquo;In the whole period since the amalgamation the reduction in expenditure amounts to £1,707,127 per annum.&rdquo; That amount still remained.  If the old gross receipts had remained as before that amount of £1,707,000 in a saving of expenditure would not merely have paid the debentures, the guaranteed preference and the preference, and would have given not merely five per cent. to the ordinary shareholders, but a great deal more.  I think it takes about £800,000 to pay the debentures, the guaranteed preference, the preference and to give a percentage to the ordinary shareholders.  A reduction of £1,700,000 in the working expenses per annum as between the year 1924 and the year we are in now has been effected, and yet there are people who will say that the 1924 Act was a failure.  It has got to be remembered that that reduction in expenditure of £1,700,000 has been achieved after paying compensation according to the terms and on the scale that the present Government have now adopted.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we passed, in 1927, a Road Motor Vehicles' Bill. There may have been earlier Bills passed in other Parliaments giving a company power to go on the roads, but if there were I do not know of them, and I think that our Bill was the first of that kind.  In that Bill we gave them their outlet upon the road for the first time and they seized their chance, although many restrictions were imposed upon the measure by this House, and they could not seize their chance to any great extent because of these restrictions.  In 1931 we went further and advanced to the point of controlling passenger traffic for them, and this year goods traffic is to be controlled.  Those are the steps that have been taken to consolidate the system and, in view of all the circumstances, is it not wise to wait and see what will be the results of these before deciding that the railways are so derelict that their capital must be reduced from £27,000,000 to £12,000,000?</P>
    <P>In addition to the Road Transport Bill with whatever it gives, we have this.  Clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill <Col N="607" /> deal in some way with the reconstructed finances of the company.  The rest has application to the company's position, sometimes a good application, sometimes bad.  We start off in Clause 2 by remitting certain debts due by the company, and the Minister himself, yesterday I think, agreed with the statement of the chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company that this will bring them annually some £15,000. Then let us come to Clause 13&mdash;&ldquo;The Railways (Directorate) Act, 1924, is hereby repealed.&rdquo;  There is a loss from that of £20,000 per annum.  The Minister says he does not know if the Great Southern Railways Company in fact received that £20,000.  Would not a responsible man inquire, just merely put the question and ask to have the answer for this House, before he would decide to repeal the Act which gave them their directorate, which gave the London, Midland and Scottish Company that consideration for the payment of £20,000 per annum?  At any rate let us quote these two things&mdash; £15,000 saved to the company as one item and £20,000 per annum lost to them.</P>
    <P>There is another item.  The London, Midland and Scottish Company invested in this company, through the medium of the Dublin South Eastern Company, about £300,000 from time to time.  There was outstanding a debt of at least £100,000, lasting from somewhere about 1906, 1907 or 1908, with compound interest accruing since.  Has that debt been paid back, or will it be demanded?  If so, where is the company to get the money?  Will they get the bank to lend them a shilling after the Minister's statement as to what were the main charges?  What is that equivalent to in reduced receipts? How many years are to lapse before we get to the situation we were in prior to Section 13 of this Bill having been introduced and passed? The Minister says he does not care whether they lose the £20,000 or not.  He believes that the London, Midland and Scottish Company, if they did make a bargain of this type, got the best if it.  I wonder how?  Was it through having a representative on the <Col N="608" /> Board?  Whatever advantage they used to get in their bargaining or in their dealings with the Great Southern Railways Company, are they going to be defeated in their bargaining powers now simply because their directors are removed from the Board, or is this another instance of the spirit of pessimism which means that they could always overcome the Irish directors? Is it that there is something in the railway system between this country and England which means that they have always the better of it?</P>
    <P>At any rate we ought to know what really was the defect or the deficiency brought upon the railway company by reason of having a London, Midland and Scottish director sitting on the Board.  I think the Minister ought to know before he introduced that, and we are entitled to the information if he did make an inquiry, as to the amount of the debt outstanding and the compound interest which has accrued. However, the directors are to go and that is being hailed with delight by the Labour Party.  If the London, Midland and Scottish directorate are to go from the councils of the railway company in this country, why should not the National Union of Railwaymen be cut off from interference with the affairs of this country?  If we are going to get rid of a director representing an English company on the Board of our company, why should not we get rid of whatever interference there may be by an English railway union in the affairs of this country?</P>
    <P>I wonder is there any member of the Labour Party who is able to tell me whether there is any truth in a story which circulated in this country at the time of the Treaty and which gained currency here in recent years that the N.U.R. made an attempt to cut away from this country.  I understand that the N.U.R. in England, as a group, made up their minds that once the Treaty was signed there was going to be a definite break up.  The N.U.R. was going on the assumption that the Irish Unions were going to secede from the N.U.R.  They acted on that opinion.  They thought that was the principle that was at stake.</P>
    <P>I believe, not out of any feelings of gratitude for Irish railwaymen but <Col N="609" /> simply because they wanted a strong union in this country they did consider whether or not they should establish an Irish union on a sound footing and I understand they came to the conclusion that they should give a sum of money amounting to £20,000 as a war chest for an Irish Railway Union in this country.  They were greeted with a flood of telegrams, and finally they met a big deputation who urged that in no circumstances should there be a break-up in the relations with that union to establish a branch union here.  If we are going to have a clearing out of people who interfere in this country, let us do it root and branch as far as the railway people are concerned.  Why cannot we have our own unions here?  Why not have them financed by our own people? Why cannot they fight their own battles?  If that is not going to be looked into, I would ask the Minister to look into this: to see if there is not required any change in the laws affecting the rights of trades unions here affiliated with trade unions across the water and to see whether they are now receiving certain legislative preferences to which they are not entitled under the law.</P>
    <P>In Sections 6 and 7 of this Bill we have an attack upon the present number of directors, apart from the matter of the London, Midland and Scottish director, and we have an attack on the system by which they are elected.  Why this House should declare as its opinion that postal voting is a more progressive method of election than that of voting at an open meeting and by proxies, I do not know and it has not been argued.  We have Deputy Davin waxing probably more heatedly on this section than any other, except, perhaps, Section 8.  Deputy Davin is going to introduce further amendments to Section 7.  He wants the number of directors cut down.  The proposal in Section 7 is to cut the number down to seven.  Deputy Davin wants the number reduced to six.  I do not know whether the Minister has ever seen a copy of the measure which the Labour Party introduced to this House in 1923 called the Transport and Communications <Col N="610" /> Bill.  If he does come across it he will see that it is a bit of a curiosity.  He will find that this Party which is now so excited about having seven directors at that time proposed a special Minister for transport with whatever secretaries and staff might be required in that Government Department.  They were going to add to him a railway dictator, a man who was to be called a Director of Railways, and then, funnily enough, that Director of Railways was to be assisted by seven railway commissioners, so we had a Minister, a dictator and seven advisers.  And as if that was not enough we are going to have a rates tribunal to determine matters about rates, and other matters now determined by the railway company, and only under the supervision of the rates tribunal.  We are to have, to determine rates, a tribunal consisting of three members, who are to be permanent, associated to a general panel of 12 members, and a railway panel of four.  In addition, we are to have a central board on Irish railway wages and an Irish railway council and after a period the directors are to be left at seven.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not deal with the Wages Board here, and I presume that Board is to be left.  I confess I was terrified lest there should be any attempt to interfere with it, although the power of that Board, and its importance have been very seriously diminished in the last two or three months.  I always felt you must have some such body.  If a strike breaks out, and if people are reasonable then, within two or three weeks they are going to look for some machinery for arbitration; and what machinery could be better than representatives of the two sides to the dispute with an independent chairman; and that is what the Wages Board is.  The Wages Board operated pretty successfully in this country up to recently.  I cannot understand why, when that Board is called into consultation and after they have made a decision which has always been respected, recently their decision should be called in question.</P>

      <P>I am not denying the claim that could be made, or that might be made.  But a claim was made and it was argued out and the Board decided that a particular thing should be done.  I put it to the Deputy, if you are going to have conciliation machinery and its award is not accepted what position are you in? What is the conciliation machinery for?  What are you driven back to? You are driven back to the machinery of the strike and eventually again to the machinery of conciliation and what better machinery can there be for that than a body composed of representatives of both parties and an independent chairman?  We have a situation now that the award has not been accepted, and that the conciliation machinery, to some extent, has been scrapped though not entirely. The demand for a new award was made in abnormal circumstances.  I can well imagine following what the Minister said as to the meaning of the abnormal circumstances that they had to be scrutinised, and that because of politics a proper plea could not be put forward.  Why should the railwaymen suffer because the railways have in recent months suffered much from the economic war?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. I said it was their aim to enjoy the peak wages but they did not succeed. It is a natural aim for one to hope to continue to enjoy peak wages.  We all want to do that.  There has been that award, and although I admit there have been successive cuts and that each cut that came made the latest cut more difficult, yet despite all that this machinery to award cuts, to decide upon awards, is in existence.  The latest cut is not even void now.  It has been postponed until April, and one of the Bills here has some relation to it.  In this Bill there is Section 8 about which Deputy Davin has definite hopes, and with that is to be read the second sub-section of Section 13.  I do not see any great difference.  I see some differences and I think they are advantageous as between this and the section repealed in the 1932 Act.  The only thing I want to make inquiry about is that in the previous section of that Act now repealed the Minister had to be satisfied that there was alternative transport, and not necessarily alternative transport under the auspices of the company making the application.  In this the company has to satisfy the Minister that they are to run an alternative transport.  I want to know rather would the alternative transport run by somebody else satisfy.  So far as this means that branch lines will have to be closed down, if it can be proved to the satisfaction of the Minister that they are unremunerative, I am with him.  I do not see how anyone can claim that they should be kept running and in employment when they are not remunerative.  It would simply mean that they are going to be kept there as charities.  I asked yesterday to have the simple thesis argued out, leaving exaggerated capital out of it, whether if it can be shown that a particular branch line is not improving and <Col N="613" /> is unremunerative yet notwithstanding, and despite that fact, that branch line should be kept going.  Outside that, and in addition to the sections to which I have referred, namely, 3, 4, and 5, there is Section 10 which I frankly confess I do not understand.  I do not know what it means.  I do not know whether it means that the Railway Tribunal is not to be paid, when dealing with rate matters, or whether, when dealing with rate matters it is going to charge fees to meet its expenses.  I presume that is rather the fact, but it is not carried out in the wording of the section which, I think, is not perfectly drafted.</P>
      <P>We have in the Bill, to meet the railway situation, Section 3, 4 and 5. I said previously, when talking about these awards that the conciliation machinery might be called into being again soon.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce warned the House here, the other day, that the wages award was not void but was only postponed. I want to know what is the Minister's idea.  Has he any proposal definitely about whatever sum of money is likely to be saved by the cutting down of the debenture interest? There are three sets of people who may claim a share if any is to come.  There are the employees; there are the postponed shareholders like the ordinary shareholders, and there is the travelling and trading public.  If I am to take this Bill as meaning anything, Section 5 would indicate that the travelling and trading public ought to get the advantage of anything saved from the debenture holders, because it says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5 (1).  As soon as conveniently may be after the passing of this Act the Railway Tribunal shall reconsider the standard revenue...and after hearing the Minister and all other parties desirous of being heard and appearing to the Railway Tribunal to be interested the Railway Tribunal shall adjust and vary the said standard revenue to such extent (if any) and in such manner as appears to the Railway Tribunal to be just and equitable in consequence of the reconstruction of the <Col N="614" /> capital of the company effected by this Act and the Railway Tribunal shall fix the amount of the standard revenue accordingly.</P>
    <P>That would indicate, on first reading, that you present the Railway Tribunal with this new fact, that so much&mdash;a quarter of a million or so&mdash;is saved from the debenture shareholders. Readjust standard revenue in accordance with that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he did not think standard charges were going to be lowered.  Standard charges depend on standard revenue, he said.  What does this phrase mean?  I will consider it in its application to the 1924 Act as meaning one thing.  The Railway Tribunal in deciding upon standard revenue had not to take into consideration anything about the distribution of the revenue?  All they had to decide was what charges will, with efficient and economic management, bring to the company a net income equal to the average aggregate net income enjoyed by the absorbed or amalgamated companies for the three years ending with the year 1930.  Are they given new terms of reference in this?  Are they asked to reduce standard revenue and, therefore, standard charges by the amount going to be saved?  If that is so and if the trading community is going to get the benefit of whatever is taken from the debenture holders, that is one situation.</P>
    <P>I should imagine that the new situation, as it presents, itself to the railway employees, is a perfectly clear one also.  There is no award against them; it has been postponed.  Their Northern brethren have been asked to get the Railway Board to see whether there are no new circumstances that will bring about a new award.  Surely there are new circumstances here.  I recommend to Deputy Keyes that he should bear in mind the previous eight outs which so affected his thoughts and the thoughts of the people for whom he speaks.  He should now definitely associate himself with this measure and he can definitely say to the conciliation machinery, if it is brought together again, that there are new conditions. He can say that the award that has been made against them, but that is <Col N="615" /> not yet operative, should be indefinitely postponed.</P>
    <P>If it is neither of these two things that is to happen, then provided always that the traffic will keep at the same point or will increase, the shareholders are going to get some benefit.  Has the Minister a proposal about it?  Does he intend that whatever is looted from the debenture shareholders, the owners of the railways, should go to the trading community, the employees, the other shareholders, or all three?  The only section that has any reference to it is Section 5 and, on first reading, it looks as if it is a matter for the Railway Tribunal to determine and so reduce standard charges.  I do not think it bears examination when Section 52 and 53 of the original Act are put together.  That leaves us with Sections 3 and 4.  I suppose the Minister must have, with a certain amount of cynicism, seen Section 4 written.  Reference is made in that section to trustee securities, but whether any trustee money will be hereafter invested in them is a completely different matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If anyone listened to the Minister to-night, he would go away feeling that nothing he had control of would ever again go into railways. It has one good point about it, it prevents the immediate realisation, or an attempt immediately to realise, trustee securities with a view to further and new investment.  In so far as it gives a breathing space of two or three years, it is all to the good.  In so far as these are going to rank again as trustee securities, that day had passed. That leaves us with Section 3, a section which cuts down the property of the people who really own the railway system&mdash;the debenture holders.  Yesterday the Minister, in answer to Deputy MacDermot, used a very peculiar phrase, a very cryptic phrase, with regard to debenture holders and the necessity for unanimity amongst them. Deputy MacDermot asked him would it not be possible to postpone for some period dealing with the property of the company in this way so as to find out what the debenture holders thought of <Col N="616" /> it.  The Minister replied that that requires unanimity.  That was the simple phrase.  Under certain circumstances which are likely to occur, if the Minister's view is correct, debenture shareholders can take possession of the railway; they can divide out whatever funds are in reserve; they can sell the property for what they can get and divide the spoil.  They can put in a receiver to do various things for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister is quite right when he says that if you could collect all the debenture holders in one room and if all of them except one were against putting in a receiver and if the one man wanted to put in the receiver, presumably he could do so, unless other means were found of circumventing his getting the receiver appointed.  From that angle only unanimity is required.  Take Deputy MacDermot's point.  If we really want to find out what debenture stockholders think of this whole matter, we certainly can, from a general meeting, get as good an expression of opinion from those people as from the preference or ordinary shareholders.  It can be described as a bare majority, or evidence can be shown that it was a considerable majority.  You can, however, get a good decision from them as to how their property should be handled.  You can get an expression, maybe by a couple of different schemes, as to how best the reconstruction can be effected.  It is not quite an accurate answer to say that unanimity would be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred yesterday to certain circumstances. I drew attention to a particular meeting when the chairman of the railway company said&mdash;and I think it is the common case with everybody&mdash;that the railways in this country during the last year have been suffering from three things&mdash;road competition of a particular type, trade depression common to this country as to all other countries, and the specially aggravated depression owing to the economic war.  I say that the last year is not a fair one to take by reason of the abnormal circumstances.  Take the year before, which the chairman of the Great Southern Railways brought in by way of comparison when he was <Col N="617" /> giving an account to this year's general meeting.  He said that last year the company's gross receipts were £3,617,000.  The expenses that had to be set off against that in connection with dividends, interest or fixed charges were £2,991,000.  There was a net profit of £625,000.  He said later that £447,000 odd were required to pay debenture and fixed interest charges.</P>
    <P>The figure of £615,000 represented the worst year that the railway company had prior to the starting of the economic war.  Their net receipts&mdash;and that was before the latest of the awards was to be enforced against the employees&mdash;were £615,000.  They were able to pay the debentures; they were able to pay the some part of their guaranteed preference shareholders. It takes about £800,000 to pay all the shareholders, all the debenture, guaranteed preference and preference and to give one per cent. to the ordinary&mdash;and they showed a net profit of £615,000.  Now if one is interested enough to read back over the corresponding statements from year to year for the past five or six years one feature emerges peculiar to these items.</P>
    <P>Previously the complaint usually was that the passenger receipts were dropping considerably.  This year the chairman gave the fall in receipts, and he gave them under different headings. The passenger train traffic showed a decrease of £24,000 as compared with the previous year.  The goods train traffic (excluding live stock) showed a decrease of £282,000; live stock showed a decrease of £134,000 and miscellaneous items a decrease of £3,000, making in all a drop this year in receipts of £444,000.  The debenture money, as far as taking it in terms of gross receipts, gained no extra value this year.  The chairman said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The stagnation in trade&mdash;more particularly as it affected live stock and farm produce&mdash;from which the farmers of the Free State have suffered so heavily, had disastrous effects on the railways, coming, as it did, at a time when they were struggling for their very existence, handicapped by the adverse conditions to which I have already <Col N="618" /> referred.  Official trade returns of imports and exports for 1932 relating to the commodities which form a large proportion of our normal goods traffic, bacon, fresh meat, flour and other mill stuffs, farm produce, live stock, coal, cement, etc., show a decline in volume and value of 26 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the chairman's statement to his shareholders this year.  That is the cause of the very bad fall in last year's receipts.  And it is not always going to be so.  May I hark back again to the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; Editorial of March 1st, which said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the foundation of local factories and the widely distributed increase of population now in progress there are the elements of a brighter future for our railroads than they have known for generations past.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With that bright prospect and with the abnormal circumstances that operated for the last year, is it fair to say to the proprietors, to the railway debenture holders: &ldquo;We are going to lop off your property and the profits you get from it by a certain percentage?&rdquo; The Minister said that he found that this whole scheme for which he has taken responsibility, apart from the fact that it came from the company to him, justifies the equities of the situation by two things.  The peculiar rights of each of them based upon the property and the prospects of the revenue earning capacity of the company. The prospects taken from what year?  If it is this year&mdash;the last year with which we have dealt&mdash;there is no reason that anybody can see upon which to base a case for a reduction of the shareholders' property by one penny.  In the worst year they had a net receipt of £617,000, enough to pay the debentures and to leave something approaching £200,000 over.  Take that year, because it is only in the circumstances of that year that any case can be made and we decide to neglect the bright prospects of the future that are depicted in the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; and we are now going to interfere with the shareholders' property. We asked several times where did this <Col N="619" /> scheme come from and we got an answer from the Minister, and he says he takes responsibility for it.  He is always careful to drag in the circumstances as to where this scheme came from&mdash;that it came from the company. Again I want to get it on record just what the chairman did say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I now come to the Bill's proposal regarding reconstruction of capital. In all our conferences with the Minister he was insistent in his demand for reconstruction of the company's capital simultaneously with the enactment of any measures of relief for the railway.  He contended that it was obviously hopeless to ever again earn any dividend for the greater number of our shareholders, so long as their existing nominal capital values remain unaltered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then this follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That was, of course, an undeniable contention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell this House in what circumstances he discussed the railways which brought those of the directors who visited him to say that that was an undeniable contention? Did he put before them his plans for the future of the country?  Did he talk about the growth of industries and the development of the country?  Did he talk about the growth of population now in progress, and did they disbelieve him?  And was it an undeniable contention that the railways could never again earn money for their shareholders.  Did they discuss the railways in the light of the circumstances that were operating as far as unrestricted road competition was going on?  Or in the light of the legislation that was to be brought in?  Or did he detail that legislation to them? I would like to get an explanation of the words of the chairman that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was obviously hopeless to ever again earn any dividend for the greater number of our shareholders, so long as their existing nominal capital values remained unaltered?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The circumstances are an important matter, the circumstances that surround that phrase from the Minister. <Col N="620" /> However, the Minister pressed it still further.  The chairman said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister pressed us to assist him in his desire to befriend us by devising some means of reconstruction and making some attempt to secure our shareholders' consent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister yesterday in answering an interjection said he presumed this scheme was put forward as a scheme that would be accepted voluntarily by the shareholders.  I wonder can he say that after what I have read.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister pressed us...to make some attempt to secure our shareholders' consent.  We pointed out to him that an effective scheme of reconstruction must embrace the debenture holders...whom we did not represent.  It would be idle for us to invite or try to persuade them to make the sacrifice of their income unless and until we could assure them of some resulting added stability of the railway undertaking. It was impossible, therefore, to approach them at that stage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Did the Minister tell of the conditions that were likely to give the added economic stability to the railways?  Whether he did or not the chairman says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To gain information, however, for ourselves we employed an eminent firm of financial accountants and experts to examine our accounts and financial condition, and advise us as to the feasibility of evolving from them an equitable scheme of reconstruction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then this sentence is the pivotal point of the whole scheme:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Their report laid it down that no scheme, based on anything but guess-work as to the future, was possible to be set up.  Subject to this specific proviso they submitted a scheme for our guidance and criticism.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then the chairman goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That scheme was shown to the Minister as it stood, without endorsement or approval and, indeed, without any examination or consideration by the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And the Minister tells us it is equitable on the face of it.  But it cannot be <Col N="621" /> regarded as based upon anything but guess-work.  And in this year of all years, with the trade depression of the world having its impact here and with the special impact of the economic war upon us, we are going to cut down the property of the railway shareholders in a scheme which, as the eminent financial accountants and experts have put it, is based upon nothing but guess-work for the future.</P>
    <P>That is the reason that I ask the Dáil to decline to give a Second Reading to this Bill until an independent tribunal, after hearing the evidence of all interests likely to be affected, has considered and reported on two matters (1) whether a reduction is called for at all and (2) if one is called for what reduction should be effected that, as between the different denominations of stock, will be fair and equitable in all the circumstances.  It seems to me that it bodes ill for the future of this country, for all the hopes expressed with regard to the industrialisation of the country, the ruralisation of industry, the swift passage of goods from one rural centre to another, the bigger mass of population which will be demanding goods and producing goods to answer the demand that, despite all that, we are marking our appreciation of the future of this country, viewed through the medium of our main transport agency, by writing down the capital from £26,000,000 to £12,000,000.  That is a pretty good test of the belief of the people who make these promises in the promises they make.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question as to whether there is going to be any big industrialisation of the country and apart from the question of what economic state, new or old, we are to have, can anybody justify the doing of this: taking the worst year the company has had, taking a guess-work scheme and saying the time&mdash;abnormal as it is&mdash;makes it necessary to cut down railway capital and that it is fair and equitable to cut down this capital according to this guess-work scheme? I could have understood the Minister coming in here with either of two propositions&mdash;that the circumstances of the time were very abnormal; that, in <Col N="622" /> these abnormal circumstances, everybody had got to bear a bit of the burden; that railway shareholders, amongst others, would have to bear it and that at this time, when we were bringing in measures to get the railways rehabilitated as transport agencies, we would ask the shareholders to remit their claim to some share of their interest for a period of a couple of years but holding out the prospect that, eventually, they would go back to where they were; that the value of their property would be as it was and that the receipts they drew from it would not, by legislative action, be cut down.  I could have imagined the Minister doing another thing&mdash;coming in here with a Bill and saying: There is a road transport Bill which, added to the other Bill of 1932, gives the railways the best position we can ever help them to.  Let those Bills run for a couple of years and assist, by the carrying out, through administrative policy, of the spirit of these measures, to make the Great Southern Railways the main transport agency for goods and passengers in the country; say then to the directors: &ldquo;You have two or three years in which to make good. If you do not make good in that time, here is a warning to you and your shareholders that we will regard the position as pretty bad and reduce the capital accordingly.&rdquo;  Either of these two solutions&mdash;although a case could be made against both&mdash;would be a much more equitable solution of this problem than adopting the course in this Bill.</P>
    <P>You take this company with 2,000 miles of track, still carrying, despite all competition, 13,000,000 passengers; two and one-third million head of live stock; and two and a half million tons of merchandise, and you say to them: Because of the impact of the economic war, on top of world depression, the receipts have so come down that they were just barely able to pay the debenture interest this year, you are going to cut down the capital and, to add to the futility of the whole business, to cut it down according to a scheme which the Minister says is guess-work and which he says he received from the company subject to <Col N="623" /> the specific proviso that it was guess-work. This scheme he adopts as fair and equitable on the face of it, and he adduces this last argument&mdash;equal to most of the other arguments he used about this Bill&mdash;that if anybody can give him a better scheme he will consider it.  I could evolve a variety of schemes, and if I were allowed to put them up on the same terms and on the same basis of argument as the Minister has put up his, they would stand equal to his.  Take another division of this stock: let £100 debenture be regarded as £90, the guaranteed preference be regarded as value for some other figure, and let us go in and out in that way.  I could say &ldquo;That seems to me on the face of it equitable.&rdquo;  If I cannot give reasons why I think it equitable, I shall be in the same position as the Minister.  In the end, I could take refuge in the statement of the directors, that it is based on guess-work. Let us have something more than guess-work.  Let an independent tribunal say what the prospects are when these Bills are beginning to have effect&mdash;I refer to the 1932 Act and to the Bill now introduced&mdash;and postpone any interference, shocking as it is, with the property of certain people who invested their money on the strength of the peculiar position these stocks occupy.  They were looking for a guaranteed amount of money; they were looking for a gilt-edged security. They did not want any element of chance about the business.  There are funds in court invested in this stock. It is a trustee security, held, in the main, by trustees and that is going to be interfered with on account of the worst year the railways have ever known, and on foot of a scheme that the Minister himself has admitted came to him from the directors with the hallmark of guess-work upon it.</P>
    <P>We should have a tribunal and we should let that tribunal decide quite a number of things.  This is an attempt to reconstruct the main transport agency of the country.  It should be done on some better basis than I described.  Nobody has any idea; nobody has, I think, even the data on which they could base a good opinion <Col N="624" /> as to the economics of road transport in the country.  That being the position, without any examination we are going to destroy property, as this Bill proposes to do, and we have not even been given the consolation of knowing to whom it is intended the loot is to go.  We have had no indication of that. We have had no indication that the position of the travelling public or the trading public is to be improved.  If we knew that, it would be some consolation, though I do not think that any improvement that could be looked to would ever compensate for this shocking business of interfering in this light-hearted, haphazard way with property of such great value as the railway companies still have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The case made by the Deputy against this reconstruction scheme is based upon his assertion that last year was the worst year the railways have had.  Who told him that?  Where did he get that information? Does he know so little about what was happening to the railways when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce that he has no realisation of the fact that, despite the economic war, the world depression and all the evils which occurred last year was not the worst year the railways ever had. The net receipts of the railway company in 1925, when the Deputy was Minister for Industry and Commerce, when his Amalgamation Act of 1924 was producing all the beneficial results to which he referred, were considerably less than they were last year and were insufficient to pay the debenture interest in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In each year since then, with one exception, the gross earnings of the railway company have been diminishing. If the Deputy had got his facts right at the beginning, he would have talked less nonsense in the end.  It is easy to argue for the postponement of a painful <Col N="625" /> operation.  The reconstruction of the capital of the Great Southern Railways Company and the other provisions contained in this Bill and the other Bill are, many of them, going to be painful in operation to some people.  It is natural that they should request the postponement, try to convince themselves and others that the situation is not such that the operation must be carried out if the patient is to live.</P>
    <P>The Deputy started by quoting a speech delivered by me in which I said that although the situation of the railway companies was serious they were not bankrupt.  Then with great vehemence and some eloquence, he argued for an hour in support of that contention.  No one was contradicting him.  He was fighting all the time shadows created by his own imagination. Nobody had asserted that the railway companies were bankrupt. The only quotation he read from a speech by me was a quotation in which I asserted that the railway companies were not bankrupt.  I have been saying here yesterday and to-day that railway transportation is, and will be for a long time, the most economical method of transportation available to us.  But, if we are going to give the railways an opportunity of serving the country in a proper manner, an opportunity of carrying on, on an economical and profitable basis, we have got to make certain alterations in our transport system, certain alterations in the organisation and finances of the railway company.  That is what these Bills are proposing to do.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is anything in the Deputy's speech that has not been replied to already.  The reconstruction of the capital of the company is, in our opinion, an essential condition for making the railways the backbone of a profitable and economic transport organisation.  The Deputy quoted from a speech delivered some days ago by the chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company.  One of the statements made in that speech was that the assertion made by me to the directors when I met them, that it was unlikely that the railway company could ever again pay a return upon <Col N="626" /> £26,000,000 of capital was undeniable. The Deputy asked me what information the chairman of the railway company had when he made the statement that that was undeniable, upon what he was acting.  He was acting with all the knowledge that the Deputy now has; all the knowledge that any member of the public now has; acting with the knowledge of the nature of the legislative proposals which we were submitting to the Dáil.  He spoke three days after the Bills were published, and he spoke with as much information as it was possible for him to have.  The statement he made was a sensible statement, a statement which has been agreed to by a number of Deputies here to-day, a statement supported by a number of persons who have expressed disinterested opinions on the railway situation.  But it is not merely a fact that it is unlikely that the railway company will ever again earn a revenue which will permit them to pay a reasonable return upon £26,000,000 of capital, but it is also a fact that it is most undesirable that they should be put in a position in which the natural desire to pay that return would tend to operate to cripple the efficiency of the services they were conducting.  If we are going to give to the railway companies the opportunity to secure a transport monopoly here, if we are going to give them an unfettered direction of road services as well as rail services, we want to be satisfied that that power is not going to be used, that these road services are not going to be conducted, with the one idea of again paying a return upon capital which is represented by assets no, longer capable of earning revenue.</P>
    <P>That is the justification for undertaking this reconstruction scheme and now is as good a time as any other. There is no reason to believe that the railway company will not again have a period of greater prosperity than it had last year.  Just as in 1925 it went down lower than it went last year, its prosperity was in part restored by the economies which it was able to effect. But during the whole period the gross receipts were declining.  During the whole period the passenger traffic was declining.  The Deputy mentioned the <Col N="627" /> fact that the passenger traffic was only down by £24,000 last year.  I suppose he metaphorically slapped himself on the back and said, &ldquo;It was my Bill in 1932 that did that.&rdquo;  He merely forgot for the moment that the Eucharistic Congress last year brought more people to this country than came on any single occasion before; that entirely abnormal passenger traffic conditions operated; and that that had some bearing upon the apparent arrest in the decline of the company's receipts from passenger traffic.  The conveyance of 13,000,000 passengers is a big undertaking no doubt, but if the use made of respective services is any indication of their suitability, any indication of the public need for them, any indication of their ability to serve the requirements of particular parts of the country, against the 13,000,000 passengers carried in railway carriages last year there is the fact that very nearly double that, over 22,000,000 passengers, were carried by road services during the same period.  That is a figure which has to be compared with the figure of 6,500,000 for 1928.  A comparison between these figures will give some indication of the growth of road services and the extent to which passenger traffic has gone to road services. It is undoubtedly possible to get back for the railways some part of that traffic.  A large part of it is new traffic that the railways never had and never will have.  In so far as it represents traffic taken from the railways, it is possible to get back for them some part of it, but only if the rolling stock, permanent way, and the equipment of the railways are kept up to date; only if there is no inability on the part of the company to spend upon the maintenance of its system, on its carriages, on the conveniences made available for those using the railways, adequate sums in each year.  If train services are going to be slow, if carriages are going to be uncomfortable or unclean, if railway stations are not going to be kept in proper repair, people will naturally not use them.  I am not saying that that is the condition at present. There are no arrears of maintenance <Col N="628" /> on the main lines, as there is on the branch lines, which necessitate speed restrictions.</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly scope for the expenditure of quite large sums of money on up-to-date rolling stock. There are also arrears in the provision made for the maintenance of stations. If the railway company is to get back traffic, they have to give service for it. They can give good service only if the changes contemplated by these Bills are made, and if they are released from the charges which the Bills are designed to relieve them from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the question, because I know that there is a responsibility devolving on the Minister's Department to see that the maintenance of the line is up to a reasonable standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  Some attempt has been made to create the impression that there is a conflict between the present attitude of the members of this Party and their attitude during the recent general election. Although the Deputy who said that a conflict existed did not attempt to prove it, and certainly did not succeed in proving it, if he attempted it, the Bills being introduced are precisely the Bills we would have introduced if an election never took place. They are the Bills we had in mind when speaking at meetings during the course of the election campaign.  The sole reason why the Bills were not published before the election was because they were not drafted in time to permit it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to correct a statement that I made when I stated that 22,000,000 were carried by buses.  That 22,000,000 consisted of people outside the city <Col N="629" /> and suburbs.  The proper total was 72,000,000; 49,000,000 being in the city and suburban area.</P>
    <P>The other matters mentioned by the Deputy can be more suitably dealt with on the Committee Stage.  A modification in standard revenue is, I think, desirable.  It is quite clear that a reduction in charges on the company, consequent on the re-organisation of the finances, cannot be passed on to the traders, because no modification of standard charges is possible.  We have the certificate of the Railways Tribunal that no system of charges which they can devise is capable of yielding to the company the present standard revenue. We think that the standard revenue should be reconsidered by the Tribunal, having regard to the reconstruction of capital, so that it may be brought to some figure in closer touch with actuality.</P>
    <P>We had a considerable discussion here to-day, and a further statement by the Deputy concerned, on the proposal to remove from the London, Midland and Scottish the right to nominate a director on the Board of the amalgamated company.  I stated earlier to-day that, irrespective of the consequences, that is a step which, in my opinion should have been taken.  I think it is very undesirable that the main railway system of this country should be tied up in any way with one foreign railway company. There are other British railway companies with associations here, and even if there were not, I think we should ensure that no person representing a foreign interest, and a foreign interest entirely, should have a directing voice in the control of the railway system here.  Even if that voice was only one in seven, and that the influence exercised by the member appointed was the influence which one would normally assume to be exercised by one member of a board of that number, I want to make it clear that the situation is aggravated by the fact that the company in question is the London, Midland and Scottish.  I did not want to say anything about this company, but I have had some reason to take stock of its attitude with regard to this <Col N="630" /> country on a few occasions since I became Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I was struck from the very beginning by the fact that it has not employed a single Irish national on its steamship services between the two countries since the Free State was established. I was struck by the fact that on every occasion on which it could avoid spending money in this country it avoided doing so.  I was struck by the fact that the number of those placed by it in positions to direct operations with this country were not Irish nationals. Because of that, I think that the position of a foreign company with a right to nominate a director on the Board of the amalgamated company was aggravated, when the company in question became the London, Midland and Scottish.  It may be that the attitude of the company in other circumstances will force us to take some other action some time but, in the meantime, I am prepared to stand over the proposal to take from them the right to have a member on the Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you accept the liability attaching to that proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that right should ever have been given.  I want to get clear what is in the Deputy's mind.  The Dublin and South-Eastern Railway Company got a loan of £100,000 from the London and NorthWestern Railway, which subsequently became the London, Midland and Scottish, and in return for that loan they gave to the London, Midland and Scottish Company the right to nominate a director on the Board of the Dublin and South-Eastern Railway.  There was a very direct relationship between the Dublin and South-Eastern Railway and the London, Midland and Scottish &mdash;a relationship which I think if a national Government existed at the time would never have allowed to be established, and certainly would have prevented if they found it existed. When the Dublin and South-Eastern Railway was amalgamated with the Great Southern Railways Company the London, Midland and Scottish Company did not carry the right to a directorship in the amalgamated company because of the loan.  The directorship <Col N="631" /> was not given because of the loan.  The directorship was given in consideration of the agreement entered into, which secured for the amalgamated company certain concessions in respect of through rates, and certain privileges in the division of the receipts from through rates, amounting to £20,000 yearly.  I say that if the London, Midland and Scottish Company paid £20,000 yearly they got value for it, and if they want to terminate that arrangement, well they are at liberty to do so.  They cannot expect to continue to get value unless they pay for it.</P>

      <P>These are the main points worth mentioning now.  All the other points mentioned are really Committee points and can then be discussed more suitably.  As I said already to-day, and yesterday, the purpose behind these Bills is to create in this country transport organisation that will be suitable to our needs, that will be capable of supplying for each individual and each part of the country the type of transport required and that will be capable of working on a profitable basis.  These organisations will not be railway organisations only <Col N="632" /> any more than they will be road organisations only, but they will be so directed as to ensure, in so far as possible, the preservation of the railways, as to ensure that, in so far as the preservation of the railways is in itself desirable, they will, to the greatest possible extent, be preserved, and that there will be no question of termination of railway service or closing down of branch lines until it is clearly shown that the public convenience is not going to be seriously affected and that such action is going to make the rest of the concern more profitable and tend to promote its prosperity and its prospects of providing railway employment.  I did not intend to be discourteous to Deputy Good&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I think that, in relation to that loan, it is just as well to draw his attention to one of the conditions of the agreement entered into by the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway at the time this loan was negotiated.  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Either company shall have power, on giving six months' notice in writing, to require repayment of or repay the sum advanced, or any part thereof, provided that, for the five years immediately preceding the date of the notice, interest at the rate of 3½ per cent. per annum has been paid on the sum advanced.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Deputy will see, therefore, why I asked that the existence of any liability should be demonstrated first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the liability was undertaken by the Dublin, Wicklow, and Wexford Railway, they did something which, in my opinion, they should not have done, and something which, in my opinion, they would not have been allowed to do if there had been in existence at the time a national Government.</P>

      <P>I submit that it has a <Col N="634" /> lot to do with it, because the question arises as to whether we should, by our Act, continue that arrangement.  There was considerable objection to the thing being done in 1924, and I think that when I mention the fact that Deputy Mulcahy and other members of the present Cumann na nGaedheal Party, opposed it strongly, it will be an indication that it produced such strong feelings that there was even a division&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The new paragraph (b) proposed to be inserted is intended as a positive declaration of the pensionable status of an officer who served under a local authority in Northern Ireland so as to make any such period of service recognisable for pension purposes in the same way as if such officer had, from the beginning, served under a local authority in the Free State.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3) and substitute a new sub-section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) Where an officer has become entitled by virtue of this section to <Col N="641" /> reckon as part of a period of continuous pensionable service a period of service under a local authority the functional area of which was outside the area now comprised in Saorstát Eireann (whether such period of continuous pensionable service does or does not also include by virtue of this section a period between the termination of such service and his being appointed to a pensionable office under another local authority) and such officer is awarded a pension or gratuity, the Minister shall, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, refund to the local authority by which such pension or gratuity is paid, such proportion of such pension or gratuity as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, shall determine to be attributable to the service of such officer under a local authority whose functional area was outside the area now comprised in Saorstát Eireann, and in such case Section 47 of the principal Act and sub-section (2) of this section shall not apply.</P>
    <P>The new sub-section which it is proposed to substitute for sub-section (3) is designed to make more certain provision for the recoupment of any moneys which will become payable by the State towards the pensions of local officers who have previous service in Northern Ireland.  The provision in the Bill as introduced is that the Minister for Finance shall refund any such moneys to the local authority concerned and the liability extends down to the date that such an officer entered the service of the local authority in the Free State.  The new provision makes the State liable for the period of service in Northern Ireland of the official concerned, and provides for an apportionment of liability between the State and the local authority for the period intervening between the Northern Ireland service and the service under a Free State local authority.  The State share of the liability will be met by the vote of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and paid by the Minister for Local Government with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 5:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (5), page 4, to insert between the lines 62 and 63 the words&mdash;&ldquo;references to resignation from a service shall be construed as including leaving such service otherwise than by dismissal, and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment designed to remove a doubt as to the application of the Act to persons who did not formally resign and who were not, some of them, actually appointed.

The Minister also said, in the course of the debate, that to his knowledge no test of a corresponding nature was demanded from civil servants in other States or countries.  I have evidence that even in the United States of America a test is demanded from the public teachers in the schools.  That is to say, the word &ldquo;test&rdquo; can be construed into meaning a declaration that has to be signed by those servants of the State.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,616,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1933, for an Advance to the Guarantee Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this Estimate is in pursuance of the undertaking given by the President last November.  It will be remembered that the Government then decided to grant a moratorium in respect of the land annuities falling due on the gales November-December, 1932 and May-June of the present year.  A moratorium was granted to all who were unable to meet their obligations and the arrears accruing in consequence thereof were to be funded over a period at 4½ per cent. interest.  If, consequent upon this concession, the law were to be allowed to operate normally, the local authorities would suffer by the hypothecation to the Guarantee Fund of the local taxation grants.  Therefore, when announcing the concession the President stated that, in due course, there would be released from the Guarantee Fund the amount of grants absorbed in it as the result of the moratorium. <Col N="647" /> Apart altogether from the special grant of £250,000, which was announced in the last Budget and provided by Statute in the current year, and which has already been distributed in full, the total amount of the agricultural grant due to local authorities was £1,948,022.</P>
    <P>Of this sum £524,000 has already been issued from the local taxation account and a further £5,000,000, was issued from the Emergency Fund, thus leaving due to the local authorities about £924,000.  The Vote now before the House provides for an advance to the Guarantee Fund and will enable the Department of Finance to repay the £500,000 already advanced under the Emergency Fund and a further sum of £191,178 which was advanced from the Central Fund to the Guarantee Fund.  It will also permit us to issue to the local authorities a sum of £924,022.  This Estimate has to be read and to be taken in conjunction with the Land (Purchase Annuities Fund) Bill which has been read a second time and which will be taken again on Tuesday next in this House.  They are complementary measures but this at any rate is an essential step in the process which will enable us to release the balance of the local taxation grants to the local authorities and we hope will put, as far as Government assistance can, the finances of these bodies in a sound position.</P>

      <P>I should like to know if the Minister is prepared to give any information to the House regarding the reduction of something between £400,000 and £500,000 in the agricultural grant for the ensuing year.  Will the Minister explain why when the Government made this House, through the President, a very definite promise that 50 per cent. of the annuities were to be remitted, no mention was made of the fact that roughly one-fourth of the amount paid last year for the relief of local rates was going to be deducted by the Government this year?</P>

I do not know what was meant by the word <Col N="648" />&ldquo;special.&rdquo;  In the year 1931 we gave a grant of £750,000 and there was nothing special about it.  It was merely a re-orientation of our finances.  There was nothing special about this grant unless something supervened during the year to make it a special grant. I do not know whether it was intended merely as a little gift to the people to pacify them from one election to another, but I think there should be some explanation as to why there is to be a reduction this year, as far as one can see, from £2,200,000 to £1,750,000, a drop of some £450,000.</P>

I, as one of the most orderly Deputies in the House, could not transgress the rules of order so far as Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Fitzgerald have invited me.  I do not think it would be in order to say anything at this stage of our proposals for the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point of relevancy, may I put this to the Minister. In his opening statement he said he wanted this Estimate taken in conjunction with the Land (Purchase Annuities Fund) Bill.  I think that disposes of his statement that it would be out of order <Col N="649" /> to deal with the matter now.  On the other point, might I put it to the Minister that before the present Government came into office there were two sums, one of £1,200,000, and another of £750,000 or £1,950,000 in all, made available for the relief of agricultural rates.  The present Government is now proposing to reduce that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the £250,000 which the Minister said was an additional grant, the present Government announced that its policy was complete de-rating.  Last year he added £250,000 to the sum given for relief of agricultural rates, and the whole tenor of the statements coming from the Government side was that inasmuch as Cumann na nGaedheal had prepared the Estimates, it was impossible for them immediately on coming into office to go to the full extent of their promises.  They said that the £250,000 was just a token of their earnestness.  The Minister now turns round and says that far from its being a small instalment of better things to follow it was really something special.  Instead of its merely being a part payment of what they promised the people, it now appears that it was merely given to hide from the people the fact that they were going to give nothing at all.</P>

    <P>The original estimate for Vote No. 6 in respect of the year ending 31st March, 1933 was prepared, as I am sure the House will understand, in the late autumn of 1931.  It included provision for the collection and the administration of the revenue and the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act on the basis of the tariffs existing at that time and the Acts then in force.  Since the beginning of the financial year 1932-3, numerous tariff changes have been introduced by various Acts of the Oireachtas and the work incidental to and consequential upon these, together with the additional work which has arisen out of the Old Age Pensions Act of last year, necessitated immediate additions to the staff of the Revenue Department.  Arising out of these Acts, increased expenditure also arose on travelling, on the purchase of technical equipment and on the distribution of the various instructions and memoranda relative to the new functions of the Department.  Savings have been made on certain sub-heads of the Vote but nevertheless the resultant economies have not been quite sufficient to meet the additional expenditure and additional provision now asked for must be made in the ordinary course by the Oireachtas to cover the cost of the Department to the close of the financial year.</P>

With regard to sub-head C.1 the amount is £9,000 and that arises in connection with the case of teachers, some fifty of whom were either dismissed by the last Government or had salaries withdrawn from them, or were unable to carry on with their work as teachers.  The principle that the Government has decided to carry out, in connection with these teachers, is that in the Gaeltacht, in the period where a teacher was not actually in service and carrying out his or her duty at teaching work or was not paid, we are paying in respect to his or her service for the period.</P>

      <Col N="653" /> In respect to teachers who were either prevented from attending to their school work by Government action or on account of their political activities and were not carrying on their teaching work, they are not to be paid in respect to that, but they are going to be allowed, in regard to their pension rights, for the periods during which they were absent from their work.  The sum of £7,000 has already been paid out to those teachers and a further sum of £2,000 is required.  As against the expenditure of £9,000 in this connection, plus the sum of £150 under sub-head B, for examinations, we have a saving of £5,400 on the other sub-heads.  We have a deficiency in appropriation in aid of £500.  There is also the cost of the additional students from the Gaeltacht areas in the preparatory colleges.  In most cases they do not pay fees; therefore there is a falling off in the appropriation in aid in respect to that.  The sum total of the estimate is £9,150.</P>

    <P>Fo-mhírcheann B.1.&mdash;Chun dréachta ceóil a mbéidh Gaedhilg leó a fhoillsiughadh, táthar ag brath £100 a chur i n-úsáid roimh an 31adh lá de Mhí an Mhárta, 1933, agus táthar ag brath £1,000 a chaitheamh ar an obair chéadna, ins an bhliadhain ar deireadh dí an 31adh lá de Mhí an Mhárta, <Col N="654" /> 1934.  Bhéarfar cuid de'n airgead seo i n-a dhíolaidheachta do lucht scríobhtha na ndréacht, agus caithfear an chuid eile de, de réir mar bhéas riachtanach, i n-a íocaidheachta ar chostas páipéir, clódórachta, agus ceangail.</P>
    <P>Ins an bhliadhain atá i láthair ann, níltear ag brath airgead a chaitheamh le dréachta ar bith ach amháin le rudaí atá curtha isteach ag an Ollamh Carl Hardebeck.  Meastar ná raghaidh an caitheachas i mbliain iomláin thar £1,000, sé sin, £400 mar íocaíocht le ceapadóirí agus £600 ar chlóbhualadh agus ar chostaisí eile bhainfidh le foillsiú.</P>
    <P>Fo-mhírcheann B.5.&mdash;I mbliadhain a 1926, chinn Roinn an Oideachais go ndéanfaidhe bailiughadh ar shomplaí de'n Ghaedhilg mar labhairtear í ins na ceanntair ar fhan sé beó ariamh ionnta.  Cinneadh go dtógfaidhe na somplaí seo ar phónograf ins an chaoi a mbéadh taisce bhuan ar fagháil de Ghaedhilg na gcainnteóir dúthchais; agus cinneadh fosta go dtabharfaidhe aire ar leith do na ceanntair i n-a bhfuil an Ghaedhilg i gcontabhairt a caillte.  Cuireadh trí deóntais airgid ar fagháil mar chongnamh do'n obair seo sa Vóta i gcóir Eolaidheachta agus Ealadhan, eadhon, £500 do gach Cúige de na trí Cúigí&mdash;Mumha, Connachta, agus Ulaidh.  I gCúige Mumhan, rinneadh deireadh na h-oibre i mbliadhain a 1928.  Naoi somplaí caogad a tógadh; agus chosain an obair go léir £466 3s. 10d.  I mbliadhain a 1930 a tógadh na somplaí i gCúige Chonnacht, agus i gConndae an Cláir mar aon leis.  Seacht somplaí seachtmhoghad a tógadh; agus, leis an chuid seo de'n obair, caitheadh £520 19s. 5d.  Tógadh ochtmhogha sompla i gCúige Uladh, i mbliadhain a 1931, agus chosain sin £591 18s. 5d.</P>
    <P>£1,500 a deónuigheadh do'n obair go léir, agus chosain an obair £1,580. Tá an £80 sin de bhreis costais dhá áireamh ins an Mheastachán Breise seo.  Na somplaí a fuarthas i gCúige Uladh, ba i Meadhon Foghmhair agus i nDeireadh Foghmhair de bhliadhain a 1931 a tógadh iad, ach rinneadh na chéad ullmhúcháin uilig le n-a aghaidh sin i Mí Iúil roimh ré.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> An laghadughadh a tháinig go tobann ar luach an phunnta i Meadhon Foghmhair, mhéaduigh sé an dá chostas a ba mhó dá rabh ag baint leis an obair, eadhon, costas taistil an éolaidhe as an Ghearmáin a bhí i mbun ghléas tógtha na sompla, agus costas na múnla ar tógadh ortha iad.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh an obair i módh a bhí chó beag-chostasach sin gur leór an t-airgead a deónuigheadh i dtús ama, munab é an laghadughadh mór tobann a tháinig ar luach an phunnta.</P>
    <P>Fo-mhírcheann B.6.&mdash;Is mian leis an Ollamh Marstrander, fear atá i n-a Ollamh i n-Iolscoil Oslo, is mian leis somplaí de Ghaedhilg Oileáin Mhanain thógáil ó cibé beagán beag cainnteóir dúthchais atá fagtha ins an oileán sin, agus chuir muinntear na h-Iorbhuaidhe suim áirithe airgid ar fagháil dó le h-aghaidh na h-oibre. Ach ní leór an t-airgead sin le gléas a thabhairt do'n Ollamh Marstrander an obair a dhéanamh i gceart.  Mar sin de, chuir sé an scéal i láthair mhuinntear Acadamh Ríoghdha na hÉireann, agus tá siad-san ag iarraidh ar an Riaghaltas suim bheag airgid a chur ar fagháil mar chongnamh ins an obair seo ag an Ollamh Marstrander. <Col N="656" /> Scoláirí a bhéadh i gcionn staidéir nó teagaisc a bhaineas le h-eólas ar chanamhna Ghaedhilg na h-aimsire seo, tá an Riaghaltas cinnte gur mhór a rachadh sé ar sochar dóbhtha an obair seo bheith déanta ag fear léighinn a bhfuil an chéim agus an chliú aige atá ag an Ollamh Marstrander; agus, ar an adhbhar sin, is é barramhail an Riaghaltais gur cheart an congnamh a thabhairt dó atá de dhíth air le n-a bheartughadh a chur i gcrích.  Mar sin de, táthar ag brath £100 de dheóntas a chur ar fagháil d'acadamh Ríoghdha na hÉireann le h-aghaidh na h-oibre seo is mian leis an Ollamh Marstrander a dhéanamh i n-Oileán Mhanainn.  Bhéarfaidh sé macasamhla de na somplaí a thógfaidh sé d'Acadamh Ríoghdha na hÉireann; agus tá sé tuighthe ag cách dá mbaineann leis an chúis gur leis an Stát na macasamhla sin.</P>
