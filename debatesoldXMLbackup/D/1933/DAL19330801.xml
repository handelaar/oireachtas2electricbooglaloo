      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that there is any objection to giving the reason for this remarkable act?  The primary purpose for which a Government exists is for the protection of the community.  The Minister knows that certain people condemned a very large section in this country to death and that the only thing that prevented that being carried out was the unsafety of people who might attempt to carry it out, and that up to two months ago a great many people were protected by the Government, presumably for a good reason.  Now the Government carefully removes the last possibility of defence from these people while, as far as we are aware, the Government takes no action whatever against lawless bodies whose career during the past ten years has been nothing but one of assassination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I will put it in an interrogative form.  Will the President give us an assurance for the public that all adequate protection will be given to every person whose life is in danger, and to banks whose property is in danger, when this step is being taken?  Will the Government give an assurance that action will be taken against every illegal body in this country, whether associated with the Government or not, to make these illegal bodies incapable of carrying out the policy proposed some years ago by members of them, namely, assassination of people supporting this State?</P>

      <P>The action the Government is taking is perfectly lawful. All protection considered to be necessary for the protection of the citizens will be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the action taken by the Government was lawful.  The Minister is aware that certain sergeants and various other people went around demanding guns from people who had permits.  That was contrary to the law, as far as I understand the law, in this country.  I presume the Minister is aware that the action of the Government last Saturday night was an illegal action and that they only tried to mend their hands when they were told they were acting illegally.  Is the Minister not aware that, as the law stands, these permits can only be collected by the superintendent who issued them, and that the permits could only be withdrawn for one of two reasons: either that the man who had the permit was unfit to have a permit or that the reason for which the permit was given no longer exists?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I should like to have my mind made more clear on this matter. Is it the situation in this country now that, in accordance with the President's declaration in this House, those who do not apply for permits, but who acquire guns in defiance of the law, may retain them, but those who do apply for licences and would decline to carry guns except within the law will not be allowed to retain them?  If that is the situation in this country now, I think a clear, explicit statement should be made by the President or the Minister for Justice to that effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister to reconsider, if not immediately, in his own time, his decision not to tell us the number of permits involved?  I will ask him to consider whether it would not be much easier <Col N="906" /> for the House and the country to form a judgment on the action the Government have taken, if they knew the numbers.</P>

      <P>I was going to ask for an early adjournment to draw attention to the uneasiness caused in the public mind by the action of the Government in withdrawing firearms certificates from law-abiding citizens to whom they had been granted for the purpose of the protection of life and property.  In view of the hasty and precipitate action of the Government, in the first place, in taking this decision and, in the second place, in view of their refusal to make a statement on the matter, I think I am entitled to know whether an opportunity of this sort will be afforded.</P>

      <P>A difficulty has arisen, as has been indicated by two Deputies.  The Ministerial amendment is really a re-drafting and amalgamation of sub-sections (1) and (3) of Section 28.  Technically, if amendment No. 111 is carried, amendments 112, 113 and 114 cannot be moved.  They might possibly, on being re-drafted, be moved to the new sub-section, but such re-drafting cannot be done in the House.  A further difficulty arises&mdash; Deputy Rice admits that amendment No. 112 has been met by the re-drafting of sub-section (1) and amendment No. 118 may possibly also have been met.  If amendment No. 116 is carried, amendments Nos. 117 to 124 cannot be moved.  If amendments 111 and 116 are carried such of the lapsed amendments Deputies desire to offer could be offered on Report Stage.  The discussion may range over these amendments now or on amendment No. 111.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, when we arrived at Section 28 to which amendment 111 is moved, we arrived at the most vital section in this Land Bill.  When the Acting-Minister for Lands and Fisheries was speaking on this Bill on the Second Reading Stage and when he came to discuss Section 28 he mentioned in passing that there had been deleted, or there would be deleted from the Land Act of 1923 sub-section (4) (b) of Section 24 of that Act. That sub-section reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If within the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner the proprietor or tenant of the declared land so requires them to do, the Land Commission shall, as soon as practicable, provide the said proprietor or tenant with a new holding which, in the opinion of the Land Commission other than the judicial commissioner (subject to the right of appeal to the judicial commissioner, whose decision shall be final) shall be equally suitable for the said proprietor or tenant, and of not less value than the declared land....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sub-section is being materially re-enacted in the Bill of 1933 save in respect of the all-important words &ldquo;shall be equally suitable for the said proprietor or tenant&rdquo;.  The Minister in defending the deletion of these words said that they had constituted, in practice, practically impassable <Col N="914" /> barriers, when the Land Commission sought compulsorily to acquire purchased land.  The reason that the Minister gave for deleting those words is, in my opinion, the most forcible and the most unanswerable reason for retaining them.  I discharge the Attorney-General from any deliberate intention of confusing the issue.  But when he was speaking at an earlier stage of this Bill, he spoke of the security of tenure being buried fathoms deep for the tenant farmers of this country, and it subsequently transpired that he was referring to persons who were still paying judicial rents at the time of the passing of the 1923 Land Act.</P>
    <P>My protest is made on behalf of the purchased tenants.  The people who entered into agreements with the Land Commission to purchase their lands were put in possession of their holdings by the Land Commission on the secure understanding which just represented the final settlement of the land question in so far as they were concerned. The Bill at the present time before us means that every purchased tenant in this country whether he has five acres, ten acres, 50 acres, or 100 acres of land can be put out on the side of the road in the morning by the Land Commission acting under the direction of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries; and by way of compensation he can be offered land of equal market value, 100 miles or 200 miles away from where his father and grandfather and the people who went before him were born.  I was recently discussing this question with a distinguished supporter of the Fianna Fáil Government and when I put it to him that this Bill meant that every farmer in this country was stripped of the security which the Land League gave and made a pawn on the Minister's chess board to be moved about wherever the Minister chose to put them, he denied it.  He said it was incredible and he would not believe that the Fianna Fáil Government would introduce such legislation and that I had misread the Bill.  That supporter of the Fianna Fáil Government is in the House to-day.  That member of the Party will hear from his own Attorney-General <Col N="915" /> confirmation of what I now say.  I hope that member of the Party will have the courage to vote according to his convictions. Those of us who are not ashamed to confess ourselves agrarians, people who consider that the final settlement of the land question in this country is of paramount importance, know with what trepidation leaders of the Land League set that movement in motion.  They realised how great was the danger of stirring up the people on the question of the land; how deep and violent the reactions of our people became when their homestead was at stake, and it required the utmost endeavour to keep that movement within prudent and permissible limits.</P>
    <P>The Government to-day for the purpose, according to themselves, of speeding up the settlement of the congested districts question, propose to wipe out the security of tenure of the small holders of this country.  I warn them that if they do that they are putting their hand to a work the end of which none of us in this House can fully see.  If any attempt is made to shift about the tenant purchasers of this country, to clear people out of their homesteads in order to use those homesteads for the purpose of dividing them up amongst their neighbours, feuds and quarrels will be set on foot in every district where that is attempted which may have disastrous consequences for the country at large. Everybody knows of his own acquaintance now, 30 years after the land war finished, the loathing with which the land grabber is looked upon in the country still.  It may be 40 or 50 years since he grabbed land, but he and his children are remembered as land grabbers and the children of land grabbers.  Very often that understandable feeling has boiled over and terrible things have been done; and it has taken all the leaders of the people could do to restrain them, to hold them back within the bounds of justice, to prevent them from doing terrible injuries to the people who they believed unjustly grabbed their lands.  The whole object of the land code was to make it impossible for anyone to grab his neighbour's land.  Here this Bill <Col N="916" /> provides that where a jealous neighbour wants to grab his neighbour's land he can set the machinery of the Land Commission in motion; he can get that land declared as being necessary for the relief of congestion; and it may be that that man will be swept clean out of the area.  The only defence that individual who is about to be removed has is to ask is he going to get land of equal market value.  If the Land Commission say &ldquo;Yes, although you were born and bred in the County Donegal, we are going to give you land of equal value in County Kerry&rdquo; he has no answer to their demand but to quit, to get out.  He can be evicted.</P>
    <P>So long as the words &ldquo;shall be equally suitable for the said proprietor&rdquo; were there that man had a right to go before the Land Commission and plead that the land offered to him at a great distance from the home where he was born was not equally suitable to him.  He had the right to go beyond the Land Commission to the judicial commissioner and make that case.  The Land Commission never attempted so long as that safeguard was there to disturb the ordinary small tenant purchaser.  That safeguard is taken away; it is being taken away for a purpose.  It was not taken away for the fun of taking it away.</P>
    <P>When we came into the House here to discuss the Second Stage of this Bill we were told that the Minister had prepared a map for us.  We were shown a rundale division.  You would imagine that nobody in this House who was interested in the land or the land policy ever heard of rundale before. Armed with the weapons that this Bill is going to put into the Minister's hands, he is going down into an area of that character, full of the most dangerous possibilities, full of the most delicate situations, and he will have power to shift these people about like pawns on a chessboard.  He is going down to settle the problem that puzzled the late Cardinal O'Donnell, that puzzled the late Father Denis O'Hara, and the original members of the C.D.B., and that took them years to solve each individual case they undertook.  True, these men <Col N="917" /> were puzzled by individual cases, but knowing their people, with patience, even with endless and marvellous patience, they worked away on this rundale division and they did their best by agreement and conciliation and persuasion to get the people to come together and facilitate the rearrangement of the land in order that the thing might be carried through.  Everyone who knows the land question knows that any attempt at strong-arm methods in circumstances of that kind will be fraught with disaster, and the business of rearranging these rundale divisions will be a thousand times outweighed by the enmities and hatreds that will be stirred up in this area if an attempt is made to do it by any other means than patience, conciliation and persuasion.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to trespass too long on the time of the House, but, to my mind, this is a decision fraught with the gravest possible consequences for the country.  We all know that in the days before any group of tenants had fixity of tenure their holdings deteriorated, their houses became wretched. They became so, not because the people wanted them to be so, but because the people had no faith in the endurance of their tenancy and their right to remain there.  They had no heart to improve, they had no heart to make the repairs that they wanted to make because they were afraid that they were going to be taken from them. Now, if there are seven tenants in any townland, and it is decided that that townland is a congested townland, and it is proposed to take steps to relieve that congestion&mdash;now, lest the Fianna Fáil Party might think that I sought to be offensive, let us assume that there was a Centre Party Government in office and that they found seven tenants, five of whom were Centre Party, one Fianna Fáil and one Cumann na nGaedheal, and that the land of some one of these was needed for the relief of congestion.  Let us suppose that a Centre Party Minister for Lands and Fisheries was in power. I am putting the question as strongly as I can against myself, but I simply want to try and drive home what the Fianna Fáil Party is up against and <Col N="918" /> what they would say in the case that I am giving.</P>

      <P>Let us suppose this land has to be acquired.  Do Deputies realise the pressure that would be brought to bear upon the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he had to exercise the powers contained in this Bill and to make a requisition of that land? Is it not as certain as anything can well be that in these circumstances it is the land of the Fianna Fáil farmers or the Cumann na nGaedheal farmers that would be acquired?  Let them consider that.  Let us suppose for a moment that the Minister resisted that temptation and that he said to the Land Commission: go and acquire whatever land you think is best without regard to individuals at all, and that it so happened that the Land Commission in the discharge of their duty took the Fianna Fáil farmers' land, will Deputy Smith convince me or will anyone convince me that that will not be denounced as a dishonest act?</P>

      <P>Will it not be said that you are land grabbers, as it was said before, when the land grabbers came and took the land of the people and when the people knew what to do to pay them off?  Let the Government consider well before they put their hands to such action, and before the Minister, or anybody else, tries to persuade these people that there is nothing in its operation except what is ordinary, unbiassed and impartial administration of the law.  It simply means that the land is taken from these people and that they will have to shift their homes.  Those who are thus evicted will look upon the people who took their land as land grabbers, and I tell the Government that if they let loose upon the land the feeling that <Col N="919" /> the people are going to be faced once again with the land grabbers they will live to regret it.  It took years to quieten down the feeling let loose in the country by the evictors and the land grabbers in the past.  If that is let loose again, under the conditions that prevail, no Government will be able to put an end to it and God knows where it will lead our people.  I am defending what I consider to be absolutely essential to the interests of our people on the land.  They have a deep and profound conviction that the land is theirs and that no one should take it from them.  If you pass this Bill in its present form every holder of land will be stripped of his tenure.  Once the people are stripped of their security of tenure you are going to open up in the country again a terrible state of unrest.  If that state of things is once opened up under the conditions now prevailing no Government, whether the present or any other, will be able to put an end to it and God only knows where it will end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Dillon upon one point and that is that this is the most vital section in the Land Bill.  After that I disagree with him.  I know of no country in the world in which security of tenure is absolute.  The settler in Ontario 50 years ago had absolute security, until civilisation made its inroads and towns became established. The settler in Western Australia 100 years ago thought he had security, but there is no such thing as security of tenure in the absolute.  The State has its rights.  Under the operations of the Land Act of 1923, in the constituency I represent, and the adjoining constituency of the County Meath, we have seen that a section like this is absolutely necessary if land settlement is to come about.  I heard Deputy Hogan painting a picture of the 250 acre farmer, and the great asset he was to the State and all the wonderful things he did.  I am not disputing with Deputy Hogan the things that the 250 acre farmer does. I have nothing to say as to his progress.  That is not the problem in <Col N="920" /> the Midlands.  The problem in the Midlands is not the non-resident grazier who has a farm in every second parish.  These farms are subject to land purchase annuities.  But we are unable, under the Land Act of 1923, to get even the smallest of these farms for the relief of congestion in the Midlands.  And mind you there is congestion in parts of the Midlands, but in trying to relieve it we are baulked by the Land Act of 1923.</P>
      <P>We were told in correspondence with the Land Commission during the time of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, and even during the time of our own Government, that we were bound, not merely in the case of the possessor of 250 acres, but very often the possessor of 2,500 acres, from whom we wanted to take 50 or 60 acres for the relief of congestion, to find another holding equal in size and value to the one we took from him. The people can remain in the bogs and the marshes because of those tenant rights on which Deputy Dillon is so eloquent, which will leave in undisturbed possession of their farm men in my constituency giving the least possible labour.  These men do not rear herds of suckers or breed Oxford-Downs, or Polled-Angus cattle. They go down to the West and buy the cheapest Galloway breeds of cattle, and finish them off in the quickest possible time and give the least possible amount of labour.  I am ready to believe that the eloquence we have heard for the past week is not poured forth on behalf of the 250 acre resident farmer who works his land according to the rules of good husbandry, but on behalf of the grazier who is master of the Midlands and is fast turning it into a wilderness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has referred to the land war.  Deputy Dillon invaded my constituency lately, and it brought to my mind the time of the land war.  It brought to my mind a person who suffered imprisonment and torture over that land war, the late J.P. Farrell. I was surprised to see on the platform from which Deputy Dillon spoke in his most eloquent way in defence of <Col N="921" /> tenant right the very people whom J. P. Farrell fought in that land war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Referring again to my constituency, one has only to go down to certain places in it, such as the Hill of Uisneach, or stand at the crossroads of Killare, and see the absolute desert there.  Deputy Dillon has quoted some people on these benches in reference to this Bill.  Let me quote some one who does not support Fianna Fáil, but who still supports Cumann na nGaedheal. Under the 1923 Act a large area of land was divided up near the small town of Delvin.  This man's comment recently was that there was one thing on which he agreed with Fianna Fáil, and that was the sub-division of land.  Previous to the division of the land around Delvin, trade was stagnant in that town.  With the settlement of the people on farms around it there came some trade into the town, and the man to whom I am referring agreed with us on our policy of land division because it stimulated trade.</P>
      <P>I do not like to go into this question of land grabbing.  If I did, I could tell a great many tales of modern land grabbers who obtained various farms up and down the Midlands by very questionable means.  Deputy Hogan referred in his speech to the thrifty farmer, to the economic farmer, to the good business farmer, who minded his business and who was better than the other fellow.  There was many a thrifty farmer in the country who got broken. He got broken because his sons, instead of being economically-minded and thrifty went out in the Sinn Féin movement.  The time which might have been devoted to thoughts of economics was given in the service of their country.  All the blame cannot be put at the door of the farmer for the position he may find himself in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, as I said at the beginning, is the most vital clause in this Bill.  If <Col N="922" /> we examine the origin of the land war we find that it originated when the national leaders of the time saw the clearance of Meath and Westmeath, the taking of the land from the people, and their banishment to the emigrant ship or into hovels in the bogs.  They wanted to put an end to that.  That spirit is there still.  I think Deputy Dillon talked about patience and forbearance and all that kind of thing. Patience and forbearance was what we showed in County Meath.  The sooner this clause is put into operation the better.  The sooner the ordinary people get back to the land and get work on the land the better.  We do not stand for excessive sub-division, which leads nowhere.  We certainly do not stand for interference with the residential farmer, but we do want to put an end to the absent grazier, who is no benefit to the community.  The sooner he is cleared out of the Midlands the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposed sub-section, as it now stands, may undoubtedly do something to meet some minor but still important objections to the clause, which as Deputy Kennedy rightly pointed out is a vital clause in the Bill, but in reality even the amendments that have been introduced by the Minister, in so far as he has met some of the amendments put down from other sides of the House, leave the main question untouched.  I think the Minister himself realised that, because he thought it necessary to put up a defence of this particular section even as it now stands.  Whatever the purposes of the Minister may be, and whatever the purposes of Deputy Kennedy and the various members who spoke from the Fianna Fáil Benches on this particular Bill, it means the end of the farmer's security on his land.  It means the end of security not merely for the £2,000 farmer but for practically every other farmer as well&mdash;the big farmer, the middle-sized farmer and the small farmer.  Anybody who has any knowledge of the country must know perfectly well that if this Bill is put into operation you are not going to stop at this Bill; you are not going to stop at the legal provisions of this Bill. <Col N="923" /> In this clause we have gone back on the agrarian development of this country for the last 50 years.  Some people may think that that is progress. I myself look at it as reaction of the worst type.  Some countries&mdash;there is at least one&mdash;would regard such a thing as progress.  I think we strike at the roots of security, prosperity, settlement and decent living by acknowledging the principle that is embodied in this particular sub-section which we are discussing. Remember, we must read this sub-section not merely in conjunction with the knowledge gained from living in this country for 50 years, as many of us have done, but in connection with a number of other things as well.  We must read it in connection with the original sub-section (3), which is now embodied in the particular section proposed by the Minister; and particularly we must read it in connection with Section 31.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it would be complete and wilful blindness on the part of anybody who has the welfare of the country at heart to leave out of account the whole policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, as announced from many a platform.  I suggest that it is useless for the Minister and the back benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Kennedy or anybody else, to say they are not going to stand for too much sub-division. It is not what they are going to stand for will matter in five years' time.  It is whether the avalanche they are now starting, and deliberately starting, can be stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that anybody who has a knowledge of this country, who has a knowledge of land hunger in this country, and of the danger of stimulating and stirring up that particular passion, will know perfectly well that it would be extremely difficult for any Government to stop the sub-division that is now being started and that is to go on.  When we look at this particular section, look at it in its full reality and consider what it stands for&mdash;not the mere temporary provisions that are now in it&mdash;but look upon it as portion of a policy, <Col N="924" /> as a portion of the development of farming in this country, I say there is nothing in the Bill or nothing in the speeches we have heard, even in the cooing voice of the Minister on the last occasion on which we discussed the Bill, to allay any of the anxiety which is felt throughout the country as the result of the introduction of this measure and this particular provision.  On the contrary the more anybody thinks over what is involved in this particular section, the more he must be fearsome of the results for the future of this country. Take even what for the moment may seem a somewhat remote contingency. Remember we are living in revolutionary times.  We have a revolutionary Government in power.  It is quite true that the Minister says that this is evolution and not revolution but we might consider that there are people in this country who think that the proper form of evolution is revolution and in many ways they follow the Party and follow the particular country in which these doctrines have got acceptation.  You have a revolutionary spirit and that is being fostered by the Government. That being so, it is quite clear that we must take all contingencies into account.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a clause which in the year 1923 might be perfectly harmless, a clause that might not cause any anxiety normally, namely the phrase &ldquo;in accordance with proper methods of husbandry,&rdquo; may become an instrument of tyranny and eviction in certain developments in this country. Remember we had supporters of the Government and, if I mistake not, even members of the Government, practically telling the people from public platforms that they will have to clear out of the land if they do not farm their lands in the way the Government want them, if they do not, for instance, fall in with the wheat policy of the Government. We have heard that policy propounded in this House.  It has been pointed out to us by members of the Government that the salvation of the country depends on the success of that policy.  What is more easy <Col N="925" /> for the present Government in one of its more revolutionary moods or for any revolutionary Government that may succeed it, to take up the line that because of the way in which the ordinary farmer farms his land, for producing cattle, etc. he is using it if I may quote the words of the Minister, in an anti-social manner? Who is to decide whether or not he is using his land in an anti-social manner?  In this case, is it not the Minister?  Is that one of the excepted matters or not?  Therefore I suggest that sub-section (3) as the Bill now stands is in itself an element of danger.</P>
    <P>But, leaving that aside there is so much that threatens the future of the country in this section and Section 31, that it is difficult to understand how any Government, having the welfare of the country at heart, and having any kind of imagination whatever, any grip of the realities of the situation, could have ventured on a policy of that kind.  What is the excuse?  The relief of congestion. What is the reality?  Section 31? The excuse is to relieve congestion, especially in the West, but in reality Section 31 carries you far beyond any such problem.  It is to provide land for the landless.  Remember it is no longer a comparatively small number you are dealing with.  The congests may be large in number but taken as a whole they are a comparatively small number.  In addition you are now dealing with all the landless. Where are you going to stop?  Does anybody think that Deputy Kennedy is going to receive the people from the West with open arms?  As he pointed out clearly, there is congestion in Westmeath and there are landless people in Westmeath.  They will have to be provided for.  I doubt if very many congests from the West will come from any other county under this particular Bill to the rich lands of Kildare, Meath and Westmeath. Yet you are offering to provide land for the congests and the landless.  Does anybody suggest that there is enough land in this country to satisfy that particular demand?  If so, if it is to be satisfied, where is the line to be <Col N="926" /> drawn?  At the £2,000 worth of a farm or at the 30 acres mentioned by the President?  Can you stop there or will you reach the ideal of Deputy Moore, the Hungarian ideal, where they chopped up the land so much&mdash;he is my authority&mdash;and went so far that they had to amalgamate the lands again?</P>
    <P>Surely, anybody who knows the history of this country must know perfectly well the dangers of stirring up the agitation which the Government is stirring up.  First of all there is a bad principle involved and on that account we should oppose this section.  Apart altogether from the question of opposition to the principle, there is the deliberate stirring up of an agitation that the Government cannot stop.  It was only the other night that the Attorney-General said, in connection with the land agitation that started here during the Black-and-Tan period, that enough of a tribute or enough of appreciation had not been paid to the I.R.A. for the work they did in suppressing or in dealing with that agitation.  That is precisely the fact. See what that means.  It means that in the course of a year an agitation was got up and was spreading like a forest fire through the country.  It took an army, at a time when there was a war on, to deal with that situation.  That is the kind of agitation the Government is now attempting to stir up.  The Minister states that he is for evolution and not revolution.  These are his words, and he made great play with them.  In reality, as I say, he is so steeped in revolution that he does not know it when he sees it.  The Government here as elsewhere are so simple as to believe that you can start a revolution and then buy it off by cajolery and bribery.  You can do nothing of the kind.  The one excuse&mdash;it may be an excuse or, if not an excuse, an explanation at all events&mdash;for the Government, so far as this section is concerned, is that they do not know in this case, any more than they knew in other cases, the strength of the forces that they threaten to let loose on the country.  If they did realise <Col N="927" /> the strength of these forces, I think that even the present Government would hesitate.  It took a very long struggle before the solution, or what is looked upon as a solution, of the land question in this country was reached.  It goes back even before 1881.  Various methods of solving that particular question were tried.  They all failed until, finally, everybody was agreed that the only solution of that acute question that would bring about the welfare of the country and allow anything like prosperity in this country, especially amongst the farming classes and, therefore, amongst every class, was full proprietorship for the farmers.  That is being got rid of now.  The old insecurity is being brought back, disguise it how you may or limit it how you may, in this Bill.  The insecurity is there.  The land is no longer in the hands of the landlords, it is quite true; but so far as the owner of the land or the farmer is concerned, the insecurity is even greater for him now than it was under the landlords, because he will have to deal with a situation in which, as a result of the Government's propaganda and the Government's policy, class is being goaded against class and hatred is being stirred up. It is in a situation of that kind and at that very time that the Government proposes to start an avalanche of this kind in the shape of a new land agitation and, possibly, a new land war.</P>
    <P>If we look at the benefits that are promised under this Bill I suggest that there are not many.  I am leaving aside, as I said on the Second Reading, the question of the morality or the ethics of the transaction.  I do not understand the morality or the ethics of the Government so far as public policy is concerned and, therefore, there is no need to discuss that question.  Looking at it purely from the point of view of national prudence and national policy, however, and when you think how it concerns the number of congests in the West, and when you think of the great dangers that may be let loose upon the country, I do not see how any person&mdash; even a supporter of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="928" /> Party&mdash;can gleefully vote for this particular section.  I am satisfied that very few congests in the West are going to benefit from the division of the lands of Meath, Westmeath and Kildare.  There will be plenty of local landless people in the neighbourhood of any estates to be split up in these counties who will put in their claims and they will see that their claims are heard.  Everybody knows the difficulty of moving even one person from a neighbouring county, at the present moment, to a place where an estate is being split up.  Everybody knows the danger of bringing in a stranger from outside.  Nobody believes that congestion in the West will be helped by this Bill.  You will still have the problem of congestion, and along with that you will have the whole security of land tenure torn up by the roots.  Running through this Bill is the same contempt for the farmers and for the farming community that the Government have shown right along.  They pretend to be greatly in favour of benefiting the farmer.  They pretend to be stirred up by the fate of the farmer and the losses he is suffering.  In reality, right through their policy, they have shown nothing but contempt for the farming community.  The House should think very seriously before it determines to give a big fillip to an agitation that has been stirred up already on the platforms of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

I quoted them here before during the Second Reading of this Bill.  I quoted the case of the estate of <Col N="929" /> Captain Moore, of Mooresfort, County Tipperary, where the Land Commission endeavoured to take 61 acres of land from Captain Moore and where Deputy Roddy, in reply to Deputy Hassett, who was a Cumann na nGaedheal T.D. for Tipperary at that time, stated that Captain Moore had 5,722 acres in addition to the 61 acres they were trying to take from him, and where Captain Moore beat the Irish Land Commission in the Appeal Court on the question of taking those 61 acres from him.</P>

      <P>Vol. 29, col. 681 of the Official Debates.  Deputy Hassett said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Twelve months ago I put a question on this matter to the Minister for Fisheries.  I asked:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;If he is aware that the Irish Land Commission recently refused to take any portion of the lands owned by Captain Moore, of Mooresfort, Tipperary, for the relief of congestion; if he will state the reason for such refusal; the number of acres at present in the possession of Captain Moore; if he is aware that there are a number of smallholders living near this estate; and what steps he proposes to take to bring them up to the economic standard.&rsquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This was the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;Proceedings were instituted by the Land Commission under the Land Act, 1923, for the acquisition of 61a. 2r. 0p. of the lands of Kilross, on the estate of Captain Moore, County Tipperary.  The owner objected to the acquisition of the lands on the grounds that for many years past they had been worked by him as part of his home farm and farming industry generally, including that of a stud farm, and that if he were deprived of the lands the result would be to materially interfere with the stud farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" />&lsquo;The objection came before the Land Commission Court, who, having considered all the circumstances, gave judgment allowing the objection, and the proceedings were in consequence discontinued. In addition to these lands, Captain Moore is returned in the Schedule of Particulars lodged as holding about 722 acres of demesne lands and 5,000 acres of mountain and woods.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Roddy tells us that there is nothing in this Bill that will enable us to take 61 acres of land from a man with 5,722 acres, despite all the wails from Deputy Hogan and the tears and the bleeding heart of Deputy Dillon in connection with this matter. That is what Deputy Roddy tells us from his experience, and no doubt Deputy Roddy has a lot of experience since he was for so many years in charge of that Department.  If that is so, what are they trying to do?  If Deputy Roddy's argument is correct, that under this section we are unable to take 61 acres from a gentleman with 5,700 acres, what is all the noise at the cross-roads about?  Who is going to take the 10 or 20 acres off the small farmers of the country?  What is it all about if Deputy Roddy's statement is correct, or what is the joke?  I think the bottom must have gone out of that balloon.  Then we had the other case that was mentioned by Deputy Hassett, the Braddell Estate in County Tipperary. There, there was a non-residential farm of 500 acres.  The Land Commission endeavoured to take it over from this gentleman who had another estate in County Cork of 1,188 acres.  The Land Commission endeavoured to take 500 acres from him and to leave him with 1,188 acres. What happened?  This gentleman went to reside in a three-roomed cottage on the 500 acre holding.  He appealed to the Tribunal, and again the Tribunal found that the 500 acre holding was a residential holding because this gentleman was living for a period in a three-roomed cottage on it, with the result <Col N="931" /> that his objection before the Tribunal was upheld.  He was left in possession of these 500 acres together with all the other land that he had.  These are types of cases that we are getting from the opposite side.  Every member of the House is familiar with the ridiculous statements that have been plastered all over the country during the last month or six weeks in connection with this Bill, and particularly with this section dealing with security of tenure.  Does any Deputy on the opposite side seriously suggest that the Dillons and the Davitts who went out in the Land League days would say, if they were asked, that they were out fighting for gentlemen of the type of Captain Moore, to give him the right to hold 5,700 acres that he had evicted his tenantry out of.  What would their reply be if they were asked that question? Does anybody seriously suggest that they were going to stand for security of tenure for that class of bucko?  Were they going to stand for security of tenure for a gentleman with 1,188 acres in County Cork and with another 500 acres in County Tipperary? Were they going to stand for security of tenure for the Smith-Barrys or for Lord Barrymore, who at present owns a couple of thousand acres in my constituency? I hope to have a word to say in dividing up some of that, and there will be no bones about it either.</P>
      <P>We have been accused by Deputy O'Sullivan that we are going to take land for the landless men.  For whom did the Government of which he was a member take land?  Was it for congests or for landless men?  What about the district justice down in County Tipperary who got the 351 acres?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he got it from the Government of which the Deputy was a member.  That land was given at such a price that it would have been of no use to a congest or a landless man. It was divided up at such a price that nobody except a pensioner who, in addition to his pension, got a good slice of a bounty, could ever hope to hold it.  When we hear all this talk about Fianna Fáil taking up a new line and of giving land to the landless, I think it would be very much to the point to know under what definition as landless men or as congests the people who were given land under the last Government&mdash;the particular cases to which I have just referred&mdash;would come?  I could also quote other very glaring cases where land was taken over for the relief of congestion, cases in which men from whom land was taken were given large areas of land elsewhere, and where the land that was taken for the relief of congestion was given to single individuals, in some cases to the first cousins of those who left it.  Surely there was no need to give any congest or landless man 200 <Col N="933" /> acres.  Undoubtedly, the gentlemen opposite were generous to their own. It is with the knowledge of what they did themselves in the past that they are judging the Government in office to-day.  That is why we are accused of going to do this, that and the other; that we are going, as Deputy Dillon said, to divide up the land amongst friends of Fianna Fáil.  It is because of what the people opposite did in the past in regard to the division of estates that we are hearing all this talk now.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan spoke of the anxiety there is throughout the country.  In spite of all the efforts of the Deputies opposite to, so to speak, raise some steam in the country by means of platform orations and otherwise&mdash;the orations which they have been pouring out through the country on this Bill during the last month or six weeks&mdash;I have not seen one bit of anxiety in the country.  There is no anxiety whatever in the country in regard to this Bill.  Is the Government to be accused of leaving gentlemen in possession of 5,700 acres and taking, say, 50 or 60 acres from men like Deputy Kent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the division of land proves a success under this Bill I hope we will go further.  If the Bill proves to be a failure I hope we will not stop in office for ten years, looking at the failure&mdash;as the people opposite did&mdash;without making an attempt to remedy the situation.

      <P>I want to ask the Minister whether there is any prospect of his making a concession in this section, on the lines of amendment 115, in the name of Deputy Roddy, and a further concession on the lines of amendment 119, in my name, which seeks to take care of the case where a man is acquiring land with the intention of making it a residential holding for one of his children.  Deputy Roddy's amendment seeks to restore a very legitimate safeguard, and it appears to me, if the Minister could see his way to make concessions on the lines of these two amendments, it would mitigate the objections to the section as a whole, very considerably.  I will not press that further.  I will let the Minister reflect on it.  I want to say a few words with reference to the speech that we heard from Deputy Corry.  It is really too bad that the Attorney-General is again absent. Unfortunately he is always absent when Deputy Corry is speaking, because it would be so interesting to get him to try to reconcile Deputy Corry's views on the Land Commission <Col N="936" /> in this Bill with his own.  There may be two views as to the extent to which this Bill shakes security of tenure, or will shakes it in practice.  One thing is certain, that if the Fianna Fáil contention is correct, that it is not going to shake it in practice, it is very undesirable that the people of the country, as a whole, should think that it will shake it.  If this Bill passes into law it will become the duty of all of us to reassure the people, as far as possible, as to the spirit in which the Bill is going to be administered, and as to the maintenance of security of tenure, especially for small people.  We all know that it would be absolutely disastrous for agriculture if the people got the idea into their heads that they are insecure.  No one wants them to get that idea into their heads, unless that idea legitimately should be in their heads.  The Minister has made some important concessions already on this Bill, and has made some very reassuring declarations, as to the spirit in which this Bill is going to be administered, if it becomes an Act.  He was particularly emphatic about noninterference from the political side with the work of the Land Commission.  Yet, what are we to feel when we listen to Deputy Corry stating that he is looking forward in the near future to the dividing up of estates in his own constituency?</P>

      <P>I would like to reassure Deputy MacDermot that, when I said I was looking forward to the dividing up of estates, my sole reason was that I think it will be for the benefit of the people, and will largely relieve unemployment. If there are 2,000 acres of land on which there is only a man and a dog, I will ask that that land be taken, and that people be put on it who will work it.</P>

      <P>I am not desirous of casting any reflection on Deputy Corry's motives.  I dare say he would select estates for division in the spirit of the purest patriotism, as he conceives it; but if the Bill is going to be administered by Deputy Corry, it is going to be administered quite differently from the manner in which the Minister and the Government have told us it is going to be administered. <Col N="937" /> The feeling of insecurity about this Bill that has been created in the country has been mainly due to indiscreet declarations by persons on the Government Benches.  There have been, first of all, declarations by some Ministers. Even in the course of debates in the House, if a Minister becomes discreet, a good many of the supporters of the Government remain indiscreet.  If this Bill is not going to do far greater damage than by its terms it actually should do, there ought to be a different attitude and a more discreet tone adopted by the supporters of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I certainly cannot follow the last speaker.  The spirit in which this measure will be administered will depend entirely on the outlook of the Ministry of the day, and an assurance from the Minister in charge of it now as to how it is going to be administered is not worth the making, because Governments and Ministries will come and go, but this will remain an Act until it is repealed and any guarantee now will have little effect on the manner in which this government's successor will administer it or, for that matter, any other Act of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with what Deputy Belton has said.  It is not inconsistent with my point, which is merely this, that if the Bill is once an Act and is placed on the Statute Book we must do all we can to have it well administered.  We will do everything we can now to prevent interference with security; but once this is an Act it becomes our duty to do all we can to have it well administered and to reassure the minds of the people.</P>

      <P>It is time enough to consider how we will slide down the slippery slopes when this becomes an Act. There are principles involved in this Bill which we must oppose.  We should not contemplate the position in which we will find ourselves when the proposals on this Bill will be embodied in an Act.  This Bill could not be framed or conceived by any body of men except men imbued with a communistic outlook.  This is the purest of communism, undiluted communism.  It is <Col N="938" /> dishonest.  I will take the Minister up on his own statements.  This section is particularly dishonest.  The Minister is going to smash the principle for which the whole Plan of Campaign was initiated.  He is going to destroy peasant proprietorship.  It is immaterial whether he fixes the limit at £2,000 or £20,000.  He is breaking the principle.  If, in his opinion, it is right to dispossess the owner of real estate of anything he holds over £2,000 in value, he is working upon a very bad principle.  He can say next year: &ldquo;We will take land from a man if he has anything worth over £1,500.&rdquo;  The following year he can bring the limit down to £1,000 and he can follow on till he finally deals with one or two acres that might be worth £100.  There is no end to this if that principle is adopted.</P>
      <P>The Minister recently expressed the hope that another section of the Bill would be discussed in a different atmosphere. He wondered if anybody thought the Ministry was going to interfere with the farm that was worked to the best national advantage. We hear a lot of those platitudes about working a farm to the best national advantage, but they are not used by any man doing practical work on his farm.  What is meant by working a farm to the best national advantage? By their actions we shall judge them. I consider that this gesture on the part of the Government is dishonest.  Take the case of any business.  If it does not pay a dividend, the owner has an uneasy feeling about it.  He wonders if it is properly managed.  If that business, in addition to paying no dividend, does not pay its way, has not the owner 100 per cent. doubt about its soundness and management?  Who are the farmers whom the Minister is satisfying at the expense of the farmers who are running their farms well? The Minister is forgiving those who do not pay their way and putting the expense on the men who do pay their way.  That is embodied in Section 12, which deals with people who do not pay their annuities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>When dealing with this section the Minister said that anybody working his farm properly and to the best national advantage would not be interfered with.  I want to show from the Minister's own words that he is subsidising the people who are not working their lands well.  I wonder if he means what he says in regard to this section&mdash;that any man working his land well will not be interfered with, regardless of the size of the farm?  I notice that he took very good care that neither he nor the Attorney-General committed himself to putting down an amendment to that effect.</P>
      <P>If he were honest about it, on the face of it would he not admit that it is the business that is not paying its way that is unsound?  Is it not unprofitably worked?  Surely he cannot say that the business that is not paying its way is worked to the best possible advantage.  Yet out of the local exchequer the Government subsidises that.  In a speech which the Minister made a week or two ago he made a special plea for these people here.  Are we to put those people, he asked, on the side of the road in order to enforce those arrears?  No, but he is going to put people on the side of the road who are working their lands well.  He is going to subsidise those people who, on the evidence before the Minister, are not working their lands well.  He is going to subsidise them, not by means of the Central Fund but he is going to subsidise them from the ratepayers' pockets.  He is going to subsidise them with the money from the men who are paying their way and working their land well.  On that point, what does the Minister mean by working the land well?  We hear a lot of talk on the Government Benches about hundreds of acres being run by a man and dog.  Will any Minister get up&mdash;assuming that the farms are worked by a man and dog&mdash;and say that the man who is running his farm with a man and dog is doing it for the love of that kind of farming?  Or is he doing it because that is the only farming that will pay him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you are going to take the farmers to task for the way they run their farms address yourself, first, to the <Col N="940" /> problem of prices.  If that farm were run in another way not only would it not pay him, but it may not be run to the best national advantage.  It is all right for a man going along the road who sees a 50 acre field to say: &ldquo;here is a 50 acre field, what a pity that field is not tilled, what a lot of people would be employed on that field.&rdquo;  But that man never tilled 50 acres himself, and he had not to worry on a Saturday night to know where he was to get the wages for those men.  It is extraordinary on a debate like this on land policy that we have not the presence here of the Minister who, above all others, should be here, the Minister for Agriculture. If a farm is grazed it is because the economic policy in this country did not permit of any other method of farming to make that farm pay.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister in charge of the Bill went away and that we are only left with the legal adviser of the Government here.  I have every respect for the Attorney-General both in an offensive and defensive capacity, but, after all, I think the House should have the Minister here whose job it is to look after land or agriculture or both.  I am not saying perhaps that the Attorney-General does not know as much as any of them about land.  I think he does.  However, I think we can get on as well without the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which I would like to put before the House, and I put it up as a direct challenge, if you like, to any of the Government spokesmen to stand up here and say that the agricultural policy in the last 80 or 90 years took any other direction than the natural economic direction dictated by the prices trend in agricultural produce that obtained over that period.  In support of that challenge I have here actual data from 1840 down to 1925 to prove my statement. At the figure of 100 in the year 1840, the prices would be in 1925 as follows:&mdash; wheat 117, oats 139, barley 155, hay 117, potatoes 177, flax 207, butter 147, pork 144, wool 133, eggs 138, beef 138, mutton 145, store cattle one to two-year old 143, and store cattle two to three years, 200. <Col N="941" /> All these figures would compare with 100 in 1840.  That shows that store cattle were out on their own.  I am sorry I gave the wrong figures there. I gave the figures, not for 1925, but for 1868.  Now, the Attorney-General can lie back and laugh and explain those figures when I am done.  He can laugh away after I am done.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is treated seriously by the Government I want them to remember the prices of 1925.  Now the price of wheat in 1925 as against the figure 100 in 1840 was 118; oats 172, barley 140; hay 189; potatoes 334, flax 237, butter 189, pork 260, wool 114, eggs 497, beef 183, mutton 269, store cattle one and two years old 443; and cattle two years old and upward 403.  But we get Ministers here standing up and blaming the farmers for utilising their land to produce a certain product that as compared with 1840 shows a price of 443 as against 100.  Has not the farmer shown business wisdom by pursuing the line of activity that pays him best?  Will any Deputy on the opposite side get up and controvert that?  Will any Deputy opposite get up and show 20 per cent. of the land that I can show under tillage?  I am not arguing from the graziers' point of view.  Will any Deputy opposite get up and show 20 per cent. of the agricultural wages that I can show or even that he is paying at a rate of 60 per cent. of the wages that I pay?  I am not arguing from the graziers' point of view but from the commonsense point of view.  The figures I have read to the House are figures compiled from the Census returns, probably by the ablest man who was ever in the Civil Service.  We are told that the land is not worked to the best national advantage.  Whose is the fault if a proper agricultural policy has not been formulated for working the land to the best national advantage? If you want the land to be tilled produce a policy that will make tillage more profitable than live stock grazing. When you do that you are on the right road.  Until you do that you are only groping in the dark.  If you want to get the land of the country worked in such a way that will pay the farmers you have to produce that policy first. <Col N="942" /> If you will not what do you propose doing?  What will the sub-division of large farms mean?  If you sub-divide 5,000 acres into 100 small holdings what will it mean?  It will mean that you will have so many small ranches instead of one big ranch.  It cannot mean anything else, if the present agricultural trend of prices is allowed to operate. We will be told by men who know nothing about agriculture, men who never earned a week's livelihood by agriculture, &ldquo;we want a different agricultural policy.&rdquo;  Where is the Minister for Agriculture showing us a different agricultural policy here? He is conspicuous by his absence.</P>
    <P>If you allow this trend of prices to operate the division of the land will mean that instead of one man running, say, 5,000 acres you will have 100 little grazing ranches instead of one grazing ranch.  When you put 40 per cent. on their produce the whole hundred will be running to the workhouse.  We have the ordinary methods of husbandry mentioned in this.  I hold that while that system obtains the ordinary methods of husbandry are being pursued by these farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Government would not interfere with farms of whatever size that were run according to the ordinary methods of husbandry. He has not made any attempt to get out of the entanglements he has worked himself into.  I hope he will make an attempt.  It is extraordinary to find people coming in here and saying that we must curtail agricultural activities.  They want to undo the work of the Creator; they want to bring all the people down to one common level.  In support of that the Minister for Agriculture said that two-thirds of the land was owned by one-third of the people, and that we should not allow that to go on.  Will the Minister for Agriculture deny that two-thirds, and more than two-thirds, of the income from the medical profession in Dublin goes to less than two-thirds of the medical practitioners in Dublin?  Will the Attorney-General deny that two-thirds of the income from the legal profession goes to less than one-third of the legal practitioners <Col N="943" /> in Dublin?  To use the words of Deputy Corry, why not distribute the loot? Does the Minister for Agriculture mean that proper agriculture is not a profession? It is the noblest profession in the world.  We who make our livelihood at it are not one bit ashamed of it.  We hold our heads as agriculturists higher than any lawyer or doctor can hold his head.  We produce, while they live on our backs.  We are carrying the lot of them&mdash;even on both sides of the House; but the professional gentlemen on our side of the House have not committed that blunder.  Take the business of Dublin City.  Is not two-thirds of the business of Dublin carried on by less than one-third of the shops in Dublin? Is it not the same in the industrial world?  Why are not these singled out for distribution amongst the workless? Why is not Guinness' divided up into fragments and the unemployed given a bit each?  Why is not Jacobs' divided up?  Why is not the Shannon scheme divided up, and why do not the landless people of Clare and Limerick take up industry instead of looking for a piece of their neighbour's land?  Why does not Deputy Corry become eloquent about the millions involved in the Shannon scheme?  Why is not that given over to the landless men instead of the paltry 5,000 acres he wastes his time talking about?  What is wrong with the Government is that they do not understand agriculture.  Not one of them understands the first thing about it.  Agriculture is a progressive science.  Any farmer who is not able to take a sample of his soil and go through the simple process of analysing it to discover what fertilisers it is deficient in will be left behind in the race in this year of 1933 if he goes in for tillage.  That is all Greek to the Front Bench opposite.  There is no reason why there should not be a department which, on receipt of a postcard or a telephone message or a wire from a farmer, would send a person to look at the field he is going to crop, take a sample of it and prescribe for it just as the doctor would prescribe for a patient, so that the farmer could take the prescription to his manure <Col N="944" /> merchant and be provided with the fertilisers that he should put into that field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the section was necessary and that it would apply only to those people who did not work their land according to the ordinary methods of husbandry. My reference, in passing, to soil analysis and so forth was to bring it home to the Minister that he is sublimely ignorant of what working the land according to the ordinary methods of husbandry means and, therefore, he cannot contemplate working the land according to the ordinary methods of husbandry under this Bill.  I suppose if he saw me analysing a portion of my soil on the head of a shovel he would say that that fellow should be committed to Grangegorman.  I submit to the Minister for his serious consideration, if he is honestly pursuing the course of putting more men on the land, that the division of land will not put more men on it.  In his opening speech he said that had been the fixed policy of Fianna Fáil since its inception. We know that Fianna Fáil always adapts its policy to the circumstances of the moment.  The Minister said that since its inception the fixed policy of Fianna Fáil was to put the maximum number of people on the soil.  I suggest to the Minister that it is not his Department that is going to put the most people on the soil.  It is the Department of the Minister for Agriculture. It is the agricultural policy that will put more people on the soil and not the land policy.  We were told about the derelict farms which Deputy Corry said he saw around the country and the high prices that had been paid for them.  The Deputy also claimed in various speeches and so did the Minister, that the principle embodied in this section was embodied in the Act of 1923.  The Minister knows well that that is not so.  Deputy Corry referred to the derelict farms that should be divided up.  Again I would remind the <Col N="945" /> Minister that in the case of these farms on which he proposes to remit the arrears if these arrears had been paid the farms would not be derelict.  If they both want to be a little insistent and consistent in these matters I would suggest that the Minister and Deputy Corry should get together, and come to a common denominator on the point where Deputy Corry wants to show how these farms became derelict and to blame the previous Administration. He also taunted the Front Opposition Bench here about the Act of 1923 and said that the landlords were allowed to get away with the loot under that Act. That comes well from a Party which never raised its voice on any point against the Land Act of 1923 until now. I opposed the Act of 1923 when it was a Bill going through this House, in every county in the Free State, and I never met one single member of the Fianna Fáil Party to say a word for or against the Act of 1923 at that time. If they had any sense of decency, after taking 10 years to find out what was wrong with it, they would let the fault pass by now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Government Party will not change their mind with regard to this section, but I would ask the Labour Party to consider what they are doing.  If they are genuinely interested in having more men on the soil, I put it to them that it is not by an alteration in land policy that that will be done, but rather by an intelligent formation of an agricultural policy. Perhaps if the owner of that 5,000 acres mentioned worked his land in a husbandlike manner, and paid good wages, he would employ more human beings than if the whole 5,000 acres were split up into 50 little farms. Again I would remind the Labour Party that, as they know, hardly any two men are of the same capacity.  A man who takes up farming as a profession should be allowed to develop his own profession and business.  Why say to a farmer: &ldquo;Thus far you shall go and no further&rdquo;?  Why not say to the lawyer: &ldquo;Ten guineas per day and no more&rdquo;?  Deputies opposite agree with that, but still they are supporting the limitation of the farmers' profession. The man who would put <Col N="946" /> agriculture right in this country would be worth £10,000,000.  I am not a person to set a limit as to what a man is worth.  The job is the thing that counts; and the man that would put commonsense into the Fianna Fáil Party would be worth the whole nation. Why fix a limit in agriculture?  How can there be any progress in agriculture if we are all to be brought down to a common level?  You will find men who could live well on 30 or 40 acres of land and who would starve upon 100 acres of land; and you would get men who would do well upon 100 acres of land and who would starve on 20 or 30 acres of land.  If a man through his own exertions is able to go freely into the market and buy 500 acres of land, and can work it in conformity with good husbandry, why should he not be allowed to do so?  Is it not the same principle as the man who takes a little shop, starts huckstering, gets into business, then finds he has not capacity enough for his business in that particular little shop and goes out and purchases better?  Are you to say to him, you cannot increase your business?</P>

I am surprised that the Deputy from Clare suggests that you could get primary wealth down in Clare&mdash;that you could pick it up in the fields and on the mountains and in the bogs in Clare.  There would be a great rush to Clare, if that were true.  But I am afraid the rush is rather from Clare than to Clare.  If you can pick up wealth in Clare, why piffle about dividing up a few farms?  You will get no wealth without work, and the Deputy knows there is no wealth in 10/- a ton for Clare turf.  Why circumscribe the small farmer any more than the shopkeeper?</P>

He has insinuated that.  I challenge him to prove it.  They are not the best things for the country.  If the land of this country is divided up into small holdings and a blight comes on any crop, how are you going to rescue it? How are you going to have scientific agriculture?  What use is going to be made of the Faculty of Agriculture? Is it not to be an unnecessary luxury?  If the Minister wants to plant the most men on the land, why does he not suggest that every reaper and binder in the country should be scrapped, and the scrap iron sold to one of the Deputies behind him?

      <P>Under Section 28 no land will be interfered with if it is worked according to the proper methods of husbandry.  I am suggesting to the Minister that&mdash;if his sublime policy of putting the most people on the land is to be carried out to the fullest &mdash;this is the way to carry it out. Deputy Hogan suggested that agriculture was a primary industry.  I want the Minister to go back to primitive methods, and to make it a primary industry.  That is how you will get the most people on the land.  In this section he is destroying security of tenure.  He is destroying something which people in this country value: something that a money value cannot be put on.  Deputy MacDermot suggested that there should be some sugar coating on the pill.  I suggest that there should not; that the real pill should be put before the country.  If they are prepared to swallow it without any sugar coating then they stand behind the Government.  The Government should be fair, and not put any sugar coating on it.  They should say: &ldquo;By this Bill we mean to destroy fixity of tenure.  We take to ourselves the right to acquire the land.&rdquo;  We were not told what size farm is referred to.  Does the Minister not see what he has walked into now? No farm in the country would average more than £2,000 to-day.  What man would give more than £2,000 for it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gorey is not in the House, and I think the Deputy opposite would not have much to say if Deputy Gorey were here.  This Bill was not before the House when the farm in question was bought.  Saying that there is no security in a farm over £2,000 in value automatically reduces all farms in the country to £2,000.  No man is going to pay more.  There is no comparison between the size of farms.  The proposal is to acquire land and give economic holdings.  The economic holding has not been defined for us.  I suggest that the Minister should study the difficulty that the late Sir Antony Macdonnell found in conceiving the idea of an economic holding. I know places where an acre of <Col N="949" /> land would be an economic holding and I know places where 100 acres would not be an economic holding.  I know farms of four acres in County Dublin which gave a bigger return this year than farms of 500 acres.  A lot depends on the suitability of the land.  A lot depends on the technical knowledge of the worker, and a lot depends upon the track of trade.  What have the Minister and his colleagues been doing? They have been destroying the track of trade in this country for the last year and a half.  Now they propose to take the land which they say is not worked to the best national advantage according to the ordinary methods of husbandry, and give it to people who will work it economically and make economic holdings.  The Minister has never defined what an economic holding is. With the market destroyed I think it would be impossible for him to define it, but he muddles on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole idea of this Bill, and this section in particular&mdash;because all the rest are only padding; this is the kernel of the Bill&mdash;is to confiscate the land.  They hope to carry the mob. They say: &ldquo;We are going only for the big fellow&rdquo; and they hope to carry the mob to get the big fellow by the throat.  When they have got the principle the rest will be easy.  It is pure Communism.  They have not at all attempted to solve the problem by a scientific agricultural policy.  They want to take the land off somebody who has it, and give it to congests and landless men.  If a man with four or five acres is given a slice off this land, is he to work the increased holding with the implements with which he worked the four or five acres, or is he to get more machinery?  If he worked the four or five acres with primitive methods and he works 30 or 40 acres with suitable machinery he will have employed as many men on the four or five acres as he will employ on the 30 or 40 acres.  The whole aim is to get hold of the land, to destroy peasant proprietorship, to pull all the farmers down to a common level&mdash;to reduce them to the position they were in a hundred years ago when they were referred to as peasants.  Any farmer <Col N="950" /> to-day does not take it as a compliment to be referred to as a peasant. Not by any means.  The professional class can make up their minds that if they want to reduce the farmers to the level of peasants their action will not find favour with the farmers.  Let us have the communistic proposal stripped of all its padding.  Let it be shown as it really is.  If the principle is conceded, then those amendments count for nothing.  If the principle of £2,000 value is given to the Government it can be brought down as low as the whim of any Minister of the day desires.  It will destroy progressive farming.  The Minister, if he made any study of progressive farming in other countries, should know that progress in agriculture&mdash;outside of market gardening and horticulture&mdash;both as regards cultivated crops and live stock, has been made by big farmers on big farms.  If we had a proper agricultural policy, with big farms of 300, 400 or even 5,000 acres, run as ordinary agricultural farms, it would be better than any agricultural college which this or any other Government could set up in the country.  But no such educative power can ever be established if we reduce the size of the farms to the £2,000 standard.  It is going to be a serious loss to agriculture.  We know the old idea that obtained in this country&mdash;the fool of the family given the farm.  All the other members of the family were sent into the professions, into the Civil Service, into the police force or anywhere you like, but the &ldquo;mug&rdquo; got the farm.

      <P>I may have got a farm, but the Deputy got nothing, and even though I am to be classed in that category I am certainly a degree above the Deputy who interrupted.  Why not leave the profession of agriculture open to the best brains of the country? Why not make it possible to have a career in agriculture in this country? If you are not going to allow a man to get beyond practically the spade and shovel stage, nobody is going to stick in agriculture in this country.  Give it a chance so that brains may be applied <Col N="951" /> to it.  There is no calling in this country which requires more brains than agriculture, but it is going to be destroyed now if this is passed.  This Bill has been introduced without an assurance being put before the House that the fundamentals of the agricultural industry will not be injured if these proposals are put over.  The Minister has not applied himself at all to that.  He has only appealed to the selfish passions of the mob, dishonest passions with very little regard for the Ten Commandments: &ldquo;This man has land; why should he have so much land; why should you not have more?&rdquo; You might as well say that because one man has a bad suit of clothes, and another has three or four suits, you should take some suits from the man who has three or four.  The question is, does a man own the land legally, did he get it honestly and legally?  If he did not get it honestly, take it off him, not because he has too much land, but because he did not come by it honestly.  If he has it honestly, and if he is not working it to the best national advantage, that is the fault of the Minister, who has not shown brains enough to devise a policy that would enable that man to work the land to the best national advantage.  The whole thing is in the hands of the Government, but this suggests the rule of the gun.  They do not seem to be as fond of guns as they were.  They are apparently getting afraid of them. Though the gun is in this, figuratively, no knowledge is shown of the sentimental value attached to their land by farmers, nor have the Ministry betrayed any knowledge whatever of how agriculture has advanced in other countries or the necessity for having farms of varying sizes in this country so as to suit the varying capacities of the people of the country.  If you reduce the size of the farms down to a common level, and that a low level, you must look forward to the land of this country being farmed on a common level by the lowest level of intelligence amongst the people of the country.</P>

      <P>Though he is always a bit of a bore, Deputy Belton is the <Col N="952" /> most convenient speaker the Government has in this House, because he invariably succeeds in effectively smashing every argument he makes by a succeeding argument.

      <P>He is the best and the most convenient speaker the Government has though he sits on the Opposition Benches.  Deputy Belton's idea of farming is rather unique though I must say it is very up-to-date.  His methods of farming&mdash;he called it &ldquo;proper methods of husbandry&rdquo;&mdash;are rather advanced.  He said that if we had a proper method in this country, if a farmer decided to choose a field for tillage and wanted to know what he could grow to the best advantage in it, he should be in the position that all he would have to do would be to telephone to the Department or send a post-card to it and have an inspector within a few hours, to examine the clay, tell him what crop he should grow and issue a certificate to him to go to the manure supply department to get a supply of the particular kind of manure that the Department had decided was suitable for that soil.  He was interrupted at that point and I thought it was rather unfortunate because if he had been allowed to carry on and to develop his interesting views, probably we should have heard from him that the next thing the farmer ought to be able to do would be to press a button to get his hens to lay eggs.  He has a very advanced idea of agriculture.</P>

      <P>I regret that in an hour's speech Deputy Belton did not make himself clear to anybody in the House. I regret that, as one who has such an experience of farming, he has still to be told the kind of fertiliser that suits a particular soil.  I know farmers who know a good deal more than most instructors of agriculture about their farms and about the type of fertilisers that suits them.  They are able to make their little farms pay if they are anything like economic farms at all. They are not the type about whom Deputy Belton talked, and they are not &ldquo;mugs&rdquo; either.  I resent that remark. I spent a good part of my life on a farm, and I know these farmers are <Col N="954" /> not &ldquo;mugs.&rdquo;  Deputy Belton can only be speaking of the Cumann na nGaedheal type of farmer he knows. It should not be allowed to pass in this House that up to the present the men who have got the farms in this country were the &ldquo;mugs&rdquo; of their respective families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I submit that I made no such statement. I said that there was an impression abroad that only the &ldquo;mug&rdquo; of the family got the farm.  I did not say that it was the &ldquo;mug&rdquo; of the family who got the farm.  It is quite evident from some of the interjections that there are more &ldquo;mugs&rdquo; than the farmers, anyhow.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Belton's statement means anything, it must mean that the Government know what they are doing, and that there is a certain type of farmers in this country, who have large farms, who are &ldquo;mugs,&rdquo; and that it is time to have these farms run in the interests of the country.  Deputy Belton wants to have the maximum number of people on the land, he says, and he went back to the last century.</P>

      <P>As I said, Deputy Belton went back to the last century.  I am not surprised at that, because when he was asked to state facts on a former debate he refused to come down to details.  He is a century away from the details on this amendment, and we are satisfied to leave him a century away, because it would be a catastrophe altogether if he came up to date.  He and other Deputies opposite talked about fixity of tenure. Deputy Belton boasts of being the only man in this House who knows anything about agriculture and, in fact, of being the only well-informed man in this State where agriculture is concerned.  If his speech means anything, it means that the man with 2,000, 5,000 or 10,000 acres, as the case may be, is the only farmer who is able to run a farm economically in this State.  If his speech means anything it means that he does not want small farms.  He does not want <Col N="955" /> a large farm of 5,000 or 10,000 acres to be divided up into so many farms of, say, 50 acres each.  He is against that because, he said, it will mean that there will be a certain number of small graziers instead of one big grazier.  If that is the Cumann na nGaedheal idea, I am not surprised that they are fighting shy of this Bill, because I do admit that it aims at the direct opposite.  I think it is the first time that anybody, who claims to represent the farming interests in this State or to be a member of a Party with the interests of the farmers at heart, ever stated openly and above-board that the large farm of 2,000, 5,000 or 10,000 acres was the only farm that would be economical and that that was the type of farm that should be favoured by the Government.  If that statement is made definitely here, I should like to know if the other members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or of the Centre Party are prepared to back it up and to say that is their policy also.  At any rate, it is not the Government's policy and, so far as I can, I will do all in my power to see that it never will be the Government's policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies in this House have talked a lot about fixity of tenure.  If they have watched the progress of the 1923 Land Act they will know very well that a particular clause in that Bill, which they held safeguarded fixity of tenure, absolutely destroyed the intentions of the Minister for Agriculture, as he was then, when that Bill was being passed through both Houses here.  Take the case of the West of Ireland.  I do not blame Deputy Belton or other Deputies from the South for not being able to see this problem in its entirety.  There is a different problem altogether in the West of Ireland and other parts of the congested districts from that which exists in the East and South.  Some of the Deputies are looking at the problem too much from what I might call the eastern point of view.  I know that there are extensive farms of land in the West of Ireland and the people who own those lands have <Col N="956" /> fixity of tenure.  They are simply graziers.  To my mind, they are not running their farms under the proper methods of husbandry, nor have they done so for a considerable number of years.  Some of them, whom I know very well, have been letting parts of those farms for grazing and conacre tillage to people with large families living on three or four acres of land. Because of a particular clause of the previous Bill, the Government, under the 1923 Act, could not interfere with those people and could not take over the land.  This section that is now being criticised is designed to remedy that defect and I think that most people who know the congested districts, if they are just and honest, will have to admit that such a clause as this is absolutely necessary in so far as it remedies that defect.</P>
    <P>Fixity of tenure can be described in various ways.  Are we to take it that a man with 5,000 or 10,000 acres of land, with fixity of tenure, can do anything he likes with that land? Are we to take it, if in the vicinity of that land there are 2,000 people living in hovels and on slum holdings with an average standard valuation of 15/-, that that man with the 5,000 or 10,000 acres can absolutely waste it while the people in the neighbourhood are living under conditions of starvation?  If that is the policy of Cumann na nGaedheal, and if such a man is not to be interfered with, are we to take it that that position will be a preventive of Communism? Deputies opposite talk a lot about Communism.  Where is there a better breeding ground for Communism or any other &ldquo;ism&rdquo; than a position of that kind where a man with 5,000 or 10,000 acres of land can let it go to waste if he likes, while in the locality a large number of people are not able to exist on their miserable holdings? I hold that the best preventive of Communism is the Government's policy of having the land used by the people and safeguarding a very large number of the community under fixity of tenure by giving them economic holdings and placing on the land the men who are able and capable of working the land and providing <Col N="957" /> for themselves and their families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the driving force behind this amendment from the Government Benches is concentrated largely on this question of the farms of 5,000 or 10,000 acres and so on.  At any rate, they seem to think so.  I am not acquainted with some of the matters, although the constituency which I happen to represent has loomed largely in this debate here to-day, but I want to tell Deputy Corry that during the last week a Land Commission officer, or somebody in connection with the Land Commission, visited one of the best farmers in Tipperary, whose farming is so good that I defy anybody to challenge it.  The visit was in connection with this Bill.  This man is not a rancher but a farmer, and this kind of thing has been going on pretty extensively in my constituency.  These men are not ranchers but ordinary working farmers, and I am stating before the House the position as we see it in connection with this Bill.  Very recently I asked that somebody from the Government Benches, when they talked about the conditions of the ordinary small farmer, would inform us what section in the Bill would protect or safeguard the farmer with 50 acres or 100 acres.  I was told &ldquo;commonsense.&rdquo;  I am not prepared to take that as an answer when I ask a direct question with regard to the purpose of a section in a Bill.  A lot has been said about fixity of tenure.  Some people seem to think that it should not be there at all.  I think it was Deputy Kennedy who pointed out that there were a number of countries in which there was not fixity of tenure at all.  It does not exist, I think, in Russia.  I do not want to see this country brought to the same level as Russia.  I would invite in particular Deputy Davin's attention to the following extract from the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the sale of cottages and plots under the Labourers' Acts:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It appears to us that it is scarcely necessary to argue the <Col N="958" /> advantages of ownership.  The history of our country has been one continuous struggle both on the land and in the town to gain the freedom and security that go with ownership. This we regard as a basic and essential principle in any Christian State that bases social order on justice.  In the security which it gives, better citizenship is developed, and men are encouraged to improve their holdings by the certain knowledge that the improvements effected will inure to themselves or their families.  We are satisfied that when tenants become owners of their cottages they will gladly devote their spare time to improving and beautifying the homes which will be theirs for all time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to know if Deputy Davin subscribes to that doctrine.  I would like to say that some of those whose names are appended to that document have very little regard for the rights of ownership in other directions, or for fixity of tenure. Notwithstanding that, they turn around and put that paragraph in their Report.  I want to say that I do not object to it at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in anybody denying that this section of the Bill does interfere with every right.  I asked a moment ago if any Deputy on the benches opposite could show me where, in the section, there is security for the 50-acre farm or even for the 20-acre farm?  The security is not there, and I submit to the House that it only needs just a little stirring up of hostility in a certain district to turn that district into a congested district so that people can apply for any man's land.  Very probably Fianna Fáil Deputies will say that that is not so, but where is there anything in the Bill to prevent such a thing taking place?  No Deputy on the opposite <Col N="959" /> side has been able to point out to me where there is any security whatever in this Bill.  That is the particular objection that I have to it.  If a hardworking, industrious farmer acquired an extra holding in the hope that some day it would be occupied by one of his children, had he not a perfect right to do so if he bought it in the open market?  Who will deny that right to him?  I know people myself who have holdings, and because of this section they are certainly very anxious about them.  They have reason to be.  Land Commission officers, or somebody connected with that Department, have been visiting farms&mdash;not estates and not holdings of 1,000 acres or 500 acres. It will all depend, I suppose, on the strength of a Fianna Fáil club in a particular district whether a particular locality is to become a congested district or not.  I do not intend to delay the House further by dealing with other matters that have already been fully debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody listening to the speeches made by Deputies on the Government Benches would come to the conclusion that they have a great anxiety with regard to the division of land.  So far as my own constituency is concerned, I desire to refer to a few facts in connection with the division of land.  Prior to the Fianna Fáil Government coming into office, the Land Commission acquired two estates there: one, the Saunders-Knox-Gore estate, and the other, Captain Jones's estate.  As a matter of fact, the officials in the Land Commission were engaged on the division of the Saunders-Knox-Gore estate when a communication was sent to Dublin and a message came back from the Land Commission stopping the officials in their work.  I am speaking with first-hand knowledge of what occurred.  An explanation of that was subsequently made by the present Minister for Justice.  He was then Minister for Lands and Fisheries. His explanation of the division of the estate not being proceeded with was that the land was not going into the right hands.  The Minister's speech dealing with that was reported in the <Col N="960" /><i>Western People</i> in April, 1932.  That is a fact and there is no going behind it.  These facts and particulars are in the hands of the Land Commission officials, and there can be no denial of them.  The Captain Jones estate was acquired in or about the same time.  It is practically derelict to-day, while the Saunders-Knox-Gore estate is absolutely derelict.  This latter estate is in the possession of the Land Commission.  It is not being divided up, but the land is being grazed by anybody who desires to do so.  I wonder what return the Land Commission is getting for the money that was paid for that estate.  If that is the class of administration that we are to get, it surely is not surprising that there should be, as there is, a terrible anxiety throughout the country so far as the acquisition of land is concerned. I admit there is land in the country that requires to be acquired, and that should be acquired.  I think myself some of it should have been acquired long since.  If the present Government were faithful to the promises they made when they were seeking power and making a bid for the votes of the people to place them in power, then surely we should not have the class of administration of which I have given the House an example.  I mention these matters for the purpose of bringing home to the minds of everybody what is going on to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy referred to the question of land tenure.  It has to be said to his credit that, when speaking on that question, he was very candid. The Deputy said that there should be land tenure, but that it should not be absolute.  He did not, however, define for the House the difference between what is land tenure and what is absolute land tenure.  In saying that, Deputy Kennedy also said that, while land tenure is quite all right in its own way and that people should have an interest in their land, the State had rights.  I think the phrase used by the Deputy &ldquo;that the State had rights&rdquo; let the cat out of the bag, and that land is now going to become a State concern&mdash;State property.  These were the sentiments expressed from the side opposite.  These are the principles <Col N="961" /> that we hear propounded by Deputy Kennedy and other Deputies on the Government Benches.  I wonder do those sentiments convey any meaning, do they indicate anything with regard to the future policy of the Government? This section that we are discussing strikes at the very root of land tenure.  The greatest and the ablest men that this country ever produced devoted practically their entire lives, and were successful in their efforts, to establish the right and title of the farmers of this country deep in the soil.</P>
    <P>That whole system is being struck at to-day.  It is being slashed at now, and the farmer is going to be deprived of his rights.  He is going to be robbed of his rights, and his ruin will be practically accomplished.  People talk about land tenure and ask what was the value of it.  It is invaluable, priceless, because the right of a man to his property represents something that he feels no one can deprive him of.  No one can claim that the people had an opportunity of knowing that anything like this would be attempted by the Government, when they were seeking office.  Was it ever stated from any public platform that if the Government were given their vote the people would be deprived of their land?  We have certain explanations from professional men, legal and otherwise.  I do not blame them for giving these explanations.  That is their job; to try to put the best complexion they can on these questions.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the position of a farmer, if the Bill is passed.  What security has he from his land?  A Deputy opposite stated recently that a bank manager to whom he was speaking stated that he was prepared to advance any money on land.  I was speaking to a bank manager yesterday, and I asked him: &ldquo;What advance are you prepared to make on the security of land if this Bill is passed?&rdquo; The reply was: &ldquo;I would not advance a penny.  Do you not think that I would be very foolish if I did?&rdquo;  I told him that I was very glad to get that opinion, as it agreed with my own view.  I am sorry at the same time that <Col N="962" /> this situation has been created.  It means that when a man sees his title broken, he will have no ambition.  Is it not the ambition of any man, when he has acquired property, which is properly safeguarded, to defend it against anyone?  If he was a man worthy of the name he would work that property and make it more valuable, because he was creating an asset to hand on to those who succeeded him. What asset in land will a man have now?  None whatever.  That asset has been smashed.  By the Act of 1870, he secured compensation for disturbance, and by the Act of 1881, fair rent, fixity of tenure and the right of free sale.  That is being smashed now. Some of the best Irishmen that this country can boast of&mdash;Butt, Biggar, Parnell, Healy, Davitt, Dillon and O'Brien&mdash;gave the best years of their lives to place the Irish farmer in the position he now occupies.  All that is now going by the board.  I wonder what these men would have felt if they had foreseen the present position.</P>
    <P>I do not desire to refer particularly to a statement made by Deputy Cleary, that if the farmers were any good they should be able to make their land pay. The week before last I remember that the Deputy stated that the farmers could never make the land pay.  My answer on that occasion was that if they did not make it pay prior to the economic war they could not make it pay now, or even eke out an existence, as a result of the position that had been created.  I do not want to say anything that might be irrelevant when I refer to the present situation.  I pointed out how the administration of the Land Commission had been carried on in North Mayo since Fianna Fáil came into office.  If it is carried out in a similar manner in other parts of the country it must do great harm.  I do not desire anything I say to be a reflection on the manner in which the Land Commission officials acquit themselves. I know that their work is carried on under great obstacles.  When the Land Commission officials went to a certain estate for the purpose of dividing it, I know that a message was sent to Ballina that they were not to do so. That was in April, 1932, since when <Col N="963" /> that estate has been derelict.  That estate should be in the possession of the Land Commission and proper accounts concerning it should be rendered. If everything else in the Land Commission is administered in the same manner, it must be a very unprofitable Department.  I repeat that the Land Commission officials are not to blame.</P>

      <P>Can the Attorney-General say anything about the point I put to the Minister this afternoon, that he should make a concession in the sense of amendment 115, to safeguard the position, to see that other suitable land in the locality was taken before the land of the owner was taken, and if he could make a concession in relation to amendment 119? That amendment seeks to provide for the case where a man has acquired a farm upon which he intends to settle his children.</P>

      <P>With regard to what Deputy Roddy said, I think we did promise to look into the question, and I will undertake to have it looked into.  As regards what Deputy MacDermot asked, I do not think the Minister could accept amendment 115.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Attorney-General will appreciate that it is very unjust to acquire registered land from a person so long as there is suitable untenanted land in the district&mdash;land equally suitable for the relief of congestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that that is one of the things that gives rise to most of the practical difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate the difficulties of the situation.  At the same time, it would appear to me to be obviously unfair that the Land Commission should proceed to acquire land in a certain district when alongside that land there is untenanted land equally suitable for the relief of congestion and which really should be first acquired.  It has always been recognised in the Land Commission, and <Col N="965" /> even under this Bill it is recognised, that registered land has a certain claim for special consideration.  Untenanted land is dealt with differently under the 1923 Act.  So long as there is untenanted land alongside or adjacent to registered land, then in all justice the Land Commission should first acquire the untenanted land, and then the other land subsequently, if it is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be the practice so far as possible, but the Deputy knows perfectly well that this type of clause has given rise to enormous difficulties heretofore.  A clause similar to that which the Deputy wants to insert here was inserted in Section 24 of the 1923 Act.  The result was that where land was needed for division the owner invariably said that there was other land in the district available, and that held up the work of the Land Commission.  The Land Commission will not acquire land where there is more suitable land in the district. There is, of course, the other point of view.  The Deputy knows that if you give holdings to people some distance away from their place of residence you make it impossible for them to work that land in an ordinary fashion. Instead of the land being portion of the holding it is situated quite a distance away, and they are half the day carting stuff along the road from one holding to another, instead of devoting that time to working on the land.  I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister propose to advert to the principle of amendment 119 suggested by Deputy MacDermot?  Surely it is manifest that where a man wants to make provision for his children, wants to settle them on the land, he ought not to be impeded or restricted.  That seems to me to be a very desirable purpose, and if the Land Commission can take land from that man and give it to someone else's children, that seems to me to be anything but a rational arrangement. With reference to Deputy Roddy's point, I think that throws added light on the danger this section carries with it.  The people are going to be made pawns of and are going to be shoved <Col N="966" /> about here, there and everywhere without any regard to the attachment of an individual for his own home.  It is not right that the Land Commission should shift a man out of his home in order to make the pattern look nice.  They are going to disregard a man's attachment to his home although equally suitable land might be within a mile from the place.  They are going to put a man out of his father's home simply because it fits into their plan.</P>
      <P>How any Irish Parliament could recognise a principle of that sort absolutely baffles me.  How anyone professing to be a nationalist or professing the traditions of nationalism could stand over that sort of principle absolutely baffles me.  The whole thing throws a floodlight on the purpose of the Minister and the Land Commission. It means that they have no regard for and no understanding of what a man's homestead means to him in this country.  The Attorney-General ought to know.  He was born and reared in a part of the country where that kind of thing obtains.  The Minister for Defence comes from a part of the country where, perhaps, our outlook on the land question is not so rife.  Other Ministers were born and bred in Dublin, and they do not understand the land question at all.  The Attorney-General ought to understand it because he was born in the country. The idea of going to a man and telling him you are going to take his holding, although a mile away there is untenanted land which could easily be used for the relief of congestion&mdash;the idea that you are going to put him out and transport him to another part of the country is monstrous.</P>

I have not <Col N="967" /> the slightest doubt the Attorney-General speaks in good faith and he hopes he will be able to implement that undertaking, but I say he will not be able because when his own supporters get under way he will be forced to do things which he knows in his heart are wrong.  Those amendments ought to be accepted.  The amendment I have down ought to be accepted and the amendment that provides for the case of a man desirous of making provision for his children by putting them on his land ought to be accepted.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept them, then it is clear what the purpose of the Bill is.  They may have high hopes now, but when this measure comes into operation they will be driven down along the path which is going to land this country God knows where.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will be prepared to make a statement later with regard to the elimination of the term &ldquo;equally suitable.&rdquo;  I would like also to know if there will be any advertence to the question of the provision of alternative holdings.  There may be a case in which a man getting a holding of the same value as the one he has to leave may have to expend £1,000 in order to put it into a condition so that he may carry on the same class of farming as that to which he was accustomed.  I would like to hear from the Minister in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The words &ldquo;equally suitable&rdquo; in the 1923 Act rendered the section inoperative.  Even though the Land Commission wanted the land very badly for the relief of congestion, they could not take vested land simply because no one would be satisfied that the land they were getting was &ldquo;equally suitable.&rdquo;  It was only in very few cases that the owner would be satisfied that the alternative holdings were &ldquo;equally suitable.&rdquo;  Usually unless the owner got a holding that was two or three times the value of his original holding he was not satisfied. In cases where the Land Commission was compelled to give the owner an alternative holding that holding was worth several times as much as the holding he was giving up.  For that <Col N="968" /> reason, we are not going to stultify ourselves by accepting the amendment. I do not want, at this stage, to go into the objections raised to this particular amendment.  We will have another day to discuss it.  It has been already discussed at considerable length.</P>
      <P>The next amendment 115, in the names of Deputies Roddy and Lynch, mentions &ldquo;other unacquired land in the locality suitable for the relief of congestion.&rdquo; Well if these words &ldquo;other unacquired land in the locality&rdquo; go in, though there are 10 or 20 congests around the ranch that is not being worked and on which the owner never put his foot for years, the position will be that that land is to remain in his possession and the congests there are to remain congests.  If there are other lands five or six miles away which can be given to these congests that land would not be suitable for them.</P>

    <P>(1)  Where a provisional list of untenanted lands or a notice under this Part of this Act of intention to declare that lands are required for relief of congestion has been published and no objection thereto has been lodged or if lodged has been finally disposed of, the Land Commission may, if they consider it expedient so to do for the purpose of the immediate distribution of such lands by order declare the appointed day for such lands notwithstanding that the price has not been agreed upon or fixed, and by the same order declare the price (in this section called the provisional price) at which it is proposed to purchase such lands.</P>
    <P>(2)  In default of agreement, the price of lands in respect of which the appointed day has been declared under the foregoing sub-section of this section shall be fixed in accordance with the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts in that behalf.</P>
    <P>(3)  If the price of lands in respect of which the appointed day has been declared under this section exceeds the provisional price, the Land Commission shall make an additional advance and issue additional land bonds for the purchase of such lands and there shall be payable by the Land Commission to the person <Col N="973" /> entitled to the receipt of the rents and profits of such land before the purchase thereof a sum equal to interest (less income tax) on the additional land bonds so issued from the appointed day to the date of the issue of such additional land bonds.</P>
    <P>(4)  If the price of lands in respect of which the appointed day has been declared under this section is less than the provisional price, the Land Commission shall pay into the Land Bond Fund such sum as will be sufficient to redeem the land bonds issued in excess of the price of such lands and shall be entitled to recover the amount so paid into the Land Bond Fund, together with the interest paid on the bonds so redeemed from the appointed day to the date on which such bonds are redeemed, out of the purchase money of such lands so far as it shall not have been distributed on allocation or from such person as shall have received such purchase money or any part thereof and shall be found liable to make such repayments.</P>
    <P>(5)  The provisions of the Land Act, 1931, in relation to guarantee deposits, as amended by this Act, shall apply in the case of untenanted lands for which a provisional price has been declared under this section, with the modification that the deposit shall be 25 per cent. of the provisional price.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 127:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 29 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who or whose predecessor, at the passing of the Land Act, 1881, was the tenant of a holding to which the Land Acts apply, and who (or whose predecessor) was evicted from the said holding, since the said date, in consequence of proceedings taken by or on behalf of his landlord and who or whose personal representative has not under any previous Land Acts been either reinstated in his original holding or been given a substituted holding, shall be entitled on making application in a form to be prescribed <Col N="974" /> under this Act, to be restored to his original holding or to be given a substituted holding (as the case may be).</P>
    <P>I am surprised that this Bill does not make any mandatory provision for the reinstatement of evicted tenants, or the representatives of tenants evicted from their holdings since the passing of the Land Act, 1881.  The British House of Commons in the year 1907 passed an Evicted Tenants Bill making it obligatory on the Government of the day to reinstate all the evicted tenants in their former holdings. That Bill was held up by the House of Lords and did not become law.  I understand that the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis passed a resolution something on the lines of the amendment which I now ask the House to accept, and, in view of that, I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.  During the discussion of the Land Bill of 1927, ex-Deputy James Cosgrove moved an amendment providing for the reinstatement of all evicted tenants in their original holdings.  During the debate on that amendment I endeavoured to point out that it would be absolutely impossible to give effect to it in the form in which it was moved.  I have been reading some of the debates in the British House of Commons.  In support of my argument I understand that in dealing with the 8,000 claims made previous to 1907, the Commissioners in their report at the time stated that &ldquo;in 1,259 out of the 1,609 cases in which the applicants were considered suitable to be provided with holdings their former holdings are in the possession of other tenants.&rdquo;  That, of course, made it quite clear even at that time that it would be impracticable to have the evicted tenants restored to their former holdings.</P>
    <P>That is the reason why I am suggesting, in this amendment, that they be restored to their original holdings, or that they be given substitute holdings as the case may be.  When ex-Deputy James Cosgrove's amendment was under discussion in the Dáil, in 1927.  Deputy Hogan, who was then Minister for Agriculture, said that if <Col N="975" /> the amendment were accepted there would be about 100,000 applications coming in from evicted tenants or their representatives.  From information supplied by the Commissioners, who had invited applications previous to the year 1907, and who were the best judges as to what the exact number of such claimants was likely to be, Mr. Birrell, who was then Chief Secretary for Ireland, speaking in the House of Commons on the Evicted Tenants Bill of 1907, said that the maximum number of applications under this head would not exceed 8,000.  He said, at the same time, there were some of the people who claimed to be representatives of the evicted tenants who, in his opinion, had as much right to describe themselves as descendants of evicted tenants as they had to call themselves astronomers.  He boiled it all down to this, that in his view the number of genuine claims submitted would not exceed 2,000.  Looking at the figures quoted from time to time in this House and elsewhere, I understand there were 3,359 tenants restored to their former holdings, or had suitable alternative holdings provided for them, up to the 31st March, 1914.  I have not at my disposal the same information as the Minister and I hope he will give the House the number of tenants restored to their holdings or provided with suitable alternative holdings under the Act of 1923.</P>
    <P>I asked on the Second Reading debate of this Bill that we should get reliable information on the aspect of the claims of those tenants, and I hope that the Minister now will be able to furnish the House with the information when he comes to reply on that matter.  Mr. Birrell, dealing with the claims of the evicted tenants in the debate to which I have referred, said that in his opinion&mdash;and apparently that opinion was shared by the late Mr. John Redmond, the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, and by the then Mr. James Campbell, who was afterwards Lord Glenavy, and Chairman of the Senate&mdash;80,000 acres of land would make reasonable provision for the claims of the genuine evicted <Col N="976" /> tenants.  I quote these figures because they were made available by the Land Commission of that particular period, which apparently investigated the applications that were submitted to them previous to the discussion of the Evicted Tenants Bill of 1907.  I am informed by ex-Deputy James Cosgrove, who is in touch with the organisation, so far as there is any organisation available, to promote the claims of the evicted tenants, that the number of cases awaiting settlement at the moment could not possibly exceed 500. I know Deputy Dillon will oppose this amendment simply because it is moved by a member of the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation, may I say that whatever the prescience of Deputy Davin may be, he has not yet developed the faculty of thought-reading and he, therefore, cannot know anything about what I may be going to say.</P>

      <P>I said that one of the reasons that would justify Deputy Dillon in his opposition to this amendment was that it was moved by a member of the Labour Party.  However, everybody recognises the fact that it was the agitation surrounding the original eviction of these tenants, and their claims for restoration, which led to the passage of the various Land Acts in this country.  I think everybody associated with the land agitation and the passage of the various Land Acts holds that genuine evicted tenants should be reinstated in their holdings, or provided with suitable alternative holdings, if it is not possible to give them back their own original holdings. If the British Parliament in 1907 considered it feasible, for any good reason at that time, to introduce and pass a Bill for the reinstatement of those people, I think the present Government whose Party conference, already published, unanimously declared support of the same policy, should make provision in the Land Bill for the reinstatement of those people or their relatives. I hope, without saying anything further upon the matter, that the Minister will see his way to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Perhaps, before the Minister replies, Deputy Davin will <Col N="977" /> explain why it is he left out the evicted tenants of '79 and '80.  I am in entire agreement with the Deputy in his attitude towards the evicted tenants.  I agree that provision of a very specific character should be introduced into this Bill for the reinstatement of evicted tenants.  But I cannot see why the men subsequent to '81 should be excluded from such benefits.  The very best of the evicted tenants were the men in the years '79 and '80.  These are the men who were evicted having very little hope of ever getting back.  Something has been knocked out of Governments since the movement was started. The men evicted subsequent to 1881 knew that there was a great movement in being, and hoped that justice would be done to them in the long run, but the men who went out in '79 and '80 were the shock troops of the land movement.  They did not know whether it was possible to break the power of landlordism but they went out all the same.  The numbers evicted in 1881 may be small.  The numbers evicted in '79 and '80 are still smaller but their claims are far stronger and seem even more meritorious than those men for whom Deputy Davin speaks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I have no doubt, will answer that there are very great administrative difficulties.  I have no doubt there are.  But I know that the prime objective of the leaders of the Land League movement was to put back into their holdings the men who were evicted in the land war.  I remember, prior to the election of 1918, I attended the reinstatement of the last evicted tenant in East Mayo to his holding in the month of November of that year.  I know it was the ardent desire of every land leaguer in Ireland to put back the evicted tenants into their holdings or into suitable holdings.  It was hoped that the 1923 Act and subsequent Land Acts of an Irish Government would complete that work.  This Land Bill, to my mind, has very few redeeming features, but if an amendment, in the sense of Deputy Davin's amendment, were inserted in the Bill, it would do something to redeem it from the deplorable character it has assumed.  I cannot allow this occasion to pass without drawing Deputy <Col N="978" /> Davin's attention to the apparent inconsistency of the position he has taken up.  We have just passed a section of this Bill for the purpose of making new evicted tenants.  We have just passed a section which puts it in the power of the Land Commission to put tenants out.  Now Deputy Davin, very rightly I think, wants to insert a section to compel the Land Commission to put back the old evicted tenants.  I hope when the time comes for reinstating tenants who were evicted by the Land Commission under the Act of 1933 Deputy Davin will co-operate with me.  That time will probably come.</P>

So far as I am concerned I strongly urge on the Minister to accept this amendment, with one qualification,&mdash;instead of the words &ldquo;at the passing of the Land Act, 1881&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;on the 1st day of January, 1879&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, they have power to go back three years beyond the date which Deputy Davin mentioned,&mdash;1881.  They have power to go back to 1878.  I should like to get fully from both Deputy Dillon and Deputy Davin their point of view on this matter.  I do not think any Party in the House has a monopoly of sympathy with the evicted tenants. We are on common ground in that respect.  We all know what the country owes to the men who fought the land war.  We all want to see them properly dealt with, and we want to see their personal representatives dealt with. <Col N="979" /> There is one thing we want to be clear on, and that is that under the previous Acts the Land Commission were compelled to take into consideration whether or not the personal representative of an evicted tenant was a fit and proper person, and was competent to work the land.  The Land Commission, in their administration of the previous Acts, although they were directed by law to have regard to a man's competency, put a rather liberal interpretation on their legal instructions.  In some districts they put in personal representatives who did not &ldquo;hang on&rdquo; to the land.  Down in Kildare, I understand, there were 12 representatives of evicted tenants put in, and within a few months five of them sold out. There are some personal representatives of evicted tenants who have no great need for land.  Sometimes the personal representative is very remote from the original evicted tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are cases on the files of the Land Commission where a woman has claimed to be the personal representative of an evicted tenant simply because her husband was the grandson of the man who was evicted.  The woman is a shopkeeper; she has a fairly good business.  Are we to put that woman on the land to the exclusion of a small uneconomic holder, or a landless man who has no other means of livelihood, and who knows how to work the land?  Are we to deal with correspondence we have from Australia, from men who are personal representatives of evicted tenants, who know nothing about the land and have been all their lives in cities, by asking them to come back simply because they are the grand-children of tenants evicted in 1881 or 1878?  As the law stands, the Land Commission has to inquire whether a person is competent to work the land or not.  If Deputies agree that that is a good and proper direction to the Land Commission then the law does not require to be amended.  In this Bill, however, we are amending the law in one respect, and that is to enable the Land Commission to more easily acquire land for genuine evicted tenants, and the personal <Col N="980" /> representatives of evicted tenants, who are competent to work the land.</P>
    <P>On the 15th June of this year the situation relating to evicted tenants was as follows:&mdash;There were 13,693 applications lodged.  The number who were refused as being unsuitable, after inquiry, was 4,852.  The number reinstated by the landlord or provided with land by the Land Commission was 3,461.  That left a residue of 5,308.  Some of those cases were lodged years ago, but the Land Commission have at the moment 240 cases noted for further consideration when land comes in.  Up to the present, they have no power to acquire land specifically for the placing of evicted tenants or their personal representatives on the land.  Under Section 31 of this Bill we are taking power to acquire land for evicted tenants.  What I want to hear from Deputy Davin and Deputy Dillon is whether Deputy Davin's amendment is to go through as it stands, that is that the personal representative of an evicted tenant shall be entitled, upon the filling of a form, to get the original holding or a substitute holding, no matter whether or not he is competent to work the land, whether or not he is a man who is well-off in other ways, or whether or not he is living in the country.  I want to hear both Deputy Dillon and Deputy Davin on that point.  Heretofore, we had power to place evicted tenants on the land, and in this Bill we are taking power to more conveniently get land for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy Davin is considering what the Minister has said I want to state that there is no doubt whatever in my mind.  When those men were being put out on the road Michael Davitt and the men with him went down, stood beside them, and said: &ldquo;Go out in every confidence. We will put you back.  They may evict you, they may kick you out, they may persecute you, they may do anything they like, but sooner or later we will put you back.&rdquo;  That promise ought to be redeemed.  That is the issue.  The Minister says&mdash;and mind <Col N="981" /> you, I have every sympathy with him in the administrative difficulties involved&mdash;that a lot of those people are unsuitable.  Whose fault is that? Was not that the very object of the landlord who put them out?  They drove them out on the roadside.  The people had to live.  They had to go and get work here and there as best they could, to keep body and soul together.  Many of them drifted to the cities.  Many of them drifted to the workhouse.  Michael Davitt drifted to the workhouse.  If he did not drift into the workhouse there might have been no Land League and no land war.  I suppose if Michael Davitt were an applicant for reinstatement to-day he would be told he was not suitable because he was an industrial worker in a North of England city.</P>
      <P>On the qualifications laid down by the Land Commission Michael Davitt was not eligible for reinstatement as an evicted tenant.  Does the House stand over that?  I make no bones about it.  These men risked their all. Their wives risked their all.  Their wives went out into the streets with their children.  They went into the workhouses with their children, rather than give in, and they did that on the express promise that we would put them back.  Now is your opportunity. It is a question of whether this House is going to honour this promise or not.  In my opinion no administrative difficulty should be allowed to stand in the way.  Every single genuine successor of an evicted tenant should have the promise from the Land Commission: &ldquo;If you want a holding such as your parents were put out of, we will give it to you. We will redeem the promises made to you.  We will put you back.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have this to say, and I am sure that Deputy Donnelly will not challenge the accuracy of my statement, that during the discussions on the 1923 Bill and during the discussions on the 1927 Bill, I spoke in the same strain.  I hope, now that we have in office and in power a Party which definitely pledged itself to a certain course of action through its delegates from the Fianna Fáil branches at the last Ard-Fheis, they will implement the policy which was unanimously approved of at the last meeting of the Ard-Fheis.  I candidly confess that the Minister can pick out exceptional cases to justify opposition to the acceptance of an amendment of this kind.  It is quite true, that some of the <Col N="983" /> tenants evicted, and certainly some of their representatives, are to-day endeavouring to eke out an existence in Australia, America and in other foreign countries.  Is there anybody in this House who would not say that an opportunity should be created, by the acceptance of such an amendment, to bring back from Australia or America or these other countries the tenants or their representatives who were forced to leave this country as a result of eviction?</P>
      <P>The Government are paying pensions to several sets of officials who served in the Army and in the Civil Service. These pensions are being paid regardless of the other means of income of these people or whether they hold other positions or not.  I know persons who are receiving at the same time salaries and pensions from the State at the expense of the taxpayers. I think that should dispose of the argument that there are some people well off, and that simply because they are well off&mdash;possibly in a few cases they would be unfit for immediate work on the land&mdash;they should not get land.  Remember these people or their predecessors were evicted from the holdings and these holdings were taken over by grabbers.  They are entitled to be reinstated in their original holdings or provided with alternative holdings or if you like, given compensation for the land taken from them, in circumstances well known to Deputies, in the days of the land agitation.  I want to advise Deputy Donnelly on this.  The Minister has stated that the Land Commission can, under their present powers, make provision for the reinstatement of evicted tenants or their representatives in their former holdings.  I would like to remind Deputy Donnelly that the word used is that the Land Commission &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  My amendment compels them to do so.  That is the difference between the present powers of the Minister and the amendment moved by me.</P>

      <P>Provided the Minister is prepared to regard this as an obligation I am not going to quibble over words, as to whether the date should be after the 1st of January, 1879 or the passing of the Act of 1881.  I am not an expert by any means regarding the method by which the Bill will be administered, but it should be possible to have all the land which the Minister hopes to acquire, acquired and divided within a period of three years.  I am making that statement without any official advice&mdash;and I would like to hear the Minister on this&mdash;or without any access to those who hope to help the Minister with the Bill.  I am prepared to admit that there may be exceptional cases as stated by the Minister, but I think that the House ought to make a real beginning, after all the discussions that have gone on in the British House of Commons and in the Dáil on the 1923 Act, on the 1927 Act and on this Bill, and that finally we ought to come to the time when the majority of the House ought to do the right thing for those who have been deprived of their holdings without any compensation.  You can have it any way you like.  You can reinstate these people&mdash;personally, I believe that will be impossible in many cases&mdash;or you can provide them with alternative holdings and if, that is impossible, you can make provision by way of compensation for these people who are deprived of their holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask Deputy Dillon whether he has any figures which he can give to the House to show the number of additional people he would cover by the suggested amendment in regard to the date.  In other words, what was the number of people who were evicted between the 1st of January 1879 and the date of the passing of the Act of 1881?  The Minister stated that only 153 tenants or representatives of tenants were reinstated in their former holdings or provided with alternative holdings since the passing of the 1923 Act.  I venture to suggest that the majority of the people who will be administering this Bill will be the very same people who administered that Act.  They will <Col N="985" /> have the same outlook and the same mentality unless this House inserts an amendment of this kind and compels them to take these cases into consideration. The Minister may not be in his seat or his Party may not be in power 12 months from to-day. There is nobody who can get up and prophesy what will be the life of this Parliament or how long the Minister and his colleagues will remain in office but when the Government goes out of office it should have the satisfaction at any rate of being able to say to the people that they honoured the obligations placed upon them by their own Ard Fheis at its last meeting.  There are 5,308 cases still outstanding.  I listened very attentively to the Minister's remarks when the Minister assured the House that 240 out of 5,308 cases still outstanding, were noted for consideration.  He said that the Land Commission, of which he is the acting head to-day, had noted for consideration only 240 cases out of a total number of 5,308.  Would his own colleagues, sitting behind him, accept that as satisfactory, or do they regard that as the outlook of the Minister himself on the number of people who should be considered?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this amendment is allowed to be withdrawn, I want to know whether or not the Minister is prepared to accept the principle that it should be made mandatory on the Land Commission to offer reinstatement on the original holdings, or on equally suitable holdings, to tenants evicted, whether subsequent to May, 1878, or to the passing of the Land Act of 1881.  I prefer the former and Deputy Davin prefers the other.  Does the Minister accept that principle, and is he prepared to introduce, on the Report Stage, an amendment, the object of which will be to offer reinstatement on the original holding or an equally suitable holding to every tenant evicted under the land war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I can accept that unreservedly, but the Deputy said &ldquo;evicted tenants.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I want to examine the amendment and its effect more closely than I have been able to. It must be remembered that there are 167 amendments and I have not had time to examine their full effect.  I suggest that Deputy Davin can put down the amendment on the Report Stage and move it then if I have not tabled an amendment that will meet the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, if the Minister is prepared to accept the principle, that will meet the matter.  With all due respect, I submit that the Minister has had as much time, and much greater assistance to enable him to do so, to examine these amendments than private Deputies have had.  I submit that a very important principle is raised by this amendment.  If the Minister is prepared to accept the principle I have no desire to intervene between himself and Deputy Davin.  If <Col N="988" /> he is not prepared to accept the principle that evicted tenants or their personal representatives must be offered reinstatement on their own holdings or on suitable alternative holdings, then I ask the House to divide on this amendment.</P>

      <P>I was not attempting to misrepresent it.  It is quite easy to make mistakes.  The Deputy himself can make mistakes and if he would bear that in mind he might not be so intolerant of the mistakes of others. However, I should like to know, in connection with this amendment, what the Minister proposes to do with regard to the number of farms in the hands of the Land Commission at present. There is quite a big number of farms all over the country in the hands of the Land Commission where the tenants have been evicted on account of nonpayment of their annuities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it is very much the same question.  Now that the arrears are to be forgiven and that <Col N="989" /> these tenants can be restored to their holdings without having to pay the debt that was formerly required to be paid before they got repossession of their holdings, it is natural that they will be wanting to know whether they will be entitled to resume possession now.  The Minister has not said anything about that so far and I should like to know what his intention is in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore is, possibly, the only Deputy in the House who wants a definition of what is meant by an evicted tenant.  All of us, who have lived here during our lives, know what is meant by an evicted tenant, and we include in that term the people who represent them now.  I think that, if there is any section in this Bill, and if there is any principle put forward in any amendment for which the Minister should not require any time for consideration, it is this principle here.  The principle put forward in Deputy Davin's amendment is one that every person in this House understands.  I would press the House to ask for a decision now on the question of the principle raised by Deputy Davin.  Is the Minister prepared to accept the principle raised in Deputy Davin's amendment, apart from the question of details which can be considered later on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I submit that what an evicted tenant is is not at all so clear as Deputy Rice and Deputy Davin have tried to make out.  &ldquo;In consequence of proceedings taken by or on behalf of his landlord.&rdquo;  Now, up to 1931 the State was acting for the landlord in regard to rent so that it would include people evicted as late as 1927 and 1928.  Deputy Rice, with all his legal knowledge, could not see that. He thinks I am very stupid indeed not to be able to understand what an evicted tenant is.  Evidently it is the other way about.  Deputy Rice does not understand what is meant by this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore has made a graceful attempt to try and cut across this discussion so that a decision on this might be postponed.  I assume <Col N="990" /> that is the reason for Deputy Moore's assumed ignorance of what is meant by an evicted tenant.</P>

      <P>I think that anybody who wants to face this problem honestly must admit that there are certain people who have a very tenuous claim to be called the representatives of evicted tenants.  We want to see them dealt with.  There is a necessity for exceptions and, certainly, as it stands, Deputy Dillon would not accept the amendment.

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 128:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 29 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any person who is at the passing of this Act in occupation of a cottage and/or an allotment provided under the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, 1883 to 1919, shall be provided, after application in a form to be prescribed under this Act, by the Land Commission with an additional parcel of land of not less than five acres in extent whenever land is being divided in any area or district.</P>
      <P>I think it is only right that, where it is possible, additional land should be allotted to the tenants of labourers' cottages.  During the last couple of years no class in the community has suffered as much as the workers in the rural areas.  Every increase of rates on the bigger farmers and every tariff meant a reduction of wages for the agricultural worker.  In many cases, where there are large estates convenient to labourers' cottages, the tenants of the cottages are unable to get even a pint of milk from the owners of the estate.  Even the men employed on the estate have to pay 6d. a quart for milk.  After the last election the owner of an estate in the constituency which Deputy Moore and I come from reduced the working week of the tenants employed on his estate and he told them that that was the result of voting for the Labour and the Fianna Fáil candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tenants of labourers' cottages have only half an acre of very bad land.  In the old days when cottages were being built the worst portions of land were allotted to the labourers. If their holdings could be extended in the way I suggest then, when there would be very little work available outside, those tenants would have an opportunity of providing food for their families.  They would be in a position to feed cattle and carry out a considerable amount of tillage.  I am sure this amendment will meet with the approval of all sections in the House.  The amendment merely seeks to grant tenants of labourers' cottages additional parcels of land <Col N="999" /> whenever land is being divided in any district.  Those men are familiar with agricultural work and this will enable them to pay their rents and educate their children.  If there are any further dismissals from employment in agricultural areas, those men can be occupied tilling their own land.  I trust the Minister will give this amendment sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware, of course, that at the present time there are 42,000 occupiers of labourers' cottages throughout the country.  He cannot be unaware that a large number of the occupants of these cottages are not agricultural labourers. There has been a controversy raging up and down the country at the different county councils as to whether or not a man who was not a genuine agricultural labourer should be left in a cottage.  Statements have been made at the different county councils that cottages are occupied by school teachers, hackney car owners, engineers, and different other types of the professional and artisan classes. The practice of the Land Commission has been that wherever and whenever an estate has been divided and where the occupants of labourers' cottages on the estate or tenants on the estate are competent to work the land such people get perhaps a few acres and sometimes an economic holding.</P>
      <P>There were three estates divided within the last year or so and in one of them in County Meath the total number of allotments was 20.  Of these, seven went to occupants of labourers' cottages.  They got between them an area of 98 acres at a price of £1,079.  In another case in Tipperary the total number of allotments was 22.  Of these, three were occupants of labourers' cottages, and these got between them 43 acres and 3 perches of land, costing £666.  In another case in Tipperary there were 24 allotments made on the estate; two of these were occupants of labourers' cottages and they got between them 59 acres at a price of £768.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have every sympathy with the man who wants to provide economic holdings <Col N="1000" /> for the occupants of labourers' cottages, when these are people who can work an economic holding.  I am in favour of giving allotments where the occupant of a labourer's cottage is a man who can work the land, and work an additional couple of acres, put a cow on it to get milk for his children, keep some hens and have eggs for his family.  I think such a man should get the land.  But I do not believe that every occupant of a labourer's cottage should get land.  I am thoroughly convinced he should not. I know two labourers, occupants of cottages.  One of them is a man who works every inch of his half-acre. The other has not even grazed his plot with a goat for the last 20 years.  He has done nothing with the land and now, under this amendment we would be compelled to give a man of that class who has wasted his own half-acre another five acres.  I certainly would not stand for it.</P>
    <P>If a man has shown that he is capable of working the land, that he desires land, and that he would make good use of it, I would be prepared to give him an extra couple of acres or even to give him, if possible, an economic holding.  But I am not prepared to give an extra holding to a man who has not proved that he can work the land he already has.  I have given the House the figures in three typical estates, to show that the practice of the Land Commission has been to give land to the people living in labourers' cottages whenever these labourers have shown that they are competent to work the land.  But to make that a general rule compelling the Land Commission to give land to every occupant of labourers' cottages, whether that occupant is a school teacher, plumber, or agricultural labourer, is a principle for which I am not going to stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDaly" hpid="Mr. Patrick Daly Mr. Patrick Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words in support of this amendment. I think the Minister should accept it. Five acres would enable a labourer to keep one cow.  There are unfortunate labourers living in labourers' cottages who are paying 3/- or 4/- a week for milk.  If these had five additional <Col N="1001" /> acres of land they would be able to keep a cow and calf.  In my own constituency there are, at present, estates held by the Government which they could break up and in that way give five acres to each labourer living in the district around that estate.  In my constituency there are over 5,000 labourers' cottages and each and every one of these labourers are capable of working the land.  They are all agricultural labourers.  For this reason I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that the Minister can take up exceptional cases, either in his own county or in any county in the State, where the tenants of labourers' cottages possibly are not all working the small holdings attached to their cottages, but I think it is quite true also to say that the boards of health have power to deal with individuals of that kind.  This amendment is put forward because it has been our experience, and it certainly is my experience in my constituency of Leix and Offaly that in no case has any cottage tenant got any addition to his small holding, out of any estates divided in that constituency.  I certainly made strong representations and protests to the Land Commission in several cases where they declined to deal with such applications in the past and where cottage tenants were living adjacent to the estates.  I presume the estates that the Minister quoted have been divided since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office and to that extent it is certainly an advance on the previous position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission officials in making inquiry as to the suitability of applicants for land under the 1923 Act scarcely ever took into consideration the names of the applicants who resided in labourers' cottages.  There is one Deputy sitting on the Opposition Benches who is aware that I made protest to him against the action of a Land Commission official on two occasions.  That official told the applicants that no <Col N="1002" /> applicant residing in a labourers' cottage would be considered for an addition to his holding.  I am surprised to hear that there is even one case where a school teacher is residing in a labourer's cottage.  That, certainly is not any great credit to the board of health concerned, because certainly there are more suitable and deserving local applicants for that cottage, people who would be more entitled to it than a school teacher.  It would be interesting to know in what county that is.  I am certain that if it were known, that county board of health would get a very bad reputation for its administration.</P>
      <P>This matter has been carefully considered by the Labour Party before we put down this amendment.  I know of very few cases where occupiers of a labourer's cottage would have the courage to apply for an economic holding.  The majority of men who live in labourers' cottages, so far as my knowledge of such people goes, are men who are employed by the county council as road workers or employed as agricultural labourers, or in the outskirts of the towns, employed by the shopkeepers.  In such cases it is impossible for the occupiers of labourers' cottages to produce enough food to maintain themselves and their families on their three-quarters of an acre and at the same time provide grass for a cow and a calf or two. The intention behind the minds of the people responsible for this amendment is that five acres should be made available where land is being divided, so as to provide the occupiers of labourers' cottages with two or three acres for grass and enough land to produce potatoes and vegetables for the support of the occupier and his family.  That is the intention behind the amendment.  I am prepared to admit, and the Minister will have to admit it also, that possibly in the case of those two bad tenants he has in mind there will be no land made available for division in that area, and in such a case it would be impossible for the Land Commission to provide this addition to the holding which he has in mind.</P>

If, within the terms of his amendment, land falls into the hands of the Land Commission and if there is a man living in a labourer's cottage on the estate who has failed to work the half-acre or acre that he has, is the Land Commission to be compelled to give that man five acres?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Galway) Mr. Hogan (Galway)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Galway): Deputy Davin has completely misconceived the position.  Under the 1923 Act the Land Commission always gave land to the labourers who were put out of employment, by reason of the division of an estate, whether they lived in labourers cottages or not.  I know plenty of cases where labourers to the number of ten or 12 got economic holdings on an estate.  Deputy Davin also said that the procedure of the Land Commission, as outlined by the Acting-Minister in that statement he read out, was an advance on the previous position. It is not.  It is a retrograde step, because what is happening is that seven labourers are getting 98 acres, that is, 14 acres apiece.  The labourers are now getting uneconomic holdings. I know that of my own knowledge. They are getting holdings of £6 or £7 valuation.  Deputy Davin considers that that is an advance.  It is not an advance.  He said that was an improvement on the procedure adopted by the Land Commission under a previous dispensation.  It is not an improvement.  It is a very decided retrograde step.  Personally, I regard it as extremely bad policy to give less than an economic holding to anybody. Deputy Davin spoke about the labourer who has to get work on the roads or to get work near towns from <Col N="1004" /> local farmers.  What is going to happen to that labourer when all that work stops, as stop it will?  The work from the local farmers will stop when this Bill is in operation, because most of the farmers who give employment to labourers will have their land taken from them.  The work on the roads will stop when the money runs short, and that is not going to last very long. What will be the position either of the labourer whom the Minister speaks of who has a 14 acre holding or a £6 valuation holding, or the labourer whom Deputy Davin is interested in and who has to live on six acres of land?  I will tell you where we are going&mdash;we are going back to 1848. Even before this Bill is passed in my own county I saw estates divided and holdings given to landless men of 15 or 16 acres of poor land, the valuation of which would be about £7.  There is a new definition now of an economic holding.  The economic holdings that were made under previous Acts were between £12 and £20 valuation and sometimes up to £25.  It is now cut down always by one-third, and often by one-half.  You will have a new class of small tenants whose standard of living will be extraordinarily low.  That has happened already and it is certain to happen under the Bill which is to deal with congestion and landless men.  There will be a new class of tenant whose condition will be worse than the occupier of a holding of £3 valuation in 1848 or 1860.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be unfair to Deputy Hogan or to misrepresent the position during his régime, because I know that when an estate was acquired and divided the men who lost their employment as a result of the acquisition of such an estate were almost in all cases that I know of provided for.  The Minister has read out a list which I believe includes the names of occupiers of labourers' cottages who were not employed on the estates concerned and that is what I say is an advance on the previous position in so far as I cannot give the name of one occupier of a labourer's cottage not employed on the estate who got any land under the Act of 1923 in my constituency.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 129:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 22, line 47, to delete the words &ldquo;notwithstanding that the price has not been agreed upon or fixed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think this amendment is covered by the next amendment in the name of the Minister.  The only point I would like to be certain about is that payment will be made to the landlord on a fixed date, and the object of the amendment is to provide that it should be made on the appointed day.  A long time may elapse between the appointed day and the time when the price is fixed, and in that time the value of land may appreciate or depreciate. I want to provide that the landlord shall be secured and that the value of the land should be prescribed. I think, as I say, that the object of the amendment is covered by amendment 130.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>It raises the same question. In sub-section (2), after the word &ldquo;behalf&rdquo; it proposes to add the words &ldquo;and at the value of the lands <Col N="1007" /> on the appointed day&rdquo;.  The section gives power to take untenanted land and to fix the price provisionally. Sub-section (2) provides &ldquo;In default of agreement the price of lands in respect of which the appointed day has been declared under the foregoing sub-section of this section shall be fixed in accordance with the provision of the Land Purchase Acts in that behalf&rdquo;. My amendment proposes to add to these words in order to make it definite and clear what, I think, the section proposes to do, that is, to declare the value of the land on the appointed day.  The value of the land may change in favour or against the Land Commission but I think it is the intention of the Minister to fix the price on the appointed day.  It may work in his favour in some cases or against him in others, but it would prevent litigation and disputes as to what the real date is.  I suggest that the Minister might accept that amendment.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (3) provides that the vendor is entitled to receive interest on the amount of the bonds, less income tax.  In the following sub-section there is also reference to the interest to be paid on the bonds, and there is no provision for the deduction of income tax.  I want to make it perfectly clear, and I am sure the Minister will accept the amendment, that income tax is not going to be deducted twice over.  It would appear from sub-section (3) and sub-section (4) that the Minister has a right to deduct it twice over.  Line 5, sub-section (3) says:&mdash;&ldquo;...a sum equal to interest (less income tax).&rdquo; Lines 13 and 14 of sub-section (4) refer to &ldquo;the amount so paid into the Land Bond Fund, together with the interest paid on the bonds...&rdquo; There is no mention of income tax there.</P>

      <P>Under the Income Tax Acts, income tax must be deducted at the full standard rate from the interest on land bonds.  It may be that the recipient of the interest is entitled to repayment from the Revenue Commissioners of the tax so deducted.  If he has in fact obtained repayment of such tax obviously he is not entitled to deduct the same tax from the interest which the Land Commission calls upon him to refund under sub-section (4).</P>

      <P>In sub-section (5), line 25, to delete the figures &ldquo;25&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;ten.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> The sub-section provides that in relation to guarantee deposits the provisions of the Act of 1931 shall apply in the case of untenanted land for which a provisional price has been declared under this section, with the modification that the deposit shall be 25 per cent. of the provisional price. That seems to me to be too large a sum to require as deposit.  The price will always be fixed within a very narrow margin, and I therefore suggest to the Minister that he should accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is not a fairly wide margin naturally the tendency with the Land Commission will be to play safe.  The provisional price will not be in operation very long, I hope, and I think it is better that the Land Commission should have a margin of 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the force of what the Minister says, but I do suggest that 25 per cent. is too high.  Would the Minister consider the figure of 15 per cent?  Twenty-five per cent. is an enormous proportion having regard to the competency of the valuers who act for the Land Commission.  It seems incredible that there would be such a wide margin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisional price, I presume, will be based on the inspector's valuation of the land.  It is scarcely conceivable that there would be such a margin between the inspector's valuation and the price which would ultimately be fixed by the appeal tribunal.  Taking the cases which passed through the Land Commission for, let us say, the last six months, it will be found that there is scarcely a difference of 5 per cent.</P>

A £4,000 or £5,000 holding may be resumed without any appeal to any tribunal.  Remember the discussion which took place on the constitution of the tribunal; the Minister carried his point.

      <P>If any such petition as aforesaid is granted then it shall not be lawful for the Land Commission to exercise their powers of resumption and the holding shall be vested in the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 30 provides that a tenant of a holding shall have the right to petition the Land Commission against the resumption of that particular holding.  Following on that, procedure is laid down by means of which the Land Commission shall determine or shall deal with that petition.  I propose to add at the end of the section that if such a petition is granted it shall not be lawful for the Land Commission to exercise their powers of resumption <Col N="1014" /> and that the holding shall be vested in the tenant.  I do not know whether it is necessary to add a sub-section of that kind at all.  The vesting of the holding in the tenant following the grant of the petition should be a purely automatic process.

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 56, page 23, after the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;other than land purchased under the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under Section 31 of the Land Act of 1923 it is provided that advances may be made to the following persons or bodies for the purchase by them from the Land Commission of parcels of land:</P>
      <P>(a)  A person being the tenant or proprietor of a holding which in the opinion of the Land Commission is not an economic holding.</P>
      <P>(b)  A person who has entered into agreement with the Land Commission for the exchange of his holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> (c)  A person who was evicted within 25 years before the passing of the Land Act of 1923.</P>
    <P>(d)  A person being a labourer who by reason of the sale of any lands under the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts has been deprived of his employment, and</P>
    <P>(f)  any other person to whom in the opinion of the Land Commission an advance ought to be made.</P>
    <P>The last provision of course covers landless men.  The Minister has stated that Section 31 gives him much greater power to deal, not alone with the problem of congestion but with the problem of landless men and other classes, than he had under the previous Land Acts.  In this amendment I want to limit the Minister's powers to acquire only untenanted land under this particular section for the purpose of dealing with certain classes of persons mentioned in Section 31 of the Land Act of 1923.  I want chiefly to insure that registered land or purchased land shall be utilised only for the purpose of relieving congestion. Section 31 as it is worded undoubtedly gives the Minister most extraordinary powers.  When Section 31 is related to Section 28 the Minister has far greater powers than he had under any previous Land Act for the purposes of acquiring and distributing land to classes of persons mentioned in Section 31 of the 1923 Act.  I want to distinguish so far as the acquisition of land is concerned between the operation of Section 31 and Section 28, and to ensure that the land acquired under Section 28 shall be utilised for the purpose of relieving congestion and that that acquired under Section 31 shall be divided for the purposes mentioned in Section 31 of the Land Act of 1923.</P>

He provides in his own Bill that it shall only be taken off a tenant if and when the Land Commission provide a holding of the same market value for the tenant.  Would he add this further protection, that that land shall be only taken on the basis set out in the Act for the relief of congestion?</P>

      <P>That takes my breath away.  I thought it was generally understood that it is some hardship, to put it no further, to take £2,000 worth of vested land where a man has a holding working it as an ordinary farmer.  I thought it was generally <Col N="1017" /> agreed that it was a hardship to take that land.  It is agreed by the Government that it is a hardship to take it because they came in with a Bill which gave special rights for the protection of such land.  I am suggesting that in addition to the right of protection they provide for such holding, his holding can only be taken if he is paid its market value, and that if he gets a holding of equal market value such holding can only be taken for the relief of congestion.  You are dealing only with land worth £2,000 which is worked in accordance with proper methods of husbandry.  Would it not be a monstrous thing to take that land?</P>

It can be taken under the Shannon scheme, and was taken under the Shannon scheme.</P>

That is the kind of holding on which there would be only one labourer's cottage at most. I have hardly ever seen a holding of 140 acres with more than one labourer's cottage.  Here you are taking power to take the sort of land to which I have referred for landless men, and by that sort of land I mean £2,000 worth of purchased land on which a man and his family live, and which he farms as an ordinary working farmer in accordance with proper methods of husbandry.

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Where lands have been vested in a purchaser under any Land Purchase Act prior to the Land Act, 1923, and the sporting rights (including fishing rights) on or over such lands or in the waters adjoining or intersecting such lands were not so vested, the Land Commission may, if of the opinion that it would be for the benefit of the country that such rights should be acquired and that such rights (other than fishing rights) should be vested in the proprietors of the lands on or over which such rights (other than as aforesaid) are exercised as an appurtenance to such lands and if such proprietors are willing to purchase such rights (other than as aforesaid), make an order declaring the appointed day in respect of all such rights and vesting the same in the Land Commission at a price, payable in land bonds, to be fixed (in default of agreement by the <Col N="1020" /> lay commissioners subject to a right of appeal to the appeal tribunal.</P>

      <P>The position at the moment is that with regard to any sporting rights that were vested in the landlord under the old Acts no matter how much local agitation is against the landlord going over the tenant's land, nothing can be done to settle the dispute.  We want to take power in this Bill, where the Land Commission sees fit, to acquire those sporting rights and vest them in the tenants who are agreeable to purchase them. With regard to the fishing rights, we want to take the same power as was taken under the 1923 Act under which all the fishing rights were bought up. We want to go back over the old Acts and to purchase these rights that were vested in the old landlords and vest them in the tenants as was done under the 1923 Act.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 145:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 32 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything in this or other Land Acts no land shall be compulsorily acquired subsequent to the coming into operation of this Act unless the Land Commission are satisfied that such land is not at present providing an amount of employment proportionate to its acreage and character, and for the purpose of computing such employment children of the tenant or proprietor employed on the land shall be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of this amendment, standing in my name, as I understand it, has been accepted by the Minister and by the Fianna Fáil Party as a whole.  They have frequently indicated, in the course of the debates on this Bill, that in <Col N="1021" /> practice no proprietor, or tenant, will be disturbed on his land if the land in question is giving its due amount of employment.  If that is so, I suggest that it would be an enormous improvement to this Bill to embody that principle in the Bill and that it would tremendously increase the feeling of security of tenants, or proprietors, of land throughout the country.  It would give the Land Commission a valuable working principle on which to go and I suggest it would be a great help to the whole carrying on of agriculture in this country and would enable everybody to feel that he was safe in improving his land and making the very best of it and sinking money in it.  As long as the authorities are satisfied that the land was giving its due amount of employment, I think the proprietor of such land should not be disturbed under any pretext.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Galway) Mr. Hogan (Galway)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Galway): If that is so, the Minister will hear from me.  I think it is a perfectly sound amendment in the circumstances of this Bill.  Personally, I am against the Land Commission, or any other body, telling any man how to work his land, and I take it that so is Deputy MacDermot.  But the position now is that in a great many respects it is left to various departments to say what sort of stock a farmer should have and it is not for me to complain about that.  The position is generally now for departments to say on what lines lands should be farmed.  As Deputy MacDermot pointed out, the principle in this amendment is a principle which has been absolutely accepted by the Government Party.  All their public pronouncements have been on the lines that the Bill is not to affect any land that is giving value to the community either from the point of view of production or from the point of view of the number of labourers employed.  I should be particularly in favour of this because whatever little land I have supports a rather <Col N="1022" /> big number of workmen, but I assure the Acting-Minister that if he had that in his mind in inviting me to speak I am not thinking of that so much.</P>
      <P>Under the circumstances of the present time, however, having regard to the length to which this Bill goes and to the insecurity in which tenants are placed, I am entirely in favour of this amendment.  One thing seems to me to be clear, and that is that the Government cannot, consistent with any of the statements that they have been making, refuse this amendment. This Bill, if passed into law, will give the Land Commission power to acquire the land of biggish farmers whether they employ much labour or not.  It will tend, undoubtedly, to make them feel a sense of insecurity and in that respect, also, the effect of the Bill in future will be that people will do less work, incur less capital expenditure and, therefore, employ less labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied that, except for this section, the whole trend of this Bill will be to employ, if you wish, less paid labour on the land.  This is the only section that will do anything to counteract that general tendency in the Bill.  I think that must be admitted. Every previous section of the Bill will at least have the tendency of preventing owners of land from incurring expenditure and, therefore, of employing labour on whatever land may be left to them.  This attempts to counteract that.  It is an attempt which is consistent with the declarations made by the Party opposite.  Apart from politics altogether, there is no doubt about it that the particular farm which is employing the most labour, is producing most and is doing most for the country.  No Party, no matter what their policy on land may be, has ever denied that, or attempted to deny it in public.  In that state of affairs I do not see how the Government can refuse to accept this amendment, and particularly I do not see how the Labour Party can vote against if they have any interest other than a political interest in labour.  I honestly believe that this may do something to create employment on the land.  There are people yet in this country with a certain <Col N="1023" /> amount of land, up to 200 acres or thereabouts&mdash;I am not speaking of millionaires&mdash;who have a certain amount of capital, whose lands would not be taken in any event, and who will feel a sense of security as a result of the passage of this.  If they have that provision there it will undoubtedly have the effect of getting them to go in for a type of farming that, while it may not be any more remunerative, will give more employment.  I know a few people who happen to have a bit of money who are anxious to hold their land and are thinking on those lines. Apart altogether from the political aspects of this, I believe that the acceptance of the amendment would be a genuine improvement from that point of view to this Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who comes from another part of the country to that represented by Deputy Hogan, I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment.  This would be giving the good farmer the minimum security that he needs.  Like most Deputies who have been to their constituencies recently and who have been questioned about this Bill, I personally would be glad to be able to point to such a provision in this Bill: that a farm that is being carried on in a proper way will not be touched.  We have had the assurance from the Government Benches and from Government Deputies inside and outside the House that there is no fear whatever that this Bill is going to touch the person who is carrying on in the way that he should carry on.  I support Deputy MacDermot's amendment.  I would say to the Minister that he would be doing a very good service to this Bill and to the people who want to carry on in the country by accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>Under Sections 28 and 29 of the 1923 Act the Land Commission can take land from anybody, from a judicial tenant, and resume his holding no matter how he is working it, even though he is providing employment on it, and need not necessarily give him any land in exchange.  That is what all the row was about in the case of the 1923 Act.  Also under that Act the Land Commission can take a vested holding for the relief of congestion, but in that case they have to give land equally suitable elsewhere. I must say that I am sympathetic to what Deputy MacDermot is trying to do.  The difficulty is to find words that will cover the idea that he has in mind.  If we had any standard unit value of land; that one could say that a man who has 20 units of that value was keeping himself and one workman on it, or one son over 18 years of age, it would be easy to legislate, but we have no unit value at the moment. The poor law valuation is not, in fact, in present circumstances any criterion of the value of land.</P>

      <P>Would not the Minister agree that the Land Commission would have to take this point into consideration?  In any case they would have to try to make some estimate if they were going to do their work well. They have a whole lot of other problems to consider in connection with the acquisition of land that are every bit as difficult as this is: to assess what is the amount of employment the land ought to give.  I was speaking quite honestly this afternoon when I said that we wish to be in a position to reassure people's minds throughout the country as to the effect of this Bill.  There is nothing that would put us in that position more thoroughly, apart from the withdrawal of the Bill altogether, than the acceptance of this amendment.  I have spoken to some members of the Labour Party and find that they are sympathetic to it.  I am not surprised, because, as Deputy Hogan has pointed out, there is nothing that could more conduce to using land in the way that would give the greatest amount of employment than a provision of this kind.</P>

      <P>The motion under Standing Order No. 27 has been accepted by the Chair, and the Leader of the Opposition has given the Ceann Comhairle a written statement of the subject to be discussed:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" />&ldquo;To draw attention to the uneasiness caused in the public mind by the action of the Government in withdrawing firearms certificates from law-abiding citizens, to whom such certificates had been granted for the protection of life or property.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>By Private Notice I submitted the following question to-day:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the President if he has any statement to make as to the withdrawal of certificates for firearms; if he will state the number of firearms collected, the number proposed to be collected, and the number proposed to be left uncollected.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government was asked for a simple statement.  It made no statement. What has happened has been happily described by Deputy Dillon, as the collection by the Government of arms from persons legally authorised to hold them under a statute of the State.  No explanation was given as to what the policy of the Government was with regard to the matter, if they had any policy at all.  The Act which was passed some years ago placed the onus on the superintendents of the Guards who, in each case, had to receive applications for and to grant permits to individuals to have firearms.  It was not done very lightly, but after mature consideration of the circumstances of the case.  It was not done without reason.  The necessity had arisen for arming certain persons.  The events of the previous few years had occasioned some disorder in the State. Considerable sums of money belonging to private individuals and public corporations, even some State moneys, had been seized.  It was for the protection of property, as well as for the security of life, that certificates or permits, or whatever one likes to call them, were given to certain individuals to hold arms.  There was no abuse as far as the public is aware on the part of those who got these certificates.  We would all hope that the necessity for keeping firearms would speedily pass away.  We have <Col N="1030" /> got no information on that point. As the law stands, the certificate can be withdrawn by the superintendents. It is a strange circumstance in these days that all the superintendents came to the same opinion, on the same day, on the same thing, in such widely different places as Donegal and Cork, Kerry and Louth. Apparently the Government had a policy in that matter.  However precipitate and hasty it may be, apparently they had taken the responsibility from the superintendents of the Guards.  If they did that, on the advice of the superintendents, they might have told us to-day, or they might have so stated in the Press.</P>
    <P>This Government has been remarkable for the number of sensations that it has provided for the public since it first took over office in this State. After the first series of moderate political sensations we came to the major one.  There is one sensation which the Government is anxious that public attention should be diverted from, and that is the economic position in this State.  They have provided some political sensations which have, occasionally, diverted public attention from these matters.  There is, for instance, the victimisation of the ex-Governor-General, the victimisation of the head of the Gárda Síochána and minor victimisations which do not count very much in their eyes&mdash;all, I suppose, of set purpose to divert public attention from the grave economic issues which they have themselves brought about and about which they have admitted that they have never attempted, since the last general election, to endeavour to settle.</P>
    <P>It is quite time that the Government should act impartially in this country, should forget their partiality, should not abuse the power and the authority that they have seized, should realise there is a responsibility on them for the good order of this State and for the economic condition of the people. They are asked in Parliament for an explanation as to their conduct in a case such as this.  Although they may endeavour to stage this as a political sensation of the first magnitude, we are not forgetting the major infirmities, <Col N="1031" /> the major sins of the Ministry.  A policy of victimisation and partiality will bring its own judgment upon whoever perpetrates it.</P>
    <P>In this evening's paper there is evidence of an endeavour by masked men, I presume, armed, to interview a citizen of this State.  Has there been any abuse on the part of those law-abiding citizens, who have got certificates, of the trust reposed in them by the responsible Gárda officer?  If there were, there may be some excuse for dealing with a particular case, but there is no excuse for, at a moment's notice, disturbing the public mind with this policy of cancelling all certificates for no reason that is given, for no explanation that is offered.  It bears on its face its own condemnation of Government policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was so little said by Deputy Cosgrave that I anticipated somebody else on the Front Bench opposite would follow him with something more definite.  He seems to treat this matter, about which we were told so much alarm was created&mdash;or, at least, we gathered from some newspapers that such alarm was said to be created through the country&mdash;as merely an attempt by the Government to stage a sensation.  Well, if it is not a sensation, and I assume that is the Deputy's line of argument, then there is nothing in it and there is nothing here worth discussing. He states it is merely an attempt by the Government to stage a sensation.  I gather from that that he regards it as no sensation; he regards it as nothing abnormal, nothing that would create any trouble or difficulty in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is a very simple one. The position is that in 1925 a Firearms Act was passed in this country under certain circumstances.  It was passed to deal with a certain position.  Under that Firearms Act certain certificates or permits were issued to certain people in this country.  These certificates could be withdrawn at any time on various grounds.  One of the grounds was that a person had no good reason for requiring a firearm.  The other <Col N="1032" /> grounds the Deputy is, I take it, conversant with, and I do not want to go through them.  At this stage I would like to deal with the point made by Deputy Cosgrave that he assumes that we have got in touch or that the police force, the head of the police, got in touch with superintendents through the country.  The police force, including superintendents, as has been the practice established here for the last ten years, works through its headquarters.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Cosgrave wants to make any point as to the head of the police having had to get an expression of opinion, or that the superintendents of the police had a discretion and were entitled to act entirely on their own discretion, he is trying to stipulate or set out something not acted upon by the former Commissioner of Police. This Act sets out that the superintendent of the Civic Guards may issue a permit.  Was that what was done? Not at all.  Under that Act there were routine orders issued and I can take you over any of the routine orders issued during those times.  I will take practically the first one issued under the Act.  It is Routine Order No. C.80:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The following instructions relative to the granting of firearms certificates are issued for the information and guidance of the Gárda.  In all cases where application for a firearms licence is made in respect of a revolver or other lethal weapon for which no previous licence has been issued the Commissioner's authority to grant such licence must be obtained and accordingly all such applications shall be forwarded to headquarters for the necessary authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GearoidOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not revocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy for a moment suggest that the person who takes on himself the authority to grant a licence in any other matter as well as a firearms certificate has not the right to revoke it?  Is that the law that we are going to get now?  Is that the suggestion?  In practice all through that was what was not acted upon. <Col N="1033" /> Those were the routine orders issued and to state that a superintendent is to be the sole judge as to whether a licence is to issue or be revoked&mdash; that position has not been acted upon since the Act was passed in 1925.</P>
      <P>Eight years have elapsed since this Act was passed.  A number of certificates have been issued.  The 31st July in each year is the date upon which these licences normally expire.  The police authorities, perhaps like other people, may consider, and the Government may consider, that it is advisable to have a stocktaking in this particular matter.  The stocktaking has taken place and is taking place at the present time with regard to revolvers and pistols at present held on permit throughout the country.</P>
      <P>We have seen various incidents happening through the country where the people who held firearms certificates were involved.  We have seen people fined.  We have seen as late as the other day where a member on the Front Bench opposite had to intervene with one of those people apparently to take charge of his gun himself.  I think it was in Cootehill or in Clones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy states, but I am stating what the paper states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" />&ldquo;Towards the close of the meeting General Mulcahy and Commandant Cronin were seen to be in heated controversy, Commandant Cronin demanding from General Mulcahy that the latter should restore to him the gun for which he stated he held a permit.  General Mulcahy was heard to say that he would restore the gun if Commandant Cronin was in danger.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There have been a number of instances like that.  The police are satisfied that a great number of those people who have permits are in no need of having these firearms.  They are also satisfied that to some of those people those firearms are a greater danger than protection.  A point was sought to be made by Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy Fitzgerald to-day in asking a question about the banks and so on.  With regard to the banks and with regard to individuals, the right to protect them is vested in the forces of this State.  It is their duty to see that these people are protected, that property is protected&mdash;that every step that is necessary is taken to see that their persons and property will be protected.  Arms have not been taken up in any indiscriminate way from any individuals, nor is any individual told that he is not going to get any protection.  I saw a reference in a newspaper and a lot of point was made about it in the case of the late Commissioner of the Gárda, that at the same time as a request was made for a revocation of his arms certificate, the guard was taken from him.  The person concerned a month ago asked that the guard be withdrawn from him.  That person was offered the guard back again to protect him, and although he was a guard that was taken into the force in his own time he said he was only a tout and would not have him.  The police forces of this country, if they are to maintain order, have a right to say who the guard is who is to protect any individual and no individual has a right to discriminate as to the personnel of the guards who are to protect him. That cannot be admitted even from the late Commissioner of the Gárda. <Col N="1035" /> That position will not be admitted.</P>
    <P>Trying to suggest to the House and country that there are individuals in this country whose guns have been taken from them at present and that no attempt is being made to protect them is untrue and without foundation. It is not so.  To say that banks, warehouses and so on are in danger is an attempt to create a greater sensation than anything else that could be visualised.  On this matter of protection, the police are taking and will take every application for individual permits into consideration.  These applications will be considered and every precaution will be taken.  Every protection will be given to those people.  What is happening under this order?  In the ordinary way people would have to apply for a renewal of the licence on the 31st July.  These people pay 5/- every year for the renewal of their licence.  These licences were revoked.  They were informed beforehand that permits were being revoked.  Everyone of these who wants a gun for his protection and every individual who wants a gun for the protection of his property will have his application for a permit considered and permits will be issued where the police think that a gun is necessary for protection. The police forces will be the judges of that particular matter.</P>
    <P>This talk about sensation and creating a sensation is all so much&mdash;well I do not know exactly how to describe it.  But in the ordinary, normal way, if the people opposite were not trying to make political capital out of these things, such a position as this would not have arisen.  It would be treated as a perfectly normal, ordinary procedure.</P>

Analyse that speech, look through it and see what the pith of it does <Col N="1036" /> amount to.

      <P>If it was not going to be considered whether those people who had guns would get a licence, why were we told that the people from whom guns were taken and permits revoked are to apply for a licence?  That is what we are told now.  Why was not that stated before? Why were the public told that every single licence held by a private individual in the State was to be revoked? That is what we were told.  There was nothing about reconsideration.  If the Minister's statement is that that was the original view held&mdash;that there was going to be reconsideration&mdash;then between the Department of Justice and the Chief Commissioner of the Civic Guards they have blundered in the most appalling fashion.  If it were a mere question of stocktaking and considering whether two or three or ten or 15 licences were going to be revoked and that every single one of the others would be granted, then the whole thing is simply the act of an imbecile. Whether the imbecility of this particular procedure is imbecility proceeding from the Minister for Justice or imbecility proceeding from the Commissioner of the Gárda I do not greatly care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is admitted.  The Minister said just now, in the hearing of every Deputy, that persons who require firearms would get them back.  Therefore, there must be persons who require firearms for their protection.  Otherwise the Minister's statement was absolute nonsense.  To say that there are no people who require firearms for their protection and that these firearms are not required for protective purposes is clearly absurd.  Of course there are people in this State who require firearms for their protection.  Everybody knows it, including the Minister.  In fact it was admitted by the Minister in his speech.  Yet these people who require firearms for their protection are to have these firearms taken up for a day, or a week or a month or six months.  These arms are taken up wantonly, and we are told that is to be an example of efficiency and is merely stocktaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are persons who require firearms for their protection.  This is well known, but every single one of these individuals is to be left unprotected and every bank is to be left unprotected. Every person who is carrying a sum of money, and who requires firearms upon him, is to be left unprotected, while stock is being taken, as the Minister says.  That is the story according to the Minister, and goodness knows how long they are to be left unprotected.  Freedom is to be given to the Minister's allies, or rather, I should say, to the Minister's masters to go against these people.  The lame, weak, halting defence which the Minister put up here certainly deceived nobody.  Everybody in this State knows what is behind this.  Everybody knows that the Minister has his orders and he has obeyed his orders.  He has got his orders from the I.R.A. and kindred associations.  He has obeyed them as he always has obeyed them and as the rest of the Administration have always obeyed them when they got them.  Of course these persons <Col N="1038" /> who have no licences and can carry guns without the slightest bit of interference, these gentlemen who can have revolvers and Thompson guns and fire at a superintendent of the Guards, or anybody else, will not be touched by the Minister.  As the President tells us, they are to have their revolvers and their Thompson guns and everything else, provided they do not show them in public.  They do not come to get a licence.  They do not apply for permits. They simply tell the Minister that they do not care a button about him; that they will carry them without his permission, and down on his knees goes the Minister for Justice.  That is the situation here now.  They give their orders and the Minister obeys, as he always has obeyed them.</P>
    <P>Persons in this State are told that the Guards now are going to give them protection.  What is the meaning of that attack on the Guards, because that is an attack on the Guards?  When did the Guards ever cease to give all the protection they could?  The Guards gave all the protection they could when they were just as efficient, if not a more efficient force than they are at present. At that time they considered that it was necessary that certain individuals should have firearms.  They gave all the protection they could.  They knew they could not be in every place and could not afford to all individuals at all times complete and adequate protection. They know it and every sane person knows it.  They considered it then necessary, in order that persons should be safe, that individuals should have firearms in addition to the police protection.  They gave every possible protection.  Yet they considered then, and they consider now I believe, that persons require firearms for their protection. This is a matter for the discretion of each chief superintendent. It is not left to such superintendents. Every superintendent who knows his district is the only person who can judge.  To say that all these superintendents one day came suddenly to a certain conclusion about the persons whom they all thought within the last few months required arms for their protection and suddenly changed their minds is absolute nonsense.  It is <Col N="1039" /> absurd for the Minister to make any such suggestion.  We know perfectly well what is behind the matter.  We know perfectly well that the ordinary individual is not to get the right to protect himself if the Minister's masters think he should not have the right to protect himself.  We see here a Minister absolutely and obviously&mdash; because there can be no other explanation&mdash;obeying the orders which he gets from outside; a Minister degrading his high office as this Minister is by this cowardly attitude on his part.  I should like to remind the Minister of a famous line from one of the great Elizabethan dramatists, and it is this: &ldquo;Let me remain an honest man which I am sure a coward can never be.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only going to venture a very few words on this subject.  My diagnosis of the Government's malady is slightly different from that of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. I do not believe that they have taken the action they have taken because they were ordered to do so by the I.R.A.  But I do believe that they are making a kind of demonstration because they felt impelled to do so by the coming into existence of the National Guard.  I think they felt that something was expected of them by their followers to show their disapproval and dislike of that body.  I do not believe that these inquisitions would ever have occurred if it were not for the recent development in connection with that organisation.  There is no man in this House who is less sympathetic towards militaristic developments than I am, but I must say that I am not impressed by the action that the Government have just taken.  In fact the story which has appeared in the newspapers in the last few days seemed almost too fantastic to be true.  I have been waiting patiently for some indication from the Government as to what it all means.  They are, it appears to me, unnecessarily secretive as to the number of arms involved, and without knowing something about the number it is rather difficult to form a judgment about the whole business.  It <Col N="1040" /> may be that there are a certain number of arms now out under licence that would be better recalled. We do not know what portion of the cases at present being investigated that applies to.  It certainly seems absolutely senseless that calls should be paid on General O'Duffy, Mr. Blythe, Deputy Mulcahy and people of that description and that they should be called upon to deliver up their revolvers.  Is there a single person in the House who believes that a revolver in the possession of any one of these is any sort of danger to the public peace, or any danger to the State?  Is the revolver of General O'Duffy going to make all the difference as to whether the National Guard is a body formidable to this State or not formidable to this State? I suggest that the Government have covered themselves with ridicule by what they have done.  They have not given any intelligible explanation of the matter to-night.  This talk about stocktaking would not deceive a baby. They are not interested at all, apparently, in taking stock of the arms illegitimately held, and we all know that there are far more arms illegitimately held than legitimately held amongst citizens of the country. I do not think that there will be many impartial persons found to differ from the opinion that the Government have made themselves supremely ridiculous by what they have done in the matter of these guns.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy MacDermot, I take a different view of this situation from what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has taken.  But I also take a different view of the situation from what Deputy MacDermot has taken, because I am not in the least interested in whether the Government are acting at the behests of the I.R.A. or whether they are acting through fear of the development and growth of the National Guard.  What I am interested in is the uneasiness and alarm, and I may say the resentment, created in the public mind during the last few days by this precipitate action of the Government.  I have on many occasions in this House called attention <Col N="1041" /> to the fact that the underlying principle of Government policy is one that creates insecurity and unrest, and this is a further manifestation of that policy, because nothing could be more calculated to create in the public mind a feeling of alarm and uneasiness than the method adopted by the Government in withdrawing the certificates and purporting to call in the arms issued pursuant to the certificates granted in the last few days.  I agree with Deputy MacDermot that the so-called explanation of the Minister for Justice would not deceive a baby. It was quite clear to me that he had no explanation to offer to the House of the action which has taken place. At the beginning of his speech he endeavoured to invoke the Firearms Act of 1925 and he quoted the sub-section which enabled a superintendent of the Guards to withdraw a certificate where there was no good reason for the person to whom the certificate had been given to require firearms.  Then he proceeded to this absurd and ridiculous performance about stocktaking. If the explanation of this action of the Government is stocktaking, why was it that on Friday last a firearms certificate was given to a member of this House on which he paid his fee of 5/- to the superintendent of police and that same certificate was withdrawn the following day?  What is the necessity for that action if this is simply stocktaking?  Are we to assume that between Friday evening and Saturday morning a sudden decision was taken by the Government or by the Gárda or other authorities that stocktaking was required?  If stocktaking was required why was not the normal and proper procedure carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice says there was a suggestion that we were bringing forward this question for the purpose of making political capital and that if we had not that purpose we would have treated it as normal procedure.  Why was not the normal procedure of the last nine years, since the Firearms Act was passed, carried out in this instance?  If there was to be stocktaking the time when everyone having a certificate was bound to apply&mdash; before 31st July&mdash;for its renewal might <Col N="1042" /> have been availed of.  It lay in the hands of the competent authorities, when an application was made, to decide whether the applicant was a proper person to whom a fresh certificate could be given, without creating in the public mind any feeling of alarm, or even making it known to the public. All these incidents could have been dealt with by the Gárda and with the necessary withholding of certificates in proper cases.  But no, we had these occurrences, which were tantamount to raids on private houses.  In the country we had instances where, when the occupants of private houses were absent, or abroad on business, they were pursued by the police officers simply because they wanted to take up the guns.  The Government have made a mistake in taking this precipitate action.  Why did they not, after the matter appeared in the public Press, take steps to allay this feeling of alarm by publishing a statement that this was a mere innocent, ordinary, routine movement of the Guards or of headquarters? The Minister for Justice on Saturday knew nothing about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister responsible for good order and for the police of the country knew nothing about this on Saturday, or so he told the Press.  We had raids, alarms and excursions which could be obviated in a perfectly routine manner. The alarm could have been allayed on Saturday by a statement from the Minister for Justice, not that he knew nothing about it, but that it was a matter of police routine.  That would have allayed public uneasiness and suspicion, but that course was not taken and nothing that the Minister has said to-night will allay that alarm. No smiling or sniggering from the President as he has been smiling and sniggering during this debate will allay public uneasiness.  Rather will it increase that uneasiness.  It is well known that the more the President smiles and sniggers the more the point goes home and no smiling or sniggering from the Fianna Fáil Benches will allay anxiety.  The great want of the country at the present time is peace. You may have the best economic policy, but if you have not peace and a sense of security your economic <Col N="1043" /> policy is sure to fail, and every action of this Government, during the last 18 months, has done nothing except to create public uneasiness and suspicion and unrest.</P>

      <P>I have noticed, in the course of this debate, the Fianna Fáil Party have been taking up a rather amused attitude.  I do not know how far the President will smile if one of the gentlemen from whom he took these revolvers is murdered in the streets.  Murder has been done in the streets of Dublin before, and it is something that I do not care to contemplate that any man should be shot down in the streets of Dublin without a chance of defending himself and without a weapon to defend himself.  I am quite satisfied that such an event would be deplored by the President.  But it seems to me to be scarcely an adequate excuse for taking a risk of that kind that the Chief Commissioner wanted to take stock of the pistols and other firearms in the hands of law-abiding citizens who had applied to the State for permits and who held them at the disposal of the State at all times.  It is well to remember that most of the Ministers sitting on the Front Bench at the present time are under police protection.</P>

      <P>So far I do not require protection, and if I do I hope I shall get it.  But there are men in this State at the present moment who, in the opinion of the competent police officers, do require firearms to be carried upon their person to give them security and safety.  For these men, walking the streets or living in their homes, it was thought necessary that <Col N="1044" /> they should have firearms, and the excuse now given for taking them up is that the police wanted to take stock. That is the excuse given.  I just want to clear my own mind as to what the exact situation in the country is.  The President of the Executive Council said in this House some time ago that, while he knew there were arms in the possession of many people in the country without authority, he was not going to go and look for them because he did not believe he would get them.  What do such people want arms for?  Does the Minister for Justice seriously suggest that the presence of these arms in the hands of unauthorised persons does not constitute anxiety to the police of this country?  Is he of opinion that it is just that a man who is in danger of being assailed by armed assassins should not be allowed to carry a weapon with which to defend his life?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in this country unhappy memories of men who were assailed by armed assassins and who had no weapons to defend their lives.  I think if a similar occurrence again took place in this country President de Valera, and the members of the Executive Council, would genuinely and sincerely deplore it, but they are running the risk of such occurrences in the country.  As I see it, there are two classes of people in this country now in the possession of arms or who were before this revocation. One class of these persons were law-abiding citizens who asked the police for licences and satisfied the police that there were grounds on which they should get them.  The other class of persons who have arms deny the policy of the State and refuse even to ask for a licence to carry them.  Those persons have a guarantee from the President that thoses arms will not be looked for; that so long as they are not carried in public he will not allow them to be prosecuted.  The law-abiding citizens who applied for permits, who informed the Chief of Police that they had the weapons and proposed to hold them only for the purposes of defending themselves, have had the weapons taken from them in order that the Chief of Police might <Col N="1045" /> take stock.  I am reluctant to believe that the President desires to do what he consciously believes to be unjust or unreasonable, but it surpasses my comprehension of justice and reason to take arms from law-abiding citizens who were given them to protect themselves, while leaving arms in the hands of men who deny the authority of the State, and who deliberately declare that anyone in politics in this country who does not agree with them is a traitor and deserves a traitor's fate.</P>

      <P>We have heard the most fantastic piece of nonsense put up by the Minister for Justice to-night in defence of the most outrageous series of acts.  He says the Chief Commissioner of Police wanted to take stock.  The country is going to take stock within the next couple of days of the people who put up that excuse. The Chief Commissioner of Police, through the medium of the Minister for Justice, has made a laughing-stock of the Ministry.  It is funny to notice the double-back there is to-night.  There is no doubt that sensation was the object, and sensation in order to get attention diverted from the breakdown of the negotiations which recently were going on through unofficial persons, despite all the President's laughter, and the absence of the man who carried on the negotiations and was rebuffed.  Before I end I will refer to the other negotiations which were carried on prior to Christmas, and to the documents which proceeded from the other side.  There is not the slightest doubt about it but that the Ministry had to get some way out of the difficulty.  Sensation was the object.  It is not such a sensation now, but it was a good &ldquo;three-to-one on&rdquo; chance beforehand.  The Minister for Justice will understand the phrase. The Minister for Justice has already had experience of &ldquo;three-to-one on&rdquo; chances not coming off.  This one has not come off.  It was to be a great sensation&mdash;&ldquo;Arms Collected.  Series of Raids for Arms.  Necessity for Raids for Arms to Prevent Great Outbreak of Force Against the State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-night we are told that under the authority of the Act the Chief Commissioner of Police decided to revoke <Col N="1046" /> the certificates.  Let us see the field he had before him in the way of excuses on which to revoke the certificates. Section 5 of the Act, which is the section under which my particular weapon&mdash;if it could be called a weapon &mdash;was removed from me, says that the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána of the district in which the holder of a firearms certificate resides may, at any time, revoke such certificate, &ldquo;if he is satisfied&rdquo;&mdash;not if he is ordered&mdash;&ldquo;that the holder of such certificate...&rdquo; and then there are four reasons given.  The first is that the holder has no good reason for requiring the firearm to which the certificate relates.  That is the sub-section and the lettered paragraph under which all those revolvers were lifted.  The Chief Commissioner did not ask his superintendent to declare that the person holding the firearm was a person who could not, without danger to the public safety or to the peace, be permitted to have a firearm in his possession.  That is not certified.  That excuse is gone.  He might also have certified, but he did not, that the person was a person declared by the Act to be disentitled to hold a firearms certificate.  He might have declared, but he did not, that where the firearms certificate limits the purpose for which the firearm to which the certificate relates may be used the person is using such firearm for a purpose not authorised by the certificate.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that all those certificates were revoked on the grounds that the superintendent is satisfied that the holders of the certificates had no good reason to require the firearms to which the certificates relate.  That is his excuse.  On the face of that declaration by the superintendent, acting on the instructions of the Chief Commissioner, the Minister now tells us: &ldquo;Oh anybody who likes may apply again.&rdquo;  The same superintendent who has certified that he is satisfied that one man has no good reason for having a gun may to-morrow decide that he has good reason.  That is the fatuitous position the Minister for Justice is put in by this piece of nonsense.  As a preliminary to becoming satisfied that X Y and Z have good reason for holding a <Col N="1047" /> firearms certificate they declare that they have no good reason.  The smile is off the President's face now.  What is the excuse for it?  A casual reference to the use of arms by certain people, not defined for fear there might be a contradiction, and one prize phrase quoted from a paper, and promptly denied by a person who was on the spot.  That is the excuse.  There have been many dud cases put up in this House and outside it.  Notwithstanding the presence of the Attorney-General and his famous exploit in Green Street, I say that this is much worse than the famous Official Secrets case.  The judge delicately adopted the word of counsel in that case, and said that the case was &ldquo;tripe.&rdquo;  What would we apply to this?  I suppose this is cowheel!</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has drawn attention to the contrast.  He did not give the President's words correctly in referring to the contrast.  On the 5th August last year in this House the President was put a question by General Mulcahy: &ldquo;Do we understand that in the meantime the I.R.A. may organise, drill and arm?&rdquo;  That is the question. Here is the answer: &ldquo;The position is this,&rdquo; said the President, &ldquo;provided that there is no attempt to get arms in, we are not going, as far as we can prevent it, to allow arms to come in. As long as there is no attempt to get arms, or as long as there is no attempt <Col N="1048" /> to publicly parade with arms, we are not going to get out after the arms that are in the hands of individuals at the present time.&rdquo;  Mr. Dillon asked &ldquo;Why.&rdquo;  The answer was: &ldquo;For this reason, that it is not in the public interest that it should be done.&rdquo;  On the 5th August of last year it was not in the public interest to get in arms illegally held&mdash;when the President admitted that he knew they were illegally held.  On the 30th July of this year it is in the public interest to get in arms for which certificates are held, arms that are known to the Government. When they are got in we are told it is for a stocktaking.</P>
    <P>It so happens that when I was first called on in relation to this particular incident I did not know what was the purpose of the visit, and I was not given very much information on the initiative of the person who called.  I did ask one or two questions, and one was whether the particular weapon was being removed for the purpose of oiling it, cleaning it, and getting it into better condition.  At that point I was told, &ldquo;Oh no, the gun is being collected.&rdquo;  At that time I said that I had a certificate, and that there was no revocation order.  The next morning I got a revocation order. The superintendent did not inform that particular officer of his who called on me that there was a stocktaking on, because the two or three questions I put went precisely to that point.  I was told that the weapon was being collected.  Certainly if anybody had told me that morning or the next morning that the superintendent had declared he was satisfied I had no good reason for keeping a firearm, in order to get an opportunity two or three days later to say that he was satisfied I had good reason for keeping a firearm, I would have been amazed.  I should have thought that no responsible person would allow himself to be put in such a fantastic position in this House.</P>
    <P>I want to get again to the other side of the picture.  We had details in this House in November last of a scandalous case or rather the scandalous <Col N="1049" /> behaviour of the Attorney-General in relation to a case where a man, who luckily was armed, was raided by armed men.  I refer to the Gavin-McWalter case.  Captain Gavin was raided at night.  A knock came to his door and he was told he had arms that were wanted.  He knew from the sounds around the House that there was a party about the house.  They proceeded to break open his door and he warned them that he would shoot. There was a hand flashing an electric torch.  When the door was partially broken in he fired in the direction of the torch.  Then the people who were raiding the house fled and, according to the local report, there were seven of them.  Some time later he heard moaning outside.  He went out and he found one of the men lying wounded through the chest.  He got a priest and a doctor and eventually got the man taken to hospital.  That man was eventually put on trial by the Attorney-General, who stands for the magnificence of the law in this country. What was the charge?  Was it one of an attempt to commit a felony?  The jury were not allowed to determine that question.  Was there a question of conspiracy to commit murder?  The jury were not allowed to determine that either.  The man caught and shot when he was trying to break into this house with arms was put on trial by the Attorney-General for having a gun illegally in his possession, the same charge that might one of these days be preferred against the ex-Minister for Finance.  There are the circumstances in which the two are going to be equalised.  The Attorney-General defended his action in this House and the statement he made on that day is worth repeating.  Here is his defence on the 2nd November.</P>

      <P>Certainly, it is <Col N="1050" /> worth repeating because this is the majesty of the law personified.  &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Attorney-General, &ldquo;as regards McWalter himself he was so seriously wounded in the attack&rdquo;&mdash;remember this is the would-be assassin&mdash;&ldquo;that he nearly died in hospital.&rdquo;  Certainly the law is coming in for its due.  I think the phrase opens the mind of the Attorney-General in relation to the case.  &ldquo;He was under arrest in hospital.  The moment he was well enough to be arraigned before a court, that the Guards reported that he was well enough, I had him brought before a court.&rdquo;  Now, we are standing up in all our might!  &ldquo;Having regard to the evidence before me and to the whole situation, weighing it up as carefully as I could, and without the slightest sympathy for McWalter&rdquo;&mdash;understood &mdash;&ldquo;I decided that the best and wisest course was to bring him up on a charge for the possession of firearms.&rdquo;  A charge for the possession of firearms! &ldquo;He was speedily dealt with on that charge.  He was sent to prison for six months and, as far as I understand, his six months in prison have been spent between life and death in hospital.&rdquo;  The reference is Volume 44, No. 3, Column 900.</P>

      <P>Let me quote another case.  This is a quotation from the daily Press of March 28th, 1933:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;When I capture a man again I will try him myself and have none of this hullabaloo about it.&rsquo; These were the words of James McDonald, a young farmer, of Newport at Longford, when Mr. Kenny, D.J., sent for trial in custody to the Circuit Court, Charles Hussey, Michael Dowler and William Ganly, on charges of conspiracy and unlawfully assembly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here is his story:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On March 20th he was awakened by noise at his gate and knocking at his door and a voice calling for assistance for a motor car stuck on the road.  Hearing whispering outside, his suspicions were aroused and he loaded a shot-gun and sent his brother out first.  He heard a shout, &lsquo;hands up,&rsquo; and he then rushed out with his gun.  He heard men running away and followed them in his bare feet and fired three shots after them.  He fired at the height of a man and loaded as he ran.  Returning to the house he put on his boots and gave chase on a cycle, carrying his loaded gun.  He came up behind a man carrying a rifle.  The man was travelling at the rate of between a jog and a walk and did not hear witness until he had said &lsquo;drop it.&rsquo;&lsquo;He dropped the rifle,&rsquo; added the witness.  &lsquo;I kept him covered with my gun while I slung his rifle on my shoulder, got on my bicycle and ordered him to run on, which he did.&rsquo; He recognised one of the prisoners (pointing out William Ganly), and ran him on before him and gave him to Sergeant Clogher at Abbeyshrule Barracks.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here is his comment on it:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;The poor little devil was frightened,&rsquo; added the witness, &lsquo;and <Col N="1053" /> told me he was Ganly, and that he was one of the men who came to my house to raid me for two revolvers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another witness was called to give evidence and then the sergeant deposed that Ganly detailed his movements and those of the other three prisoners. Here is a fellow described to be &ldquo;a poor little devil who ran to the barracks in front of the man who captured him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ganly told him that when they went to McDonald's a shot was fired and he returned the fire.  &lsquo;They fired again,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;and he (Ganly) ran through the hedge and the others ran along the road.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And listen to this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ganly added that the rifle he had belonged to the I.R.A., of which he was a member, and that he had it for three months and used it on parade once a week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the type of man who goes up in a cowardly fashion to a man's door in the night and runs away when a shot is fired and then runs to the police barrack and gives himself up.  Guns were not originally given to anybody in the belief that the man who had a gun could always preserve his life.  That was never accepted.  But this was accepted: that you could make the circumstance of having a gun very hot for that type of fellow&mdash;&ldquo;the poor little devil&rdquo; who ran away when a shot was fired.  These types of fellows know now that, while there is stocktaking on, they are safe, and that if they are caught the Attorney-General will be kind enough to bring them up only on the charge of being in possession of a gun without a licence.  Certainly, the majesty of the law has advanced somewhat since the Attorney-General took over office.</P>
    <P>There have been innumerable raids in the country in the last year.  One particular raid was on what was described as a camping-ground for a certain number of the I.R.A.  On that occasion they took over a castle&mdash; week-ending on other people's property. The President is not going to look for the guns in the possession of these people because, forsooth, it is <Col N="1054" /> not in the public interest that he should do so.  But it is in the public interest that people, who applied for arms and only got them on a certificate from a superintendent of police that he was satisfied that they had good reason for having them and, by implication, that they were not going to be a danger to the public and would not be used for unauthorised purposes, are to have their arms taken from them.  It is in the public interest to take the arms from these people, but it is not in the public interest to take the arms from the others!  Is it any wonder that the phrase is used that the Government is not here but outside the House?  Is it any wonder that it is said that the orders are only accepted here and executed here, but that the orders themselves are formulated outside?  There are innumerable examples to show that, if they are not actually following the orders of the people outside, their minds, at any rate, work very closely together and seem to work a week after a certain journal indicates that a particular action is desirable.</P>
    <P>We have had a recent case of an outrage on a member of the Guards &mdash;the riddling of Superintendent Casserley's car in County Louth. That was preceded by a rather interesting little incident.  Certain men were arrested by the same superintendent, or, at least, on his orders, and brought into court.  They refused to recognise the court, were sentenced, and came to Mountjoy.  Some time later they made their appearance again in various towns in County Louth, and the district justice in that county declared that the Government had not released these men contrary to the usual practice, but that their fines had been paid.  That drew from these men the retort that, if the fines had been paid, they had not been paid by them. Furthermore, it drew the following interesting letter, signed by Laurence Grogan, of Drogheda, on the 8th July of this year.  Here are the full facts of the case, according to him:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On May 2nd last we were summoned to attend Drogheda District Court on May 19 on the charge of <Col N="1055" /> posting up the Army Council's appeal for recruits for the Irish Republican Army.  We did not attend the court and, in our absence, we were fined 5/- each, or in default seven days in Mountjoy. Thomas Grogan, who was described as the &lsquo;ringleader&rsquo; by Supt. Casserley, was fined an additional 5/- in the &lsquo;malicious damage&rsquo; charge, and 1/- for &lsquo;assaulting&rsquo; the superintendent, or 14 days in default.  The justice, Mr. Goff, ordered the fines to be paid within one week.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We were arrested on June 26 and conveyed to Mountjoy prison, where I demanded political treatment. We refused to give any particulars to the prison staff save that we were Catholics.  We were removed to the basement.  Next morning we were ordered from our cells for medical inspection.  As this inspection necessitated the removal of all our clothing we refused to submit to such a procedure. We were next asked to work in the garden but we refused and were removed to &lsquo;C&rsquo; Wing.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While in &lsquo;C&rsquo; Wing I was visited by Mr. Oscar Traynor, T.D., one of the visiting justices, who adversely commented on our attitude in refusing particulars asked for by the reception clerk.  He also stated that our imprisonment was embarrassing the Government, and that the people who created the scenes in Drogheda Court would not have done it two years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a stinger!</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I told him that the Government were embarrassing themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is rather humorous and the President should laugh at it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At about 5 p.m. on Tuesday we were told to pack up, and after being handed our property, we were released.  We paid no fines; we did not authorise any person to do so on our behalf, nor have we any knowledge of how or by whom they were paid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, they were a wee bit depressed in their pride and prestige <Col N="1056" /> by all this, and so Superintendent Casserley's car had to be riddled the next evening or a few evenings after. One has not heard of any arrests in connection with that, nor of any raids or visits made upon these men, who had just come out and who were in defiance of all the authority of the President and his Guards.  No action was taken.  One has not heard of any action being taken.  Deputy Traynor had visited them in Mountjoy and told them they were embarrassing the Government and would not have done two years previously what they did in Drogheda.</P>

      <P>I notice that Deputies have very carefully managed to deprive us of any opportunity of replying to the absurd nonsense that we have been hearing up to now.  The Deputy who introduced the motion suggested that we were trying, as the Minister for Justice pointed out, to create a sensation, but this whole performance, if it were possible to create a sensation, is intended exactly for that purpose.  If we were desirous of doing anything such as has been suggested by those who have spoken in support of the motion we would welcome this sort of thing because undoubtedly it tends to create public uneasiness.  Now what is the action to which objection is being taken?  The Minister for Justice pointed out clearly that permits were given to a large number of persons from 1925, and even before 1925.  We, as a Government, and the present head of the Civic Guard, are not satisfied that many people having these permits are entitled in the circumstances of to-day to have them, or that it is in the public interest that they should have them.  The period in which application had to be made for a renewal of these licences happened to come round on the 31st July, and it is suggested that something extraordinary was done in asking people who had got permits to give up their arms.  The giving up of their arms served several useful purposes.  The first purpose was to show that those who had got these permits had the arms under their own effective control&mdash;a very important thing.  The second purpose of the giving up was to get from them a recognition of the fact that if they had a permit they were not entitled to think, as some who refused to give <Col N="1059" /> them up would seem to suggest, that they had these things of right and that they themselves were going to be the judges to determine that.  We are taking action to make certain that if in future anybody is found in public with a gun and using it improperly, it will be certain at any rate that that person will not be able to say that he has it with the permission of the Government.  We are going to see that in the circumstances of the present day people are not going to carry firearms round with them in public.</P>

      <P>There are other countries in the world where such things as that took place.  No Government is capable of completely wiping out things of that sort.  Incidents of that sort are happening all over the world, and there is not a country in the world probably that can show such a clean record against crime as our country can in the last year or so.  The gentlemen on the opposite benches created crime.  We wanted to bring about a change in the situation and we have been doing that consistently. The latest attack was from a gentleman who had been the head of the Civic Guard and who states now that repression only helps to make organisations grow, but when that gentleman was in office and held power he did not act on those principles.  We have by our attitude, and by our understanding of the situation that existed, brought the country to a state of peace and quiet such as it had not known for ten years, but those on the opposite benches are going to see to it that that peace and quiet cannot continue. They have started an organisation the very purpose of which is quite clear. Whom did they put in charge of it? The man who in the past was in charge of the Civic Guards, the man who in the past had it as his first duty to see that the law was obeyed and that the Constitution was obeyed, but now the Constitution is not good enough for him.  The Constitution that he wanted&mdash;the Constitution for which men were put to death if they did not obey it&mdash;is not good enough for him: he must have a dictatorship now. Very well.  We are going to see to it that, if there is any change of democratic rule in this country, it will be by the will of the people.</P>

We have people here who have been talking about the will of the people, who put people to death in the name of the will of the people, and the moment they are out of office&mdash; evidently it was all right as long as the will of the people favoured themselves &mdash;they start to organise and to create forces which, when they think the time is ripe, are going to set the will of the people aside.  Some of them did it before the last Government was out of office.  There was a statement, in an appeal made in the paper which was run by the organisation of the Government of the day, to the effect that the Army were going to be the judges as to whether the people's Government was acting correctly or not.  The same people created distrust then by giving an excuse for the holding of arms by people who said &ldquo;very well; we had them here for ten years, saying they were governing in the name of the people, and when the people are going to put them aside, according to the statement of one of their responsible Ministers&mdash;it was attributed to the Minister for Finance&mdash;we may expect that armed forces will be used to prevent the democratically elected Government from taking office.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That did not happen. Precisely because it did not happen, and because there was no attempt, I said there was one thing that became Cumann na nGaedheal, that was, that there was no person, at any rate, amongst them going to lead a campaign of that sort. In this Government we are pledging ourselves to the people that the trust they have reposed in us will be given back to them, to give to any other people they may think it right to give it to.  That right of the people to choose any Government is going to be defended against everybody, whether it <Col N="1062" /> is from the opposite ranks or from anywhere else.  Speaking on the situation not very long ago, I said that we were anxious to give the greatest amount of liberty possible to everybody, but I said also that there was a certain danger point beyond which we could not allow liberty to go, liberty which became a licence.  We are satisfied that we have approached, in certain respects, that point now, and we intend to take action, and intend to see that the authority of the elected Government of the people is going to be maintained against everybody.  We are certain that every true citizen of this country is going to stand behind the Government in seeing that that is maintained, and that no new dictators from any side are going to be allowed to arise and to act against the people's Government.</P>
      <P>The first step was to take stock, at any rate, of the arms held, or supposed to be held by permission of the Government, and during any interval that may elapse while applications for new permits are being considered&mdash;and any interval that will elapse will be a short one&mdash;adequate protection, so far as the State can give protection, will be given both to property and to the individuals concerned.  We offer no apology whatever for making that stocktaking.  We know the circumstances in which arms were given out in the past.  We know that quite a large number of people, pretending to have permits, did not, in fact, have them.  There are large numbers of arms at the moment in the hands of the supporters of the gentlemen opposite, for which no permits are held by those who have them.  We are determined, as far as we are concerned, that no people will bear arms on this side or on the other side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On either side.  No private armies.  We are going, as far as we can, to see that any people who have arms in this country will have to have them with the express permission of the Government and, if they have not permission, in so far as we can get them, they will not be allowed to have the arms.  I am not sorry this debate was called. This was not intended from our side, at any rate, to create any sensation. We are not in co-operation, as the gentlemen on the opposite benches are, with General O'Duffy.  If any sensations have been sought to be created I would say it is that gentleman has sought to create the sensation. If you have forces that follow army nomenclature on thé one hand, and an army organisation on the other hand, the Government are determined to see to it that armies of that sort, side by side, each fearing the other, each using whatever the other does, are not going to be permitted to continue. We are confident that in ending that situation as quickly as we can, we will have the support of all right-minded citizens.  As a Government we are asking them to-night to stand behind the present Government.  I say to the young men on either side, who are sought to be attracted to movements of that sort, that what is going to be done with them, and what is being done with them, is to try to induce them to go into two forces which will ultimately mean civil war in this country.  Instead of trying to foment <Col N="1064" /> a situation of that sort and to make it more difficult, we want to concentrate the attention of the people on other matters.  We have serious economic questions to deal with.  There is no doubt whatever about that. Other countries have to deal with them.  We have seen that a World Conference in London failed recently.  The one thing to be learned from that conference is that nations will have to solve, internally for the most part, their own economic problems.  People who create uneasiness and uncertainty at the present time are going to make it more difficult to do that.  I would say that that is the object of certain of them, to make the question of dealing with the present situation more difficult in our external relations, and more difficult internally for us.  When this A.C.A. was first established over a year ago, one of the things said by those who were at Ottawa at that time was: &ldquo;See that; we will not have much trouble in dealing with you once that develops.&rdquo;  That was quite sufficient to show the mentality.</P>

      <P>This morning when I was informed that the Opposition was putting down this question, which was first directed to me, I said that I was not going to answer it, that it was one for the Minister for Justice.  I said that there was a broader question <Col N="1065" /> behind this, and suggested that the movers of the motion should make it clear that there was a broader question, when I would answer it and make any statement that was required.</P>

      <P>May I ask a question? We all know what the President thinks of the A.C.A.  I think it would be of great public importance if the President would tell the House and the young people of this country what he thinks of the I.R.A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have more than once indicated that the Irish Volunteers were formed 20 years ago and their present existence was a continuing one.  Our attitude was that as time went on and as it was quite clear that many of the objects for which they were formed were being attained by action such as is being taken by this House, the reason for the I.R.A. would disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is your present attitude towards them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>My present attitude is that the moment that the Oath was removed, and it was possible for all sections of the people to be freely represented in this House, there was no excuse for anybody trying to use force or arming for the purpose of securing national freedom.  I have said more than once, I indicated quite clearly in public, that it was my view that arms in this present situation, with the Oath removed and constitutional action possible, could only in the long run lead to the possibility of those arms being used in a civil conflict.  I have said it publicly that if it is the idea to serve the nation as a whole by using them against outside aggression, then these arms would not be necessary so long as you have a Government prepared to do that and it could have all the arms it wanted for that purpose.  They have either to use them behind the Government, in which case arms would not be necessary, or against the Government, in which case arms could not be permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it was simply a question of time until that truth had penetrated <Col N="1066" /> to the minds of all the people in the country, to the minds of the young people and the old people.  It was penetrating very rapidly, so rapidly that we were getting quickly to the position in which we were going to have general acceptance here in Ireland of the position that, as our people were free to elect representatives without any barrier, free to elect any Government they want with any policy they want, Republican or any other&mdash;even the immediate declaration of a Republic&mdash;there was no excuse whatever for the possession of arms.  That is our attitude.</P>

      <P>They did have these objectives in the past.  Because we have a new body starting up, you give life, a new form of life, a new reason. They will naturally say to themselves: &ldquo;Here is a body; they are going to pretend to keep inside the law; they are manoeuvring well inside the law, or trying to do it, and they will be allowed to build themselves up, and the Irish people in a short time may find themselves in a position in which they will have a dictator established here with forces and help even outside this country.&rdquo;  That is the fear that will give rise to a new position in the minds of a number of young people. We want at the very start to make it clear that we are not going, so long as we are a Government, to permit that situation to arise.  I already indicated two definite things.  One is that we are not going to allow parades in uniform in public.  I have said that and we mean to see that is obeyed.</P>

      <P>There will not be parades allowed in public in uniform, because that indicates in the present circumstances a military organisation with a definite objective which we know is hateful to a large section of our people and it would drive a large section of our people to arm themselves in a counter movement. We are not going to have arms.  We are not going, so far as we can do it, to allow public parades in which uniform is worn, and we are not going to allow any guns in public. When I say in public what I mean is this, that under no circumstances are we going to permit people to have guns in public.  What I mean is a public place.</P>
      <P>I said it was not our policy to go raiding.  We wanted to give peace, if we could&mdash;a feeling of peace and security to the people.  That policy has been justified, at any rate in the last one and a half years, during which we have had a greater peace and security in this country than the people have known for ten years.  The people understand it and know our policy was effective.  We think perhaps we will be compelled to depart from it, but if we are it is not because we do not think that in all the circumstances it would have been the best.  We cannot allow two organisations to grow up, each one to be a stimulus and an incentive to the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Galway): I must protest against the way the house was treated in this debate and the trick that has been played on the House is a trick that the President has played often here.  I can call it nothing but a trick. He was asked by the ex-President, the Leader of the Opposition, to explain why the permits, the certificates, which certain citizens in this country held for small arms were withdrawn.  He put <Col N="1068" /> up the Minister for Justice to answer it and give five or six reasons which everybody knew to be unnecessary. Then at the very end he gets up, after allowing the debate to proceed on a certain line, and he gives the real reason.  The more I see of the President the more I despise him, and I think he has made a most despicable speech to-night.  Here is quite obviously the attempt which he has been at for years, and which I think is the mainspring of all his political activities, to put the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or any other organisation in the position that he was in himself for ten years.  His whole attempt has been to try to justify his own past.  He realises the only way he can do it is to pretend that there are other organisations and people in the country who will do as badly as he did and act as undemocratically as he did, if they get the chance.</P>
      <P>He went back to articles in the <i>Irishman</i> of five years ago.  There was some article in Irish as to the functions of the Army and he quoted it as evidence that the previous Government, if they got the chance, would act undemocratically; in other words, would act as he did.  He actually stated that now; at least he said that in the formation of the National Guard there was complete evidence that we who talk so much about law and order and majority rule were ready to do just what the I.R.A. did when they were under his control. Much has been revealed here to-night. The real trouble in this country is that every act done by the President is not done with any eye for the good of the country, but is purely an attempt to justify to himself&mdash;I will say it&mdash;his own criminal past.  That is the real trouble.  I will tell him this: &ldquo;You will never put us in the same position as you and your Government were in.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the people declared against us &mdash;who can gainsay me?&mdash;we handed you over a disciplined Army.  When the people declared against us we handed you over a disciplined Gárda and a disciplined Army.  When the people declared against us we walked out of our offices.  We were always <Col N="1069" /> democrats.  We acted in the same way as a Government with 100 years' tradition behind it would act.  Everybody remembers that at that time there were suggestions in the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash; the kept Press that is now financed out of the pockets of the taxpayers&mdash;about mutiny.  I remember immediately after the general election in 1932 there were reports that there was going to be mutiny in the Army.  In that paper from day to day there were all sorts of scares.  What was the idea?  The idea was that we, if we got the chance&mdash;the President is still insisting on it&mdash;we would commit the monstrous national crimes that he and his Party committed.</P>
    <P>This matter should have been debated quietly and dispassionately, but the President will not allow that. Now he has his latest scare, the National Guard.  They are the same body, we are told, as the I.R.A.  Who are the I.R.A.?  They are the body who admittedly committed murder after murder in this country for ten years.  Is not that the truth?  They have admitted it.  Is there a man on the Fianna Fáil side who can contradict that?  Time and time again after these murders, the I.R.A. were justified by the man who is now talking of democratic rule.  I remember after these murders that Deputy de Valera as he then was, the man who is now President of the Executive Council, got up here in the Dáil, and said that after all, the murderers had the same authority or much the same authority as we claimed to have.  When we were debating a particularly foul murder committed by the I.R.A., the man who is now talking of democratic rule and of law and order, the man who is now preparing to take away the guns from all law abiding persons, used the phrase that we were in the same position as the murderers.  What was that but an invitation to those men to shoot again?  This is the man who has the impudence now to get up and talk about democratic rule, and about democracy and about his sham and insincere patriotism and nationality. This is the man who is taking the guns out of the hands of men who are loyal to the State.  And that is done in order <Col N="1070" /> to soil the National Guard.  Watch his statement&mdash;&ldquo;they are acting within the law at the moment.&rdquo;  But he is afraid of what they might do with foreign help.  Mind you, that will encourage the people who are opposed to this State to use their guns and to use them on the people they now know have no guns with which to protect themselves.  I wonder will the President advert to that in the event of another murder by the I.R.A.?</P>
    <P>The National Guard, he tells us, are acting within the law at the moment but this meticulous lover of democracy and the Constitution says they may go outside it.  They may want a dictatorship. I think the President, a short time ago, was going for a dictatorship. He was going for a dictatorship until he got his first knock at the Dublin and Cork elections.  I remember his speeches before the elections.  The Dáil was no use.  It should be shut up for five years.  It only led to waste of time and money.  After the Dublin and Cork elections he was back with a jump.  Now he is against dictatorships but he is afraid that somebody else may steal a march on him, and thus do what he had intended.</P>
    <P>What is behind this envenomed attack on General O'Duffy, and this charge against us that we are in league with the National Guard in any way?  Is the National Guard an illegal organisation or an illegal assembly?  If it is, in what way has it broken the law?  Are any of its objects illegal?  What right has the President to charge any assembly with being an illegal organisation or illegal assembly when it has not broken the law?  Are the objects of the National Guard illegal?  Is the National Guard an illegal organisation or assembly?  It is no answer to say that individuals in the National Guard are breaking the law.  Individuals in the St. Vincent de Paul Society may break the law or have arms illegally.  Does that make the society illegal?  Is the National Guard armed?  And this is the organisation that is being compared with the I.R.A.  It is now announced by the President that this organisation is a rival to the I.R.A. and that <Col N="1071" /> in fact this organisation will have the effect of making the I.R.A. grow and <i>vice versa</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that the President is afraid that he is losing the country politically. The President has rather an exaggerated idea of the political importance to which the National Guard has developed.  When the President is out for some political and Party object no one can dress it up in such a veneer of patriotism as he can.  He got up here and thumped the desk. But he is never more insincere and never more a pettifogger than when he thumps the desk.  I have known him for the last ten years and I have seen him under all circumstances.  I do not give the snap of a finger for his democracy or his nationality.  I think there is more real nationality and democracy in General O'Duffy's little finger than in his whole body. The National Guard will go on as a constitutional organisation in spite of him.  Any attempt that the President makes to mix them up and to try and place the National Guard and the I.R.A. in the same position will fail in the hearts of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attempt to do that very thing has been revealed as the real object behind these raids.  In trying to do this he is wasting his time.  The organisation is a democratic organisation. <Col N="1072" /> This petty trick, this puny little trick of the Minister for Justice and the President and the Commissioner of the Gárda to try to create a scare and to create some feeling against the National Guard will not work.  This raid for arms in the case of all the law-abiding people will not work to create a scare against the National Guard.  Make no mistake about that. It will not work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad that this debate occurred.  Until the President stood up I was wondering what the effect of it would be.  The country was genuinely perturbed as to the reason for these raids.  They were genuinely wondering why they occurred.  If it were left to the speech of the Minister for Justice they would be wondering still, because nobody believed it for a moment.  But we know it now. According to the President's speech, stripped of its fustian and humbug and all that insincere patriotism with which he dresses his arguments, these raids for arms all over the country, regardless of consequences, were for the purpose of persuading the people that the National Guard was an organisation similar to the I.R.A.  It will not work. You will not bring off that thing now. You are beginning to be found out.</P>
