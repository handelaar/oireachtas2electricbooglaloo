      <P>I maintain that a great necessity exists for an increased bounty.

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Price of Porkers.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether in view of the difference in the price paid to farmers in the Saorstát for porkers as compared with the price paid in Northern Ireland, and of the retail price charged for pork in the Saorstát and also of the fact that foreign bacon is virtually excluded by reason of the tariffs on pig meats and pig products, he will take steps to ensure that the price paid to farmers for porkers in the Saorstát shall be as high as the price paid in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The quantity of pig meat consumed as fresh pork in Saorstát Eireann is too small to have any appreciable effect on the price of pigs. The price paid for dead pigs for bacon curing is, approximately, equal to that paid for similar pigs in Northern Ireland, having regard to the British 30 per cent. special duty on Saorstát pork and to the freight charges and other expenses incidental to purchases of pork at markets more distant from curing establishments.  As regards live pigs bought for curing, the Deputy should be aware that the price of bacon in Saorstát Eireann is closely related to the price received for the surplus bacon exported and that that price is again reflected in the price paid for live pigs.  Moreover, in view of the fact that but a small proportion of the total bacon manufactured is exported and <Col N="1476" /> that the bounty is paid on exports only, the effect of the bounty when spread over all the pigs purchased for curing is relatively slight.  Taking all circumstances into consideration I am satisfied that the price paid for live pigs is reasonably related to the price of bacon in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>

The man is, in fact, the hirer of the lorry until the purchase is completed by the payment of the last instalment.

      <P>I submit that to be talking of a licensed owner has no meaning at all.  The point made by Deputy Thrift is that under the law at present it appears that the person who purchases a lorry on the hire-purchase system is not the owner of the lorry. He is a bailee until he has paid the last instalment.  In these circumstances is the bailee of a lorry free to operate and carry his own merchandise? I do not think the Minister knows.  He ought to try and find out.</P>

      <P>I am not responsible for what the Deputy thinks.  I am trying to explain.  If he has not the intelligence to understand, I cannot help it.  The fact is that if a person is driving a lorry, if he is entitled to do it, he must be the registered owner; his name must appear on the registration book.  If it appears on the registration book he does not require a licence.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to look into this.  Legally it is doubtful if the person holding a lorry under these terms, the virtual owner if you like, can subscribe himself as the owner of the lorry.  To introduce the term &ldquo;registered owner&rdquo; is simply bringing in a new word which is not in the Bill.  I ask the Minister to inquire into the matter, because I do not believe he wants such a person to have a licence any more than I do.</P>

It is not usual on a definition section to have a debate on an amendment of that nature.  The question is whether a shipping company complying with certain conditions is an existing carrier or not.  There are two key amendments to that, Nos. 31 and 36. <Col N="1488" /> If the advancement made by the Minister is considered satisfactory as meeting the points raised in the other amendments, it might be taken now.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I shall briefly explain what the purpose is and we can dispose of it.  The Bill, as originally drafted, conferred upon shipping companies the same right in respect to the operation of roads services as upon railway companies and tram companies.  On reconsideration, and as a result of representations <Col N="1489" /> made, we came to the conclusion that it was not essential to our purpose that they should have precisely that right.  Consequently, it is proposed to amend the Bill in a manner which will enable us to give a licence to shipping companies to operate road services where it is desirable that they should be allowed to do so.  It will be quite obvious that there may be, and probably will be, circumstances under which it will be desirable that shipping companies should operate road services.  They will not, however, have that statutory secured right to operate road services that railway companies and tramway companies will have.  If, however, they are existing carriers, as quite a number of them are, they will be statutorily entitled to a licence as an existing carrier, the same as any other existing carrier, but that licence cannot be compulsorily acquired by a railway company or tramway company, as the licence of another existing carrier might be.  Similarly, if after the appointed day a licence for a new service is issued to a shipping company, that service cannot be compulsorily acquired under the Act. The position will be, therefore, that instead of shipping companies having precisely the same right to run road services as railway and tram companies, they will be merely entitled to apply and get a licence in respect of a new service, although secured in their right to maintain an existing service, and whether they get a licence in respect of an existing service or a new service their service cannot be compulsorily acquired.  I do not think that an elaborate explanation is necessary.  The difference, so far as shipping companies are concerned, is not likely to be considerable.  I mean, in so far as existing shipping companies operating road services at the moment are concerned, there will be no change.  But, if we were to maintain the Bill as originally drafted, circumstances might arise in the future which might be regarded as undesirable.  In the new form, the Bill is, I think, eminently satisfactory.  It secures the rights of the shipping companies and also <Col N="1490" /> permits of the situation being brought subject to control if, at any time, it is considered necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if, in connection with a shipping company applying for a permit for a new service, it is intended that they be in any way restricted in regard to tonnage in the same way as existing carriers who have not any statutory rights at the present moment are intended to be restricted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The position will be that if it is considered desirable that a shipping company be allowed to operate a road service, then there will be no limitation upon the liberty which is given to it, except such limitation as is considered generally desirable in the public interest.  For example, a shipping company running a road service to a small port in the West might not be allowed to run a road service all over Ireland, but where it is desirable that it should have a road service it will be allowed.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to delete all words after the word &ldquo;on,&rdquo; page 4, line 10, to and including the figures &ldquo;1933,&rdquo; line 11, and substitute the words &ldquo;continuously during the whole of the twelve months immediately prior to the 8th day of February, 1933.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment would be that an existing carrier shall, within the meaning of the Bill, be a person who has engaged in the road transport business continuously for a period of twelve months preceding the introduction of this measure.  This would tend to bring the Bill into line with Section 11 of the Transport Act, 1932.  It is surely an eminently reasonable proposition, and will be justified by subsequent <Col N="1491" /> sections where we find that an employee is asked to have five years' continuous service before he is entitled to compensation for the loss of his job; yet it is proposed here that the carrying company or individual who has been in business for even one day between the periods set out is entitled to qualify for a licence, and such compensation will be given as his business plus the licence will warrant.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is particularly tender-hearted in regard to these people.  They must have known that there was a certain element of risk in engaging in this business, as transport legislation had been long overdue, and they must have been conscious of the risk they were running.  The Minister himself speaking on this matter on one occasion said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think there is very little comparison between the two.  The railways have fixed assets.  They have the lines, the stations, etc., whereas the omnibus companies own only omnibuses.  These have a limited life, and I believe very little hardship would be imposed on anybody if it were enacted that after a particular date, let it be one year or eighteen months ahead, the sole rights of running public services on the roads would be vested in that transport board, the establishment of which we suggest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yet, in this Bill he proposes to recognise as a vested interest, entitled to a licence and to all the rights of an old-established firm, a concern that may have had only two or three days' existence.  It does not take a very wide stretch of the imagination to see that these people ought to have given attention to this matter.  I suggest that in all fairness it would be only reasonable to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that amendments Nos. 6 and 7 have really the same aim in view.  After having heard the speech of Deputy Keyes I am satisfied that they have an entirely opposite aim.  The effect of No. 6 would be, as it were, to increase the <Col N="1492" /> number of persons who might apply for licences as existing carriers.  The purpose of No. 7 is definitely to decrease the number of persons who can apply for such licences.  The proposal reached me from another quarter that the period stated in the Bill should be increased to the full one year suggested in the amendment in the name of Deputy McGilligan, and I was curious to know the reason behind it.  I am not yet satisfied that there is any sound reason behind it at all.  On the face of it, it would appear to suggest that it is desired to give a right to a licence as an existing carrier, including the right to be compulsorily acquired, to some person who operated a service between the 8th February and the 1st July, and did not operate it since the 1st July or at any time between that date and the 8th February.  If that is the intention then definitely No. 6 must be refused.</P>
      <P>There is a suggestion, however, that people might have engaged in a seasonal carrying trade&mdash;in other words, engaged as carriers in a certain period of the year when some commodity had to be carried&mdash;and who would not engage in the carrying trade again until that period came around at the end of another 12 months.  There is as a perfect analogy in the beet trade. At a certain period of the year people engage in the carrying of beet who do not ordinarily do carrying business at all.  Those people are covered by the proposal in the Bill.  In any case no amendment is necessary to cover them, because the period of the year is well within the period specified.  If there were some seasonal trade carried on between the 9th February and the 1st July, and at no other time of the year, then there would be a case for amendment No. 6, but that has to be shown first.  It has not yet been shown to my satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 7, I think Deputy Keyes' suggestion is based somewhat on a misunderstanding.  A person who merely on one or two occasions carried goods for reward could not, in my opinion, claim to have carried on a road transport business. The carrying on of a road transport <Col N="1493" /> business would involve, in my opinion, the holding themselves out as being available to conduct that business at any time when required.  On the other hand, it is quite clear that there are people who would undoubtedly be victims of injustice if the term &ldquo;continuously&rdquo; is put in the Bill.  Again, I adduce the example of those who engage in the beet carrying business in certain periods of the year.  Those are people who will have some other occupation during the rest of the year and do not carry goods for reward. Those people cannot be described as having carried on business continuously from the 8th February, 1932 to the 8th February, 1933.  Consequently they would be excluded from the Bill and ineligible to engage in this business and would have their livelihood&mdash;in so far as that forms part of their livelihood &mdash;taken from them without compensation. That, I think, would be unjust. Our view was that in so far as road transport is to be made subject to control and handed over to other transport organisations that should be done by a process of acquisition and purchase, and not by a process of elimination either by competition or legislation.</P>
    <P>Consequently, as between the three suggestions&mdash;the one contained in amendment No. 6, the one contained in amendment No. 7, and the one in the Bill&mdash;I am still in favour of the one in the Bill, as it is the fairest to my mind.  It provides a reasonable period in respect of which the road transport business must have been in existence. When we say there &ldquo;at some time during that period&rdquo; we had in mind the necessity of fixing a date for the purpose of determining the magnitude of the business.  A man might have had three or four lorries or tractors operating at one period of the year and not at another, and I think in fairness to him he should be allowed to select the period which would be to his best advantage.  That is the reason that term appears there.  It is quite clear that it is not our intention that anybody who carried goods for reward once or twice during the period should be allowed to get a licence.  I do not think such person could be described <Col N="1494" /> as carrying on a road transport business, consequently the introduction of the term &ldquo;continuously&rdquo; is not necessary to achieve what I gather is Deputy Keyes' purpose.  The extension of the period as suggested by Deputy Keyes is not necessary either.  I do not think there are many people who would be brought under the Bill, or made entitled to procure a licence as an existing carrier in consequence of that extension of time, if the term &ldquo;road transport business&rdquo; is interpreted as I indicate here.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not yet assured me that he has made provision to prevent an individual who has succeeded in purchasing some old scrap lorries from less fortunate persons receiving compensation say, for three lorries when in reality he was entitled to compensation in respect of one.

      <P>First of all, the applicant for a licence must definitely have carried on road transport business during that period.

      <P>The whole object of the Minister's legislation and of his policy&mdash;that is if he still stands for the same policy&mdash;is unification of public road transport services.  The introduction of this amendment, in my opinion, increases, for compensation purposes, the value to people who have during the period stated in the amendment engaged in this business. I heard the Minister refer to the people who engage in the business of carrying beet to the Carlow factory, and I understand he describes that as a seasonal trade.  I do not know everybody who has been carrying beet from my constituency into the Carlow factory.</P>

    <P>All these people have their beet season and in addition to that they are able to fit in other contracts for other people and other business concerns. What we object to is the <Col N="1495" /> number of individuals who have broken-down lorries, who may not have paid the full licence duty for the full period as laid down in the section, and for compensation purposes they will have a false value put upon their property if Deputy Keyes's amendment is not accepted.  The Minister may take it and perhaps he knows it that there are people in the business living from hand to mouth and who have described this Bill, or certain sections of the Bill, as a godsend to drive them out of the business while at the same time helping them to realise something more than a scrap value of their property.  Who is going to pay for the increase as a result of the definition put into this section? The people who will pay are those who want to remain in the industry and who want to carry on the transport services.  But if this definition was not in here in this loose language they would have very little value placed upon their assets.</P>
    <P>Now I do not think this amendment is unfair, in view of the Minister's repeated declarations from 1929 down to a couple of months ago, when he stated that it was the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party when they came into office to unify the transport industry in the country under public ownership. This is not unification either under private management or under public ownership, but at any rate, if it is to be unification on anything on the lines visualised by the Minister in his speech and declarations which he made on behalf of his Party, it should not be unification at the expense of people who have been properly engaged in the business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands me on two points.  The first is the getting of a licence does not entitle anybody to be compulsorily acquired.  He has got to make a case for it and unless there is a good case for it no Ministerial order would be issued for the compulsory acquisition of the business.  If a person was merely speculating or merely applying for a licence and making the case that he carried on a particular business of a particular magnitude in order to get <Col N="1496" /> compensation, he would likely find himself involved in loss because of the absence of the order.  If he does get the order then in default of agreement the arbitrator will fix the amount having regard to the financial loss he had suffered as a result of the order.  I was as anxious as the Deputy to facilitate railway companies in acquiring control of road transport services, but we must not lose sight of essential elements of justice in the matter and people who are conducting these road services which are capable of being acquired have rights which must be secured to them.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that there is another consideration in connection with the exclusion of a person who is conducting a road service of some kind.  It would not merely prevent him from carrying on that business and not merely prevent him from getting compensation for it, but would also exclude any person employed by him from compensation. So that there are other factors which must come into account also.  It seems to me that if we can get a definition which will include all those who are genuinely in the merchandise road carrying business and erring on the generous rather than on the ungenerous side, then we have achieved our purpose.</P>

      <P>I would appeal to Deputies Davin and Keyes to have a little more pity for the unfortunate labouring man.  It is an extraordinary thing that opposition towards any recognition of people whose sole property in the world amounts to an old vehicle worth £60 or £70 comes from the Labour Benches.  It is an extraordinary thing that the chief opposition to these people being recognised or to the prospect of their getting any little compensation for loss of their business comes from the Labour Benches.  It is not what one would expect really from Deputies who profess that their chief interest is in the welfare of the labouring classes.  I understand the chief allegation against these men is that they work too hard, that their hours are too long.  I think that is one of the reasons why this Bill had <Col N="1497" /> to be brought forward.  They were capturing too much of the transport business of the country on that account. It was not their fault if they had to do that.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Labour Deputies not to shut out any of them at all if it is possible to include them.  With regard to the amendments before us at the moment, I would suggest to the Minister that he ought to accept Deputy McGilligan's amendment.</P>

      <P>I have not the slightest interest in that body, and I am not helping any interest whatever.  It is quite conceivable that people owning vehicles would have contracts during the spring months of the year, when you bear in mind that there is a great deal of carrying of such things as seeds and manures during the spring season.  You can imagine one of these carriers having a contract for that period.  Or he might take a contract for the carrying of sand and gravel.  It would be a very great penalty if, having had no prospect of business during the period from July to February he had not registered these lorries, and was thus deprived of the right of using these lorries and was not to get compensation for the loss of his business. I submit the Minister should in fairness, in order that there may be no injustice inflicted on such men, accept the date in Deputy McGilligan's amendment and allow the qualifying clause to operate from 8th February, 1932.</P>

      <P>That is the most interesting reply.  We are dealing now with the question of eligibility for compensation.  Under certain circumstances some of the licensed undertakers can compel the authorised undertakers to acquire them.  Therefore we have a situation in which we are legislating to give the licensed undertakers who are here defined in this section, the right to compel the authorised undertakers to acquire them, without adverting at all to the question of where the authorised undertaker <Col N="1499" /> is going to get the money, not only to acquire them but to compensate their employees.  I think the Labour Party, before they waxed so solicitous, as it appears they are going to wax, for the compensation of those workers employed by licensed undertakings, ought to consider the question of where the money is going to come from, and I think Deputy Moore ought to consider that question also.</P>

      <P>There is an impression that some of us speak for the railway company and I am glad that the Minister has further explained, by the remark which he addressed across the House to Deputy Dillon, that we are not concerned with the railway company as such, but we are concerned, and I think the Minister should be equally concerned, that the business of transport should be run on a proper basis and that those who have been endeavouring to carry on the business on that basis should be protected from having to pay compensation for other people who have not been continuously engaged in the business inflicted on them.  I suggest to Deputy Moore that the short period mentioned in this definition clause makes it possible for people who have broken-down lorries, not in continuous use even for the period stated here, to come in and get a value placed on their property for compensation purposes which could not be placed upon it were it not for this loose definition in this section of the Bill.  The Deputy ridicules and criticises&mdash;he is quite entitled to do it&mdash;the attitude of the Labour Party in turning a certain type of people out of business.  We object to people operating these services who do not carry on their business on Christian lines.  The Deputy apparently is prepared to support the policy of the carrier employed during the summer time, either working himself or employing other people, and who works from dawn to dark.  He is prepared to support that in the public interest.  He is prepared to support these conditions of employment observed by pirating employers of this kind.  That is what the Labour Party is objecting to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the amendment is quite clear, in my opinion.  It aims to make it more difficult for a person who runs only a small transport service to get compensation for the compulsory transfer of his licence.  Deputy Davin is also under a misunderstanding.  If he has been working 16 hours a day, he has <Col N="1503" /> been over-working because he has not fully grasped what the Bill provides. There is no question of putting an exalted value on old crocks of vehicles that may be subject to acquisition and compensation.  The actual equipment need not necessarily be transferred to the railway company acquiring the licence.  If the railway company wishes to terminate a service it applies for a transfer of the licence to itself.  If it gets an order for the compulsory transfer, then the compensation clauses come into operation.  They provide that the former holder of the licence shall be compensated for any pecuniary loss resulting from the transfer; but he may be left with lorries and other vehicles because the acquiring company may not require them.  The fact that he may be left with the lorries will be taken into account by the arbitrator when he is fixing compensation. In certain circumstances that may increase or decrease the compensation.</P>
      <P>The fact is that there cannot be manipulation of the kind that the Deputy suggests for the purpose of making a railway company pay more for a monopoly than it otherwise would. The Deputy asks what is the argument against the amendment.  I submit that before I should be asked to make an argument against the amendment I should first hear an argument in its favour.  The presumption is in favour of the Bill, unless a case for the amendment is made.  The case for the amendment is divided into two parts. One is, should we insist that before a person can be regarded as an existing carrier he should be continuously in the business for a definite period?  In view of the nature of this business, the interpretation of &ldquo;continuously&rdquo; would be a difficult thing.  Apart from that there are people who, because of the locality in which they live or for other reasons, engage in a carrying trade of a seasonal nature and they may be debarred from compensation by reason of the word &ldquo;continuously.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term &ldquo;road transport business&rdquo; involves a business of a particular kind, even though it may be a business for a particular period of the year.  We specify 1st July to 8th February.  We <Col N="1504" /> say that anyone who has been operating a road transport service between these two dates is entitled to be regarded as an existing carrier.  If there is a case for increasing that period we would like to hear it.  The only effect would be to bring within the definition and make entitled to a licence some person operating a road transport business between February and July, but which ceased before July and did not operate any further.  It is undesirable to do that and I do not think it is the intention of either Deputy Davin or Deputy Keyes to do it.  On the whole, I still prefer the Bill as it stands.  It requires that a road transport business must have been carried on during a period of eight months in order to qualify for an application for a licence.</P>

      <P>I thought this amendment would have been tied up by a corresponding amendment to Section 8.  If there were any force in whatever arguments have been advanced for this amendment, they would apply equally to an analogous amendment to Section 8.  The dovetailing of this measure brings this existing carrier definition into importance <Col N="1505" /> in two respects, one is that if you define the dates, if you define existing carrier by the dates in the measure itself, you have to get the dates in Section 8 (2) (b).  There is a correspondence at any rate between them.  I think that it is tied up in certain circumstances with this measure.  This is clearly a restrictive amendment, it is an amendment which shows itself to be restrictive and indifferent to the right of the road vehicle owner, ruthlessly having regard only to the railways, irrespective of and indifferent to what is happening to the road vehicle owner.  If there is a case to be made that you are only to consider an existing carrier who has been consistently in the road carrying business for one year immediately prior to February, 1933, then you allow that person to send in a list of the vehicles that he has continuously employed on the road for the year mentioned and thereby you saddle him with the unladen weight of that number of vehicles.</P>
      <P>Once you hit the owner you, indirectly, hit the employee.  I do not know if that has as yet emerged to the attention of the Deputy, to say that the fewer owners you have who can qualify as existing carriers, then the fewer employees are there under the existing circumstances who could be compensated.  The Minister has asked what argument can be made for February, 1932.  I asked what were the reasons for putting down the 1st of July, 1932, or if it was to get in certain seasonal road carrying occupations. I do not see why the Minister should not go further and take a normal period of a commercial year. It may be that there are people who carry on important seasonal occupations outside the dates in the Bill, and who carry them on in a corresponding season each year.  There is no logical reason, I think, why they should be deprived of getting a road carrier's licence and everything that flows from it.  There is no reason why they should be discriminated against here.  I quite admit that if the period is put back to that point that a great number of people may qualify.</P>

      <P>Yes.  If there is any reason for getting these qualified, then you can give to them what they have in Section 8.  Let us have a statement that the vehicles on the road are to be related to seasons of abnormal carrying and, therefore, the number of vehicles will relate to the vehicles ordinarily in use and not the vehicles in use at peak points.  I suggest that is the proper way to meet it.  But allow everybody who has run a vehicle at any time during the year to qualify for the existing licence.  If there is a period which can be pointed to as an abnormal period then very well.  Of course, if this were a measure that gave any great hope of help to the railway companies, I would not merely refrain from moving such an amendment as I have to the 9th February in order to get a great deal of good done, but I would be quite willing to see a certain amount of harm done as, undoubtedly, it has been done to the road vehicle owner and the employees under this Bill.  We are getting wise to two propositions in this.  We do a considerable amount of harm to the road vehicle owners and their employees and no immediate good to the railway companies.  We are falling between two stools.  The reason I put down the amendment was to find out why that date in February, 1933, was chosen.  The amendment standing in Deputy Keyes' name is going to be a restrictive amendment.  It is going to limit the number of owners who can get a claim established immediately for their property.  The repercussions of that will also fall on a number of employees.</P>

But, in the case of beet, there are people who carry beet and nothing else and who, when the beet season is over, put the lorry in the shed for the next season and do not do carrying business except for that time of the year.  If there is such a trade which comes in between February and July we will put back the date, but if not, it is undesirable to have it put back, because it might bring in somebody who was in the carrying business and went out of it before July, who has not carried on that business between July and February at all.

If we amend the definition section, a consequential amendment would have to be made later.  He will get a licence with a stated lorry capacity.  It would then be open to him to acquire lorries up to that capacity and to resume services in the hope that he would be subsequently acquired by the railway company. The less we have of that the better.  I do not imagine that in such circumstances any Minister would in fact give an order for compulsory acquisition.  Certainly not on the application of the licensee.  He might on the application of the railway company. Unless there is a case for extending the period, a definite case which can be shown and argued, why should we extend it?  Deputy McGilligan says there must be some seasonal trade.  If anybody knows of a seasonal trade of a character which would justify the increasing of the period, I am prepared to increase it, but I am not prepared to do it until a case is shown.  No case has been shown yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister not admitted that the reason for the phrase in the clause we are discussing &ldquo;at some time&rdquo; is because of his fear that there might be people who carried on merely a seasonal trade between the dates mentioned in the Bill.  If he has that fear with regard to six months of the year, is it not irrational to think that there would not be similar reasons for believing that there were people engaged in a seasonal trade during the other six months from February to July?  Why assume, in drafting the Bill, that there may be people in that period between July and February who engage in a seasonal trade, but with regard to the months preceding that, from February to July, there is no ground for thinking that anybody carried on a seasonal business?  Deputies should bear in mind that it is not merely the owner we are to think of in these cases but each vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says there is no ground for thinking that any person used a vehicle during the period between February, 1932, and July, 1932, and did not licence that vehicle afterwards. I think it is inevitable.  If it were possible to take a census I am sure there would be quite a number of cases.  It is almost certain that there would be people with contracts for the conveyance of sand and gravel, for instance, who would have a contract during that period and who, not seeing such a business in front of them for the remainder of the year, did not licence their vehicle after June of last year.  I think the Minister should not ask for such fine proof with regard to that particular period of the year when he is basing his own Bill on the assumption that there is seasonal traffic in the other period of the year and that there are people who would be very seriously affected if he did not provide for their getting a <Col N="1511" /> licence and getting the full value that a licence brings with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take the Minister up on that point of presumption. There is a Bill before the Dáil which contains the date &ldquo;1st July, 1932.&rdquo;  If there is a presumption that that is the correct date, that can be backed by argument and we should hear that argument.  Against that I say there is a presumption in favour of a commercial year as being the period inside which both abnormal and normal traffic will be included.  That presumption should carry and should only be overridden when the Minister shows that inside the earlier period of the year there is abnormal traffic&mdash; traffic which he does not want to exclude.  We have no argument as to that.  In fact, we have had the point put by Deputy Moore in opposition to the Minister.  He takes the particular date&mdash;1st July.  One of the reasons he takes July rather than, say, September, is because between July and September there is a certain traffic which he wants to include for the purpose of counting for the acquisition of an existing licence.  Can he say, having more knowledge of this than anybody else, being more in touch with the people concerned, that there is not similar traffic in the earlier portion of the year?</P>

      <P>Has there been consultation with the people interested in the road vehicles, and have they agreed that that particular period, 1st July to 1st February, is a satisfactory period?  There is a point which Deputy Moore has urged with considerable weight&mdash;that you can get registration <Col N="1512" /> for different periods of the year.  It may be that people have registered in the earlier period and not taken out registration afterwards, but who are in the business to all intents and purposes. I should like to point out that if Deputy Keyes carries this amendment of his he does not achieve what he stated was his object when speaking, because he founded his argument entirely on the number of vehicles in use at a particular time.  He instanced the case of a man who might buy up four or five lorries at scrap value.  If he is continually in the business with one lorry, the Deputy's amendment is then satisfied.</P>
      <P>Then we come to the later section. If he has bought those scrap lorries and used them in the period 1st July, 1932, to 8th February, 1933, he gets his own weight established in the scrap lorries.  The Deputy's amendment does not achieve its purpose.  If his amendment were &ldquo;continuously during the whole of the twelve months immediately prior to the 8th day of February, 1933, carried on business with a certified or established number of lorries he shall be an existing carrier in respect of these lorries&rdquo;, then it might serve a purpose.  If Deputy Keyes' amendment is carried it does not cut out the gentleman who could establish himself as a continuous carrier over the year, but has more lorries, bought as scrap, in the period from 1st July to 8th February.</P>
      <P>I go back again to my own amendment and to the general principle of the whole thing.  Will the Minister not consider between this and Report Stage making inquiries of a precise nature from, say, the federation interested in the road vehicle business, as to whether they can bring before him concrete examples of traffic of a legitimate type which will be cut out if this measure stands?  If the Minister could assure us that, having made those inquiries, he has satisfied himself or secured agreement from the people interested, that the measure does not work any harm, then the House would pass it unanimously.</P>

      <P>The putting into this section of the commercial year or the licensing year would make it much more acceptable than does the wording of the Bill as it now stands.  The Minister bases his whole argument&mdash;if he has used any convincing argument against this amendment&mdash;upon the idea that the acceptance of the amendment will put out somebody who has been engaged in a seasonal carrying business.  He referred to the carrying of beet as a case in point.  Public carriers have been engaged in that seasonal business since 1925 or 1926. The Minister knows perfectly well that, a year ago, when he made his announcements in regard to the proposed transport policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, there were enough lorries licensed in the carrying trade to meet the needs of the trading community. Does the Minister deny that under the <Col N="1514" /> terms of this definition section, as now worded, it will be possible for a person who has not paid his lorry licence for a full year to come in and get a licence as an existing carrier, and in that way alone place some value upon his broken-down lorry, which could not happen if the amendment is accepted?  What seasonal business has been carried on up to a year ago that would affect anybody who has come into the carrying trade inside the past six or twelve months? The amendment covers a full year, and therefore it covers every person engaged even in seasonal carrying business.  Is not that so?</P>

      <P>It will be possible for people to get licences as existing carriers who have not had lorries licensed for 12 months, but they must have had lorries licensed within the 12 months, even if only for three months of the period.  I imagine that with certain carriers it is the practice to licence lorries for particular times of the year when traffic is likely to be in greater volume than at other times, and they should not be debarred from having those lorries brought into the calculation of their standard lorry weight when applying for their licence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That question does not arise in the amendment in my name to Section 6 but we can discuss that when we come to it.  It has nothing to do with the particular question arising under amendment 11 which has relation only to the point of exempted areas.  Assuming the principle of exempted areas is accepted, and in the event of the exempted area clauses remaining in the Bill, then there is a question arising on the amendment in the Deputy's name in relation to Section 6.  In other words, the question of the size of these exempted areas will, of course, entirely depend on what it is intended to operate inside the exempted areas.  If, for instance, a service is licensed which does not operate exclusively in an exempted area, it is not put on a footing with an unlicensed lorry.  Once <Col N="1519" /> it goes inside the exempted area it is a matter of indifference as to whether the area is large or small.  The lorry which is unlicensed does not become a common carrier.  It does not have the conditions about registration attached to it.  Let me assume I am the possessor of a lorry which moves between Dublin and Galway.  I clearly must get a licence for that.  Therefore, I am bound to establish myself as a common carrier for certain classes of goods. Once I go inside the exempted area with that lorry am I going to be free to compete with the unlicensed lorries? Can I then pick and choose my traffic? Can I take traffic because I like it inside that area where I have not established myself as a common carrier?  If so, the question of the exempted area is a matter of importance. My answer to the Deputy's query is that a person who operates outside an exempted area must be licensed in respect of the service he runs both inside and outside the exempted area.</P>
      <P>Of course, we can argue the merits of the case.  In the first place, is it necessary to make a case for exempted areas at all?  We could conceivably delete it from the Bill, and so everybody who carried merchandise by road would have to be licensed and subject to all the conditions which apply to a licensee under this Bill as it stands.  But we definitely considered that it was desirable there should be in relation to certain port towns an exempted area, that is, an area convenient to the towns in respect of which no restrictions would apply; where anybody might carry or deliver goods without being subject to restrictions or under the necessity of getting a licence.  The main purpose behind the Bill is to bring the cartage of merchandise by roads under such a degree of control, that it is possible for the railway company by acquisition to achieve effective monopoly in their areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It can be said about these exempted areas that the traffic that is likely to arise and <Col N="1520" /> terminate in them is traffic which is of no interest to the railways; they do not want it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Including amendment 16 in particular.  It is obvious there are several considerations which apply in relation to certain areas.  In the first instance, take Dublin and Cork. There is the fact that certain classes of goods carried by road which could not be carried otherwise and to attempt to bring it under the regulation and control which we attempt in other areas would be fraught with considerable administrative difficulties and would not be necessary in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall give an illustration first of all of a distribution service.  I do not know to what extent a distribution service, operated as such, is being carried on at the present time but such a service could conceivably be operated. A number of shopkeepers wish to distribute the goods sold in their establishments and have an organisation for that purpose, carrying on that distribution inside a residential area. Such an organisation could conceivably come into existence and there is no reason why we should stop it.  No useful purpose would be served by stopping it.  Secondly, there is the business of carting milk or poultry or garden produce into towns from the area immediately round about them by people who are occasionally carriers for reward or by people who occasionally carry their own or their neighbours' goods in that way.  Again there is no reason why that business should be interfered with.  If it is shown that the introduction of exempted areas does definite damage to the scheme of the Bill or takes from the railways <Col N="1521" /> traffic which the railways should have, or in any other way produces something undesirable, then we are prepared to reconsider our decision to have these exempted areas but that has not been shown.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the towns mentioned in the Bill have regular steamship services.  It seems to me that there is no objection to allowing any person to operate in these towns, in the distribution or collection of traffic for these steamship services within the limited area suggested here without being subject to the limitations imposed by the Bill on licensed carriers.  We are proposing to change the limit of the exempted areas.  In the Bill as it was introduced, any areas included in a radius of 15 miles from the principal post office in the towns enumerated, was an exempted area. It was pointed out that in that provision certain exempted areas overlapped and that, because of the wording of the Bill, it would be possible for a person to carry on a service without a licence in more than one exempted area if the areas did in fact overlap.  We are proposing to change that by reducing the areas in respect of the towns, except the major towns Dublin and Cork.  In these towns we are of opinion that the 15 miles originally proposed is a reasonable distance but in respect of the other towns we are proposing a ten-mile area.</P>
    <P>As I have said, in so far as these proposals affect the railway companies, the railway companies have agreed to them.  On the other hand representations have been made by various harbour authorities throughout the country, that the effect of these limitations will be to prejudice the future prospects of their harbours.  They say that under these Bills the railway companies, having secured a monopoly might and probably would be able to use that monopoly to the detriment of various harbours.</P>
    <P>Consequently it was urged that much larger areas than any that have appeared in the Bill up to the present should be provided for.  In some cases 30 and 35 miles, and in others 40 <Col N="1522" /> miles were suggested.  These suggestions are, in my opinion, based entirely on misunderstandings and fears for which there is no real justification. In the first place, it is clear that the persons most interested in bringing traffic to the ports are naturally the steamship companies using the ports. If the steamship companies feel that their prospects of trade are prejudiced by actions of the railway company then they can apply for, and under certain circumstances must get, a licence to operate a road service themselves.  In fact some of the steamship companies operating through our ports have road services working at the moment.  Any existing carrier who is at the present time serving these port towns with road vehicles is entitled to a licence under the Bill and that licence will not be compulsorily acquired by a railway company unless a Ministerial Order is made to that effect.  Such order will not be made unless it is clear that the public interest is going to be served by the transfer of the licence.  It is quite clear that the public interest will not be served by the transfer of the licence if the trade of that particular port is going to be prejudiced and if the railway company do not propose to institute in relation to that port the service required for it, whether a road service or a rail service, on a scale which the previous traffic would justify.  In the event of the railway company undertaking to provide such a service and failing to do it, then it is possible for the Minister to give a licence to some other operator, a licence which cannot be acquired by the railway company.  He can therefore by Ministerial Order restore the status quo. Therefore it is quite clear that the representations made by the harbour authorities are based on misapprehensions as to the effect the Bill would have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in Tralee, where the Port and Harbours Tribunal upheld that opinion of the harbour authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in the case of Tralee.  Take the case of Tralee port. <Col N="1523" /> If there are persons operating a road transport service from Fenit Harbour, these persons are entitled to a licence under the Bill to continue the service unless and until a Ministerial Order for the compulsory transfer of the licence to the railway company is made.  The Order would not be made at all unless the railway company undertook to provide whatever road services would be required to maintain the port or unless it were clearly shown that the public interest was not going to be prejudiced by the making of the Order.  If the railway company undertake to provide a similar service, to the extent which the traffic justifies and fail to do so, then there is power in the Bill to issue a new licence, a new licence which cannot be acquired by the railway company under any part of the Bill.  The shipping companies operating at a port are entitled to obtain a licence, and this licence when obtained cannot be acquired under the compulsory clause of the Bill.  I would remind the Deputy that there is a railway to Tralee Port, the existence of which is gravely jeopardised by the existence of road competition.  Tralee Harbour Commissioners and other harbour commissioners who have been writing in regard to similar areas should ask themselves what would be the position of the ports if the railways ceased to operate.  They are apprehensive now that ill effects may result to their ports and harbours by a reduction of road services, but they should ask themselves what would happen to their ports and harbours if the rail services ceased.  We have got to face up to the fact that we have too much transport facilities in the country at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both systems cannot be maintained at their present level; either we must reconcile ourselves to reduce considerably the rail services available or the road services available.  We cannot have both.  Both services are working at a loss.  There is not enough traffic to maintain both services at the present time.  In so far as there is traffic, both services can be provided; but if the traffic is not there, our point of view is that in the majority of cases <Col N="1524" /> it is preferable to maintain the railway service rather than the road service. Undoubtedly there will be exception taken to that view-point in quite a number of cases but, particularly in relation to a port, I would say that the maintenance of the railway service is of vital importance.  If the existence of a road service on too great a scale is prejudicing the possibility of maintaining railway services, then the road service should be reduced or controlled. That is the idea behind the limitation of the exempted areas, the narrow limits set out here.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that this matter will be very fully discussed.  There are three important points to be borne in mind:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Should we have exempted areas at all.</P>
    <P>(2)  Should these exempted areas be of the magnitude suggested in amendment 16, and</P>
    <P>(3)  Should we have exempted areas of much greater magnitude.</P>
    <P>If we decide to have exempted areas in respect of all ports of the size suggested for Tralee port, Waterford Harbour or Limerick Harbour, or of the size suggested elsewhere by Deputies, we may as well tear up the Bill altogether, because the various exempted areas would more or less cover the entire country with the exception of a small piece around Athlone, and it would not be worth our while passing a Bill for the sake of a small area around Athlone.</P>
    <P>These are the three points I would like Deputies to consider and, if they have regard to the difficulty of administration and the necessity of limiting transport services in some way so as to have an efficient transport service organised on a proper basis, with various safeguards in the public interest inserted, they will, I think, come to the conclusion that the provisions in this Bill, as they will be amended by the amendments I am suggesting, are the best possible that can be devised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how anybody could properly discuss this merely from the point of distance unless there is brought into the discussion such points as are introduced in amendments 19 and 21, which are in direct contrariety.  I suggest the Minister should add another to his three points.  His three points were: <Col N="1526" /> Should we have exempted areas; are they to be of the size suggested or are they to be of a greater size?  My point is, what conditions are to operate inside these areas?  It is only when you consider such conditions that you begin to inquire if it is of any importance what the size of the area is.  I want to argue on the conditions that are to operate inside the exempted areas.  When I find out the various viewpoints on that subject I will be in a position to make up my mind as to what the size of the area or what the radial distance should be.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he wants an exempted area under any circumstances. He said that it was not necessary to have these exempted areas wiped out, that the railway companies did not want the traffic inside them.  A moment later he put a gloss on that.  He said no one would think of sending a parcel five miles in future by railway.  Probably not, but would they think of sending it by a railway-owned vehicle, and, if so, how is that railway-owned vehicle going to get possession of that traffic?  Surely the whole point is whether they are going to carry that traffic on railway waggons or on road vehicles.  Surely the whole scheme is to license everybody, and thereafter allow the railway company to make application for the transfer to them of the licences and so buy out their rivals on compensation terms.  If that is the basis of the whole measure we have to consider the traffic within these exempted areas.  There is a specified area of 15 miles around Dublin.  Even under the amendment it seems to me that a lorry can run from the Border to Bray, keeping entirely inside exempted areas.</P>

      <P>In which event one would have to get to the coast, avail of a ferry service, and then enter the <Col N="1527" /> exempted area again.  If that is so, then that does away with one argument.  The Minister says that traders are distributing inside these small areas.  Surely the question of the distribution of traders' goods was covered by the amendment passed last week.  The Minister said that there might be a business of the distribution type established inside the area and there was no reason to object to its being established.  Should we throw that into the hands of the railway company, who have road vehicles to spare for this purpose, or else into the hands of the people who will get licences as existing carriers, who will have to become licensed inside these areas?  Why not give it to them?  The only way is to place everybody operating in the exempted area on an equal footing.  What is the situation in the future under the exempted area system?  Take three types of vehicles.  First, we have the vehicles owned by the railway company and licensed because they are going to operate outside a 15 miles area from Dublin, and we will call these common carriers for certain types of stuff.  We have to group the lorries belonging to professional load haulers who get a licence and operate in an existing area and who will, therefore, have to be subject to conditions.  Then we have new entrants into the business. They are to be allowed to go into the 15 mile radius from Dublin subject to no restrictions.  That is the good end of the business which the existing carrier might look to do himself.  Why not allow the carrier one of two things &mdash;that if he comes into a field free from all conditions he should become free himself, that is to license everybody inside the exempted area? From the angle of the existing road carriers I can see no argument that could be used for allowing new people to come into these areas and not subject them to any control whatsoever. Why do it?  I have not heard any arguments, certainly, on the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister envisages a situation in this way, that in these areas that concern certain named portions of the country there are not sufficient <Col N="1528" /> road services in existence at the moment, and if he sees the necessity for new services arising, surely he should make his line of progress thus: that first of all he should give to the railway companies, as existing carriers, the option of carrying under licence in these areas, and if they refuse then give it to some existing carriers not being railway companies or shipping companies.  But why allow new people into these areas?  The scheme of the Bill is to do away with unreasonable competition.  There is no reason why it should be allowed inside these areas.  These are the areas in which most traffic is going to originate. It is very fertile ground so far as existing traffic is concerned.  Why cut that away from the two classes that we are setting out to favour&mdash;the railway companies and the existing road carriers?  There is a case to be made for these, but there is no case to be made for a new company or for an existing man to allow him carry on without competition in a town traffic area free from competition when his rivals are to be subjected to the common carrier conditions.  What is the alternative?  That the man who wants to compete inside these areas has to establish himself for any class of goods that his unrestricted rivals are carrying.  Then and then only has he the right to compete against them. Therefore it is not a fair condition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was elucidating some of the issues involved in these amendments, I was beginning to wonder what was the necessity which arose for the passage of this Bill at all.  The Minister came very near to saying that so far as the Road Transport Bill was concerned, although it is designed as &ldquo;an Act to make further and better provision for the regulation and control of the carriage of passengers, merchandise and mails by road,&rdquo; in fact it really is not going to make better provision in any of these respects except in a limited area where the traffic is not so dense.  So far as other areas are concerned, the Minister proposes to provide for certain exempted areas.  I suggest to the Minister that the term &ldquo;exempted area&rdquo; is a <Col N="1529" /> delightful cuphemism for chaotic conditions. For now the Minister proposes, under amendment 16, to draw 10 or 15 mile circuits around certain parts of the towns and say that within these areas the present chaos, absence of control and absence of regulation can continue, with this difference, that notwithstanding the regulation and control speeches made by the Minister in the past, this kind of chaos is going to continue in the future.  That is the proposition and, presumably, from the speech he has made on these amendments, what we are going to do in this Transport Bill is to exempt big areas from any control or regulation whatever.  We are to have control and regulation where traffic is thinnest, but in the big areas of population, even in areas where there is a considerable volume of traffic, there is going to be the same chaos and want of control or regulation as in the past.  In this Bill, which proposes to make further and better provision for the regulation and control of the carriage of passengers, merchandise and mails by road, we are apparently going to continue the same chaotic conditions.  Apparently the Minister at one stage, when he agreed to the Bill or when the Bill was first drafted, believed that there was need for regulation and control.  But the Minister has come along now with this amendment, which he is to put into the Bill, to have these places totally exempted from the operations of any control or regulation whatever.  I suggest to the Minister that a Bill which provides for so many exempted areas in such an extensive manner as amendment 16 provides is a Bill which is not going to make better and further provision for the regulation and control of traffic or road transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said on the last occasion, and he repeated it to-day, that the case for these exempted areas is that they are distributing centres. Of course they are distributing centres, but transport is a distributing business, and what is more natural than that there should be more distribution in one area than in another? What is the case for allowing the present chaos to continue within ten <Col N="1530" /> miles from Tralee and insist on regulations within ten miles of Kilkenny and Mullingar?  If it is good in Mullingar and good in the case of Kilkenny and Letterkenny, surely it is good within ten miles of Tralee or any of those other areas which the Minister wants to set up as exempted areas. There is need for regulations in the Inishowen peninsula, but there is no need for regulations in the Dingle peninsula!  Why the Minister contends that there may be and ought to be regulations in one portion of the country which is less densely populated than other portions of the country where there are going to be no regulations I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>What is going to happen is, as Deputy McGilligan said, that the whole cream of the traffic in the big areas is going to be at the mercy of persons who are not subject to any control or regulation whatever.  They can do just what they like.  Where the traffic is creamiest there will be no control or regulations whatever.  Yet we are told that a Bill which permits this thing to continue is a Bill for the better regulation and control of road transport!  I suggest to the Minister that there is no case whatever made, notwithstanding the consent of the railway companies, which in this matter is just as unwise as their consent in many other things on occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are beginning to get light, in any case, on what was apparently the only reason for this amendment, as to which the Minister said, not without a flourish, and speaking with emphasis, that the railway companies were agreeable to it.  Of course, they are agreeable to this section, just the same as any man who is owed a hundred pounds would prefer to get ten pounds rather than nothing. The railway companies have agreed to this because the Minister has convinced them that he is going to give them no more.  I am quite sure that no sensible railway directors, looking after their own business, would prefer this, say, to one mile, or to nothing in the matter of exemption.  In any case, the Dáil is not merely a registering machine for agreements arrived at between the Minister and the railway directors.  There is another issue involved, quite apart from the interests <Col N="1533" /> of the railway companies.  The Dáil is asked in all sanity to pass a Bill of this kind providing for the regulation of road transport, with a perfect knowledge that the Bill is not going to provide for the regulation and control of road transport.  Whole areas of the country are going to be exempt. The Dáil should, in considering a Bill of this kind, make up its mind as to what appears to be the reasonable and sensible thing, quite apart from such considerations as transpired in the discussions with the railway directors. The safety of the citizens within these areas demands regulation and control. Any clear vision as to the future development of road transport and the possible complications which are going to arise because of the Minister permitting the present chaos and disorder to continue, demand that there should be regulation and control within these areas.  Anybody who has any knowledge or experience of the tangled condition into which transport has been allowed to degenerate, will agree that an efficient, economic and self-supporting transport system demands that there should be control and regulation, not for the sparsely populated portions of the country, but for the whole country.  The area of the Twenty-Six Counties is already small enough without having twelve exempted areas carved out.  Within the small area of the Twenty-Six Counties we are not even to have regulation and control.  We are only to have them in such portions of the country as are sparsely populated.  In the other portions of the country the same chaos and disorder which the Deputy of other days used to condemn so eloquently, is to be continued under this Bill.  I suggest that there is no case whatever, and least of all in a Bill which professes to be intended to assist the railways, for the creation of twelve separate exempted areas; twelve chaotic areas they should be called, not merely exempted areas, because chaos is going to reign supreme in these areas if the Minister's amendment is carried.  As I said, a small country like this neither wants nor can it, if it is to do its business properly, consent to a provision for the establishment <Col N="1534" /> of twelve exempted areas.  If the amendment is passed it will make an absolute farce of the Bill.  It will make its title a misnomer, and only perpetuate, to the disappointment of many and to the disgrace of the Minister, the transport chaos which has been continued here for so many years past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder why the Labour Party are condemning the Minister's amendment.  Deputy Good had occasion to say here earlier in the day that strange things are often concealed under apparently harmless amendments. I ask Deputies to throw their minds back to the day on which the Minister was introducing these Bills. He said: &ldquo;If this scheme does not work, the next step is nationalisation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He then said: &ldquo;We are going to do our best now to regulate the railways under existing conditions and if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he said no more.  It is manifest to me, and I think it is manifest to any sane man who studies the question of transport reform in this country, that this section turns the whole business into a farce.  The effect of this section will be that the railway companies will struggle along for another couple of years, or perhaps three years and then collapse.  Then the Minister will come back and say: &ldquo;I told you so.  Now can you resist the proposal for nationalisation?&rdquo; And whooping in the van will be by Deputies Norton, Davin and Keyes.  If they had any sense they would be up now declaring that this was a most equitable proposal, a most excellent proposal.  So surely as they succeed in getting this incorporated in the Bill, they will be lighting bonfires to celebrate the nationalisation of the railways and the imposition of a vast added burden on the shoulders of the taxpayers in three or four years, because that provision is calculated to burst the railway companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>It is very probably true. When you have paid as much heed to <Col N="1535" /> the Minister's flourishes as I have you will discover that as well as being an innocent man he is sometimes a devious man.  Everybody knows that two things wrecked the railways here: (1) at the beginning of the War the English railway rates of pay were introduced which the Irish railway companies could never afford and cannot afford at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.  The statement about the beginning of the War is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin can wax as eloquent as he likes when I sit down.  And that, combined with the fact that Ireland is a very thinly populated country, made a burden that is absolutely impossible on the railway company.  The Minister knows that. He must know what an intolerable burden it was on the railway company which serves areas like the Midland of Ireland.  We are to relieve of competition the areas in all the uneconomic parts of the country, but the districts where there is some chance of the railway company collecting revenue that might make the enterprise a paying one are specifically removed from the Bill. Again I say, to Deputy Good particularly, that after one has studied the Demosthenes style of the Minister for Industry and Commerce one does not attach undue importance to the railway companies having accepted this amendment.  The Minister knows that that is nonsense.  They have not accepted the amendment, they would not accept the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They may have thrown a bone to the lion in order to try and <Col N="1536" /> calm him down a bit, but the Minister knows perfectly well and the railwaymen or any other intelligent body of men examining that section know that it has finished the Road Transport Bill as a useful measure.  The Minister's defence we have heard, and there is no need to go into it again.  In my opinion, as Deputy McGilligan pointed out, the amendment which he so gaily pushed through on Friday last covers, and amply covers&mdash;more amply than he at present dreams of&mdash;what he wants to cover in these particular areas. Every person is free to deliver his own goods in any part of the country. Many people will go into illicit transport undertakings all over the country, under this amendment, and the interests of those people are amply guarded.  I was at first completely at a loss to understand the purpose in introducing this.  I would urge on Deputy Davin, even now at the eleventh hour, to take counsel with his leader, and see if his leader does not agree with me that this is a most astute move on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ensure that this whole body of legislation will fall, and that he will get an opportunity of coming in here and nationalising the railways.  The Minister is a rational man.  He is a reckless and imprudent man, but he is rational. He can see an objective, and he is making towards it without any regard for the interests of the people of the country.  It is not the first time he took that course.  He is taking it now, and his objective is to make this legislation fall, and to come back and say: &ldquo;I warned you.  The thing is hopeless. We have to nationalise.&rdquo;  If the Minister leaves that section in the Bill it means that the railway company will derive no worth while benefit from this body of legislation.  They will derive no benefit to make it possible for them to carry on, and in three years he will either have to repeal most of this legislation, or nationalise the railways and dismiss all the railwaymen in the country.</P>

      <P>I am opposing this amendment No. 16 for different reasons &mdash;and perhaps I should say for additional reasons&mdash;to those advanced by <Col N="1537" /> the last two speakers.  I feel, with the Minister, that the railways are an important adjunct to the ports and to shipping in this country, but circumstances may arise&mdash;as they have arisen in relation to the port of Cork&mdash;which might demand special consideration from the Minister and his Department. The Minister suggested in his speech that he had received representations from various public bodies in connection with these exempted areas.

      <P>Another reason for my opposition to this amendment is that, personally, I do not want to inflict any further hardship on the quayside workers and dockers of the City of Cork.  Most of their employment has been taken from them as a result of the tariff policy of the present Government, and I do not want to increase their hardships.  The port of Cork, it is admitted, serves a larger area than that represented in the Minister's amendment.  Unless the figure for the restricted area be increased from 15 to 25 or 30 it will spell ruin, in a very short time, for the port of Cork.</P>

      <P>I would like to reply to some of those points, because it seems to me that a lot of people have got wrong ideas into their heads.  The attitude of Deputy Anthony is really appalling.  If this question is going to be determined upon such considerations as Deputy Anthony put forward the result is incapable of being foreseen. The result is absolutely incapable of being foreseen.  Deputy Anthony thinks the exempted area should be larger than is suggested in the Bill.  He thinks the port of Cork will be ruined if there is not a larger area, and because I am not proposing to make the area larger he is going to abolish it altogether.  That is what he says he is going to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us give the Deputy some lessons in the matter to start with. There is a proposal here, and the proposal is that the traffic for a certain limited area around certain towns should not be subject to the regulations and control which this Bill prescribes. It will be subject to certain control under the Traffic Bill which is going through the Dáil at the moment.  It is not proposed to bring that particular form of transport under the control envisaged by this Bill.  The Deputy said I proposed the inclusion of these areas deliberately in order to wreek the whole Bill and destroy the <Col N="1541" /> railways and ruin transport organisation of the country, so that in two or three years' time I could come and say: &ldquo;I told you that the Bill would be a failure.  I want to nationalise transport in the country.&rdquo;  I am not saying this Bill will be a failure.  On the contrary, I say this Bill is going to improve the transport position in the country and the position of the railway organisations, so I have destroyed the Deputy's theory with that one word.  I did not make the prognosis he said I might.  I am saying quite the contrary, that these Bills are being introduced to improve the position and they will improve the position, but only if they are allowed to pass through this Dáil without the modifications which occurred to the Deputy's peculiar type of commonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now what is the position?  Deputy Norton says there is going to be chaos in respect of certain exempted areas. Why should there be chaos?  What particular type of disorganisation are we trying to rectify at the moment? Is it the disorganisation that exists in these very limited areas?  There is no disorganisation there at all.  The Deputy is completely at sea when he talks about traffic in areas being particularly thin where we propose to control it, and being thick where we do not propose to control it.  The only traffic that is exempted from the regulation is traffic which originates and ends with the exempted areas.  I grant you the greater part of the traffic of merchandise that is to be conveyed in this country has either to be conveyed to or from one of these exempted areas. That is undoubtedly correct, but that traffic is subject to all the control of the Bill.  Long-distance traffic must be licensed under the Bill, and it is only traffic which originates and terminates in the exempted areas that is exempted.  In respect of that traffic it is not only of no importance to the railways, but the railway companies were agreeable and expressed their agreement to me, through their representatives, to the Bill as amended by amendment 16.  I would not have said that if I thought there was any doubt on the matter.  I had a meeting with people who came as representatives of <Col N="1542" /> the railway company, and they suggested the Bill should be amended in the same manner as Deputies Thrift, Good and Dockrell proposed it should be amended, that is, by making the exempted areas, the areas within a radius of five miles from the post office.  I met those representatives and we discussed that matter quite frankly. I am open to conviction on every one of those points.  We discussed every one of the points I mentioned in my previous speech, and I explained the circumstances would seem to me to justify the establishment of exempted areas of the particular size I had in mind.  I indicated, as I had in fact expressed in the Dáil on the Second Reading discussion, that some reduction in some of these areas would have to take place because of the difficulty of the over-lapping of areas, and I intimated that I proposed to amend the Bill in the way amendment No. 16 effects by reducing the radius from fifteen miles to ten in respect of towns except Dublin and Cork.  The representatives of the railway company who were present were quite agreeable to that arrangement, and they were quite satisfied that the matter could be left at that.</P>

I am quite satisfied he said to these people much the same as he has said on several occasions here, and which have been referred to, &ldquo;Either take this Bill or you will get nationalisation.&rdquo;  I suppose he said to the railway directors: &ldquo;Either take the ten miles or you get nothing.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to leave the matter where they left it.  At the general discussion on the amendment suggested by the railway companies this particular proposal was considered.  Those present representing the railway companies expressed themselves as being satisfied with the proposal that I intended to bring before the Dáil.  They may, of course, have had at the backs of their heads that half a loaf is better than no bread, and that this proposal was less unsatisfactory to them than some other proposition, but they did not say so.  Their proposition was that the radius of the exempted area should be reduced to five miles.  I would sooner cut out the exempted areas altogether than have them with a five miles radius.  Such exempted areas would be of no value to anybody, and of no assistance to the railway companies.  In addition the administrative inconvenience would be very great.  In fact, it would be so great that it would be much better to wipe out the exempted areas altogether than to have them with a five mile radius.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the railway companies put forward the proposal for a five mile radius. Does he think that they would put that forward if they had agreed to accept the Minister's ten mile radius?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The companies put forward the proposition that the exempted areas should have a five mile radius.  I met representatives of the railway companies and discussed with them that and other propositions put <Col N="1544" /> forward by them.  I explained to them, as I am now attempting to explain to the Deputy, why I considered that particular amendment should not be accepted.  I said that I would propose the amendment which now appears on the Order Paper as No. 16.  They expressed themselves as being satisfied with that proposition.</P>
      <P>May I repeat again for the Deputy the arguments in support of it?  I think there should be exempted areas.  I think that from an administrative point of view they simplify the carrying out of the Bill.  They do no harm to anyone and inflict no hardship.  They do not deprive the railway companies of any traffic which legitimately they should have.  They facilitate certain types of transport business that we have no particular desire to interfere with&mdash;for which there is no reason to interfere with.  I think, therefore, that if we are going to have exempted areas there must be at least a ten mile radius. Exempted areas of any smaller size would be of no value to anyone.  If, for instance, you were to have an exempted area of five mile radius starting from the G.P.O., Dublin, it would mean cutting through certain parts of the city, leaving one part of the city inside the exempted area, and another part outside of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very much better to wipe out the exempted areas altogether than to have anything of that kind. Arguments for the abolition of the exempted areas might be considered, but I submit that arguments for their maintenance with a five miles radius are not worthy of consideration.  I am putting forward this proposition, not because it was agreed to by the railway companies, but because it is the one I consider should be submitted to the Dáil, and the one that I indicated on Second Reading I was prepared to introduce.  We have also to bear in mind that the local traffic, which is excluded from regulation by the institution of these exempted areas, is of no interest to the railway companies. While it would undoubtedly be feasible, although involving administrative difficulties of considerable magnitude, to subject to licensing all those engaged at the present time <Col N="1545" /> inside the city and town areas in the cartage of merchandise for reward, it is because of those administrative difficulties, plus the fact that no special advantage was going to be conferred on anybody by subjecting these carriers to licensing conditions, that we decided on the exempted areas.</P>
    <P>I am still open to conviction.  I have no special view point on the matter at all except the one I have mentioned. The aim of the Bill is quite clear.  It is to secure that the conditions in this country will, in the future, be better for the railway companies: that they will be able to operate their services on a profitable basis over a period of time which they cannot do at the moment.  The aim of the Bill is not to improve the position of road transport operators, as Deputy McGilligan appeared to think.  We are not setting out to improve their position at all. The main design behind the Bill is to improve the position of the railway companies.  The institution of the exempted areas does not lessen the effectiveness of that policy, and has no particular bearing on it at all.  If the Dáil is of opinion that there is any advantage to be gained by the elimination of the exempted areas then it ought to be shown that the advantages that are going to be conferred on the railway companies by the elimination of the exempted areas are sufficient to outweigh the very great administrative difficulties involved.  As I said earlier, I would much prefer to have the exempted areas abolished altogether than to have them with a five miles radius.</P>
    <P>As to whether they should be maintained or not I am, as I have said, still open to conviction.  Nobody has yet given me any solid reason against them which outweighs the reasons in their favour, namely, the administrative difficulty of bringing subject to control all those engaged in the cartage of merchandise in city areas, plus the fact that there are people in those areas with whose cartage business we do not want to interfere&mdash; business that never was or never will be of interest to the railway companies &mdash;and who may be allowed to carry on without being subject to licence fees or <Col N="1546" /> licensing provisions at all. These are the reasons that actuate us, and until they are shown to have no substance behind them I am prepared to stand by the Bill as amended by the amendments now appearing in my name on the Order Paper.  If the reasons I have given are shown to be without substance, then I am prepared to move for the deletion of the exempted areas entirely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been amazed by the speeches of the Minister this evening in arguing against the proposal for the removal of the exempted areas.  The Minister, in giving due consideration to the arguments for and against a matter of this kind, should consider where his policy, if he has a policy, is leading him.  I want to know definitely from the Minister, before a vote is taken finally on this matter, whether he has finally abandoned his policy of unification under public ownership or under private control. Surely to goodness, if that is still the policy of the Minister, of the Ministry and of the Fianna Fáil Party, it presupposes the licensing, regulation and control of public carriers under the same code.  If unification is the ultimate aim of the Government and the policy of the Minister, why should he place one set of public carriers in a privileged position and place another set of public carriers under strict regulation and control?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know if the Minister's policy is the policy he laid down in December, 1931, when he said: &ldquo;We are in favour of public ownership of transport services, with unified control outside the boundaries of municipalities.  Inside the boundaries of municipalities we are in favour of <Col N="1547" /> the municipal ownership of these services.&rdquo;  Is he going to get to that position more quickly by this policy of exempted areas?  If he still believes in unification and in the municipal ownership of these services within the municipal areas, does he think that this policy will enable him to achieve that aim, as he hopes, within the lifetime of this Dáil?  What reasons of public interest are there for suggesting that one set of public carriers should be placed in a privileged position? Why should one set of carriers be obliged to submit a classification of merchandise to the Railway Tribunal and another set of carriers be allowed, as suggested in the amendment, to operate freely in the areas where most of the traffic is to be carried?  Surely, that is an issue of policy on which the Minister should have some view.  If he is still standing by his own declared policy let him put it into operation by some other means than the means suggested in this amendment.</P>

      <P>Why should one set of public carriers be placed in a privileged position in these areas?  All public carriers should be licensed and should be obliged to operate under the same regulations and restrictions. Surely that is understood by the Minister and was understood by him when he enunciated his policy in December, 1931, and, again, at the second last general election when pleading for votes.  The fact that he is Minister now does not enable him to forget what he said in February, 1932, and it justifies me in reminding him of what he said and stood for in this House.  The suggested amendment is not in accord with the declared policy of the Minister's Party and will not bring us any nearer unification or public ownership.  In fact, it will bring us further away from it.</P>

      <P>What public benefit is going to be conferred on the community by enabling these carriers to operate freely and without control within those areas?  Speaking on the Second Reading of this Bill, I asked the Minister upon what grounds he based his claim to exempt any areas and ascertained that it was on the ground that the 15 mile radius constituted the residential area for the towns and cities mentioned.  Surely 15 miles around Ballina cannot be regarded as the residential area of Ballina or even the reduced mileage of 10, suggested by the Minister.  The Minister hopes by his tariff policy to build up a new town which will bring more people to live around Ballina before the present Government go out of office.  I cannot see any hope of that.</P>

      <P>The members of this Party will oppose and vote against any proposal to exempt any area from the terms of a Bill which aims at the unification of the road transport services of this State.  It would pave the way towards unification, under private ownership or public control, to cut sub-section (2) out of this Bill altogether.  The people who will get the privileged position, if this provision is left in the Bill, are the people, as the Minister knows, who put the railway companies in a semi-bankrupt position.  It was these pirate and, in the past, unlicensed services which stole the cream of the traffic from the railway companies, and left those companies in their present semi-bankrupt position.  The Minister knows perfectly well that carrying companies, unlicensed up to the present, <Col N="1550" /> are in a position to go out from Limerick City and carry butter from the various creameries at uneconomic road rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point, which I am sure is quite understandable even to the Minister, that the uncontrolled operation of carrying companies from the City of Limerick resulted in the railway company being deprived of the cream of the traffic which they heretofore had from outlying areas into the City of Limerick.</P>

If the Minister still believes in his own declared policy&mdash; instead of basing his arguments on the so-called acceptance of this amendment by the railway company&mdash;of aiming at unification and at municipal ownership of these public services within the municipal areas, let him cut this out of the Bill and make the way clearer for the adoption of his own policy within a reasonable time from now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good has challenged the statement made by the Minister that the railway companies had accepted the suggestion in amendment 16.  I was informed that the railway companies would be willing&mdash;although I am not going to be guided by what the railway company is willing to accept&mdash;<Col N="1551" /> to accept a radius of five miles operation within the municipal areas of Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick, disregarding all the other twopence-halfpenny towns that are mentioned in this particular amendment.</P>

      <P>I have not had the pleasure of listening to Deputy Moore on this amendment, and I shall be guided in anything I say in regard to the Deputy by whatever view he may express on the policy outlined in this amendment.  I make the case that if the Minister has any hope that, within the lifetime of his Ministry, the policy of unification or nationalisation will be adopted, the safest course for him to adopt, if he still believes in the policy so often enunciated in this House, is to cut the exempted areas clean out of the Bill and, if he is prepared to challenge a division in favour of cutting out the exempted areas, he may rest assured that I will walk into the division lobby to help him. Whether he does or not it will be necessary to divide the House on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather think that we will never get anywhere in a discussion of this principle unless we can make it a little more concrete than it has been made up to the present.  In that connection, I should like to ask Deputy Davin or Deputy Good whether they are sure that the Great Southern Railways Company would agree to be responsible, <Col N="1552" /> for instance, for all that traffic in food that is necessary for the supply of Dublin's daily food?  That is one of the things they will be up against.  There is a great deal of that market gardening traffic in County Dublin, vegetables, potatoes and so on, carried out by private carriers at present.  Under the Bill, these private carriers are to be eliminated.  The hope of the Minister is that the Bill will eliminate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will excuse me, I want to ask whether, assuming that the Minister's intention is realised, Deputy Good is certain that the Great Southern Company will be glad to have that responsibility&mdash;that they will be glad to have the responsibility of going, at any hour of the morning, to Rush or Lusk to convey the waggon loads of food that are conveyed from these places practically everyday by private carriers?  Is Deputy Good satisfied also that the community there would be content to be in the hands of the Great Southern Company with regard to that?  Of course, the Deputy will at once reply that the Great Southern Company would be subject to fixed rates by the Railway Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>What are we paying the Railway Tribunal for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>As I think we will see later on, the fixing of rates by the Railway Tribunal is largely an illusion.  It would be of such general terms that it will have no practical effect with regard to rural traffic and, particularly, with regard to the traffic I mention.  Bear in mind, I am not expressing any opinion on the matter at all.  I think that there are all sorts of different kinds of traffic that require different consideration in connection with this principle.  For instance, there is the conveyance of the traffic between Dublin and Bray.  The outward traffic there is obviously of quite a different order from the class of traffic I am speaking of and, as a matter of fact, I could not think, if it were being considered separately, of any reason why it should not be in the hands of a public carrying company&mdash;why there should not be steps <Col N="1553" /> taken to give the Great Southern Company a chance of getting control of that traffic&mdash;but it is a very different matter when you come to consider the question of the market gardening traffic I have referred to.  I very much doubt whether the Great Southern Company, if they looked that problem in the face, if they realised the responsibility they would have in regard to the rural traffic from County Dublin, Wicklow and so on&mdash;they would have practically the responsibility of supplying Dublin with food and the responsibility, as I say, of working at all hours of the night and in the early hours of the morning&mdash; would desire to have that responsibility on them and that they would wish, therefore, to see any amendment of the Minister's proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore speaks as if the abolition of these areas would wipe out all independent operators there.  That is not the policy of this elimination at all.  It is simply to bring them under regulation and to leave it to the railway company, if they want this perishable traffic to which Deputy Moore refers, to acquire it under the provisions of the Statute, if and when the railway company can raise the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will hear me for a moment, I will develop my argument.  Deputy Moore spoke of the anxiety which the market gardeners of North County Dublin might feel if they were put into the hands of the railway company.  He spoke of the possible reluctance of the railway company to undertake this highly inconvenient traffic and I gather that what was in his mind was that if we were to do away with the restricted areas, by the doing away with them, we will do away with all independent contractors in those areas and hand the whole thing over to the railway company.  Not at all.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that they do.  I, first of all, wanted to answer Deputy Moore's difficulty, that if the Great Southern Railways Company were asked to carry a head of cabbage into Dublin the whole board of directors would faint.  My reply is that there is no need for them to faint or to get weak at all.  If they want to leave the independent haulers to carry the cabbage in, they can leave them, but, if the independent haulers want to carry the cabbage, it is, presumably, a profitable enterprise, and, if it is a profitable enterprise, presumably, the railway company will want to undertake it and they can do so, as they have power to do so.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £835,314 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha na Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1934, chun Costas an Airm (maraon le Cúltaca an Airm).</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £835,314 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1934, for the cost of the Army (including Army Reserve).</P>
      <P>The Estimate for the Army Vote for the year 1933-34 has been framed on the basis of the following personnel:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Officers, 535; non-commissioned officers, 1,388; privates, 3,962; cadets, 43; nurses, 15; chaplains, 11; class &ldquo;A&rdquo; reservists, 4,700; class &ldquo;B&rdquo; reservists, 3,500; officer reservists, 239; volunteer reserve, 480; Officers' Training Corps, 650.</P>
      <P>Compared with the personnel provided for in the current year's estimate, there is an increase of 16 officers, 400 class &ldquo;A&rdquo; reservists, 19 officer reservisits, 50 cadets of the Officers' Training Corps, and seven cadets for the regular army, and on the other hand, there is a decrease in numbers of 150 other ranks, 400 class &ldquo;B&rdquo; reservists and 284 volunteer reservists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of 16 officers is mainly due to the fact that cadets will be due for commissioning during the financial year.  The increase of 19 officer reservists is due to the necessity for providing for possible retirements and new appointments.  The increase of 50 in the number of cadets for the Officers' Training Corps is attributable to the fact that this unit continues to expand, and that the figure of 650 only just represents its actual strength.  Finally, the increase in the number of cadets <Col N="1556" /> for the Regular Army is due to the fact that we are providing for more new entrants next year than in the current year.</P>
    <P>In regard to the decrease of 150 other ranks, the numbers provided for, though less than that provided for in the current estimate, represent approximately the present strength of the Army, and it is intended to maintain that average throughout the whole year.  As regards the reduction of 400 in the number of Class &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reservists, it is necessary to state that recruitment for this arm of the Service will not be proceeded with during the next financial year.  The decrease in the number of Volunteer Reservists is simply due to the fact that this particular arm of the Reserve has not in past years increased to the extent provided for in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the financial aspect of the Estimate, it will be noticed that there is a nett decrease of £65,144 in the Estimate for 1933-34 as compared with that for the financial year 1932-33. The gross decrease in the Estimate amounts to £91,364, but this is offset by an increase of £25,400.  The decrease is mainly attributable to the following factors:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Reduction in numbers, as for instance, in the case of sub-head &ldquo;A&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>(b)  The lower price level for certain commodities, as for instance in the case of provisions under sub-head &ldquo;K&rdquo; and reduced Cost-of-Living Bonus under sub-head &ldquo;Y.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(c)  The abolition of certain nonessential services such as the expenses incurred in connection with the Constitution Amendment (No. 17) Act, 1931.</P>
    <P>(d)  Closer estimation in numbers and cost in the light of experience, as for instance in the case of Incidental Expenses, Telegrams, Telephones, and expenses in connection with Foreign Horse Shows, etc.</P>
    <P>The increases are attributable to the following factors:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  In the case of the £5,261 under sub-head &ldquo;B&rdquo; it is due to the fact that the basis for the Marriage Allowance Establishment has been <Col N="1557" /> considerably widened so as to allow young married men to be eligible for the allowance.</P>
    <P>(b)  In the case of the £688 under sub-head &ldquo;F&rdquo; it is due to the necessity of replacing reserve stocks and purchasing an X-Ray apparatus in substitution for the one in use at present, which has become obsolete and utterly unserviceable.</P>
    <P>(c)  In the case of sub-head &ldquo;J&rdquo; the increase is due to the necessity of replacing cars which have become worn out, and are no longer serviceable.</P>
    <P>(d)  In the case of sub-head &ldquo;L&rdquo; it is due to the increased use of mechanical transport which is offset considerably by a reduction for conveyance by rail for troops and stores under sub-heads &ldquo;H&rdquo; and &ldquo;I.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(e)  In the case of sub-head &ldquo;N&rdquo; it is due to the need of putting in the field a Reinforced Infantry Brigade during the next collective training period.  In this connection the main increase is due to an item for hireage of horses, which is the most economic manner of putting the Brigade in question in the field.</P>
    <P>(f)  In the case of sub-heads &ldquo;O&rdquo; (£7,204), &ldquo;P&rdquo; (£4,689), and &ldquo;Q&rdquo; (£350), the increase is due to the almost absolute necessity of providing the Army with technical stores, purchase of which in past years has been deferred, but which cannot be deferred any longer if the Army is to function as an efficient instrument of the State.</P>
    <P>(g)  In the case of sub-head &ldquo;S&rdquo; it is due to the necessity of providing certain Minor New Works which have become absolutely necessary for the training of the troops, and in the case of sub-head &ldquo;V&rdquo; (£1,148) to the urgent need of replacing barrack furniture, bedding and utensils, to provide for the comfort of the troops.</P>
    <P>The Army equitation team has continued during the past year its successes abroad.  In this connection it may be well to point out that the cost as shown in the Estimate under sub-head A. 3 is gross, and not nett.  From the figures shown under the sub-head there must be deducted refunds in respect of transport expenses from the <Col N="1558" /> various show committees, and also the prize money won in the different competitions.  In point of fact, the cost of five shows in 1931 was only £1,022, and in 1932 the cost of four was only £621.  Taking into consideration the advertisement which these shows provide for our Irish hunters, it will be seen that the cost is in no way proportionate to the results achieved.  In the various competitions in which our horses took part, at Nice, Rome, Brussels, Olympia, United States, Canada and Berlin, during 1932 they obtained 15 first, eight second, 11 third, 14 fourth, three fifth, seven sixth, two seventh and six eighth places.  In view of these results the actual expenditure involved must be considered as trifling.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Army generally, the health of the troops is good, their discipline is excellent and their training is going ahead as rapidly as possible. It is hoped that during this year the training will assume a more intensive form, and that the Autumn manoeuvres will show good results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has been altogether exhaustive in his introduction of this Estimate.  In the years when the Minister was in opposition, every year when this Estimate was introduced his Party would take the opportunity of attacking the Government and demanding an explanation of their defence policy from the general national point of view.  I think that the Minister himself took part in many of those debates.  I had hoped that now that the Minister has been in office for over a year he might have made up his mind as to what changes from the policy of his predecessors, if possible or if thought necessary, he intended to introduce.  It was definitely stated in this House by the Minister for Finance that it was in the knowledge of the Party now in power that an adequate defence force could be established and maintained for a sum of less than three-quarters of a million pounds.  The sum asked for this year is £1,253,314.  That is after the Minister has had a full year to discover the necessities of the case and see what economies, if any, could be made. <Col N="1559" /> The Minister for Finance who was then Deputy MacEntee, speaking in this House on the 25th October, 1928, Vol 26, col. 978 of the Official Report, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>We believe we can maintain an Army&mdash;an Army adequate to the needs of the country&mdash;for a sum of something less than a million; in fact, for a sum something less than three-quarters of a million&mdash;and we speak on this matter not without the book.</P>
      <P>Now that the Minister has been in power for a year he does not show any inclination to reduce the cost of the Army to the figure mentioned by his colleague, the Minister for Finance. Possibly if the Minister for Finance had his way that reduction would take place.  The Minister and members of his Party in the course of a debate on this Estimate frequently challenged the previous Government as to their intentions in maintaining an Army at all, and as to their policy with regard to the eventual taking over of coastal defence from the British, as provided for in the Treaty.  They taunted the previous Government with the existence of the Treaty ports.  Now that the Fianna Fáil Party is in power one hoped that they would have made up their minds as to their policy with regard to the Treaty ports and coastal defence.  From what the Minister has so far said, we have no information in that respect.</P>
      <P>The Estimate is very little different from the Estimate of last year.  The few changes with regard to the decreases have been drawn attention to by the Minister.  There is one decrease however which perhaps might need some explanation and that is under sub-head C.&mdash;pay of civilians attached to units.  On page 292 we find that there are 350 tradesmen, helpers, etc., and that last year they were paid £54,600 but this year they are only to be paid £52,780.  This results evidently from the cut in the wages of these tradesmen. It is not a very large sum in each case but I presume it is part of the Minister's policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned the expenses of the Equitation team and I am glad he pays a tribute to the officers who have taken part in it, and to the <Col N="1560" /> valuable work they are doing.  It was a very different story a few years ago when members of his Party, and even the Vice-President, ridiculed the Army jumping teams at that time.  I am glad there is a change of heart.  With regard to general stores and warlike stores, I am glad to see that there is an increase, particularly with regard to the aviation section.  That is more than necessary and is, at any rate, an increase which is fully justified.  With regard to warlike stores there is a re-vote of £2,000. There is no mention of such an item in last year's Estimates.  It is a very curious thing to put down in any Estimates, a re-vote for warlike stores when it did not appear last year.  Presumably it refers to some item not previously mentioned or thought of when the Estimates for the Army were introduced last year.  Perhaps it refers to the Russian bear skins, which were made in England, and which were worn by soldiers not with fixed bayonets but with drawn swords, in order to protect the members of the Executive Council from the infuriated people of Dublin on a national holiday.  I do not think that would be a reason for having these unmentionable and unnamed warlike stores.</P>
    <P>There are other items which show a slight increase.  I notice that there is a very considerable decrease with regard to the Army reserve.  When the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill was before this House a few weeks ago I asked the Minister if he had any information as to the provision of technical instruction for members of the Officers Training Corps, as a scheme for that purpose had been devised some years ago, which I was particularly anxious would be revived, so that members of the Officers Training Corps, in particular, would be given an opportunity of becoming familiar with the aviation section of the Army.  The Minister in the course of his reply on other matters forgot to answer my question.  When he is replying now, I would be very glad if he could say whether there is any hope that in the course of the coming year members of the O.T.C. would have an opportunity of learning to fly, and the various technical sides of aerial war- <Col N="1561" /> fare, at any rate in a rudimentary way, during the period of their training in that corps.</P>
    <P>The Vote as a whole is much the same as those introduced by the Minister's predecessor, and the sum asked for is not substantially different.  There is, I am glad to say, a great difference between the sum asked for and the sum which the Minister for Finance stated would be sufficient to carry on the Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against this Vote, as I consider that the huge sum of £1,253,314 for the keeping up of an Army is a waste of public money which this country cannot afford at present. It is an outrageous burden on the taxpayers, when we consider that farmers are groaning under the burden of taxation, to have to pay one and a quarter millions to a pack of ne'er-do-wells-that is what I call them-swanking around our cities and towns with Sam Brown belts and brass buttons.  They are no other use as far as I can see to the State.  Even if there was an invasion threatened in the morning by a foreign country, what would be the use of this Army as an Army of defence?  Why, they would be scrapped up like a lot of mushrooms that grow in a summer's night!  It would be advisable for the Executive Council considerably to reduce this Estimate and to put those men to more useful reproductive work.  There are several ways and means of doing it.  There is a lot of untenanted and unreclaimed land which could be turned to some profitable use for the State if you put these men to cultivate it, and to raise food for the starving and hungry people we have in the Saorstát at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two items in the Estimate to which I should like to call attention.  We have the same old vexatious bonus paid to these highly salaried officials from the Minister down.  I find in this Estimate alone a sum of £15,454 is given in bonuses to those officials.  I say it is an appalling state of affairs to have this Army at such considerable expense to the taxpayers while the unfortunate people are practically down and out owing to the present policy of the <Col N="1562" /> Government.  I think the Minister and the President would be very well advised to scrap the Army for we can no longer afford to keep such a luxury, as these gentlemen are, in the country.  We cannot afford to keep these men here as an ornament to the State.  I have no love for any army, but if I were in a position in the morning I would make every young man in Ireland a soldier of the State by giving him a military training. That would be no expense to the State.  If these men had to undergo three or four hours' training every morning before their breakfasts, I can assure the Minister they would soon lose whatever little anxiety they have to shoulder a rifle or a bag on their backs.  I am sure they would very quickly shun the rifle and the kit.  The Army, I propose, could be under the control of the Government of the country.  By getting a volunteer Army in the country, we could save millions for the unfortunate ratepayers who are groaning under the burden of taxation.  They can no longer afford such a luxury as this Army.  I offer my protest as regards this Estimate.</P>

      <P>There are just one or two questions which I should like to ask the Minister.  I should like to know from him what is the latest development in relation to the munitions factory about which he expressed himself so strongly in the past.  Secondly, I should like to know how far we have advanced in the formation of the National Guard.  I notice that the President stated at Ennis when some ex-Volunteers marched past him, that they did not march as well as in the days gone by. I would like further to say that I am glad that the Minister has paid tribute to the value of the Equitation School.  I trust of course that Deputy Kent is not expressing the views of the Farmers' Party in what he said. For a man who does not want an Army, he travelled a very long road in a short time.  He gave expression to views that even the most extreme militarist would not dare to utter at the moment.  He was a pro-conscriptionist. If he represents the <Col N="1563" /> views of the Farmers' Party on that matter, I would recommend the Minister to take that into account.  It might do some good.</P>

      <P>My views are not in favour of conscription.  I never believed in conscription.  What I wished to commend to the House was this, that every young man in Ireland, just as the young men in Africa and other foreign countries, should get a military training.  It would be of a great service to himself and a great saving of money to the State, but as regards conscripts, conscripts had never, if I might be allowed to use the term, the &ldquo;guts&rdquo; to face an army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points to which I should like to call the Minister's attention.  On page 289 there is a figure of £8,121 for 42 commandants last year.  I think that should be £18,000 odd.  The Minister referred to the hireage rather than to the purchase of horses.  I should like him to develop that point in his concluding remarks.  Like some other speakers who have referred to the Equitation School, I should like also to pay a tribute to the wonderful efficiency of the officers of the Equitation School.  The men and the horses are turned out splendidly.  They are a credit to the country.  They were good horses; they were well ridden, and the results show that they have made their mark.  I think it would be rather a pity that the Army should discontinue the purchase of horses.  After all, at the present moment sales of horses throughout the country are perhaps at a lower ebb than they have been for some years. While the tariff war is on that must be a very considerable drawback to the farmers.  I think an institution like the Army would be better equipped to buy animals of this kind than most other people, and they would thus give the people an opportunity of selling these animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the horses which have taken part in shows in other countries have been very much admired, and I understand some very fancy prices have <Col N="1564" /> been offered for them.  While I can understand that the quality of horses in the Equitation School should be kept at a very high standard, I think it would be no harm when we have a good animal to effect a good sale.  It is an advertisement for the products of the State.  I presume all those animals are sound.  I would much prefer to see a small number of horses sold from the country than to get a fancy price for horses that are not sound.  There is no country in the world that has such a reputation for horses as we have, and with the opportunities there are in the Army for maintaining the stud at a proper number, I would even forego an occasional win in order to get us that advertisement in other countries which the sale of good animals might effect.</P>
    <P>It is also right to say that there is another institution in the Army, namely, the Band, which has earned very great praise from those who have had the privilege of listening to it. While not wishing to detract in any way from the honours which have been won by the Equitation School, it is only right that on an occasion such as this favourable mention should also be made of the Band.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say that in the present circumstances, and in view of the difficulties with which breeders of horses have to contend in selling them, that the Army will continue purchasing for the present year.</P>

      <P>It does not mean that the Army will purchase fewer horses than heretofore.  It simply means that for the manoeuvres this year and the manoeuvres we hope to have in the future it is necessary to have a few extra horses for a couple of months. It is cheaper and it will suit the farmers better if we hire their horses for the payment of a small sum.  They will have the use of the horses for the remainder <Col N="1565" /> of the year; they will have to give them up only for a month or so and they will get a good price for so doing.  The horses will be well cared for in the Army and they will go back better than they came in.  I believe it will suit the Army and the owners of the horses that they should be hired for that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the policy to discontinue the purchase of horses for the Equitation School.  My own view is that the best horses in the country should be got, because they have a better chance of being shown abroad than ordinary horses.  I think it unwise that we should sell the best horses we have, even though we get a good price for them.  We must either win in a jumping competition or not be in it at all.  We cannot afford to go to Germany, America or any other country and put up a bad show.  The ordinary people of a country do not pay much attention to the general good level of the horses if they do not see them bringing in a ribbon now and then.</P>
      <P>It will be admitted that for the smallness of the team quite a number of prizes were got last year.  I read out the list of first and second prizes that the team secured last year.  It shows an increase on previous years and it indicates that the team is going ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin spoke about the National Guard and also about the munition factory.  The position with regard to the munition factory is that for several months Army engineers have been in consultation with civilians who are experts in munition work and they have decided on a plan. Tenders are at the moment being considered in connection with the factory. Of course no expenditure in regard to it will be undertaken until the Dáil votes the cash.  The same thing applies to the Volunteers.  That would be a new departure, and if it comes to a head the Dáil will get an opportunity <Col N="1566" /> of expressing an opinion about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kent says we cannot afford the Army.  My own opinion is that we cannot afford to be without an army at the moment.  We are all peace lovers, but we cannot afford to shut our eyes to the fact that we have to have a defence force in this country and that it should be the best possible that we can produce.  Deputy Esmonde talked about the general defence policy and thought that there was not much change.  There has been a change.  Even the slight changes in the Estimates are based on a plan to get the Army reorganised within five years on the best possible basis, on a systematic basis, so that we can utilise the resources of the country, to the best of our ability, for its defence. We are not looking for a fight with anybody, but we must be prepared to defend the country against aggression, no matter whence that aggression comes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde said the cost of the Army was not reduced.  It has been reduced by about £63,000.  I am sorry it has been.  I think the £63,000 could have been very well spent.  The re-vote in respect of warlike stores is not covering up any sinister plot for British manufactured hats or anything like that.  As a matter of fact, the busbies were manufactured in Ireland.  It is simply a re-vote of money that was not spent last year.  Deputy Esmonde also spoke about aviation and said that members of the Officers' Training Corps should get an opportunity of training in aviation.  That has been done; arrangements are being made for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House reported progress, the Minister, I think, indicated that, having listened to the discussion on the Government amendment, he was prepared to consider the advisability of doing away with these exempted areas altogether. He said that if any cogent reasons were put forward he would be much influenced and that if we could show that the advantage that would accrue to the railway company would effectively counterbalance the administrative difficulties, he would favourably consider the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons I submit to the Minister are these:&mdash;He is at the cross-roads and he should make up his mind to do one thing or the other.  There is a great deal to be said from the point of view of the consuming public whether the ordinary laws of economic competition should operate and, if needs be, wipe out the railway companies altogether and let whoever is able to carry goods at the lowest rates get the transport business into his hands.  There is a great deal to be argued on that side.  On the other <Col N="1568" /> hand, there is a great weight in the argument that the railways are a national asset and that on balance you have got to preserve them.  The Minister is apparently satisfied that that is the right view.  I ask him to pursue that conclusion wholeheartedly, to make up his mind to preserve the railways, and, if it is necessary to preserve them, to recommend that to the Dáil.  The Minister admits that the traffic in the areas mentioned in the Schedule is of value.  He admitted that himself.  So he discharges me from the obligation of showing the special value that the traffic in these areas is to the railway company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to follow the Minister as closely as I can.  I got the impression that he stated categorically that this is a valuable business and that he proposes not to interfere with people who had built up this business within these areas, and wipe them out.  But if the Minister wants me to go into an extensive discourse on the value of these areas, I am reluctant to do it, because I think the thing is perfectly manifest.  After all, look at it this way&mdash;if this traffic was not valuable why is it discharged by private carriers at the present moment?  Why have all these independent haulage contractors emerged if it was not a valuable business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no proposal to confiscate the property of these men or to wipe them out.  What is proposed is that they should be regulated just as the Minister proposes to regulate transport in other departments.  I ask the Minister to throw back his mind to the time before the passenger traffic was regulated in city areas.  The Minister remembers a number of pirate bus companies which made conditions on the road impossible.  I submit to him now, first, from the <Col N="1569" /> point of view of the probability of chaos developing in the goods traffic business within these areas, and, secondly, from the point of view that this is a remunerative and valuable business which will greatly assist the railway companies in providing amenities for the less thickly populated areas in the country that they should be compelled by regulation. The Minister ought to make up his mind that there will be no exemptions from these regulations and that he will adhere to his policy of making unification of transport all over the country possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not advancing at all in the direction that the Deputy has in mind.  I want to have legislation passed through this House so as to make the continuance of the railways possible.  I do not want the railways to be led into a morass and left to sink, and then after some years to have the Minister for Industry and Commerce sailing out and practically pulling them ashore and explaining to the whole country that this was inevitable.  I want to give the railway companies fair play. I would go further in this than even Deputy McGilligan or Deputy Davin. Unless the Minister is prepared to do this, unless he is prepared to do away with these exempted areas, this legislation is going to fail.  I did not hear the Minister make out any case for the exemption of these areas beyond saying that there were administrative difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are exemptions from the general policy of the Bill the obligation rests upon the Minister to give the reason for these exemptions and not upon the person who attacks it. I do not think the Minister has discharged that liability that rests upon him.  The Minister says that administrative difficulties will make this impossible.  If there are administrative difficulties they ought to be overcome. I believe in the opinion of the railway companies, in the opinion of Deputy Davin, who is a railway man, and Deputy McGilligan and <Col N="1570" /> most people who are interested in the matter of traffic in these areas, that the cream of the traffic is in these exempted areas.  I think you have corroborative evidence in the fact that there are any number of companies turning up to get a share of that.  They would not be looking for a share of that traffic if it was not valuable.  It is clear that there is none of this haulage that the railway companies could not do when they take over the business as licence holders under this Bill.  I put it to the Minister that if he really wants to make a success of this railway legislation he will do away with the exempted areas altogether and press forward steadily towards the ideal of the unification of transport in this country without nationalisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the ideas put forward by Deputy Dillon. The Minister has asked for evidence of some reasons of this.  It is perfectly manifest if he wants to consider suggestions of wiping out the exempted areas, evidence can be given to him that that is necessary, apart from the fact that these exempted areas would be injurious to the railway companies if he wants to give effect to the title of the Bill to make further and better provision for the regulation and control of road traffic.  The Bill, from its very title, should be made to operate through the entire country.  And if it is to operate through the entire country it, obviously, ought to be necessary that it should operate at the source and head where there is congestion of both kinds of traffic.  If control is at all necessary, it is in congested areas that it is necessary.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that traffic in these areas is of considerable value.  There is no question of inflicting hardship on any particular persons if they are asked to be subject to the control which this House will decide as being necessary control over the transport of the country in order to have it run under proper lines.  If we are to have special exemptions we are simply catering for the type of carriers who are engaged in their own interests&mdash;that type of carrier who recognises no hours of work, people who in order to eke out a miserable <Col N="1571" /> existence work long hours in competition with firms who are keeping up a standard of wages and conditions of employment in an industry that is second only in this country to agriculture.  I think the Minister is going to create administrative difficulties in creating these areas.  If he does establish those ten miles radii then the free-lance people are entitled to operate inside the ten-mile area. Whose duty will it be to restrict them when they go from one area to another?  When a man comes with his load backward or forward to the creamery who is going to pull him up if he insists on his ten-mile radius?  I suggest it would be a difficult job.  He can do twelve or fifteen miles just as readily.  There you are creating at once an administrative difficulty in pursuance of a purpose which I believe is non-essential and only intended to defeat the best objects of this Bill. There is not very much room for further discussion on this point because the same point was made by all the speakers, that it is necessary to unify the services, and if they are to be properly unified, regularised and controlled it is necessary that that should be done over the entire Saorstát. There is no case whatever to be made for exemption in these areas suggested as there is no hardship to be inflicted upon anybody.  They are all to get a fair crack of the whip by having this regularised control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in one of his voluble moments asked us to put forward any solid argument as to the abolition of this proposal with regard to the exempted areas and then, of course, announced that he had not yet heard any solid argument. When he sets himself up as the test it is very hard to conceive the possibility of passing that.  The Minister was referred to to-night by another speaker as being somewhat in the Demosthenic vein.  Demosthenes had two periods in his life, one when he repaired to a certain beach and exercised with a pebble, when he was faltering and somewhat hesitant, and afterwards when he was very eloquent. The Minister has both <Col N="1572" /> moods.  He has the faltering and hesitant one when not believing in what he says and he gets eloquent and has a burst on something that is generally irrelevant.  From the tone in which he addressed himself to this I do not believe he sees any real force in this business about the exempted areas.  One of the phrases he used in the course of his argument gives me sufficient foundation to urge against it, or in the alternative, amendment 21 standing in my name. In speaking of keeping the area ten miles instead of reducing it to five, the Minister used the phrase: &ldquo;Anything less than a ten-mile radius is of no value to anyone.&rdquo; If there is any meaning in words, the deduction from that is that inside the ten miles there is value to somebody in this traffic. If there is not any value to anybody, why not leave it open to all and sundry, even those who ply outside? Why not add on this little bit?  It would save the Minister the administrative difficulty of paying any attention to anybody inside the exempted area, because once even a licensed lorry crosses that charmed border-the new border-it is free from all conditions.  There clearly is value in this.  The fact that the railway company used every argument with him to make him reduce the fifteen-mile area in some places to a ten-mile area shows that they, at any rate, think that inside the larger area there is something of value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the reconciliation of this conflict between Deputy Good and the Minister of what the railway directors either said or meant, is clear enough. They did prefer amendment 16 to what was in the Bill.  I suggest, if he is going to use that, even as an argument to buttress his own statements with regard to the amendment, that before the Report Stage he should consult them again and find out precisely the answer to this: would they prefer amendment 16 or the complete abolition of the exempted areas?  I am sure he will find they are in agreement with all the speakers other than himself and Deputy Moore on this subject.  The Minister counters the argument used by Deputy Norton, and <Col N="1573" /> I think exaggerated by Deputy Norton, with regard to the chaos that there is going to be inside these areas. He says as to that, that it is not in regard to the traffic that originates in these areas that there is any railway problem.</P>

      <P>Traffic that originates and terminates.  It may not be at the present moment, but is it not going to be a problem in the new circumstances? I think it is a problem at present.  There is, however, going to be a new situation created by the Bill. As Sections 35 to 37 stand, the railway company, at any rate, can apply for the transfer of a licence; that is of an existing carrier who has obtained a licence to operate elsewhere.  The assets are not stated to be transferable. What is the most obvious thing for a person who has an existing carrier's licence when the railway company makes an application and when the Minister accedes to it and transfers the licence?  What is the most obvious thing to do with the lorries which are falling in outside these exempted areas?  Surely they will be rushed into the exempted areas, sold for next to nothing, because they can operate there and they are going to be of some value to the people who can draw them in from outside.  That may be met by later amendments.  I have put one down to try to clarify the issue where they may be taken over and where, probably, it would pay the railway company to take over even badly depreciated assets rather than leave them to be used in the inside areas in the way I suggested.  Surely a new situation will arise when certain people who have made their livelihood up to date on the roads find they are likely to be cut out under the operation of the Bill in future and they make tracks immediately for the nearest exempted area to try to get a bit of business there on traffic originating in and terminating in that area.  I should say there is going to be a situation which may nearly merit Deputy Norton's description of chaos.  I ruled out the <Col N="1574" /> description myself as an exaggeration at the moment, but it may not be so exaggerated as a term in the situation that will arise when the Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>Let me take the argument the Minister has used that anything less than a ten-mile radius is of no value to anybody.  Let me stand on the logical deduction from that, that this ten-mile radius business is of value to someone.  Assuming it is of value, why not allow the other licensed people to avail themselves of it?  Why not let them take it?  If they do not want it they will not take it.  Or alternatively, why not allow everybody inside the exempted areas to operate without a licence?  It saves a lot of administrative difficulties. As far as the administration of the Act is concerned, it means that those in charge can completely and entirely close their eyes to anything that is happening in the exempted areas. Their attention is concentrated, and can be, therefore, used the better on the areas outside.  I do not see why the only people who are to be prohibited from enjoying any part of this traffic are the people whose business you set out not merely to preserve but to enhance-the railway companies in the first instance, and the licensed existing carriers, doing their business in the interior of the country external to these areas, in the second instance.  The Minister asked further, in continuation of a question asked previously, &ldquo;is really the position at the moment due to the operations inside these areas?&rdquo; I say it is in part.  If that argument has any value we can easily reduce it to an absurdity by saying &ldquo;Leave the fifteen miles as it was, in fact, make it twenty miles,&rdquo; because the further you move away from the dense traffic areas the less force there is in any argument that it is hampering the railways.  Of course I see that myself.  I do not believe that the Minister recognises that there is any force in these arguments he used.  He said again, and I think there is an argument to be founded upon it, that he did not prophesy nationalisation as the next move in the railway situation.  I think he did.</P>

      <P>I think the only reservation he put on the whole thing was, if any other measure is ever to be introduced it will be a nationalisation measure.  He faneied himself as a prophet when he said that.  In extension of that argument he said he had the belief that this Bill would do good to the main transport agency of the country.  Will it do any less good if the exempted areas are cut out?  Will it do more good if they are abolished? That is the test I put to him?  The measure is designed to help the chief transport agency of the country.  The Minister has the firm belief that it is going to help them and make them a really good transport agency.  Will it hinder their becoming a really good transport agency if the exempted areas are cut out?  Do you put any further burden on them by allowing them&mdash;not necessarily foreing them&mdash;to take transport inside those areas?  If you simply allow them to operate there, and do not give anybody a preference against them in those areas, will that impede the Minister's desire to put the railway companies into a sound position? Deputy Moore spoke more or less on these points and I want to deal with a few of his arguments in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now turn to another aspect of this matter.  There are amendments put down here to which the Minister alludes.  Deputies Reidy, Bennett, Lynch and O'Sullivan have down amendments enlarging certain named areas, and Deputy Anthony spoke on that point.  Examining the comments that have appeared in the newspapers, to which any of these amendments could be related, I find myself in some difficulty as to what are the reasons behind them.  I think it is clear that there is either of two reasons impelling these amendments.  One is the idea of preventing undue preference being given to one port as against another.  Alternatively, the only reason I can see is the point to which Deputy Moore alluded-I do not know whether he takes a firm stand on it.  He said he was not too sure that the community <Col N="1576" /> yet knew what was going to happen when this measure came into force, and that it would definitely deprive them of certain services to which they had grown accustomed.  It is possible that the people, say, in Cork, are not thinking of undue preference against the port of Cork, but are thinking simply that they have no great belief in the Minister's measure or in the railway company as such, either under this measure or before it, and therefore, they want to have a big area around the City of Cork in which the existing road vehicles will be preserved because they will not be subject to any licensing conditions.  If it is the second reason, I think that the House in the main is against it, because I think there has been agreement that, in the main, they want to put the railways into a better position, and they are prepared to impose certain hardships upon road vehicle owners and users rather than let the railways go down. Therefore, I am going to take it that the argument which is behind those amendments is the argument about the port preference.  There I find myself in considerable difficulty.  There is a section in this measure, Section 13, which is the best endeavour that has been made in this measure to deal with the question of port preference.  Of course, the phraseology of it is peculiar:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No licensee under a merchandise licence, shall, in carrying on the business authorised by such licence, make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to or in favour of any particular person, trade, industry, district or port, nor subject any particular person, trade, industry, district or port to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there is a provision that there may be an appeal to the Railway Tribunal.  That is all right so far as it goes.  I think if that phrase were brought to the attention of the Cork and Waterford people they would probably say that the Railway Tribunal may not operate that section properly, or that it may in fact be impossible to get them what they desire.  We cannot answer that except by saying that we <Col N="1577" /> will do the best we can to give them an impartial tribunal.</P>
    <P>There is another situation which has got to be met.  In fact, I think, what Cork and Waterford want is not that they should be put on equality with other ports, and that undue preference against their port should be prohibited, but that they should be preserved in their present position, which, in my opinion, is one of preference.  I think that is what they want.  If they want that, Section 13 does not meet it.  I do not know if the Minister has considered this particular question&mdash;which is one of the most difficult to meet in the whole matter&mdash;from that angle. The section undoubtedly does not meet that point.  If it is true that Waterford at the moment has a particular preferential situation, Section 13 will immediately destroy that, because the whole object of Section 13 is to put all ports on an equal basis, relative to the surrounding areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may intervene, Waterford's fear is not that they will not get preference.  Waterford's fear is that Waterford will be discriminated against in favour of other ports, by the railway company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Deputy Goulding go a bit further and say that Waterford at the moment has a certain preferential position in certain matters?  I do not think he will, because it would give his case away. Waterford, whatever its position was and however it got it, had that position guaranteed and continued to it under the Railways Act of 1924, and I imagine the Minister set out to preserve the existing position.  I do not think that, on examination, he will find that he has done so.  To that extent, I have some sympathy with the amendments which would seek to enlarge the exempted area-if there is going to be one at all&mdash;around certain ports.  I think that matter had better be dealt with by some better provision than Section 13.  If that were done, I <Col N="1578" /> would be definitely and clearly in favour of either allowing all lorries inside exempted areas, of whatever size, to operate as unlicensed carriers &mdash;to operate as carriers who do not require a licence&mdash;or, alternatively, to wipe out the whole exempted area completely.  If I were put to a choice I would rather have the exempted area completely wiped out.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore raised two points. Deputy Dillon answered him on one, except in regard to a subsidiary argument which was raised.  Deputy Moore seemed to be arguing distinctly, as Deputy Dillon said, that if the exempted areas were abolished the railway company would be forced into the business of carrying foodstuffs around the Dublin area.  Of course they would not be forced into it.  The Minister made a remark on that.  He tried to force Deputy Dillon into the dilemma that the railway company either wanted it or did not want it. Deputy Dillon's answer was: &ldquo;Leave it to them to decide.&rdquo; The second answer I would give is that the railway company might not want to carry certain traffic in certain areas themselves, but they might at the same time desire that whatever company does do that should have to become licensed as a common carrier and should have to describe the goods for which it would become a common carrier.  There would then be something in the neighbourhood of equality as between the two sets of vehicles.  It is illogical and indefensible to allow one group of lorries to operate completely free from control, and make another group subject to conditions once they come inside a certain area.  If the traffic is of any great value the railway company should be allowed to say whether they want it or not.  If they do not want it let the hauler licensed for road hauling business outside the area, but possibly coming inside it, be given the second chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>One has been trying, while the Deputies have been speaking, to picture in one's mind the position of carriers in these 12 new areas. Those are areas two of which are 30 miles in diameter-15 miles radius-and ten of which are 20 miles in diameter.  The two areas of the 30 <Col N="1579" /> miles diameter would mean about 100 miles border, and the other two would mean about 60 miles border, or something over 60 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had some experience, unfortunate experience, of what Border troubles are in this country. In face of that experience which we all deplore, we are going to set up twelve new areas with borders varying from 60 to 100 miles.  Some of us who have experience of transport problems, carriage of goods, etc., will know what trouble will be involved in that particular quarter.  An unlicensed carrier accepts goods that are to be taken six miles from the General Post Office.  He can go in that particular area five miles and he is going to chance his arm for the other mile.  The Minister's Department becomes aware of this.  He calls upon the Minister for Justice to supply sufficient detectives to preserve these areas.  What is that going to involve the State in?  And after all this expense has been incurred, what advantage is going to accrue to the State?  Now let us be practicable. The Minister is a man who considers these problems very carefully as a rule, but I am not so sure whether he has given all the attention to this Bill that would be desirable, but he considers these problems as a rule wonderfully well in view of the circumstances that are evidently attaching to his office.  Has he visualised, or can he tell the House, what advantage business, or if you like, what advantage is the State, as a whole, going to derive from the limitations attached to these particular areas?  I can see tremendous difficulties arising, but to be quite candid with the Minister, I can see practically no advantages on the other side, certainly none that would at all compensate for the difficulties, expense and other troubles involved.  I would really press the Minister seriously to consider the advantages; I have no doubt there are some advantages, which I hope he will put before the House before the debate closes, for the setting up of these particular areas.  I would like to know these advantages and to consider <Col N="1580" /> very carefully whether these advantages are going to outweigh the disadvantages that we all see from the setting up of what I may call these new border problems in connection with the transport of the country.  I hope the Minister will give us that information.  I think the House is entitled to it.  The House, so far as it has expressed its views, may be taken as opposed to the Minister's proposals in the setting up of these areas and we would like to know before a division is called what advantages are to be derived from the setting up of these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the merits of the proposals in the Bill and the amendments which are being suggested from different parts of the House, I think it is necessary once again to clear up certain misconceptions which evidently befog the minds of one or two Deputies who spoke.  I asked that any sound argument that could be advanced for the abolition of exempted areas should be produced so that we could see it, and I said if in fact one solid argument for the abolition of these areas was advanced I was prepared to abolish them.  That is my attitude. Deputy Good asked me what advantages are to be secured by the creation of these areas, and I say the advantages are few.  I will go into the matter in more detail later but my position is this: I can see no disadvantages from their creation.  I see that on the contrary the creation of these areas is not going to prejudice the position of the railway companies or put anybody in a disadvantageous position, but their existence is going to solve a number of administrative problems&mdash;it is going to make the administration of the Bill smoother.  I do not think we are doing anybody harm, we are simplifying administration and we propose to do it.  It is quite clear the positive advantages from the creation of the areas are not very large, and therefore, I am quite willing to abolish the areas if I am shown that any advantage is going to be created by their abolition, <Col N="1581" /> and, so far, I have not been shown that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin spoke about the general policy of the unification of transport, but he did not propose any solid reason for the abolition of the exempted areas.  He did not say the abolition of the exempted areas was going to benefit the railway companies, or was going to make it simpler to operate the policy embodied in these Bills, or was going to smooth the position towards the end that he has in mind in relation to transport in this country.  I mean the attitude he took up was very largely based upon a quotation read from a speech delivered by me some two or three years ago.  Apparently he accepts anything I say as gospel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now Deputy Dillon took a different line altogether.  Deputy Dillon usually speaks with the air of delivering fundamental truths upon every subject to which he addresses himself.  He said if these exempted areas are not abolished all this legislation is going to fail.  That is utter nonsense.  The Deputy did not attempt to develop that theory.  The Deputy's argument was that the one thing necessary to preserve the railways of the country was that they should get the short-distance traffic that originates and ends within 15 miles of Dublin and Cork, or ten miles of any of the other towns mentioned in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I took down the Deputy's words.  He said unless exempted areas are abolished this legislation is going to fail; that the traffic in these areas is the cream of the traffic and we are depriving the railway company of this traffic.  I again repeat that is nonsense.  The traffic in these areas is not the cream of the traffic.  It is so far from being the cream of the traffic that the railway companies told me they are not interested.  In these days nobody is likely to have certain merchandise carried by rail a distance of five or six miles.  That is the Deputy's argument. The railways were built and maintained for the purposes of carrying out long distance haulage and it is long distance haulage that is important to them.</P>

Deputy Keyes apparently had the same idea, although it was clear from what he said that he was confusing this short distance road traffic with the general road position.  He said that if control was necessary at all it was necessary in these areas.  That statement is obviously based on a complete misunderstanding of the position.  It is not the advent of the motor car in these narrow confined areas which has caused any substantial loss to the railway companies, but it is the long distance haulage traffic <Col N="1584" /> that originated in those areas.  It is the loss of that traffic to the railway companies which has produced the present position.  It is in relation to that kind of transport that we are trying to establish the monopoly conditions that we contemplate.  It is not necessary or essential to any scheme that there should be this rigid control of short distance traffic in the towns and the cities, but it is essential, in our opinion, that there should be unified and regulated control of the long distance traffic throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan came down off his fence towards the end of his speech.  From the beginning of the discussion on this amendment it was not quite clear whether the Deputy was going to plump for the abolition of the exempted areas or for his own amendment which is designed to ensure that there would be nobody controlled at all.  If there are to be exempted areas, then the amendment in the names of Deputies Finian Lynch, O'Sullivan and Reidy, is designed to increase their size. Deputy McGilligan took the line that either course would satisfy him; either abolish the exempted areas or release everyone from control within the exempted areas.  In two or three of his speeches he kept balancing on the fence, and then finally came down in favour of the abolition of the exempted areas.  But even Deputy McGilligan, who should have a very intimate knowledge of this problem because of his personal concern with it for a number of years, obviously misunderstands the position.  He certainly misunderstands the purposes of the Bill.  He talked of the peculiar proposal, as he described it, of allowing everybody to operate in the transport business within the exempted areas except the railway companies and licensed carriers.  Of course, that is not the position at all. The Bill does not purport to do that. The Bill permits railway companies and licensed carriers, if they so wish, to operate within the exempted areas, but if they do they will operate subject to the condition of their licences. They will operate as the carriers of <Col N="1585" /> the goods they profess to carry, and be subject to the other conditions that apply under the Bill.</P>
    <P>From what I am going to say Deputies will see that we mean and desire to strengthen the position of the railway companies.  If the Bill goes through in its present form we will have a number of persons licensed to carry goods in any part of the country and others unlicensed but confined in their operations to one or other of the exempted areas.  Now if we abolish the exempted areas all those who are at present carrying merchandise for reward in these cities will apply for a licence.  They will not apply for a licence merely to carry goods within the exempted area but for a licence to carry goods over a substantial part of the Saor-stát. They will become not merely local carriers but competitors of the railway companies in the traffic that is of real importance to the railway companies.  The abolition of the exempted areas is going to have this effect, that it is going to increase considerably the number of road transport operators that the railway companies will have to acquire if they are to secure the monopoly position that we contemplate under the Bill.  There are a number of carriers the bulk of whose business is confined in or about the cities and towns who will be content to confine themselves and their business to these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in which case if the railway companies want to acquire them and to reach the monopoly position that we contemplate under the Bill then they will have to buy these people out not merely in relation to that portion of their service which extends outside the area, but also in relation to that portion of it which is inside the area.  The railway companies in order to get the long distance traffic will have to buy the short distance traffic and lay out more substantial sums.</P>

When we reach that amendment I intend to oppose it.  My reasons for doing so are because we definitely want to offer an inducement to carriers to confine themselves to exempted areas and not to seek long distance traffic.  If we abolish the exempted areas, then there is no such inducement, and these carriers are going to become carriers not merely for the short distance traffic but for the long distance traffic as well.

      <P>Yes, but under the Bill he has got to say this to himself: "I can operate within the exempted areas not as a common carrier but with all the advantages that I have at present, not subject to any conditions imposed under the Bill, and not required to get a licence.  My position is not any worse than it is at present.  If I want to go outside this area, then I have got to become a common carrier, not merely outside but inside the area, subject to all the limitations imposed on a common carrier inside as well as outside the area.&rdquo; A substantial number of these people who find that the bulk of their business is confined to short distance distribution in or <Col N="1587" /> about the towns and the cities, are going to elect to confine themselves entirely to the exempted area, not to go outside it and not apply for a licence.  Consequently, these would be withdrawn, as it were, from competition with the railway companies for the traffic the railway companies want.  I want the Deputy to appreciate that position.  We limit definitely on the long-distance routes the number of competitors with the railway companies and, consequently, the number of companies that will have to be acquired by the railway companies.  If we abolish the exempted areas, we make every carrier in the country apply for a licence.  If he applies for a licence, he is not going to confine himself to a particularly narrow stretch of country; he is going to apply for a licence for the whole of the country, or for a large part of it, and, consequently, set himself up as a competitor with the railway company, which will have to acquire him if the railway company is to get into the position which we desire it to get into.  The same result would follow from the adoption of Deputy McGilligan's amendment to Section 6.  It would induce every carrier in the country to apply for a licence and enter into competition with the railway company.  The net result of that would be that the passage of the Bill would probably worsen rather than improve the position of the railway company immediately and, ultimately, increase considerably the cost of acquiring these competing services, which is a consideration causing considerable worry to Deputy Good and Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>The result would be to increase the cost.  I think I have proved that beyond controversy.  I can assure Deputies that that is what we <Col N="1588" /> contemplate would happen if these exempted areas were abolished.  It seems logical.  I want to mention other considerations in favour of these exempted areas.  We propose that shipping companies may operate road services.  A shipping company is automatically entitled to a licence if operating an existing service.  It may get a licence if it applies for it at any time. The towns mentioned in the Bill are towns from which there are regular shipping services.  In respect of these towns, is there any special reason why we should give the exclusive right of carrying goods in or out of them to services operated by shipping companies? In regard to short distance traffic, might we not allow independent operators to carry on without control? That is another consideration which should be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consider the problem which might arise in Dublin?  Assume I am a carrier in or around Dublin; assume there are no exempted areas and that an application is made simultaneously by the Great Northern Railway Company, the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin United Tramways Company to acquire that particular service.  To whom is that licence to be transferred, if it is to be transferred&mdash;to the G.N.R., the G.S.R. or the Dublin United Tramways Company? The scheme we contemplate in this Bill is the division of the country into three areas.  We regard the City of Dublin as one area, in which the dominating transport organisation is the Dublin United Tramways Company. That company engages in the carriage of merchandise of certain kinds as well as in the carriage of passengers.  Are we to contemplate a monopoly of merchandise carrying in the City of Dublin in the hands of the United Tramways Company or are we to allow one or other or both of the railway companies to come in as well and have a sort of three-cornered battle for the short distance traffic around Dublin?  Is it not a simpler proposition to eliminate those areas altogether, knowing as we do that that traffic is of no special importance to the railway companies, that they do not particularly want it; that the <Col N="1589" /> exclusion of those areas from the scope of the Bill is not going to prejudice the position of any company or interfere with the effective carrying out of our policy, bearing in mind, at the same time, that by creating these exemption areas we solve a large number of administrative problems which have held up this Bill for a considerable time and were largely responsible for the fact that the previous Government failed to deal with the merchandise carrying problem altogether?  For quite a number of years, the necessity for legislation to regulate the cartage of merchandise by road was obvious, but the administrative difficulties associated with it were so great that it was not attempted.  An attempt is being made now.  I admit that many of the devices contained in this Bill are rough and ready methods of dealing with what are very considerable administrative difficulties.  One of these devices is the exempted areas. Not merely does the existence of these exempted areas solve some of these administrative problems but these areas in themselves constitute an essential part of the scheme, and their removal is going to prejudice the prospects of the success of the scheme and make it much more difficult for the railway companies to get into the position we want to put them into-a position in which they will be the sole companies engaged in the long distance transportation of goods and passengers.  That is the aim of the Bill, and it is in order to achieve that aim that I urge that the provision should be allowed to remain as it stands.</P>
    <P>Some question may be asked as to the nature of the administrative difficulties I have in mind.  To enable this Bill to be properly administered, we have got to insert a provision of this kind: &ldquo;Where a mechanically propelled vehicle is used for the carriage of merchandise not the property of the owner of such vehicle, such merchandise shall, until the contrary is proved, be deemed, for the purpose of this Act, to be carried for reward.&rdquo;  On careful examination and consultation with the authorities who will be responsible for the administration of the Act, the <Col N="1590" /> insertion of some such provision became clearly necessary.  I want Deputies to consider all the difficulties that would be associated with the administration of the Act, including a provision of that kind, in the City of Dublin, where, day to day, short-distance transportation is being undertaken under all sorts of conditions. Deputy Moore referred also to the circumstances associated with the ordinary supply of foodstuffs to the City of Dublin-the cartage of milk from farms and places adjacent to the city to supply the requirements of the city.  Very frequently, one lorry might go out and collect the milk of two or three distributors.  That would be impossible under this Bill as it stood unless that carrier had a licence to carry for reward.  Consequently, a whole lot of people would be made common carriers and compelled to engage in that business who would not ordinarily think of doing it at all if allowed to carry on their present arrangements.  The same applies to the bringing in of the products of market gardens&mdash;the different vegetables and other things supplied to the city from farms adjacent to it.  Is it necessary that we should have the transportation of all those articles subject to control?  That stuff would not come by rail.  The railway companies are not interested in its transportation. Is it not much better to leave things as they are and to concentrate on what is our main problem&mdash; long-distance traffic.  It is because we are anxious to take out of the Bill those areas in which all these administrative difficulties exist, leave them as they stand and deal with the problem we can deal with and it is essential we should deal with if we are to solve the railway problem, that we propose these exempted areas.  I ask Deputies not lightly to decide to vote against these areas because, if they do, they may be creating a very substantial problem and they may make it impossible for legislation of this kind to be devised that will secure the position of the railway companies.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his reply, did not make certain points <Col N="1591" /> clear to me.  When speaking of the carriers that existed, say, in Dublin under the 15-mile radius scheme, he seemed to think that if that area were reduced these carriers would immediately apply for licences to become existing carriers.  Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I say that there is no sense in reducing the area at all. It is a question of either maintaining the areas or abolishing them, and I say that if they are abolished the carriers must apply for licences or go out of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the position as regards this Bill was that the competition was to be standardised at which it is to-day and that the position of the existing carriers in Dublin was that they could immediately apply for licences to go north, south, east or west-I suppose they would not go in one direction but they would go in the other three.  I do not know how the Minister reconciles that statement with the provisions in this Bill.  It seems to me that there is going to be created a position in the large cities in which, by the Minister's wish, these savage carriers are to be confined in a ringed fence into which the railway company could not enter in competition with them and that, in order that they should be kept from breaking out, they are to be given a fairly large compound. The Minister did not answer Deputy Good's point, because the person who wants to carry for 15 miles might conceivably find it very profitable to carry for 20 miles.  He spoke of administrative difficulties in administering the Act in circumstances where every carrier was licensed, but he entirely failed to deal with the position that Deputy Good raised.  He spoke about the difficulty of examining all the goods in the city, putting the onus of proof on the carrier at a five-mile radius, presumably.  Under the existing state of affairs, the present situation is going to come about with a 15-mile radius and it seems to me <Col N="1592" /> that it will be harder to keep the ring at 15 miles than at 5 miles.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the almost insoluble difficulty in which he would be placed if he had to decide between simultaneous applications from the Great Southern Railway, the Great Northern Railway and the Dublin United Tramways Company for a transfer of a carrier's licence.  He has mentioned the fact that this Bill is designed to rehabilitate the railways and I would, therefore, advise him not to waste much sympathy on the tramway company in the matter of allowing them to acquire a licence to distribute heavy goods.  I do not think that the tramway company can be considered as being in the same position as either the Great Northern Railway or the Great Southern Railway.</P>

So far as the question of giving a licence to either the Great Southern or the Great Northern companies is concerned, I do not think it would present an insoluble difficulty.  One point on which I find myself very much in agreement with the Minister is that the railway would not think of delivering goods for a distance of five miles and I will make the Minister a present of this argument which, to my mind, seems to clinch the matter.

      <P>They sent out an individual to ask certain merchants a certain number of questions.  The individual said to the merchant: &ldquo;My directors are appalled by the dearth of traffic over very small distances from this particular city.  Do you mind telling me what rate you could pay for traffic to certain points?&rdquo;&mdash;naming points on the line.  After making a calculation, the merchant said: &ldquo;I could not afford to pay you anything.&rdquo;&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; said the representative, and the merchant said: &ldquo;When I take the cost of delivery to your railway and the cost of delivery at the other end, it is cheaper to send it by road.&rdquo;  I make a present of that argument to the Minister, because it proves conclusively his point as to the impossibility of delivery by rail over a small radius and I also make him a present of this argument that there are certain classes of goods that the railway cannot hope in the future to deliver.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not make them a railway.  Deputy Davin, with his alert mind, has anticipated the point I was about to make.  It drives you back to this conclusion, that the railway company must compete under road transport conditions for certain traffic inside their area.  The most profitable, presumably, from their point of view, and one of the densest areas is Dublin.  The Minister suggested that the five mile carriage was of no interest to the railway company and I would not be surprised if the railway company agreed with him on that, but there is this portion of the argument which he has not pursued to its logical conclusion-where is that to stop?  If road transport is to be made an undertaking in which it is carried <Col N="1594" /> out to a 15 mile radius outside Dublin, and then the railway company have to try and obtain it for the rest of the journey, it is a hopeless proposition.  I think that the Minister ought to envisage the position in which the railway company are going to compete strongly under road traffic conditions for the class of traffic that suits them. I cannot see them sending out road service vehicles to Rush and Lusk for various agricultural produce.  However, as Deputy Dillon said, that is a question for the railway companies themselves.  But, as far as the railway companies are concerned, they must in the future operate road transport vehicles in order to feed their railways and, to my mind, that is going to be the solution of most of their problems in the future.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it seems to me an extraordinary position that there is to be an enormous area round all the principal towns for which you would require the service of a detective force prepared to stop vehicles on certain appointed days and to probe into where the goods came from and where the goods were going to, and all sorts of questions like that.  To my mind, the Minister, when he speaks about the administrative difficulties of the licences, is going to complicate the question by handing his problem over to the Minister for Justice, namely, to the police force.  I think the country has not much sympathy for that sort of a problem, and we would like to see a solution that would call for fewer licences and less supervision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finian Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say that I would like to agree with the Minister in his hope that the Dáil will not assent to any abolition of a proposal for exempted areas.  I confess that I do not know quite where we stand in dealing with this matter.  I have amendments down&mdash;at least I have one amendment down in connection with the Port of Tralee.  I do not know whether this is the right time to discuss it or whether its discussion should be deferred to a later time but, at any rate, one can talk of it on the general question in the sense that it is an area where a road service has been carried on for a number of years <Col N="1595" /> to the port&mdash;where, in fact, as is proved by the report of the Port and Harbours Tribunal, apart altogether from what one might call the one-sided statements that might be made by the Harbour Commissioners, they say that the railway companies have not treated them fairly-that they have not treated either the Commissioners or the merchants or the exporters fairly.  They have said, in their statement to the Department of Industry and Commerce, that there have been no &ldquo;through fares&rdquo; to English railway stations.  That was investigated by the Port and Harbours Tribunal when they were down there and, in their report, they are certainly not satisfied that the railways have given a good reason for not having provided those through fares.  If that is the case in a place like Tralee, presumably it is the case at other ports, and presumably that itself would make a prima facie case for having these exempted areas around ports.  However, my particular function in this matter is to put forward the suggestion that was made by the Harbour Commissioners in Tralee, and that is to have the exempted area from Tralee radiating for 30 miles.  I understand that in the new amendment it is a radius of ten miles that is put down. I do not know whether the person who put down the amendment was hoping that I would split the difference.  I would be prepared to split the difference to a radius of 20 miles for Tralee.  I think that there is a case for Tralee as against the case that might be made for other ports, and at least I should like the Minister to look into the case from that point of view. At any rate, the Minister may take it that I am entirely against the suggestion, as put forward by Deputy McGilligan, that these exempted areas should be wiped out altogether.  I am entirely opposed to that, and we will take what is in the Bill or in the amendment as perhaps the best we can get; but at any rate I do not want the exempted areas out.</P>

I have been in Opposition for over five years, and from experience I know that the tendency of a member of the Opposition is to oppose what the Government proposes and to work himself up into a passion merely because it is the Government which proposes a particular matter.  I do not want that to happen in this case, because I think that the considerations involved are very important and particularly that the abolition of the areas would increase the difficulties very materially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree with me that, many virtues as Deputy Dockrell has, we cannot conceive of him working himself up into a frantic passion.  The Deputy addressed the Minister through the Chair, and the country through the Minister, with astonishing moderation and with, I must say, most convincing arguments.  I propose to follow on some of the points which the Deputy made.  Deputy Good was the first one to raise the point of the real administrative difficulty that will arise in connection with this Bill.  The Minister has made two principal objections to our proposal for the elimination of these areas&mdash;first, that it would create administrative difficulties; and second, that it would serve as an inducement to persons, who had intended to operate within the 15 miles radius, to go outside.  The Minister said that it would put a very onerous duty on the Guards to have to ascertain what each lorry in the City of Dublin was about. Surely, the Minister will agree that, as a matter of fact, if a man is going to be in the haulage business he will be in it.  He will go around publicly in that business.  We need not anticipate that at three o'clock in the morning a lorry will steal out for a bag of meal and crawl across the city by lanes and backways to avoid the vigilant Guards. These people will be in the haulage <Col N="1597" /> business or they will not be in the haulage business and the Guards will have no serious difficulty in ascertaining whether a person is in the haulage business in an authorised way or is not. The Guards will find it quite easy to detect persons attempting to haul goods without having licences.</P>
      <P>If there is a 15 mile limit an additional police force will be required. Take the case of a man who is invited to take a load 16 miles.  Can you imagine for a moment that in places like Ballina, Sligo or Westport you will not have people taking the chance of running beyond the distance, particularly if they are told that just at the 15 mile border, if they go a mile further down the road there is a load waiting for the return journey.  If the law is to be enforced I submit that the administrative difficulties will be enormous if the section dealing with exempted areas operates.  Not alone in Dublin but in Cork and in rural areas like Sligo, Ballina and Westport the greatest possible difficulties will arise.  The Minister's next point was that we have a large number of persons who were hitherto content to engage in short-distance haulage work, and that they would be induced to go outside that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if they were obliged to be licensed.  If not called upon to take out a licence for their own restricted district they will not go outside it.  Surely that argument will not hold water.  If a man is equipped for short-distance haulage work around the city, and goes to the Department of Industry and Commerce for a licence for longer distances, he must constitute himself a long-distance carrier on scheduled routes.  Otherwise he will not get a licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He must act as a common carrier.  Surely the Minister must realise that men in the short-distance haulage business, calculating on such hauls, will not have the necessary equipment to hold themselves out as common carriers.  Unless they are <Col N="1598" /> going to launch fully into the business they will not go into it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's point is that if you do away with the areas you are inducing people to go into the haulage business who otherwise would not do so.  I put it to him that the want of equipment will keep them within their own areas.  The next point is that the railway company will have to acquire them.  I agree with him and I agree with Deputy Dockrell that the time is coming when the railway company must abandon the idea of carrying many classes of merchandise in railway waggons.  There is a certain class of traffic now which is pre-eminently suited to road transport, and presumably it is the intention of the railway company to go into and to develop that business.  What we want is to unify control and to get efficient transport.  It is as easy for the railway company as for others to undertake short hauls.  If a man says that he wants to get stuff and that it must go by road the railway company will carry it by road.  The aim is to unify control.  I submit that traffic within a 15 miles radius, if it is worth anything to the railway people, is worth something to the haulage people.  There is no reason whatever, when monopoly is being secured to the railway company by this Bill, why this traffic should not be as valuable an asset to the railways as to the haulage companies.  When it becomes a valuable asset it will help to have carried, at the lowest possible rates, the uneconomic haulage that has to be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister alleged that Deputy McGilligan said that the Minister intended to permit everyone to carry within the scheduled areas, except the <Col N="1599" /> railway company.  Deputy McGilligan said nothing of the kind.  What the Deputy said was that the Bill was going to allow everyone to carry within those areas, without any liability. The Bill was going to make the railway company common carriers and to place them under a material disadvantage in these areas.  How can it be lawful or commonsense to do that in a Bill of this character?  The Minister placed special emphasis on the long-distance traffic and said that the loss in that traffic was killing the railway company.  Consider Sligo and Ballina and do not concentrate always on the Dublin end.  There are more scheduled areas in the Bill than in Dublin.  Let the Minister go to the railway directors and ask them if the Collooney business was worth anything.  There are probably places about Westport where short-distance traffic would be most valuable.  There are certainly many districts about Ballina where that traffic would be most valuable to the railways.  Take Drogheda, Dundalk and a number of other ports, particularly in the rural areas, where the traffic is going to be most valuable to the railways.</P>
    <P>I listened with the closest attention to the Minister's points about administrative difficulties.  I am convinced that the administrative difficulties which will arise under this amendment are far greater than the practical difficulties which will arise under the proposals we make.  He will find in practice that there will be no difficulty in identifying persons in the haulage business once the Bill is in operation. It seems to me that the last matter was weighing more heavily with him than the Minister cared to admit.  I refer to the difficulties that he foresaw if compulsory acquisition arose, and if he was called upon to decide between the claims of the railway company, the tramways company and the Great Northern Railway.  His real difficulty, it seemed to me, was that he had given some kind of undertaking to the tramways company that they were going to get the City of Dublin.  I am not suggesting that the Minister did so for any corrupt purpose or that he was out <Col N="1600" /> for Dr. Lombard Murphy.  Surely it is nonsense, as Deputy Dockrell said, to suggest that the tramways company is not going to become a competitor.  The tramways company would not take the portion that the railway company are taking and is not equipped to take it. They do not want it and I am perfectly certain the Minister will find no serious difficulty in that direction.</P>
    <P>On the other hand I think he has it now from all sides of the House that there is a genuine and sincere feeling that if the Bill is to be a success this traffic should be reserved to the railway company.  He has always the remedy that if he finds that we were mistaken, and that he was right, he can correct the mistake by an amending Bill.  After all from the Labour Benches, from these benches, from Deputy Good, Deputy Thrift and from almost everybody, with the distinguished exception of Deputy Finian Lynch, whose heart bleeds for Tralee, he has that desire that he should take the opposite view and give a trial to the universal application of the regulations.  Surely with that consensus of opinion against him, it is worth giving it a trial and if it is proven administratively impossible, then I am perfectly certain the House will put no difficulty in his way in bringing forward an amending Bill to remove that administrative difficulty.</P>

      <P>I fear that Deputy Dillon, in his anxiety for the welfare of the railway company, is apt to forget altogether the farming community.  If there is anything I would be in favour of in this Bill, it would be an extension of the areas.  One must realise that around cities and in particular areas, there is a large amount of traffic that in the ordinary course used to be carried by farmers' horses and carts and which, since the motorists took over the roads making it impossible for this traffic to be carried as it was formerly, has to be carried by motor lorry. Cattle have to be taken to the local market, and those cattle have to be taken largely by motor lorries.  It is impossible to drive cattle on the roads around Cork City at present.  Oats and all kinds of grain, potatoes and <Col N="1601" /> other vegetables have to be taken in the same way.  You will never get the railway company to cater for that kind of traffic and it is no use pretending that they will.  I was very amused to hear Deputy Dockrell talk about the enlightened railway company that sent its messengers round the town to merchants. I know an enlightened railway company, in my part of the country, who run a special train every morning to catch the train to Dublin.  They take the painful pleasure of taking farmers and labourers out of bed three-quarters of an hour earlier than is necessary in order that that train might wait three-quarters of an hour at Cork. By doing that they lost 35/- a day at one station alone.  These are the rather amusing things that some of us have experienced on that line owing to what the enlightened railway company has done.  It is useless to be looking for traffic that you know very well you will not get.  All I have to hope for is that the Minister will protect us from Messrs. Wallis and the railway company as far as haulage is concerned because we had a rather bitter experience of both of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember a few years ago when these motorist roads were first laid down, and when we had definitely to choose between sending our grain by motor lorry or by railway, having to cart our grain to the station, seven miles from the city, to send down a man to pack it in the waggon, to send it up to Cork, and to have another man there to haul it to the merchants. When you had finished with the railway company you had not much left out of the cheque, and then you had to pay for the haulage by the man in Cork.  When we turned to the tender mercies of Messrs.  Wallis we were little better off.  In the end we got some enlightened people to hire a couple of motor lorries and cater for the traffic.  I am glad that Deputy Dockrell realises that you must get out of the idea that you are going to have the railway company hauling merchandise for a few miles while the haulage at both ends of the railway has to be done by road.  There is undoubtedly around the cities and around practically every town a large amount of <Col N="1602" /> traffic for which the railway company would never cater, and which I for one would not like to see in the hands of one individual who would extract three-fourths of the price of the produce for haulage alone.  We have got to face that problem.</P>

      <P>Let the Deputy consider that at present you will get a local lorry owner to go into the yard after the threshing and take it to Cork city and deliver it at 4/- a ton.  He can consider the difference in what way he likes.  I wonder which of those &ldquo;unified controls&rdquo; is going to go out for a load of cabbage and what will be the charge for remaining in the yard while the cabbage is being loaded and for delivering it round the city afterwards?  Those are the things we have to consider. The only change I desire in the Bill is that the area would be extended a little.  For instance, Cobh would be 17 miles from Cork.  There is a large <Col N="1603" /> traffic carried on in that area in potatoes, grain and other produce which is brought up to Cork City.  The railway company will never cater for that traffic and there is no use pretending it will.  I see very sound reasons for the extension of the limit of the exempted areas to 20 miles at least.  These are problems which have to be considered in connection with cities and large towns. In my opinion, the Minister is justified in making these exempted areas. My only objection is that these exempted areas are not large enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister exposed another peculiar aspect of his alleged pro-railway viewpoint in the course of his last speech when he said that the railways were needed for long-distance traffic and it was his intention, through the proposals contained in the Bill, to endeavour to retain the long-distance traffic for the railways.  What long distance traffic has the Minister in mind? Undoubtedly it is the traffic with which the road carriers cannot deal. He is going to present the railways with something for nothing when he presents them with a continuance of the low-rated traffic with which no alternative carrying company can deal.  I presume he will also present them with the cattle traffic from the principal fairs.  He knows it would be impossible for any road transport service to carry, from any fair in the South or West of Ireland, to Dublin or elsewhere, the equivalent of three special train loads of cattle. If the railways are going to be allowed, through the generosity of the Minister and his supporters, to retain the low-rated, bad-paying long-distance traffic, he must remember they can only continue to carry it so long as they are allowed to compete for other classes of traffic on fair lines with their road competitors. The rates for cattle and other heavy traffic over long or short distances must depend on the revenue which will be derived from other traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has Deputy Corry any objection to putting the railways on the same basis <Col N="1604" /> as the road carrying companies?  Has he any objection to fair competition? If the Deputy, the Minister and the whole Fianna Fáil Party believe in fair competition, why do they stand for preferential treatment by exempting certain carriers from the regulations and conditions imposed on their competitors?  Deputy Corry knows perfectly well that so long as road carriers operate within the area defined in the amendment they will not be obliged to submit their rates and the classification of their traffic to the Railway Tribunal.  Does the Deputy know that it will be possible for a licensed carrier in Dublin to take cattle from the city market, land them 15 miles away on the Dublin-Meath border and allow the farmer who owns them to drive them a few miles to wherever they are going? Does he realise that that farmer can, without being held up by the Guards, chance going the other mile or two and so avoid any penalty being imposed?  Can that be described as fair competition?</P>
    <P>The Minister repeatedly makes the suggestion that the traffic within the suggested radius laid down in amendment 16 is useless to the railway companies. Is he prepared to take the risk of repeating that, having the knowledge that the railway shareholders actually purchased John Wallis and Company and retained them on the road in order to recover for the railway company some of the traffic they lost through unfair competition?  If the traffic defined in the amendment is useless to the railways, surely the shareholders would not have purchased this company for the purpose of getting back their lost traffic?  If the Deputy is not prepared to stand over what the directors have been doing in the case of the Great Southern Railways he might, at least, use his influence at a Party meeting in order to make the Minister carry out the promise he made some time ago to the effect that he would wipe out the Board altogether.  If he adopts that attitude he will get the support of this Party.</P>
    <P>A lot of the things said by the Minister in support of this milk and <Col N="1605" /> water measure suggest a clear case for the removal of the board of management. He should go the whole hog and replace the present system of management by a Board such as he indicated a year ago he would set up. At Inchicore he would not take the risk of telling his listeners there that he was standing for the present system of management.  If he did that, I believe his majority would have been considerably lower at the general election.  Deputy Corry should say as little as he can about the existing Board of Directors so long as he is prepared, in approving of a Bill of this kind, to maintain that system of management.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicates that it is the policy to let the traffic that comes within the radius defined in this Bill continue to be carried by road service companies.  Does he realise that that possibly means the closing down of all railway stations, so far as goods services are concerned, within the areas defined in the Bill?  You cannot have it both ways.  The minister cannot say he stands for a monopoly for the railway company when, at the same time, he presents the road service companies with a preference not enjoyed by the railways.</P>

      <P>I do not profess to be an expert, but I know that one would require to be a genius to understand what is behind the Minister's mind in relation to this Bill.  It is only by getting the Minister to make repeated speeches, and by repeated questioning, that one can secure any information from him.  Every time he make a speech in support of a section of the Bill he goes further away from the policy he so often enunciated here and elsewhere as being the transport policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Perhaps in his spare time, if he has any, he will read the speeches he made in 1929, 1930, 1931, and 1932 and compare them with some of the speeches he made on the Second Reading of this measure and this evening.  Perhaps Deputy Corry, one of his faithful followers, who believes in standing for the full 100 per cent.  Fianna Fáil policy, will make an investigation in order to see where the Minister is travelling, where he intends to land himself and his Party, and ultimately the country. Perhaps other members of the Party will examine the situation and see where all these things are leading.</P>
      <P>This Minister has spoken frequently on this measure.  He says, in effect, &ldquo;Here is my Bill; tell me what is wrong with it; give me any one argument that will prove to my satisfaction that the exempted areas proposal should be abolished.&rdquo;  But, of course, no matter what one says or suggests or what kind of argument one puts up to the Minister he still says, as he has said to-night, that he has heard no argument that would justify him in accepting this amendment.  I asked him if he still stood for the policy of unification.  If he does stand for the policy of unification I want to point out that that policy presupposes the licensing of those who desire to apply for a licence.  It presupposes regulation and control over every person plying for profit-making purposes in the transport industry.  It presupposes licensing for control and restriction. Surely that is part of the Minister's policy and that ought to be some justification to advance to the Minister in support of the abolition of this sub-section from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1607" /> I read already and I do not want to pain the Minister by repeating it, a speech in which he stated that the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, in so far as control of the public transport services within the municipalities was concerned, was municipal control of all public vehicles plying for hire within the municipality.  Why does he go outside the municipality to justify this limit?  If he ever hopes to put that policy into operation surely he would not go beyond the limit of fixing a reasonable radius from the central post office in the four principal cities and make it much easier for himself if he ever believed in municipal control of public service to bring that policy into operation by a stroke of the pen on some future date.  If the Minister believes in the municipal ownership of the public services then he will wipe out this amendment and make it his policy to put at a later date municipal control into operation.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a number of speeches in connection with this question of the creation of exempted areas.  But in all the speeches which the Minister made he left me at all events unconvinced that there was any reason whatever for the creation of these twelve exempted areas and for permitting uncontrolled lorry service to continue in these areas. The Minister says: &ldquo;if you can prove to me that there is a strong case against the exempted areas, I am willing to cut out these exempted areas altogether.&rdquo;  But it was perfectly clear from the Minister's attitude and his three speeches linked up that he was not open to any conviction with regard to these exempted areas.  The Minister has made no case for these exempted areas.  Then he said: &ldquo;prove to me that it is wrong.&rdquo;  The Minister might have told the House the reason for the creation of these areas.  He spent a good deal of time trying to justify them but if he convinced himself and his Party, it left the rest of the House unconvinced as to the reason and necessity for the creation of these separate areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> The speeches made by the Minister on transport are always interesting during transport discussion.  Not later than February of last year, speaking at a big railway centre in Athlone, the Minister is reported as saying:-</P>
    <P>The preservation of the railways was necessary and if Fianna Fáil got into power they would see at least that the railways got sufficient traffic that would make the revenue cover expenses.  To get that traffic some control would have to be exercised over road transport services.  It is necessary that the present wasteful expenditure should be stopped and Fianna Fáil propose to stop it by having control under public ownership of the service.  If the present conditions were to continue undoubtedly it was almost certain that the railway service would have to close down.</P>
    <P>This speech was delivered on the 8th February, 1932.  A revised version of it is the Minister's speech to-night that Fianna Fáil proposes to stop wasteful competition only in the thinly populated areas.  In the other areas where the population is more crowded, and the traffic creamiest, Fianna Fáil proposes to allow these conditions to continue, which, on the 8th February last year would, according to the Minister, almost certainly mean that the railways would have to close down.  There was no suggestion in that speech that the country was going to have twelve 15 mile circles, no suggestion that this was to be a milk and water Transport Bill.  No.  It was to be a Bill of robust&mdash;almost red&mdash; transport policy as enshrined in the speech in Athlone last year.  But when the policy is to be translated into fact, and to take the form of a Bill, the redness departs and the robustness also departs and we get a Bill of this kind which does not square with the speeches of the Minister during that election.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister's third speech where he supported Deputy Moore when he said it was necessary to have these exempted areas because what was to happen the food supplies of Dublin if there was control in the Dublin areas?  Apparently we can <Col N="1609" /> only get food supplies into Dublin when there is no control.  The one guarantee of getting food supplies into Dublin is that we have chaos and a complete absence of control.  The Minister proposes to support Deputy Moore in that utterly fallacious contention. The Minister said that it was proposed to get certain foodstuffs into Dublin.  He instanced milk as one of the supplies which he is to get from within 15 miles of Dublin.  The only way to get it is to let us have no control over transport services, and then we can get all the milk we want. Suppose the food supplies can only be got, say, within 16 miles from the central post office in Dublin.  Then, apparently, according to the reasoning of the Minister and the reasoning of Deputy Moore, Dublin is going to do without that portion of its food supplies which is outside the 15 mile radius.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say that is not correct.  But that is what he said. Everybody knows that whether the foodstuffs are to be got within 15 miles of Dublin or 100 miles of Dublin it ought to be possible to get the foodstuffs no matter what the distance is.  The Minister was particularly careful to pick out Dublin. Would he apply the same philosophy to Ballina?  The Minister says in this Bill that, apparently, the same state of affairs is necessary in Ballina.  It is necessary to have exempted an area of ten miles from Ballina in order that the people of Ballina can get foodstuffs. Ballina must have complete freedom from control and regulation in order to get its foodstuffs.  I wonder is that the position in relation to Ballina?  What is to happen to the people ten miles from Kilkenny?  Are they to get no foodstuffs at all?  If Kilkenny can get its foodstuffs and it is necessary to have control and regulation in Kilkenny and within ten miles of Kilkenny, surely it is equally necessary in the public interest that we should have some control and regulation so far as Kilkenny is concerned.  The Minister made an unconvincing speech for exempting areas.  He convinced nobody except himself, and his few <Col N="1610" /> admirers on his own benches, outside Deputy Moore.  I am slow to believe that Deputy Corry, when he sees the full import of this, will be so enthusiastic in support of the Minister's statement.  Then the Minister made the other astounding statement, that it was mainly the long distance traffic which helps the railways.  I wonder did that transpire at the meeting with the directors when they accepted this ten and 15 mile radius?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was alleged to be. I imagine if the Minister has any consultation, not with directors, but with some people who know in detail the economics of road and rail transport, he will find his statement very far from representing the facts of the position so far as railway transport is concerned. The Minister said he wanted to create exempted areas to induce people to remain in these areas and not to get a licence for outside areas in order to compete for the haulage of long-distance traffic against the railways. In other words, the Minister believes that it is desirable to curb the long-distance road carrier.  When we were endeavouring on Section 2 to restrict the number of long-distance road carriers, the Minister showed no disposition on that section to curb their activities.</P>
      <P>On Section 2, the Minister was prepared to give a licence to everybody whether they travelled long or short distances.  Even if they only had a licence for three months, even if they only ran a lorry on the road for a day or half a day, the Minister was prepared to give them a licence then, even though once they got the licence they could compete with the railway companies.  He was quite generous to these competitors of the railways in order to get his way on Section 2.  In view of his sympathy with these people on Section 2 one finds it difficult to understand his new-found sympathy with the railways on Section 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the Minister is simply driven to any extreme to make a case for his exempted areas. <Col N="1611" /> The exempted areas have got into the Bill, how we need not now question, and the Minister is making a case for these exempted areas against what I believe to be his own better judgment. There is no case for the creation of these exempted areas.  The Minister knows well that there is no case for the creation of these areas. If transport is going to be regulated ten miles from Kilkenny City, it ought to be regulated in places as large as Kilkenny and in places smaller than Kilkenny.  The Minister has taken no pains to explain the inequality in a matter of that kind.</P>
    <P>Then the last hare that the Minister set going in the debate was to pretend that this was an issue as to whether the railway companies wanted short-distance traffic or long-distance traffic.  Everybody knows that the railways want all the traffic they can get, whether long-distance or short-distance. That is not the issue involved in this case.  The issue in this case is not a question of whether the railways want short-distance or long-distance traffic.  The issue is why road transport companies, or persons with road transport licences, should be allowed to ply under control and regulation in one area and without control and regulation in another area, although these areas are similar in every respect.  The Minister has not answered or explained that point. When replying, I hope the Minister will explain why it is necessary to have control and regulation ten miles from Kilkenny City and no control and regulation ten miles from Westport or Ballina.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I only rise to take part in this debate in so far as the Minister is open to conviction and is prepared to meet the arguments of the House, and to support a considerable amount of the arguments already put forward.  In my opinion, this Bill is useless unless we take steps to divert all the traffic possible to the railways. There is no use in having a patched-up job and making the railways only somewhat better than they are.  Let <Col N="1612" /> us go the whole hog and throw the entire traffic on to the railways, if the railways are fit to bear it.  Are they fit to carry all the traffic?  Apparently they are.  There is no question that they cannot take all the traffic.  That being so, why make exempted areas and why exempt the areas in particular where there is traffic that would be revenue-producing to the railways? Deputies Davin and Norton emphasised that fact, and played with the Minister in so far as he was condescending enough to give long-distance traffic to the railways.  We know that long-distance traffic is neither here nor there.  There is only one organisation that can take long-distance traffic, and that is the railways.  We know, however, that the railways cannot pay with long-distance and heavy traffic alone.  The carrying of cattle and other heavy goods for long distances does not pay.  The railways will not pay if they are confined to that traffic. They have to get the other traffic, small parcels and other traffic which pays better.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry, having departed, apparently, considerably from his usual patriotism, twitted the railways about sending lorries to his yard for oats and cabbage.  I have heard Deputy Corry repeatedly state how many acres of potatoes and oats he cultivates and I suppose there are a number of horses and carts in his yard.  When, therefore, a lorry arrives for a load of cabbage the horses and the men who drive them are standing idle.  If I were Deputy Corry, the stuff would be sent on the horses and carts into Cork, because the horses are reared in Ireland, the corn which feeds them is grown here, and the carts are also made here.  The lorry which comes into his yard is made in America and the petrol also comes from America. Why would Deputy Corry not use his own transport instead of going to the railways in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no case for exempting these areas.  The Bill would be futile in my opinion if that were done, if we are to put the railways on their feet, and that is what is looked for by the railway stockholders and the public generally.  The welfare of the agricultural <Col N="1613" /> community is involved in this. The railways must be maintained, and if they are to be maintained they must pay their way.  If they cannot pay their way they cannot exist.  Everybody admits that they must exist. Why not say to them: &ldquo;Here is your job; you are the carriers of the country; you have machinery for doing it; go and do all the carrying work of the country.&rdquo;  Impose whatever conditions you like on them, strict conditions, if you like, on the manner in which they will do it; and insist that they should do it and are made do it.  But do not say to them that they must carry cattle from Cork to Dublin and from Sligo to Dublin, but not from Mullingar to Dublin; that they must not carry other valuable stuff through the city.  Do not cut off what is really the paying end of it and give them the rubbish that does not pay.  This Bill will be useless unless it is a pro-railway Bill, and, as I say, I am against the exempted areas.</P>

    <P>(h)  the area included within a circle having a radius of ten miles and its centre at the principal post office in the town of Galway;</P>

    <P>(3)  For the purposes of this section the principal post office in any city or town shall be the post office which on the appointed day is the principal or only post office in such city or town.</P>
    <P>This amendment is the one which in fact we have been discussing, and I do not propose to restart the discussion. I think there has not been any point made by any speaker which would, in my opinion, constitute a convincing reason why those exempted areas should be abolished.  I am quite satisfied that the abolition of the exempted areas would impede rather than <Col N="1617" /> facilitate the railway companies in getting into the position which we want to put them in.  It would confer upon them no special advantage, but would in fact increase the difficulty of acquiring effective control over road transport. I explained why I thought that would be the result of the abolition of the exempted areas, and I do not think it is necessary to reopen the argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible to leave this whole question over to the Report Stage, and take the view of the railway company and the interested parties in the meantime? There seems to be some doubt as to what their view is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite genuinely, this is my position: I have gone into this matter; I am satisfied that in the interests of the railway company, and mainly for the purpose of giving effect to the policy enshrined in the Bill, those provisions are essential.  I said to myself always that there may be some argument which did not occur to me and which may outweigh all the considerations that did occur to me. If this were the case, I would be prepared to give way in the face of such an argument, but I have not heard it yet.  I think to a large extent the opposition to the proposals of the Bill is due to a misunderstanding of what is intended by those exempted areas. I am prepared&mdash;if this section appears in the Bill&mdash;at any time up to the Report Stage, or later, to consider any representations made upon that matter, and to endeavour genuinely to get as near as we can to what is the truth in connection with it.  I am fully convinced at the present time that the abolition of the exempted areas would in fact prove a curse to the railway companies, and would prevent and certainly delay acquisition by those companies of the effective control over road transport which we want to acquire for them.  It is for that reason I am putting to the Dáil that the exempted areas should be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said before, if the contrary is demonstrated and convincing reasons are advanced&mdash;that is not egotism on my part, because I have to be convinced if I am to take responsibility for <Col N="1618" /> the proposals before the Dáil&mdash;I am prepared to give way, because it is not a question of principle; it is a question of machinery, and I am convinced that the most effective machinery that could be devised to give speedy effect to the proposals of the Bill must include those exempted areas.  If it can be shown that more effective machinery can be devised which involves the abolition of the exempted areas I am prepared to agree with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to reopen the discussion, but I would like the Minister to consider some further points.  Assuming for the moment that exempted areas are a necessity, I do not think the Minister has put up any reasons or suggestions whatever as to why he has fixed on certain limitations of those areas&mdash;why he has taken 15 for Dublin and ten for another place.  The railway companies are satisfied&mdash;and, it seems to me, justly satisfied&mdash;that the areas named are too large.  I admit the force of the Minister's statements and arguments as to the difficulty of administration, but I want the Minister to consider very carefully whether it would not be possible to get some such boundary as that named by him, namely, the boundary of the city or municipality, which would meet the situation much better.  I am speaking merely on the assumption that some exempted area is necessary. I am satisfied that the best solution is not an exempted area at all, but, leaving that argument aside for the moment, we have to consider what the size of those areas ought to be.  The bigger you make them the more you limit the utility of this Bill from the railway companies' point of view.  I hope the Minister will give further consideration, before we reach the Report Stage, to the reasons for choosing some particular size in each particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say that I am quite prepared to consider any representations with regard to the size of the areas, and the inclusion of particular towns as centres of areas.  That is only a matter of machinery, and any case made for the exclusion or inclusion of particular towns, or the reduction of the area in relation to <Col N="1619" /> particular towns, would be carefully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like a reassurance from the Minister on one point.  I want to ask him is there any danger, immediate or remote, that the seven and a half preferential which is provided for in a very old Act of Parliament, and of which the City of Cork Steampacket Company gets the advantage, will be discontinued in the future.  I want to say that, to a very large extent, my opposition to this proposed amendment in relation to the exempted areas was based on the fear that, at some time or another in the near or remote future, this preferential might be removed.  I may say also that that fear is shared by many persons in Cork.  Because of that fear, I intend to divide the House, unless the Minister can reassure me that, if and when the railway companies get absolute control, there will be no fear that that differential will be removed.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that the whole further discussion of this matter might be left over until the Report Stage.  If the Minister could see his way to yield to that suggestion I think it would get us out of the difficulty.  Deputy Alton made that suggestion, and if I might say one word in support of that suggestion it would be this: I am sure one of the reasons which prompts the Minister to adhere so strongly to this amendment of his, is the belief that he has the support of the railway companies behind him.  He has made that statement several times to-night and I would like to give him an opportunity of consulting with the railway companies to ensure whether he has their support to his amendment, or would their support rather go in the direction of eliminating these areas entirely.  Now, if the Minister could see his way to leave the matter as it stands at the moment and not discuss this question of the areas further until we get to the Report Stage, it would enable him to consult with these other interests and come forward with their views before him.  Then we could see the exact position.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and to substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  On and after the appointed day it shall not be lawful for any person in the course of a road transport business carried on by him to carry merchandise in any area in Saorstát Eireann unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such person is the holder of a licence (in this Act referred to as a merchandise licence) granted under this Part of this Act authorising him to carry on merchandise road transport business in that area and such business is carried on under and in accordance with such licence, or</P>
      <P>(b)  such area is an exempted area and merchandise is carried by such person in the course of such merchandise road transport business only in such area or such area and other exempted areas.</P>
      <P>This amendment is really consequential on the last one.  It effects a change in the wording of Section 6.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment 21, of course, is in direct opposition to this. As we have discussed this already I do not want to speak on it at any great length.  All I want to say is that amendment 19 wants to have the new <Col N="1625" /> situation thus: that the only person who, in the future, will operate without a licence at all and, therefore, without the conditions which are imposed upon a licensed holder: that is to say, being a common carrier, subject to classification as to merchandise, and to maximum rates as well as to the possibility of acquisition under the compulsory section, is the carrier operating within the exempted area.  The person who keeps entirely within the new exempted areas is entirely outside the scope of all these restrictions.  Taking it that the House has decided that that should be so, I want to have the addition made that the licensed carrier, who is subject to conditions, once he goes inside the exempted area should be a free agent like the rest.  I do not see why he should be prohibited from taking the traffic which the other people are getting or why he should be put in an unfavourable position in relation to them.  It may be a small amount of traffic.  Apparently, they think it is valuable and when they come inside the exempted area they should be allowed to take whatever traffic they like, even though they have not held themselves out as being common carriers for certain classes of goods.  I do not see why they should be prohibited from doing that.  If they are going to take traffic away from anybody, it will be from the people for whom the House says it has no regard &mdash;the unlicensed carriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not here when I was dealing with this point on the other amendments.  The same considerations apply in this case. The Bill, as it will stand with No. 19 amendment inserted in it, will provide a very definite inducement to a carrier who operates mainly in or around one of the towns or cities mentioned in the Bill not to apply for a licence, but to confine his activity entirely within one of the exempted areas.  That is what we are aiming at.  If that carrier wants to enter into competition with the railway companies in respect of the long-distance traffic, then he subjects himself knowingly to certain definite limitations, one being that he is a common carrier in respect of the goods <Col N="1626" /> he proposes to carry both inside and outside the exempted area.  He also subjects himself to the limitation on his business which the Act imposes. The whole aim of that is to ensure that the number of carriers who will, in fact, apply for licences to engage in the transportation of merchandise by road outside the exempted areas will be kept down to the minimum, so that the cost and difficulty to the railway companies of acquiring them will be reduced.  In other words, we provide an inducement to the carrier whose main business is in or around a city doing short-distance carrying to confine himself to that class of work and not to go outside at all.  If we were to accept Deputy McGilligan's suggestion, instead of reducing, we would be, in fact, increasing the number of carriers engaged in long-distance traffic.  At least, the Act would tend to operate in that direction and that is undesirable in our opinion.  If we did as the Deputy suggests, there is no reason whatever why an existing carrier should not apply for a licence to carry outside the exempted area, even though he wanted to do the bulk of his business inside the exempted area. We prefer to see the Act operating in the opposite way.</P>

      <P>I am not convinced. There are two arguments put forward. One is the peculiar one, that the aim and object of the Minister is to induce as many people as possible not to become licensed carriers.

      <P>That is to say, from the point of view of the railway company which wants to acquire a monopoly by purchase, the more you put outside their grip, as long as you confine them to a particular limit of space, the better.  I do not think that that argument, thus baldly stated, will appeal to many people who have the interests of the railway company at <Col N="1627" /> heart.  The Minister argues, on my amendment, that the inducement would be to the carrier mainly operating in an exempted area to apply for a licence.  Why?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the terrible difficulties in the Bill.  There is the obvious fact or that it will be up to everybody whose licence is acquired, but whose lorries and other assets are not acquired, to throw these lorries immediately into an exempted area and start a business there.  The owner can sell them. There will always be somebody willing to take them at scrap value and run them about the streets, when they have not to take out a licence, when there is no classification of merchandise in their case, no rates fixed, no possibility of being taken over and when they are not subject to the obligations of common carriers.  My <Col N="1628" /> amendment does not seek to make these people take out a licence.  Let them operate inside their restricted areas virtually free from control.  But when you have people who have been for some reason or other induced to subject themselves to all the conditions of carriership I have spoken of&mdash; the possibility of being taken over, and restrictions with regard to merchandise, fares or rates&mdash;once these people come inside the exempted areas and are going to be in competition with the folk freed from licensing conditions, they should be free there. This does not give these other carriers any inducement to go outside.  They are protected from the possibility of acquisition so long as they remain inside.  But why take that bit of traffic away from the others and put it into these people's hands on preferential terms?  You are assisting this indiscriminate competition&mdash;the competition we are all setting our faces against at the moment&mdash;by allowing these people to operate to the disadvantage of the licensed carriers inside these exempted areas.  I think that the amendment is sound.</P>

      <P>We are moving on parallel lines.  It appears to me that I have said all I can say on the matter. Deputy McGilligan is examining this question from a point of view completely opposite to the point of view from which I am examining it.  He is examining it from the point of view of the licensed carrier.  My concern is &mdash;the Bill was drafted to achieve this purpose&mdash;that there should be a substantial inducement to existing carriers not to apply for licences but to confine themselves to their carrying activities within the exempted areas.  The present Bill operates in that direction and should tend to reduce the number of persons who will get licences and who, consequently, might have to be acquired by the railway company if it wants to get into the monopoly position. Deputy McGilligan's amendment would operate in the contrary direction <Col N="1629" /> because everybody would have the same advantages in respect of the exempted areas and, presumably, everybody would apply for licences outside that area and there is no reason why they should not.</P>

      <P>No, because, if acquired, they can start again and, consequently, the only part that can be acquired is the part outside&mdash;&ldquo;acquired&rdquo; in the sense that once bought it cannot be replaced.  On the other hand, if the Bill stands as it is, the railway companies could &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; and &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; in respect of services both inside and outside.  New services in the exempted areas can never go outside.  The restrictions imposed on other services, both inside and outside, will operate as an inducement to existing carriers to confine their activities to the exempted areas and thus reduce the number of licensed carriers and facilitate the operation of the general policy of the Bill.</P>

There is no question of maximum rates at the moment.  It is a question of price cutting all along the line and any maximum rate likely to operate will be purely notional for a long time, but after a period, when the railway company has, in fact, secured, as we anticipate they will secure, a complete monopoly over the whole country outside the exempted areas, of the transport position, the maximum rates will become effective.</P>

He does not seem to think that any of the carriers in a restricted area will want to go outside, while my view is that the major portion of them will trade outside, that is, they will trade outside and inside in order to get trade. A considerable volume of the trade will be immediately over the border and they will have to get their licences in order to compete for that trade.  That being so, let us visualise the position.  Say that 25 per cent. of their trade is outside of the border and 75 per cent. inside the restricted area.  They apply to be purchased by the railway company.  What is the railway company going to purchase? Suppose a fellow has two or three lorries.  Do you want the railway company to take 25 per cent. of the lorries?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we will have to leave this as it stands, but I am not at all convinced.  I do not see the equity of this new situation.  Let me leave out maximum fares and I agree with the Minister that, so far as they are concerned, they are going to be merely notional and I say that the classification of merchandise, which really comes into this Bill simply on account of maximum fares, might also be scrapped for a year or two.  There are, however, two other things there. There is the whole matter that is set out in Section 12, whatever it means. It says:</P>
      <P>Every licensee under a merchandise licence shall in relation to all the merchandise specified in such licence and in the area stated in such licence be a common carrier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" /> The one set of people become common carriers for whatever they hold themselves out to be carriers of.  The others do not.  They can take goods one day and refuse another class of goods that the common carrier has to take, and the only way that the gentleman operating outside the exempted areas can meet them is by becoming a common carrier for the articles that all his rivals carry. That is a hardship, I think.  Once he comes inside, if there are any little bits of odds and ends of traffic, he should be allowed to pick them up inside the exempted area.  He will not be allowed to do so under this.  Deputy Moore has put the question and has got a precise answer.</P>
    <P>Similarly with regard to the possibility of being acquired.  The one man is subject to that possibility while the other man is not.  He operates there and, as I said before, I think you are going to drive an enormous number of vehicles into these exempted areas from people who have found their licences taken from them and who get compensation for the pecuniary loss suffered.  These people may have a few lorries left on their hands and they will bundle them off to the various exempted areas, where they will either operate them free from all conditions or else get friends to operate them for the purpose of making a sale.  However, the Minister has just aroused one thought in my mind.  He talks about the maximum conditions.  I wonder has he adverted to a recent development in transport of a most interesting and far-reaching kind.  If recent events prove to be accurate with regard to transport in the country, it will mean this with regard to these vehicles, that if a carrier, being a common carrier, carries at anything less than that charge, he can contract himself out of all the conditions ordinarily applicable to a common carrier and all goods will be carried at the owner's risk.  The fact that you establish maximum fares is the foundation for that in the goods carrying business hereafter.  So that, it is not right to say that it is merely a notional carriage that will be conducted hereafter.  It is not quite clear yet that this will be fully established, <Col N="1634" /> but if that tendency grows it means that once a common carrier does this he can, because he charges something less than the maximum charge, contract out of all responsibility for the goods carried and that will be the general effect hereafter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask Deputy McGilligan whether he has in mind that under his amendment offences against the Act could only be checked outside the exempted areas.  If people who are licensed carriers are to be at liberty, once they get inside the 15 miles radius in Dublin, if they are to be subject to no restrictions, will not that debar any attempt to administer the Act inside the area so far as offences outside are concerned?  I will give an example.  If there is a lorry coming from Galway, say, and somewhere this side of Leixlip it picks up a box of eggs, if there is an attempt made inside the area to check whether or not there is a licence, obviously it could not be done.  The only place that adherence to the licence could be checked is outside the 15 miles radius. I wonder what has Deputy McGilligan to say on that?  Would he have it that there would be no such thing as checking the licence or checking obedience to the licence if the lorry has come within the 15 miles radius?</P>

There is no administrative difficulty there.</P>

The offence may be committed outside the radius and if the Guards outside the radius do not check it, then it must go on.  Obviously the Guards within the radius would have no means of checking it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) (b), page 5, line 59, to delete the words &ldquo;1st day of July&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;9th day of February&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is something in the nature of harking back to the amendment that was discussed at such great length earlier to-night, but there is some little difference in it.  The scheme is that the existing carrier applies for a licence and, in addition to giving certain specified particulars, he is asked to state the number of mechanically propelled vehicles which, on any specified date between certain named dates selected by the applicant, comply with certain conditions.  I want to enlarge those dates and to give a full period of a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of these conditions, as it stands, is that the vehicles were duly licensed under a particular section of the Finance Act as amended by subsequent enactments.  I, at any rate, see the likelihood of a peculiar situation arising of a person having an ordinary transport business for the carriage of merchandise, but having it confined mainly to, say, a quarter of the year, or six months of the year, but not the six months here mentioned, and having vehicles which possibly might not have been licensed for a particular quarter, but that his whole fleet of vehicles would never be represented by the vehicles which he had licensed at any time unless you give him the full run of the year.  You are covering all the normal periods that way.  You <Col N="1637" /> have suggested, therefore, that the number of vehicles under which the unladen weight, particulars and conditions, will afterwards apply should be the number of vehicles which he had at any specified time on the road within an operative period of 12 months.  I have an amendment down later on to remove this condition about licensing, because I do not regard that as a fair test.  As to the appeal from that test of licensing, whether it remains or not, if you limit a person to a period you are not giving that person what the appeal set out to give him, namely, the right to describe the maximum number of vehicles which he had on the road at a particular period and to get the unladen weight of these registered as the unladen weight on which he would operate in future.  There is a special application here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that what the Deputy suggests is practicable, in view of the fact that the dates in sub-section (2) have not been changed.  It is clear that if the qualifying period is between the 1st July, 1932, and the 8th February, 1933, the vehicles used by the applicant during that period must be taken into consideration when fixing the extent of his business.  I do not know if the Deputy is pressing the amendment at this stage, or linking it up definitely with an amendment to delete paragraph 1 of sub-section (2).</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If discussed together they will serve equally well.  My point of view is that we must apply this test in relation to each application; were the vehicles, said to have been used in connection with the road transport business, actually licensed under the Finance Act, 1920, as amended by subsequent enactments?  There is no other test practicable.  The applicant may have in his garage broken-down cars capable of being used, and if any other period were brought into operation in the giving of licences it might permit of considerable extension of the business, the replacing of cars with new cars, as an applicant is permited to do, <Col N="1638" /> or representing his business as being of greater extent than it actually was for the purpose of raising the acquisition price.  I do not think any hardship is liable to be caused to anyone by having the extent to which that person was involved in road transport business determined by the actual number of lorries licensed and used in connection with the business during the eight months' period.  It is a fair test as it is, and is one that can be easily applied.  It should commend itself to the Dáil. If it can be shown that it is unfair or that any anomaly will arise in consequence of it, it can be reconsidered. That has not been shown and I doubt very much if it can be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>One anomaly that may arise might be in the case where on the 9th April of the present year there were a number of lorries on order, or ready for delivery or not completed.  They were intended for the carrying trade and I think there should be some provision to deal with cases like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very useful point for the second amendment I have put in.  I do not think this amendment is necessarily blocked or logically hindered by what we have passed in the definition of &ldquo;existing carrier.&rdquo;  You might say that you define an existing carrier as one who carried on between the 1st July, 1932, and the 8th February, 1933.  It might not be the most logical to say that the number of vehicles specified was the greatest number used at any time in the year dating back from the 8th February, 1933.  It seems that the presumption is entirely in favour of the full year.  Let a man take what he has been using at any time, or even by making some amendment in the phrase, &ldquo;any time,&rdquo; let it be &ldquo;usually&rdquo; in the course of the period, not limited to any period.  Let it be that the vehicles must have been in operation by him for the purposes of his business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point which arises is that the test for the licence is an entirely different thing.  You are going to allow an applicant to elevate <Col N="1639" /> a number for the purpose of a numerical test.  The Minister limits him further by saying that whatever vehicles he has had at any time, even within a limited period, must comply with the qualifying condition.  I read that as within the envelope of the time limitation, and that the phrase &ldquo;duly licensed&rdquo; will mean &ldquo;duly licensed&rdquo; within that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case that Deputy Moore gave.  It was one that did not occur to me, where a man has vehicles on order, but which are not delivered, or, if delivered, he does not see himself getting full value out of them and reserves the taking out of licences to the beginning of the next quarter in April.  He has certainly bought the vehicles for the purpose of his business.  Why should he not be allowed to count them in?  They do not comply with the Minister's qualifying test.  When a man has a fleet of lorries and puts them aside&mdash;a certain number for repairs and for overhaul&mdash; maybe because he sees a slackness in a certain season, although they may be wanted for peak periods&mdash;saying &ldquo;I will not licence a number of them. I will save the licence payments.&rdquo;  If it happens in one period that he has not complied with the necessary conditions they are not &ldquo;duly licensed.&rdquo; Whatever is to be said about the enlargement of the time, there is a great deal to be said for cutting out as a qualifying condition that they were duly licensed under a particular section of the Finance Act.  I suggest that the qualifying condition should be that they were in use or were available for the purposes of such road merchandise transport business, and the interpretation of the business would be left to the proper authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the difficulty mentioned by Deputy Moore, I do not see how that could be avoided, no matter what date we take.  If a lorry or chassis was in process of being imported to be added to a fleet, that lorry need not be rendered useless.  I have only to repeat that if a lorry is not <Col N="1640" /> licensed, and not in use in respect of road transport business, it cannot be taken into account in any test for the purpose of measuring the extent of the business.  As the Bill stands a lorry not licensed for any one of the three consecutive quarters of the year, and not used during the whole period for the purpose of the business must be deemed not to have been required in the road transport business during the period and should be definitely left out of account in measuring the extent of the business of the applicant for a licence.  On the other hand, to abolish the test of the licence would open up the way to all sorts of trickery, to bring in every character of chassis left in the applicant's yard which he had no intention of using, but which he might mention in his application in order to get an increase in the standard lorry weight which he might licence, for the purpose of replacing with new ones if it was the intention to extend the business or to raise the acquisition price.  The licence test is a fair test.  In certain cases it may operate less favourably than some other test might.  On the face of it it is fair and reasonable and should be maintained unless a much fairer and more reasonable test is shown.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Justice this afternoon to state why proceedings instituted against Richard Murphy, of County Kilkenny, for offences under the Electoral Act had <Col N="1641" /> been withdrawn.  His answer was that the local State Solicitor after investigation had reported that the charge could not be sustained.  I was not satisfied with the answer and I want to put the facts briefly before the Minister and to say that no incident has happened for a long time in the administration of the law in that particular district which has so shocked the people as the particular incident to which I refer.  A Richard Murphy was on the register as a local government elector.  It was known to everybody that that man had died some eight or ten months previous to the election.  A Richard Murphy applied for a ballot paper on the morning of the election about 9 o'clock.  He was challenged and he refused to be sworn. He was brought into the polling booth about 10 o'clock by a supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party, who is a particular friend of mine, and I want to say to his credit in this House that he absolutely refused to allow the man to be sworn.  In the afternoon, he was again brought in by a Mr. Hayes, who is a schoolmaster and who, I understand, induced him and actually insisted on his being sworn and voting. These are briefly the facts.  I believe that the Gárda Síochána, who were well aware of the facts, instituted proceedings and issued summonses to witnesses. I can tell the Minister that there is plenty of proof to sustain the statement which I have made.  Probably the case would not have such a bad aspect were it not for the fact that a teacher was responsible for the incident.  Is that the sort of man, a man who so disregards the principles of Christianity as to induce a man to commit perjury, that any Deputy would like to have in charge of his children?</P>

      <P>We shall not argue about the distance.  The position is as I stated in reply to this question to-day.  I thought that the Deputy when he was raising this matter on the adjournment would make some suggestion as to who is to blame or who is at fault with regard to this matter. The State has officials and police forces and the State has to rely on them.  I have the police report before me and the State Solicitor's letter is before me.  In that letter the State Solicitor has definitely and clearly stated that a prosecution cannot be sustained.  It was an ordinary summons. What I want to be clear about is, is the Deputy suggesting in any <Col N="1643" /> oblique way, that there was any inter ference by any State Department in stopping the prosecution?  Is he trying to have it inferred in this House that any Deputy interfered with any Department of the Government with a view to having it stopped?</P>

      <P>There has been no interference of any kind.  If the Deputy wants to go to the State Solicitor who was appointed by a Government long previous to the advent of this Government, a State Solicitor in whom they had confidence, he can get all the facts.  This matter did not come under my notice until the question was put down.  We know nothing about summonses that are <Col N="1644" /> issued.  The State Solicitors are put in that position because they have legal knowledge and they are believed to be competent to discharge the duty entrusted to them.  The State Solicitor states in the opinion given to the Gárda, that quite definitely on the evidence a prosecution could not be sustained.  Why should the State be put to expense?  Why should people be put to trouble if the view of the State official in that area was that a prosecution could not be sustained? That is the position and that is the only answer I can give.</P>
