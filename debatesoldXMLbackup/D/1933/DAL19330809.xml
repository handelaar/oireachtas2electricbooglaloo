      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state when it is intended to publish (a) the promised report on the mission of Mr. Stephen O'Mara to the United States of America; (b) a report on the objectives and results of the recent visit to the United States of America by the Minister for Lands and Fisheries; (c) an account of the activities of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries at the recent World Economic Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the question, I refer the Deputy to the reply given by me in the Dáil on the 5th day of July, 1932, to a question put down by ex-Deputy Blythe, and to the reply given on the same occasion to a supplementary question by Deputy MacDermot.  I made it clear on that occasion that the report of Mr. O'Mara's mission would not be laid before the House.  I undertook, however, to make known the result of the decisions arrived at with regard to the recommendations made in Mr. O'Mara's report.  I further indicated that full information as to the actual expenses of the mission would be given.  On the 15th March, 1933, a Supplementary Estimate was moved in the matter by the Minister for Finance, but no statement of actual expenses was asked for and the Vote went through without discussion.  On the 11th July, 1933, during the debate on the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs, I gave an account of Mr. O'Mara's mission and of the <Col N="1410" /> extension of our establishments in the United States as a result of his recommendations.  I refer the Deputy to columns 2154-2155 of Volume 48, No. 6, of the Parliamentary Debates (Dáil Eireann).</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, it is not my intention to lay before the Dáil any report relating to the recent visit of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries to the United States.</P>
      <P>With regard to the third part of the question, the documents of the World Economic Conference are public documents, and a record of the debates of the Conference is available to the Deputy in the Journal, and will be available in the Minutes of the Conference.  Copies of the Journal and the Minutes will be placed in the Library.  The statement made by the Minister for Lands and Fisheries on the 13th day of July, 1933, has already been made available to Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state what is the most recent occasion on which an approach was made to the British Government in connection with the dispute as to (a) fishery rights in Lough Foyle, and (b) jurisdiction over the waters of that Lough, and what are the results of that approach; further, if any permission was sought from the Government of the Saorstát for the use of these waters in connection with the landing and stay there recently of the Italian Air Armada; if so, on what conditions was permission granted, and, if not, was any protest on this matter addressed to the British Government and with what result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the fishing dispute in Lough Foyle has recently been the subject of correspondence between the Government of the Irish Free State and the British Government.  The two Governments are still in communication upon the matter. As regards the question of jurisdiction over the waters of the Lough the situation remains as stated in the reply given to Deputy McMenamin on the 27th October, 1932.  I then made it clear that the Government declined to submit any Treaty issue to a Commonwealth Tribunal.  The situation in that regard remains unaltered.</P>
      <P>With regard to that part of the Deputy's question which refers to the flight of the Italian Air Armada, the permission of the Government of the Irish Free State for the use of the waters of Lough Foyle in connection with the flight was requested by the Italian Government and permission was granted.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question refers to the interval which may elapse between the issue of land bonds to credit of an estate vested in the Land Commission and the distribution of the bonds to the persons entitled thereto.  I would point out, however, that under the provisions of Section 9 of the Land Act, 1931, land bonds to the value of £14,000,000 were issued to the credit of some 5,200 estates in May and November, 1931, and it is obviously impossible to distribute this vast sum without due investigation of the owners' titles.  The allocation of the purchase moneys depends on the priority of the respective estates and the clearing of the owners' titles to the satisfaction of the Land Commission examiner.  Every effort is being made to effect the examination of title as rapidly as possible, and meanwhile owners are entitled to make application under Section 36 of the Land Act, 1931, that the dividends on land bonds yet undistributed shall be paid to them as they accrue due.</P>

    <P>No recruiting for the Gárda Síochána has taken place since February, 1932. <Col N="1425" /> The strength of the force has consequently been reduced by the ordinary process of deaths, retirements, etc.  In view of recent developments in the country and in view of the fact that public buildings were considered to be inadequately protected, permission was given to the Commissioner to reopen recruiting for the Gárda.

The Bill as introduced to-day is &ldquo;a Bill entitled an Act to make provision for the orderly and progressive development of cities, towns, and other areas, whether urban or rural, and to preserve and improve the amenities thereof and for other matters connected therewith.&rdquo;  If that Bill is really to be carried out I would be willing to postpone consideration of this matter until the Town Planning Bill comes on, but up to the present I have had no indication that the Bill to be brought in will include such places as tourist centres and seaside resorts which will in the future require proper landing facilities.  If the Minister can tell us that the coming Bill will be able to deal with such matters then perhaps it would be better to postpone consideration of the provision of facilities for local authorities to obtain land for landing grounds until that time.  Perhaps the Minister would inform us on the point.</P>

      <P>In page 24, Section 34, line 21, to delete the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;subsequent&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment really for the purpose of ascertaining from the Minister his reason for introducing Section 34 into this Bill at all.  As far as I am aware this Bill deals with only four or five cases.  There are only four or five cases where the Land Commission has withdrawn from acquisition proceedings because of the price fixed by the judicial commissioner.  In some of those cases I do know that the Land Commission subsequently proceeded to acquire a small area of land from the tenant or proprietor, which in the opinion of the Land Commission was considered suitable for the purpose of relieving the congestion prevailing in that particular area.  I think it is grossly unfair to those tenants that they should be treated in the manner which the Minister proposes under this particular section.  They were first of all notified by the Land <Col N="1435" /> Commission that it was proposed to acquire their land.  Subsequently they were notified by the Land Commission that they had withdrawn from the proceedings. In certain cases as I say the Land Commission subsequently, by arrangement with the proprietor, acquired a certain portion of his land for the purpose of dealing with the congestion in the particular neighbourhood. In the meantime that tenant may have proceeded to spend a certain amount of money in developing and improving that land.  After the spending of that money, and after the Land Commission, by virtue of their withdrawal from the proceedings, giving the tenant a certain extra vested right in those lands, the Minister now proposes to come along and take the balance of the lands from him.  I wonder was the Minister really aware of the nature of the hardship which he was inflicting on this class of tenants when he introduced this section.  I should be glad if the Minister would give us some explanation as to what is his real intention in incorporating a section of that kind in the Bill.</P>

The Deputy will notice that in several sections we are taking power, where there was a seven years' stay, to reopen the case immediately after the passing of this Act, and then allow the seven years' stay to operate in the future.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister will appreciate that some of those tenants are in a different category from the tenants with whom he has dealt in other sections of this Bill.  Take the case of the tenant I mentioned a moment ago who was notified by the Land Commission that they had withdrawn from the proceedings.  That tenant was subsequently approached by the Land Commission, and by mutual agreement between the Land Commission and the tenant a certain area of land was acquired, which area was, in the opinion of the Land Commission, adequate to deal with congestion in the area of this particular land.  That tenant, by virtue of the security which he assumed he possessed, or at least should possess, probably proceeded to spend quite a substantial sum of money in improving and developing that land.  The Minister will recognise that in view of what happened in the past, in view of the fact that the Land Commission had to withdraw from the proceedings initiated compulsorily to acquire the land, that he has got a vested right in the land and his case is in a somewhat different category from the case of the ordinary tenant.  Surely the Minister will recognise that in bare justice and in equity that tenant deserves some special consideration.  That tenant may have spent quite a substantial sum of money on the land.  I have in mind one case at the moment where I understand the tenant has spent some £400 or £500 in developing the portion of the land left to him by the Land Commission.  Now the Minister comes along and by virtue of this section takes power to acquire that land from the tenant.  The Minister will recognise and appreciate that this section will involve a certain hardship on a tenant of that kind.  As I say, there are only three or four cases altogether.  I do not imagine that a case has arisen since I left the Land Commission.  Certainly in two or three of these cases the Land Commission acquired, by mutual arrangements with tenants, an area of land sufficient to deal with the problem of congestion in the neighbourhood of the land which they proceeded originally to acquire compulsorily.</P>

      <P>This amendment has reference to Section 36.  There are other cases where damage is sometimes caused by embankments.  I mean that permanent flooding or what is tantamount to permanent flooding is caused sometimes by breaches in embankments. It appears to me that if the Minister is going to deal with all cases, as presumably it is his intention to deal with all cases, where land is subject to permanent flooding, he should take into consideration as well cases where land has been flooded, almost permanently flooded for many years past, on account of breaches or certain imperfections in an embankment.  There are some cases in Limerick and a few other cases in Waterford.  The later sections of the Bill do not deal with these.  There is a provision in the Bill dealing with embankments but it does not deal with the annuity on the part submerged.</P>

      <P>Very well.  Take the case of land that is eroded or inundated by rivers or inland waters of any kind: if the land has sufficiently deteriorated by reason of these periodic submersions, is that land to be deemed to be permanently submerged?  If such land is deemed to be permanently submerged, the fortunes of every farmer in a drainage area are going to be affected.

      <P>I think the Minister himself is not convinced of the full significance of this amendment.  It has to be read in conjunction with Section 36 (1). The relevant words of the amendment are: &ldquo;Land which is periodically covered by tidal water or is by reason of coastal or other erosion or other similar cause incapable of being cultivated or used for purposes of agriculture or pasture.&rdquo;  Therefore, I say, that leaves the Land Commission open to a case being made against them that certain inland waters periodically submerge certain lands and, as a result of that, these lands are no longer fitted for the purposes of agricultural pasturage or cultivation.  If that is so, Section 36 will apply and the Minister will have to decide what part of the land is so destroyed and what portion is not destroyed and he will be obliged to remit the annuities on the portion destroyed.  How on earth can the Minister get away from that?  I take it that submergence by a river is the same as submergence by tidal waters.</P>

If this application is not dealt with until A has married B the point can be raised that B, owning lands put in settlement, had already got the maximum advance.

The point could be raised that as the husband had already got the maximum amount of advance that could be made to him, therefore no further advance could be made.  Such a case as that might arise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 44:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 26, Section 40, to add at the end of sub-section (2) the following proviso:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided that where the rent payable is in the opinion of the Land Commission less than the rent which would have been the fair rent on the 9th day of August, 1923, the standard purchase annuity shall be an annuity of an amount not exceeding 90 per cent. nor less than 65 per cent. of the rent, having regard to the security for such rent.</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to take into account security for rent in fixing the purchase money.  Under Section 44 of the Land Act of 1931 rents on long leases or fee farm grants could be bought up by the tenant on the basis of a judicial rent provided that the rent was not less than a second term judicial rent.  That is a principle that is being observed in practice, but the present Bill puts all rents on the same basis.</P>

      <P>As the law stands, when one of these applications is granted, the land becomes tenanted land and the rent is then treated as non-judicial and a standard purchase annuity is fixed automatically under Section 2 of the 1929 Act at 65 per cent. of the rent. There is no good reason why the law applicable to a non-judicial holding, whatever the rent, whether greater, equal to, or less than a fair rent, should not continue to apply to fee farm rents.  If the landlord is not satisfied he can appeal.</P>

      <P>In page 27 to insert a new section before Section 41 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> A holding of untenanted land held under fee farm grant, or leave for lives, or years renewable for ever, or lease for a term of years of which 60 or more were unexpired at the date of the passing of the Land Act, 1923, and which at the date of the passing of this Act is substantially agricultural and pastoral, and worked in accordance with the ordinary methods of husbandary, and the rent payable in respect of such parcel is greater than what would have been a fair rent of such parcel at the date of the passing of the Land Act, 1923, if it had been held by such owner under a statutory tenancy subject to a third term judicial rent, shall not be excluded from the provisions of the Land Act, 1923, and of Acts amending and extending that Act in virtue of which lands are vested in the Land Commission as tenanted lands on the appointed day by reason only that the said parcel is or is held in connection with a demesne, home farm, park, garden, or pleasure-ground.</P>
    <P>This amendment covers a case that has not been covered under previous Land Acts.  It refers to a case where a portion of land might be held as a home farm, park or pleasure-ground, or in connection with a residential holding which was excluded definitely from all Land Acts since 1903.  As I understand the position, a residential holding had what might be called certain protection under the Land Acts, whereby it would not be taken for resumption, but as an off-set to that, none of the benefits of the Land Acts were given by way of a reduction of rent.  This is a case of a long lease taken out in days when rents were very much higher than they are now.  These rents remain on that portion of the land still, and were definitely excluded, under the Land Acts of 1923 and 1931, from any reductions.  Now that there is a change in the Land Bill, as we are considering taking away the protection or resumption in a case where the land is being used &ldquo;substantially agricultural and pastoral, and worked in accordance with the ordinary methods of husbandry,&rdquo; the owners of such parcels of land might get the benefit of <Col N="1449" /> reductions in the rents.  If they are being asked to pay 50/- or £3 for an Irish acre, as was the case some years ago, that is now an uneconomic proposition. Where such land is being worked I suggest that that is in line with the Government policy to produce food, is in line with all land legislation to reduce rents, and is in line with the needs of the present time, to give employment.</P>
    <P>Without elaborating the matter, the owner of a parcel of land, using it in accordance with the ordinary methods of husbandry, who gives employment should, at least, be treated as a judicial tenant or as the holder of a lease of another portion of the land is. I suppose there are cases of this kind throughout the Free State.  There would not be many of them.  I know one case where about 85 people are supported, and yet the owner of that land cannot get any reduction, because his lease was taken out about 100 years ago.  The leaseholder holds him to it because he has collateral security, in that the man has a residential holding in the Free State on which he resides.  If this amendment is not passed, I suggest that the absentee will be established in his rack-rent, and that no relief will be given to the occupier of land who is a resident, and who gives employment as well as taking his share in the life of the community.  As the amendment is a reasonable one, I commend it to the Minister.  It is drafted as narrowly as I could draft it in order to cover only agricultural and pastoral land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spoke to me about this amendment and I carefully examined the whole matter.  I had the Department working on it for some time.  If the amendment was admitted it would follow logically that the benefits of the Land Acts would go to all residential holders.  We are not prepared to do that in these cases. The amendment is much more far-reaching than the Deputy thinks.  We had it examined in view of the fact that it would be extended to all residential holdings, home farms or demesnes held on fee farm grants or short leases and we could not open the <Col N="1450" /> door to that.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the amendment would not open the door to all residential holdings.  My amendment specifically states that it is to apply only where the rent payable in respect of such parcels of land is greater than it would be if it was a fair rent.  In the main the rent in respect of a residential holder is not greater.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister accepted the amendment could he state what number of holdings it would apply to? I realise the Minister's difficulty perfectly well when dealing with land held under a fee farm grant or a long lease and I realise that a rigid line must be drawn somewhere.  Under existing land legislation you cannot, as far as I can see, include every type of long leaseholder and every type of fee farm grant.  It seems that the leaseholder for whom Deputy Haslett speaks has a grievance, in the sense that he is working the land according to proper methods of husbandry.  Obviously he is an up-to-date farmer.  It is impossible to carry on farming in existing conditions because of the exorbitant rent he is paying for the land.  It was always the intention&mdash;it was certainly the intention in the Act of 1923&mdash;to go as far as possible to bring some sort of relief to a tenant of that type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We went a stage in the Act of 1927 and a still further stage in the Act of 1931.  A somewhat similar case was brought to my notice before the Act of 1931 was finally passed but it was too late to introduce an amendment.  As a matter of fact I think the Minister will find on the Land Commission files records of certain correspondence that took place between Land Commission officials and certain outside solicitors regarding a few cases of this kind.  At the time I felt that this type of tenant had undoubtedly a grievance.  I felt that it was the duty of the Land Commission to try to meet that type of case, if a legal means could be found of doing so.  I suggest to the Minister that he might give this matter some further consideration.  If he looks up the records he will find that some <Col N="1451" /> correspondence took place about this type of case.  Perhaps the Minister might find some ways and means of meeting Deputy Haslett's amendment in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I do feel that this type of tenant is a very good farmer and should be encouraged.  He is the type of farmer who, under existing conditions, cannot be expected to meet his liabilities because of the exorbitant rent he has to pay.  It is perfectly true that in many cases these tenants are paying as high as £2, £3, and £4 an acre. This Bill does not hold out any relief for that type of tenant.  I think Deputy Haslett has made a good case for consideration, and I suggest that the Minister should give the amendment further examination before the Bill passes through the Seanad. Perhaps he may be able to introduce some sort of amendment that will meet Deputy Haslett's point.</P>

      <P>In page 27 to insert a new section before Section 41 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided that where an application has been refused on the ground that the parcel of land to which the same relates is usually occupied in connection with a demesne, home farm, park, garden or pleasure-ground, and provided also that the parcel at the date of the passing of this Act is substantially agricultural and pastoral and worked in accordance with the ordinary methods of husbandry, the applicant may within the prescribed time after such refusal, surrender the parcel to the person in receipt of the rent or reversion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> In view of what the Minister said, perhaps he is prepared to accept this amendment.  I do not think the Minister takes the view that he should penalise a man because he is a resident in the State and tills his land. As regards these cases that would be covered by the amendment, I cannot say they are supporters of mine and I am not speaking from that particular point of view.  I am bringing this matter forward in the interests of fair play and in order to give justice to the residents of the Free State.  We should encourage people who are willing to carry on, to spend money with us and to give employment.  I suggest that if this type of person is thrown out, has his application refused under any of the Acts, he should be given power to surrender his lease to the lessor.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back on the amendment that has been disposed of further than to say that surely the ingenuity of the Land Commission should be such as that it would give such person or number of persons, as Deputy Roddy instances, some relief in carrying on the nation's work. Where a person is excluded, where his application has been refused, I am setting out that the applicant may within the prescribed time after such refusal surrender the parcel to the person in receipt of the rent or reversion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 27, Section 41 (b), to delete all words after the word <Col N="1453" />&ldquo;sufficient,&rdquo; line 33, to the end of the paragraph, line 36.</P>
    <P>Section 41 deals with compounded arrears of rents charged on holdings which are sub-let.  The section provides that where an additional annuity in repayment of compounded arrears of rent has been charged on a holding which is wholly or partially sub-let and the sub-tenants have been declared to be direct tenants, certain provisions shall apply.  Paragraph (a) provides:</P>
    <P>(a) each such sub-tenant shall be entitled to credit for so much of the said compounded arrears of rent as is repayable by the portion of the said additional annuity charged on his separate holding as against the arrears of rent, if any, due and payable by him to his immediate landlord;</P>
    <P>The sub-section to which I suggest the amendment is (b), which provides:</P>
    <P>if there are no arrears of rent due by such sub-tenant, or if the amount of the compounded arrears of rent so repayable as aforesaid exceeds the amount of the arrears of rent due by such sub-tenant, the portion of such additional annuity charged on his separate holding or so much of the said portion of the said additional annuity as represents the excess of the said compounded arrears of rent over the arrears of rent due by such sub-tenant (as the case may be) shall be redeemed out of the intervening interest of his immediate landlord</P>
    <P>That is quite all right, but it provides further:</P>
    <P>so far as the redemption price of such intervening interest, after discharging claims in respect of unpaid instalments of payment in lieu of rent or annual sums or additional sums (if any) is sufficient</P>
    <P>That is all right so far, but it goes on:</P>
    <P>and, to the extent that such intervening interest is not so sufficient, out of the sum added to the purchase money of the holding for compounded arrears of rent;</P>
    <P>The last portion of the sub-section might work an injustice on persons entitled to the sum added to the purchase money for compounded arrears <Col N="1454" /> of rent.  They are persons who can receive only the amount due to them as compounded arrears of rent and they should not be affected by the relations between their tenants and sub-tenants. They should not be made to provide for a deficiency in the amount of money due by one under-tenant to another under-tenant.  That last section penalises them for something for which they should not be made liable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If the amendment were accepted it would have the effect of leaving the sub-tenant liable for arrears due by the middleman.  It might be necessary for the State to come to the sub-tenant's assistance. We could not leave the sub-tenant burdened by arrears due by the middleman.</P>

      <P>In page 28, Section 44, lines 15, 19, 21 and 28, to delete the figures &ldquo;1933&rdquo; and substitute the figures &ldquo;1943&rdquo; in each line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This deals with the question of building ground.  I think, perhaps, in suggesting 1943 I am asking for too much. I think the hardship in the section is <Col N="1455" /> that it effects an immediate closedown without any notice to people with potential building ground.  It does not give them any <i>locus pxnitentix.</i> Different places are affected by various circumstances and by the financial position of persons.  Where people have potential building ground they may not have the money available at the moment for development or they may be waiting in the hope that they will get better terms for letting building ground; they may be hoping for better conditions in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is harsh to set down a date which is now actually passed as the crucial date for the purpose of this section. Some time ought to be allowed to persons with ground of this character to enable them to develop it as building ground instead of shutting them down as from 28th June of the present year. The Minister should consider some extension of time in cases where persons have such land and are prepared to develop it in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>I certainly remember cases where a lot of hardship was caused to people who were tenants of such land through the landlords refusing to allow them to purchase because of the alleged potential building value of the land.  If these lands really are of potential building value the landlord should have proceeded to develop them.  I know of cases where the tenants, through their forefathers were 170 years in occupation of holdings and these people were thrown out on the road because of this potential building value.  I do not think that that is fair. For that reason I do not see my way to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>I would accept this amendment only as a <i>pis aller</i> because in my opinion the treatment that land of potential building value received under the 1923 Act and under the sections amending that in this Bill is fundamentally wrong.  The moment an Act of this Oireachtas describes land as having potential building value that is then admitted and therefore you have a situation in which that land has a certain value as agricultural land <Col N="1456" /> plus x, which is its added value as being potential building land.  This House comes along and says: &ldquo;if you do not develop x within a certain time we are going to confiscate it; we are not going to buy it from you.  We are not going to fix the price on its agricultural value plus x, but if you do not develop it within a certain time we are going to fix a price based on the agricultural value and we are going to confiscate x, the potential building value.&rdquo; I think that is beyond the competence of this House to do.  I do not think they had any right to do it.  I do not know whether under the provisions of the Land Acts any undeveloped building lands have been acquired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission says: &ldquo;you have land and it has agricultural value and building value.  If you do not build within a certain time we will take over its agricultural value and convey it to the tenant.&rdquo;  Is not that what is being done?  Is not that correct?  I say that is wrong.  If the Land Commission makes up its mind that that land is required for the relief of congestion I think they should have the right to acquire it.  It is the charge of the State to compensate the landlord for the additional building value.  I think it ought to be made a burden on the taxpayer.  It is part of a great social work that the State is doing.  There are a few selected cases of this kind where the land has a double value.  The purchasing tenant should be made liable for the agricultural value of the land, but the State should undertake to compensate the owner of the land, for the value inherent in it, the existence of which the State admits.  It does not matter <Col N="1457" /> how long the land remains undeveloped. The State, in my opinion, is not acting rightly in confiscating that land.  They have the right to compulsorily acquire it and pay for it if they take it, seeing that it is for the public good, but they have no right to confiscate it.  Personally, I would challenge a division on Section 44 on the Committee Stage, had the opportunity offered.  That opportunity is not now available, and in default of that, I would prefer to postpone the critical date as far as possible.  The effect of Deputy Rice's amendment is to postpone the critical date for ten years.  On these grounds I propose to support the amendment.</P>

It would be the State taking something which it had created.</P>

      <P>I am a disciple of commonsense and if that principle had been adopted in 1870 it would have been a good thing for the country. This thing slowed up the acquisition of land.  Because land has a potential building value, no matter in what part of the world it is.  When that potential building value becomes let us say x, and when x takes the form of plus one or two, that value has been created by the community.  I am not satisfied at all if I could see a simple way out of it to give this x this building ground value to the tenant, but I think the tenant has a much better right to it than the landlord.  I gave you an instance of a case where a man <Col N="1458" /> and his family before him were the tenants of land for 170 years and that man was thrown out on the roadside and the full building ground value of the land given to the landlord, who has never seen it and never did anything for the land.  If anybody has helped to create a site value in that land it is the tenant who lived on it.  That is my conviction.  At any rate, I do not intend to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 51:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 28 to add at the end of Section 45 the following proviso:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided that such development does not adversely affect the rights of tenants of the bog or make any undue encroachment on the future necessary supply of turbary for the said tenants and is approved by a majority of such tenants in the case of each bog.</P>
      <P>The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The powers of the Land Commission to acquire any bog for the purpose of providing turbary for the occupiers of land shall be and are hereby extended so as to include the acquisition of bog for the purpose of the development thereof for such other purposes as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, shall approve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must, in the first place, protest against the Minister legislating for the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the very important question of turbary. This is the first time in any Land Act, so far as I am aware, that the Minister has introduced legislation enabling the Minister of another Department to utilise turbary for the purpose of carrying out certain experiments. The Minister knows perfectly well that in many parts of the country there is very great scarcity of turbary. The Attorney-General knows well that in many parts of the West&mdash;even in his <Col N="1459" /> native County of Mayo&mdash;there is a very great scarcity of turbary.  Yet the Minister, in this section, proposes to give power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to utilise that turbary for the carrying out of certain experiments. We have no indication of what the experiments are to be.  We know that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is full of enthusiasm for the development of industry.  In one of these transports of enthusiasm he may see fit to utilise a very important section of bog in a part of the country where there may be already a great scarcity of bog.  I made the point on Second Reading that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce wants bog for the purpose of carrying out any one of his experiments, he should enter the market in the ordinary way and buy bog at the ordinary commercial price. He should not be facilitated in securing that bog at Land Commission prices or value.  If bog is taken for the purpose of carrying out experiments of that kind it is quite legitimate to assume that that bog will not be available for the purposes for which bog is ordinarily and normally intended&mdash;to provide fuel for the tenants on that particular estate or for tenants bordering on that estate.  The amendment which I propose provides that if the bog is required for fuel for the tenants themselves, then the Minister shall not have the right to take over any part of it for the purpose of carrying out any one of his experiments and, furthermore, that the Minister shall not have the right to acquire a bog for the purpose of carrying out any one of his experiments unless the majority of the tenants are agreeable.  I stated at the outset that there is a great scarcity of turbary in many parts of the country.  There are certain areas where there is a plentiful supply of turbary.  If the Minister should, under any circumstances, consider it necessary to acquire turbary for the purpose of his experiments, then I submit that his power to acquire should be limited to those areas in which there is a plentiful supply. Furthermore, in no case should the Minister be allowed to acquire turbary for carrying out any one of his experiments <Col N="1460" /> unless that turbary is to be utilised for a purpose related, in some way, to the purpose for which turbary is normally and naturally used.  There is a danger that this section will impose a hardship, and a very serious hardship, on very big sections of the people, particularly in the West.  Under no circumstances, in my view, would the Minister be justified in allowing any other Minister to interfere with the rights of the Land Commission in disposing of turbary for the one purpose for which it was intended&mdash;to provide fuel for the tenants on the estate in question or tenants on a neighbouring estate.  For those reasons, I move my amendment.</P>

      <P>I think that the Deputy's amendment is altogether unnecessary. It is one of the first functions of the Land Commission to provide turbary for tenants.  The Deputy will remember that under Section 37 of the 1923 Act the power of the Land Commission to acquire untenanted land was extended to acquiring bog.  The section states:</P>
      <P>The powers of the Land Commission under this Act to acquire any untenanted land shall include power so to acquire any bog for the purpose of providing turbary for the occupiers of land in the neighbourhood thereof, whether the said bog is or is not subject to any right of turbary of other persons than the owner.</P>
      <P>The section concludes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In exercising the powers given by this section, the Land Commission shall have due regard to the reasonable requirements of the owner.</P>
      <P>That section has not been annulled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This gives rise to difficulties of very grave significance I challenge the right of the Land Commission to go romping into any man's property compulsorily to acquire it for any and every purpose they like.  To my mind there ought to be very grave reasons before you permit the Land Commission compulsorily to acquire any man's property, be it landlord's property or tenant's property or anybody else's.  The relief of congestion and the general purpose of land legislation in this country were a very grave reason.  It was only after very careful consideration of the gravity of the reasons justifying land purchase that the business of land purchase was embarked upon.  That is a very different story from providing a plaything for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What may be a very valuable industry when the Minister for Industry and Commerce starts with it may turn out to be a rattle by the time he is finished.  This House has no reason to have any faith whatever in the schemes fathered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. This section gives him power, without regard to the rights of adjoining tenants, without regard to the rights of the owner of the bog, compulsorily to acquire bog through the Land Commission &ldquo;for the purpose of the development thereof for such other purposes as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, shall approve.&rdquo;  By what authority does this House propose compulsorily to acquire an individual's land for that purpose?  What grave social benefit is going to be conferred upon the State by giving the Minister for Industry and Commerce an opportunity of trying out experiments on the bogs of this country?  If he wants to try out an experiment why cannot he buy a piece of bog in the ordinary course of business and try out his experiment there?  Is not that the normal and sensible way to do it?  If you are <Col N="1463" /> going to give him the right compulsorily to acquire land for this purpose, why should not the Government have the right compulsorily to acquire land for any purpose?  Why should a citizen have any rights as against the Government at all in property?  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have the right compulsorily to acquire turbary for the purposes of an experiment, then there are a hundred and one other reasons for which the Government ought to have the right compulsorily to acquire property of every kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that doctrine be accepted by the House it is a new doctrine to me.  As I understand it, the right of any man to his own private property in this State will not be interfered with except when that right conflicts gravely and seriously with the public good, and that then, and only then, the State will intervene, providing full compensation, and will make available to the community the property which is essential to its welfare.  That is a very dangerous doctrine.  If you start expanding that doctrine it is very difficult to say where you will stop.  I consider the expansion that is being embarked upon here is of a very dangerous character.  I can see no reason which would not be equally good as the one here given to justify the compulsory acquisition of bog.  The amendment in the name of Deputy Roddy provides the very minimum of safeguard, and without dwelling on the principle to which I have referred, the general principle underlying the whole purpose, this amendment seeks to provide that that compulsory acquisition will not take place at the instance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce where it interferes with the rights of tenants of the bog or makes any undue encroachment on the future necessary supply of turbary.  I am not aware that under any previous Act the Land Commission had the right to acquire bog from tenant purchasers. They had, under the 1931 Act, I think, the right to acquire rights-of-way and such like over a bog, but I am not aware that prior to this Bill the Land Commission had any right whatever <Col N="1464" /> under any circumstances to acquire bog that had vested in the tenants.</P>

      <P>Will Deputy Roddy explain what he means by the tenants of the bog?  I think, in many cases, the word &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; would be wrong. In many cases, I think, the system is that tenants on the estate of which the bog is part have had turbary rights, but they could not be regarded as tenants.  In many cases these rights are not being exercised by the people who were originally the owners. People who had such rights have ceased to use turf; they use coal and their neighbours took over that right and have been in possession of it for years.  When you come to the last lines of Deputy Roddy's amendment, &ldquo;and is approved by a majority of such tenants,&rdquo; are the tenants to be the people who have had at some period or other the rights to which I refer? Are they to be a majority of the people with rights regardless of whether they exercise them or not?  In that case you could have people coming along who ceased to use turf and were using coal.  Whatever may be said about the principle of the amendment I think its wording is defective.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore has rather adroitly laid stress upon the last lines of Deputy Roddy's amendment. He does not refer at all to the other parts of the amendment.  It seemed to me hardly possible that the Minister could reject this amendment.  The amendment starts out by stating that the Minister ought not to have the <Col N="1465" /> right to interfere in what would adversely affect the rights of tenants or make undue encroachment on their rights.  Does the Minister reject that? Does he intend to permit encroachments upon the future turbary of the tenants?  Is he still to be entitled to allow the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come in and take over bogs in this fashion.  Personally, I thought this amendment would be accepted without any demur whatever. When the Government lays such great stress upon the supply of home fuel in this country I do not at all think they are acting up to their own principles when they try to do things that would adversely affect the users of home fuel and the supply of that particular commodity. I thought that this would be regarded as one of the most necessary amendments and the one amendment, at all events, that would be accepted without demur by the Government.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is satisfied and the Attorney-General is satisfied that there is no danger to the individual owner, what is the necessity for this section?  The Bill has already been described as a &ldquo;confiscation Land Act.&rdquo;  Certainly this is a confiscation-of-turbary section.  Those who know the country realise how important turbary is to people and, however desirable it is to prevent people from burning coal in this country, people who for years have had the right of turbary should not now by this unfortunate section be deprived of their rights.  If they are covered already by Section 37 of the Land Act of 1923, and if their rights are preserved, why not re-ensure the preservation of these rights by accepting this amendment.  After all Section 37 of the Act of 1923 dealt only with the existing tenants&mdash;those owners who are using the bog.  This is a case where the Ministry or the State themselves are deciding to take over the turbary.  I must say I have never, since this Bill began to be discussed, felt more need for an answer from the Minister.  No possible explanation has been given as to why this amendment should not be accepted.  Here they say there is to be confiscation for experimental purposes. If you take over these rights or the ownership, whether it is a quarter of an acre or a thousand acres, for State purposes it is confiscation. If this House refuses to accept this amendment it will refuse to the individual tenants and owners a right over their own property, and will put them in the position that, whatever the Government of this country may be, they will have the right to tell the tenants or the owners that they must use coal or turf as the case may be, because there is likely to be a continuation of that very interesting <Col N="1467" /> scheme called the Economic War. &ldquo;You must burn turf, you may not burn coal.  You may say you have no turf, but our answer is we will get it for you.&rdquo;  Then they will say: &ldquo;There is such and such a bog; we will take it over.&rdquo;  Someone else may say: &ldquo;There are 30, 40 or 50 people interested and their children will require that bog,&rdquo; but the Government will answer: &ldquo;Not at all; people must burn turf, and we will take that bog to supply them with turf.&rdquo;  This is the most severe section in the Bill from the point of view of confiscation.  I am certain if the Minister would only realise how serious it is, he would accept this amendment.  Deputy Moore spoke about the original owners. I do not know who the original owner is of any bog in the world.</P>

There are people living to-day who have these rights and it is for them we are legislating.  It is not for Brian Boru and those people who came before the Fianna Fáil Party came into existence.  Of course the Fianna Fáil Party people have their rights too and we are preserving such rights for them.  We are preserving those rights for people who are alive to-day and for the next generation.  Do not let us talk nonsense about original owners.  I am not a geologist, but I believe the flood may be responsible for some of those bogs.

Years and years ago he ceased to use them.  He <Col N="1468" /> has still the right, because he was a tenant on the estate of which the bog was part.  He enjoys that right, but he has ceased to use it.  His neighbour has taken over the right; he uses it now.  Whether he has a legal right or not I cannot say.  Simply because it was not being used by the man who came into possession of it 30 or 40 years ago his neighbour now uses it. Before raising the question as to which of them is to have the vote, is the majority, which Deputy Roddy wants, to be made up of people who have ceased to take an interest in it for years past?</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that the words in the 1923 Act hardly go far enough for the present occasion.  They merely say that, in exercising the powers, the Land Commission shall have due regard to the reasonable requirements of the owner.  That does not exactly suggest that they shall refrain from exercising their powers altogether if it would be a hardship on the owner.  It merely suggests that they should make what concessions they can.  In the second place it refers only to the owner, whereas we want, in addition, to protect the people who have rights to turbary.  I would suggest again that perhaps we might strike out the word &ldquo;future&rdquo; if that causes embarrassment. <Col N="1470" /> We might say &ldquo;provided that such development does not make any undue encroachment on the necessary supply of turbary for the tenants of the bog or persons having rights to the bog,&rdquo; or something of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not really attempted to offer any answer to the arguments put up by this side. I know as well as the Minister the powers conferred on the Land Commission by Section 37 of the Act of 1923, but Deputies of the House must remember that this section proposes to extend the powers under Section 37 of the Act of 1923.  This section goes far beyond the powers given to the Land Commission under Section 37 of the Act of 1923.  This section gives the Land Commission powers which it was never contemplated they should have under the previous Land Act.  This section extends the powers under Section 37 of the Land Act 1923 in so far as it gives the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to acquire bog for the purpose of development and so on.  The Dáil surely should not lightly pass a section of that kind without getting some information from the Minister as to how the Minister for Industry and Commerce proposes to utilise those powers, and as to the purposes for which he proposes to utilise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me, again, take the case of the bogs in the West of Ireland, which the Attorney-General is familiar with.  The Attorney-General knows perfectly well that some of the best bogs in the West of Ireland will be cut out in probably another 15 or 20 years; that there is in many parts of the West to-day shortage of bog, and that in the ordinary normal course of events there will be a shortage of turbary in 15, 20 or 25 years.  That is quite common in the County of Mayo and many other western counties.  Not alone is it quite common in the western counties but it is common in many southern and eastern counties as well.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, under this section, has power to come in and take over that bog for the purpose of carrying out his experiments, thereby depriving those tenants of the use of <Col N="1471" /> any bog at all.  There is nothing in this section to prevent the Minister for Industry and Commerce coming in and taking over that bog the moment the section becomes law, and depriving those tenants of the use of any turbary.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General will surely agree that this section undoubtedly gives the Land Commission the widest possible powers, for the purpose of enabling the Minister for Industry and Commerce to acquire bog with a view to carrying out his experiments.  I cannot imagine that whoever was responsible for the drafting of this section was really aware of the extraordinary powers which it gives the Land Commission for the purpose of acquiring bog; and not for the ordinary normal Land Commission purposes, but for the purpose of enabling another Minister to carry out some kind of undefined and unknown experiments.  Surely it is up to the Minister to give the Dáil some indication as to the purposes for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce will acquire this bog, and, having acquired it, for what purpose he will utilise it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has so often referred to my knowledge of the bog areas in Mayo that I had better say something in defence of this section.  I do not imagine there is the slightest apprehension amongst any smallholders in Mayo, even though I quite agree with what the Deputy has said about bog getting scarce and increasingly valuable.  I agree that an invasion by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in a particular area would cause considerable disturbance, and might possibly affect the supply of turf in the homes of the people there. I first of all wish to tell the Deputy that in considering whether bog should be acquired or not the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Lands and Fisheries would never think of entering such areas to acquire bog for development.  The Deputy pretends he does not understand what is meant by development. <Col N="1472" /> The development, as I understand it, is the development of turbary as fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a word about fuel in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand any scheme which would consider the ultilisation of peat save as fuel, and I am quite certain that there are very few areas in the West which would not welcome the Minister for Industry and Commerce and all his works if he went there to develop the area.  It would immediately give employment.  It would immediately bring money into the particular district, and it would not in the slightest degree lessen the value of turbary as fuel, or lessen the supply of it in the area.  However, apart from all that, as the Minister has said, there are 1,500,000 acres of bog.  Everybody knows that although Deputy Dillon has waxed eloquent about the danger of interfering with rights of ownership, there are large areas of bog which are used only to house grouse and game. The owner would welcome the Minister for Industry and Commerce coming along and seeking to acquire his land under this Act, when he would have to pay him the market value of it.  There has been a considerable amount of arrant nonsense talked about this section and its dangers.  Even if the bog is acquired for the purpose of experiments by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as the Deputy has stated, it is not difficult to imagine what line such developments would take.  Undoubtedly such development would be, I imagine, for the benefit of the community, but the local area would derive far more benefit from this development than the community as a whole.  However, the Minister has indicated to Deputy MacDermot that he is quite prepared to consider inserting words which will relieve the anxieties of such people.  I can imagine that the amendment if suggested by us would be opposed by Deputy Roddy on the ground that it does not protect the people whom he seeks to protect, because as Deputy Moore has pointed out, the person who is really hurt by the acquisition of turbary is the man who has rights of turbary <Col N="1473" /> and not the owner.  Tenancies in turbary, at least in Mayo, are not at all protected.  Tenant purchasers have merely rights of turbary, but the Minister is satisfied to introduce something which will be analogous with the wording of Section 37, that in exercising these powers, the Land Commission shall have due regard to the reasonable requirements of the owner and he will extend that protection to those who have right of turbary on the bog.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the explanation of the Attorney-General in this case.  As the section is drawn, whatever powers the Land Commission have under Section 37 of the Act of 1923 on behalf of tenant purchasers is now going to be shared by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Then we have the phraseology in the section: &ldquo;for the purpose of the development thereof, for such other purposes as the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the consent of the Minister for Finance shall approve.&rdquo; What is meant by &ldquo;the development thereof or for any other purpose?&rdquo; The development of the bog, as I understand it in this connection, is to exhaust the bog, to take from it what is in it.  We have no particular objection to the development of turf as fuel at all.  The objection is to watering down the rights that persons have and which are at present enshrined in Section 37 of the Land Act of 1923.  The latter portion of that section states: &ldquo;In exercising the powers given by this section the Land Commission shall have due regard to the reasonable requirements of the owner.&rdquo;  The owner in that case I take it would be the landlord.  The landlord is protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that so far as the rights of these persons are concerned, they are being watered down, that there is a new tenant brought in and the new tenant has the resources of the State behind him. Even the persons referred to by Deputy Moore can be deprived of their rights.  These rights can be acquired by the Land Commission at a knock down price.  Persons who are tenants on the bog at the moment and who may see an opportunity of getting a few pounds may sell their rights and subsequently be placed in a serious predicament owing to a shortage of fuel.  They may have to buy coal or something of that sort.  I wonder whether in connection with the development of fuel as an industry, due advertence has been made by the Land Commission to the shortage that has taken place in Connemara in the supply of fuel for the Arran Islands and for the coast of Clare.  When the supply there is exhausted other arrangements will have to be made for supplying fuel from some other source. If the development contemplated in this section results in a shortage of fuel to these people the situation will be rather serious.  In so far as the term &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo; is concerned, it is said to be any distance up to 150 miles, but I do not know if a neighbourhood 150 miles away can be said to be the immediate neighbourhood even with all the advantages of modern transport.  Section 37 of the Act of 1923 reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers of the Land Commission under this Act to acquire any <Col N="1475" /> untenanted land shall include power so to acquire any bog for the purpose of providing turbary from the occupiers of land in the neighbourhood thereof.</P>

My fear in connection with this business is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce having at his disposal a group of experts will select the most profitable centres and select the best possible bogs for development.  He will exhaust them in a comparatively short period.  He will get them much nearer Dublin than 150 miles because transport charges will make it practically impossible to deal with the bogs which are far away.</P>

      <P>Very good.  That is an advantage for the Minister.  I suppose he had that in mind when he was considering the working of a bog 150 miles away and spoke of it as being in the immediate neighbourhood of Dublin. The amendment reads: &ldquo;Provided that such development does not adversely affect the rights of tenants of the bog.&rdquo;  What is the objection to that? If they have any rights, I took it from what the Minister said, there is no intention to interfere with them.  They could not possibly be accused of any such wicked attempt as adversely to affect the rights of the tenant.  If there is no such intention to interfere with them, why not put that in the Statute? What is the objection to it?  The amendment goes on: &ldquo;Or make any undue encroachment on the future necessary supply of turbary for the said tenants.&rdquo;  Is there anything wrong with that?  I assume there is no objection to the democratic principle enshrined in the latter part of the amendment.  Where does the Government derive the authority they have except from the votes of the people and why should not the tenants be allowed <Col N="1476" /> to exercise the same democratic right? I think the Minister would be well advised to accept the amendment.  It will not interfere with any possible development the Minister for Industry and Commerce may have in contemplation so long as that development will not exhaust their future supply of turbary.</P>

      <P>There are areas in this country which have a supply of turbary that would last them for the next 1,000,000 years if these areas were populated to the same extent as at present.

      <P>Well, the man who has rights on the bog.  I would go further than that.  In every Act that has been passed in this House there has always been a certain amount of discretion. For instance, the Minister for Agriculture has power to acquire land for the purpose of forestry.  When the Land Commission are picking out land for afforestation purposes they do not go to a place where land is scarce.  They naturally go to a place where there are few people on the land and where the land is going for very little.  The same would apply to bogs.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 53:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 29, before Section 49, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 90 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, and Section 49 of the Land <Col N="1480" /> Act, 1931, shall be deemed to apply and to have always applied to variable rents issuing out of hereditaments situate in the County of the City of Dublin as if Section 90 of the Irish Land Act, 1903 contained a proviso to the following effect namely:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Provided that in the case of variable rents issuing out of or charged upon hereditaments situate in the County of the City of Dublin such rents shall be varied in accordance with the average percentage of the variation of judicial rents declared by the certificate of the Land Commission to have taken place with respect to the County of Dublin.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to remedy a defect in the machinery for the fixing of variable rents.  I want to say as briefly as I can a few words leading up to it so as to explain its meaning.  Under an Act of 1833 persons holding land from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and other bodies were entitled to get a perpetual estate in the lands they held, subject to the fee farm rent.  The Act also provided that every seven years application could be made, either by the landlord or the tenant, to vary those rents.  The variation was fixed&mdash;either increased or decreased&mdash;according to the average price of grain and oats for the period of seven years preceding the application. That system went on up to 1887. The average prices were published up to that time in the <i>Dublin Gazette</i>, and the variation was fixed by the figures as given in the <i>Dublin Gazette.</i> That system ceased in 1887 when the <i>Gazette</i> no longer published average prices.  Accordingly, the Tithe Rent Charge Act of 1900 provided a new system for fixing the amounts of variable rents.  It provided that they should be fixed according to the amount of judicial rents in a county during the preceding period of 15 years.  This amendment is designed to provide for the case of the County of the City of Dublin.  There are a number of these variable rents in the County of the City of Dublin, but there are no judicial rents in the <Col N="1481" /> County of the City of Dublin, and therefore the provision of the section cannot properly be made to apply&mdash; that is to say to the amount of the variation in a particular county.  It is proposed, therefore, by this amendment to apply the judicial rents in County of Dublin, which is the nearest area, as the test for fixing the amount of variation in these variable rents at the present time.  Some cases have arisen where these rents are payable to the Land Commission, and my information is that the Land Commission have given the proper variation to their immediate tenant, but in some of these cases the immediate tenant has a sub-tenant and has refused to give the proper variation or reduction to his sub-tenant on the ground that there is no machinery by which it can be fixed.  Therefore, I am moving the amendment, the purpose of which is that the judicial rents in the County of Dublin be made applicable for the purpose of determining the variation of these variable rents in the County and City of Dublin.</P>

As a matter of fact the system has been adopted by the Land Commission, where there is an injustice done to sub-tenants, who in some cases were not given the reductions that their landlords got.  As the Minister is aware there was a provision in Section 49 of the Land Act of 1931 giving a final reduction of 8 per cent.</P>

If they say that so-and-so owes a sum of money on their <i>ipse dixit</i> the Land Commission are obliged to withhold payment of the money.  The old principle should be adhered to.  This is a matter for the judicial commissioner who should be satisfied that there is a claim.  It should not be sufficient for the Department to come in and say: &ldquo;There is so much owing and we are entitled to have payment withheld.&rdquo;  They should go before the judge in the ordinary way and satisfy him that the amount or the approximate amount they claim is due.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 56. This is an amendment to amendment 54:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 3 of sub-section (2) of the proposed new section after the word &ldquo;requires&rdquo; to insert the following words &ldquo;and as the Land Commission is satisfied is not more than sufficient.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to give the Land Commission discretion as to the amount of money retained by them at the request of a Government Department.  The new section as it stands gives the Minister or the Department of Finance the right to go and say that so much money was due and to have it retained.  In many cases that may cause considerable injustice.  Take the case of a person who leaves land and other property, say house property, and that an estate duty account is delivered which includes the land and the house property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice up to the present has been that a provisional valuation is made by the person presenting the account and on that provisional valuation the payment of estate duty is made.  That provisional valuation is subject afterwards to checking by the Valuation Office.  If they come to the conclusion that the estate was insufficiently valued, they then make an amended valuation and the additional duty has to be paid.  In many cases where a provisional valuation has been made and duty has been paid, the Valuation Office has not been able for one reason or another to make their final valuation for some years. If the section were passed in its present form the result would be that people would be kept out of a large sum due to them for a number of years, through no fault of their own. They cannot take any steps to expedite the final valuation by the Department.  I propose, as some amelioration of the hardship likely to <Col N="1486" /> be imposed by this section, to give the Land Commission discretion to see whether the amount to be retained is sufficient or is more than sufficient&mdash; to give them the right to say that only so much should be retained.  The Department can bring evidence before them as to the amount due and they can rely on the Land Commission not retaining too little.  It would certainly be a hardship if people were to be kept out of their money for a number of years pending the final valuation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a somewhat similar section in the 1923 Act.  The words there are the &ldquo;Land Commission,&rdquo; not the &ldquo;judicial commissioners.&rdquo; I do not think that the Land Commission can very well run across the work of the Revenue Commissioners. This section is restricted to people not resident in Saorstát Eireann.  I think if it were applying to citizens resident here, there might be something to be said for the amendment.  The section is directed at people not resident here.  The Revenue Commissioners have no means of getting after these people once they get the money and I think we should leave them the right to have deducted the amount that they think is sufficient to cover the debt due to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>

I take it that what would happen is that the Revenue Commissioners would be made aware that lands were being disposed of to the Land Commission by a person who, they believed, owed them back duty. They would make an assessment on that person and would lodge a copy of it with the Land Commission.  The onus would then lie on the person to satisfy the Land Commission or the Revenue Commissioners that the assessment was in error.</P>

      <P>We intend to divide on the last stage of this Bill if for no other reason than that Section 27 still remains, that is the section which empowers the Land Commission, without allowing the tenants to go to any judicial authority, to issue warrants to the sheriffs to go in and seize for annuities due.  We opposed that section in the Committee Stage, but did not succeed in having it eliminated.  I say, if only for that section alone, I would feel it incumbent on me to divide the House on this Stage of the Bill.  Unfortunately the latter part of the Committee Stage was rushed and there were some new sections inserted which were not at all discussed in the way that they deserved to be discussed. <Col N="1490" /> I am not at all satisfied that the section dealing with fisheries is one that would benefit the fisheries of this country.  For instance, in the Minister's very brief statement he said nothing with regard to the position of existing leases which were safeguarded under the 1923 Land Act, where the 1923 Act dealt with fisheries.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the 1923 Act in his statement but he did not mention that important feature of the Act.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether existing leases are to be protected because it is possible that very grave injustice might be done if they were not.  In many ways I like the section because there were anomalies existing.  There were the cases of rivers where you had the riparian owners buying under different Acts, some of them having their fishing rights and others not having them.  That was a constant grievance.  At any rate from the point of view of the rivers, if some owners have the fishing rights, it is just as well to give them all round. The river will probably be ruined anyhow.  I would like to know what the intention of the Land Commission and the Department generally is with regard to these fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It used to be our opinion and it is still my opinion that from the point of view of salmon fishing it will be ruinous if the rivers are divided up amongst a great number of small proprietors unless there is some co-operative arrangement arrived at between these people along the river banks.  Anybody who knows the country knows that if you have A, B, C and D along the lands abutting on a river, each one of them will fish his own portion to death without any regard to the river as a whole.  That will mean the destruction of the spawning fish.  It is a matter that deserves very careful consideration and it is a matter that the Minister, if he has not already consulted with the technical men of the Department of Lands and Fisheries, should consult with them before the Bill goes to the Seanad, with a view to seeing whether some safeguard would not be necessary with <Col N="1491" /> a view to the protection of the fishing as a whole.</P>
    <P>I pointed out one section which makes the Bill extremely objectionable. There are, of course, others which we discussed in the Committee Stage of the Bill.  There was the question of the extraordinary powers taken by the Minister, powers which were formerly held by the Land Commission. There is the question of arrears which accrued due during the last 12 months being funded.  These arrears accrued during the period when the farmers could not pay their annuities.  The same thing arose in connection with the annuities which accrued during the period of the economic war.  We think it is unjustifiable. For these reasons we intend to oppose this Stage.</P>

      <P>I shall continue to oppose this Bill if for no other reason than what appears to me to be its untimeliness in the middle of the so-called economic war; and also because even up to the last moment certain Fianna Fáil spokesmen carrying considerable weight in the country have continued to make very alarming declarations as to the manner in which this Bill is going to be operated.  In view of these circumstances I do not feel free to withdraw my opposition. At the same time I do not like to part from this Bill without paying a tribute to the courtesy and spirit of accommodation that have been shown by the Acting-Minister for Lands and Fisheries and the Attorney-General.  A large number of amendments have been accepted, some of considerable importance, and I think that whatever the defects of the Bill are as it stands at present, it is enormously preferable to what it was when it was at first introduced.  The Minister and some of his colleagues have given us very specific assurances as to the spirit of impartiality and commonsense in which the Bill is going to be administered and as to the genuine degree of independence that is going to be left to the Land Commission and as to the absence of political pressure which a great many of the Fianna Fáil clubs expect to be able to exercise.  If the assurances he has given are carried <Col N="1492" /> out I will not be slow to express my gratification when the occasion offers on the way in which the Bill is administered.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch referred to the fisheries that are being taken over. When they are taken over they will be administered in the same way as the fisheries taken over under the 1923 Act, and for some time at any rate they will be kept as State lands.  The Land Commission will be advised.  It will have the advice of the Department's technical men.  I think that on the whole the Dáil has done a good job with the Bill, and I think that all Deputies on all sides of the House have a right to congratulate themselves on the way they have handled it.  I think the Bill has been improved in many respects since it came in.  I have no doubt that if energetically administered it will help to put the country generally on its feet.  We find ourselves in this position that there are a large number of unemployed people, people who could work land, and I only hope that those who have land will get ahead and employ as many as possible of the men who can work the land, thus producing what the country requires.  There is one very big principle which has been agreed to by all sides of the House. It is a very big advance from the position taken up by the man who says: &ldquo;My land is my own to do what I like with it.&rdquo;  I think it has been generally agreed that a man's title to his land is the use he makes of it.</P>

      <P>It has been generally agreed.  I think that it is a proper attitude for Deputies and the Government to take that as there is only a restricted supply of land it will have to be used for the benefit of the whole community.  I personally want to interfere as little as possible with the occupiers of land.  I believe in individualism and I prefer to see a man going ahead and making as good use of his land as any other person could to disturbing him.  We are giving him an opportunity to do that.  As the amendment that was agreed to clearly indicates, if a man is prepared to go ahead, use his land, give employment <Col N="1493" /> and produce the foodstuffs the nation requires, he is not going to be disturbed. I trust that the work of the Land Commission will be made easy, that those who have land will give the utmost employment on it and save the Land Commission from the pressure to divide land that is badly used.  A lot of obstacles in the way of the Land Commission have been removed and I <Col N="1494" /> believe that their work can be very much speeded up.  I hope that the pressure on the Land Commission to divide up unused land or ill-used land will become lighter because of the action of the owners of that land in getting down to business, giving employment and producing what the nation requires.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not given us much indication as to what the money is for.  It has been stated here in previous debates on the Dáil Eireann Loans Bill that in America there is no difficulty whatever about the lists.  The lists are there with the amounts subscribed by the various people.  We have several offices in America.  We have the Minister's office with staff, in Washington, a Consular office in New York, with staff, and other offices now, I think, in San <Col N="1496" /> Francisco, Chicago and Boston.  I should like to know what this is for, and I think the Minister should have given us some information.  During the debates on the Bill there was a suggestion in that usual inexplicit form that we associate with Presidential statements, which seemed to suggest that one of the points in bringing in the Bill at this time was that the official receivers would still be available.  I raised points here in the debates and I stated that, to the best of my information, these official receivers appointed under the American court had been the recipients of a sum of money calculated on a percentage of the total amount of money to be paid.  Again, I pointed out that amongst the men who had been employed in relation to these Dáil bonds a man called Frank P. Walsh got enormous sums of money from this Government.  As a matter of fact, towards the end of January, 1922, the late Deputy Harry Boland, who was not contaminated in any way by being pro-Treaty, had approached the previous Government and asked that the services of that gentleman be dispensed with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to come to is this: During the debate on the Bill an enormous number of questions were addressed to the President. He worked himself up into a state of heat and used that state of heat for the purpose of concealing information from this House.  One of the questions I wanted answered was whether Mr. Frank P. Walsh would have anything to do with this distribution of money, because, if he had, all our experience, as was testified by the late Deputy Harry Boland in 1922, was that this man's charges were appallingly exorbitant.  If there is a proposal that a portion of this £12,000 shall go to subsidise this very expensive gentleman I think the people of the country will have every reason to object.  If <Col N="1497" /> that man ever gave any services to this country he has been paid a thousand-fold more than he ever earned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Could not the Deputy, on the basis of that reasoning, pick out any citizen, A, B, C or D and say that if any moneys were to be paid to him it was a gross outrage on the citizens of the State? This gentleman is picked out and on the basis of that he could attack people indiscriminately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of that one could not attack people indiscriminately because I am referring to a man who has been consistently employed by the members of the Government and who, even before this Government came into power, was paid out of moneys that we had been voting. We have to vote moneys to pay that man, first, because there are charges in relation to certain litigation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in a most positive fashion.  Again there was a sort of suggestion in the President's speech that official regulations should be observed in this matter, that there was 2,500,000 dollars to be distributed and that they would receive a percentage on that total sum.  There is now to be distributed a much larger sum.  There was originally a sum of 6,000,000 dollars, nearly 2,500,000 of that has been distributed, leaving 3,500,000 plus another quarter of that sum.  If they were to be employed on the same terms these men would get a percentage that they already got in connection with the previous sums, and the Irish people would have to pay that as a result of a Bill recently passed by the Government.  I think the House ought to be told what this £12,000 is required for.  We have offices and staffs in the United States. The President said that the lists were complete.  We were told that there were full lists, and that the names of the assignees, whether they came by the assignment honestly or dishonestly were in our possession and were available. There is a full list of the contributors, and of the value of the bonds transferred whether they were transferred willingly or whether they were transferred by contributors who had the wool pulled over their eyes.  Now we are blandly and blindly invited to vote £12,000 for the repayment of this £1,500,000.  The Minister gives no indication why this sum should be voted.  There is a staff permanently employed, and permanently paid, and there is no ground that I can see for the voting of this money, unless it is for postage stamps to be put on envelopes that have to be sent out.  I <Col N="1499" /> think we should not be asked to agree to this Vote unless we are told what the money is for.  The Minister gave no information except to move that this £12,000 be voted.  I propose to sit down now in order to give the Minister an opportunity of telling us what this money is for.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not on the face of the Estimate.  If one is to take any opinion from that it would be that the Minister completely misled the House in the information he gave it in connection with the previous Bill.  Although we might be justified by our previous experience in doing so, I do not want to accept that view of the Minister's conduct.  There is to be a sum of £12,000 voted here for paying back money in America.  There seems to be no need for incurring such expense. There has to be no advertising done. We were told everybody in America had full knowledge of it.  We were told that there are full lists of the people available and the amount they contributed.  All the Government has got to do is to empower their officials to take steps for the repayment of the money.  But the fact is the Government wants this £12,000 as they wanted the £1,500,000.  It is a large sum of money to come out of the pockets of the people.</P>

      <P>Let us be clear about this.  Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald spoke of a certain individual who is not in this State at this date and the Chair endeavoured to prevent him from referring to that individual in particular, or referring to any citizen either of this State or any other State, because on the face of that reasoning one could attack almost anybody in a negative fashion.</P>

I do not intend to let Deputy Briscoe reintroduce what I would not allow Deputy Fitzgerald to refer to.</P>

      <P>Deputies on the other side seem to fear that there is a lack of precedent for certain of the things I have said here.  The trouble is that there is a lack of precedent for introducing an Estimate into this House and refusing to give any information as to what it is about.  We asked for information which should not be in the least difficult to supply.  The Government has estimated that for certain purposes in connection with the repayment of this money £12,000 should be voted. It might be quite all right to vote that money, but certainly it is not right to <Col N="1502" /> vote it unless you know what it is being voted for.  We are told nothing about it.</P>

      <P>I am going to speak of speculation, and the very odious type of speculation that is at the bottom of all this £12,000, and the other bigger sums we have voted. <Col N="1503" /> The Minister is first of all silent about it.  It is not a bad way to be when you have been indulging in a bad type of speculation.  Then when he is roused into some sort of speech he says that if Deputies could only read they would find the explanation on the face of the Estimate.  An explanation of this type is on the face of every Estimate presented to the House.  If that is an explanation, then we should never have Estimates debated.  There is always the same type of explanation as we have here, and yet it is, or at least it was, the habit of Ministers to explain; and particularly it was the habit of Ministers to answer such questions as: &ldquo;Who are going to be the recipients of the money that is going to be expended on staff?  Where is going to be the new office accommodation for which part of this money is being voted?&rdquo;  Apparently it is new office accommodation not previously met by any Vote of this House; otherwise why this Vote?  We should be told what amount of this money is going to be allocated to postage, and for what purpose.  All we get is a mere request for a sum of £12,000, with the ordinary printed statement that it is required for salaries, wages and expenses of staff, office accommodation, stationery and printing, advertising, postage, etc. Does the &ldquo;etc.,&rdquo; for instance, cover any legal expenses?  Does it cover, say the expenses of any finance house or of any bank?  Does the much debated and in this connection notorious Frank P. Walsh get any part of this money as he got of the previous moneys?  Is there an objection coming to the use of that gentleman's name? Is there any part of this money going to the much debated and in this connection notorious Frank P. Walsh?</P>

Is this the full tot of all that is going to be required in connection with this very bad type of speculation?  To-day, in answer to a question of mine, it emerged that part of the duties of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries on the trip across the Atlantic was in connection with this money, and his expenses are borne on another Vote.  I do not suppose they are being met out of this money, and yet they may be for all we know.  It is certainly a wise procedure on the part of the Government to scatter this <Col N="1505" /> particular business through a number of Votes and not have the whole matter presented to the public in one.  It is bad enough to have the revelations that there were as to the vast amount of the taxpayers' money which was being given away in this year in which we are supposed to have been so economically hard up, in order to provide £100,000 for a paper which is on its last legs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have not raised the question of the Dáil bonds at all. I am raising what is in this Estimate &mdash;the repayment of the Dáil Eireann External Loans.  Some portion of the loan we were told was going to the <Col N="1507" /><i>Irish Press.</i>  Deputy Fitzgerald has raised the point that in the United States of America we have got extra office accommodation recently.  We have got it on foot of a confidential report which is not disclosed to the House.  Is any part of the new office accommodation, which we have been told was recommended by the first missionary to the United States of the Fianna Fáil Government, required for the purpose of making forward arrangements in relation to the formal repayment of this fraction of the Dáil Eireann Loan to which I have referred or have we sufficient office accommodation in the United States ordinarily for our purposes? If so, can it be said that there is such a rush of business in this office that the staff cannot attend to the little bit of extra business involved in the repayment of the loan?  Have they to get extra fees for overtime? It seems ludicrous to have to put the question.  The Minister knows there was no necessity for extra office accommodation as far as the ordinary work was concerned.  It has to be presumed some portion of it was intended, when the office was established, for this purpose.  Why segregate into a new vote, the office accommodation for which we have already paid, unless&mdash;after the stocktaking argument of the other night anything is possible&mdash;there is going to be the contention that these people are so overworked in the American office that they cannot pass through these bonds?  £12,000 even, allowing that there is going to be some expenditure by way of postage, is not a lot but £35,000 seemed to be a very big sum for people who were so hard pressed for money that they had to take a course which was this morning declared to be illegal in relation to civil servants, and a course which was only going to bring them in £35,000 in the year.  The money that was so badly wanted when the Minister was forced to that particular resort is now going to be spent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am only making a passing reference to it.  I hope to refer to the whole affidavit on the adjournment.  The Minister's affidavit was not entirely believed this morning. It will be a welcome addition to the adjournment items.  It does not enter into this&mdash;the Minister is quite right in that&mdash;except to enable me to call attention to this fact, that we are spending here casually and without any occasion that I can see, £12,000, although the State was in such a parlous condition that it had to resort to certain dubious methods to collect from a certain class of servants in the State £35,000.  It is better to have a decent confession about all this.  What is it for?  What game is on about this?  What is it for?  Is it possible that the ordinary civil servants who are in the offices in America are not trusted?  I do not mean that they are not trustworthy, but are they not to be trusted by the present Ministry to pass on this money?  Are the Ministry afraid that these people might report back, that they might write minutes, that there might be files accumulating about all these things which somebody as Minister for Finance hereafter would quote?  Has there to be a special staff engaged for this dubious work? Is that what it is for?  That is my speculation on this matter.  That is, I believe, what has happened, that the Minister has something to hide that he does not want to remain on his files, something that he wants to be over when the temporary staff are discontinued. We have got to get some explanation and that explanation is as good as anything that the Minister can give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards this expenditure of £12,000 I should like to have some further information from the Minister as to whether it means an addition to the present staff.  If my memory serves me right some few <Col N="1509" /> years back the Minister himself thought very much of the word &ldquo;economy&rdquo; and no less a personage than the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, Deputy Flinn, stated on many occasions that if he had an opportunity of having a thorough examination of the then existing staffs in a very short time he would effect economies to the extent of a million or two.  If that were the case, then I think it is only natural to assume that since there has been no appreciable reduction in the staff the present staff should be sufficient to carry out whatever work is necessary in connection with the repayment of this Dáil Eireann Loan.  It is rather extraordinary that in the matter of introducing legislation it should be absolutely necessary to incur additional expenditure in putting such, legislation into operation.  As far as I am personally concerned I have absolutely no interest in this question of the Dáil Eireann Loan.  I was not a Republican in those days&mdash;just an old Nationalist of the Constitutional type&mdash;and I am not very much concerned regarding the repayment of this loan.  Of course we have to repay it.  It is a debt of honour and, of course, honour is a very dear subject with the Government at the moment; but I am concerned with what I consider any unnecessary expenditure, and, in my humble opinion, there is absolutely no necessity for this vote of £12,000.  It may appear a small sum but I think that in the present state of depression existing all over the country it is the absolute duty of the Government to save every halfpenny that they can save.  As far as I am personally concerned, I am not satisfied that this Vote is necessary and I think that the Minister, when reconsidering this question, should take into consideration his present staff and try to find amongst the officers at his disposal sufficient men who have the ability to carry out the work incidental to these Dáil Eireann Loans.</P>

      <P>I object to the provision of £12,000 for the service indicated in this Estimate, because I consider <Col N="1510" /> the purpose, or a part of the purpose, for which that money is going to be used, is one which should receive no facilities from this House at all.  I listened with care to the discussion that accompanied the passing of a Bill that was passed through this House recently which dealt with the repayment of certain bonds which were mainly held in America, and I understand that, as a result of that Act of Parliament, this £12,000 will be partially used for the transfer of public funds voted by this House to members of this House, albeit they are acting in a trustee capacity.  As I understand it, a number of bondholders in America have assigned their interests in these bonds to President de Valera, President de Valera having given an undertaking to stand seized of the proceeds in trust for these bondholders and to invest these moneys in the <i>Irish Press.</i> I have no doubt that, according to his lights, President de Valera entered into that contract without any intention of doing anything dishonest, but, equally, I have no doubt that it is not in the interest of rectitude in public life in this country that the head of an Irish Government could find himself in a position wherein a large part of public funds which have been voted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy might not have heard me state already that, by an Act of this Oireachtas, those bonds must be paid and that it is not in order to animadvert on any Act of this Oireachtas in a debate on an Estimate.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, sir, I submit that the amount of this Vote must, surely, be profoundly affected by the number of persons who are to be paid.  Let us assume that the bondholders all assigned their bonds to one individual.  In such a case, £12,000 would be a large sum. If, on the other hand, the bonds were in a denomination of 6d. and there were 80,000 bondholders, the sum of <Col N="1511" /> £12,000 would seem to be inadequate. It seems to me, with great respect, to be a difficult matter to discuss the adequacy of this investment unless we consider the probable number of assignees or bondholders.  I think I am right and, to go further, that I am entitled to submit to this House a valid reason for refusing this accommodation to the Government. I submit, with great respect, that I am entitled to say that, since the purpose of this is to partially convey certain funds to a certain corporation or group, it is desirable that this House should withhold from the Government any facility they can withhold in order to check that.  I have proceeded along those lines merely to draw the attention of the House to those aspects of this question. I cannot possibly discuss the adequacy of the Vote unless I can discuss the number of the assignees. With all respect, I submit, that that is profoundly relevant.  In this particular case, we have a large part of a fund which would normally be held by 40,000 or 50,000 people assigned to one individual who holds an honourable and responsible position in this State.  The purpose of this is to transfer £100,000 of public money to one individual.  I submit, with all respect, that I am entitled to say that this House should decline to provide money for such a purpose. It is not a proper purpose for which this House should provide money.</P>

The Deputy who has been speaking has referred to the position occupied by one holder of certain of these bonds.  That matter was fully dealt with on the Second, the Committee, the Report and Fifth Stages of a recent measure.  This Oireachtas has decided that those bonds must be paid, and the question <Col N="1512" /> of ownership of these bonds, by any person whomsoever, is not in order in this discussion.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, sir, on that aspect of the situation, and will not proceed any further along those lines.  I think, however, that it would have been well if the Government had communicated to us the number of bondholders whom they would be called upon to deal with.  I think it would have been well that the Minister responsible for this Estimate should have informed us of the approximate figures of the staff he required and where he proposed to employ it.  I do not think it would have been unreasonable to expect a statement from the Minister as to what office accommodation he anticipated would be necessary.  Without those particulars, it is quite impossible for this House to form a reasonable view of the adequacy of this Estimate or otherwise.  Quite apart from the adequacy of this Estimate or otherwise, I am quite clear that it is an Estimate which the House should not accept.</P>

      <P>During the course of his speech on this Estimate, Deputy McGilligan used the words &ldquo;odious,&rdquo;&ldquo;malodorous,&rdquo;&ldquo;contemptible,&rdquo;&ldquo;corrupt&rdquo; and &ldquo;scandalous.&rdquo;  He used those adjectives in relation to a proposal already adopted by this House, and which it is necessary to implement by this Estimate, the effect of which is that we shall repay to citizens of the United States money which was loaned by those citizens some years ago to the Government of this country. The money was loaned when the Black-and-Tans were trampling on this country and when we were hard pressed; when Deputy Dillon was still worrying about the Parnell Split and what happened the Paris funds; when Deputy Coburn was still weeping over the grave of the Irish Party&mdash;</P>

This Estimate is necessary to enable these pledges to be redeemed and those Deputies who would have us break our bond and drag this country's name in the mire and disgrace us before those citizens of America who helped us when we most needed help, would have us do that because some part of this money which will be repaid to those to whom it is legally due may reach the pockets of those who are their political opponents. We have had many contemptible scenes in this Dáil from time to time, but the scenes that took place here when the Bill which preceded this Estimate was under discussion were the most contemptible of all.  I was not here, but I read of those scenes in the Press and the references made from the opposite benches to the servant girls in America and the poor people out there who subscribed their cents and dollars to this loan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is asked to vote a sum of £12,000 for a definite purpose.  Included in the list of items dealing with this we find &ldquo;salaries, wages and expenses of staff, office accommodation, stationery and printing, advertising, postage, etc.&rdquo;  How much is there to be for each, and how many are going to be employed?  Surely there must have been some tot made in the Department of Finance or was the method adopted in connection with this simply to take a series of figures from £1 to £50,000 and, like some people who pick out winners, take a pin and stick it in one of the numbers and say &ldquo;That is the sum I want.&rdquo; However much the Minister may claim that as his method, I certainly think that class of computation is not adopted in any Department of State. The Department of Finance put up some figures in respect of certain officials to be employed.  Possibly they put up persons' names and the sums they were to be paid, and gave the personnel of the whole establishment. Why is that kept from the House? What is the meaning of it?  This is not the money of the Ministry.  It is not the money of their supporters.  It is the money of the people of this State, all the people.  Each and everyone, according to whatever the taxation of the country is, will pay a quota.  Let us have less talk about dictators from incompetents.  What is the meaning of bringing an estimate before the Dáil at all?  What purpose does it serve?  Surely the Ministry knows someone who will get some of the £12,000.  If the gentleman whose name was mentioned is not to be employed in that capacity, as a representative of the State in this matter, who is to be employed?  Are Messrs. Corboy to be employed?  Why is the Ministry keeping it secret?  Are they <Col N="1518" /> ashamed of it?  Why should they discredit any American firm that is going to be employed, by withholding the name from this House, leaving it to come out subsequently in the United States, that they were so employed? That is not the way to treat the citizens of another country, or the people in whom you have sufficient confidence to employ in order to do work of that sort.  In the course of his speech the Minister for Industry and Commerce asked, a short time ago, if we were against the repayment of this money.  It was not to-day or yesterday we stated our position with regard to that.  As far back as 1922 what was the attitude of himself and others in connection with it, when they put this country to an expenditure of over £100,000 in order that they would get possession of the whole of it, and, having failed to get possession of the whole of it, they then started to get possession of a moiety of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that we have got into a calm atmosphere on this question and that we are going to be businesslike.  When dealing with money of this kind we should get away from the war atmosphere that we were threatened with from the other side of the House.  We are dealing with money that is going to come out of the taxpayers' purse.  I am interested in one item, and I would like to know how it is going to be spent.  That is advertising.  The Minister might let the House know what advertising is necessary.  Is it advertising the names of the bondholders? Is he going to advertise that an office is going to be set up, asking for applications for highly paid jobs? What form will the advertising take? Will it be advertising through an agency or in newspapers, or will it be confined solely to the <i>Irish Press</i>?  As a matter of fact, to put it baldly, the advertising might be used as political election literature.  It might state how the Fianna Fáil people could save £2,000,000 in taxation and put 84,000 people to work.  All that might be given under the heading of advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a business matter, this should be <Col N="1519" /> dealt with more explicitly by the Minister.  It is usual to expect that advertising pays.  Perhaps the Minister is going to use this in some form of advertising in order to get some political advantage that we know nothing about.  I look upon this as an estimate, and an estimate is arrived at after some computation as to the manner in which the money is going to be spent.  I think this procedure is wrong.  The whole trouble and delay would have been avoided if the Minister had been a little more explicit and told in a businesslike way how the amount was computed and how it was to be spent.  It would not have been necessary for so many Deputies to have been out of order if the Minister had taken the House a little more into his confidence.</P>

However, even the Deputy, if he had spent as much time thinking about the Estimate as talking about it, would have realised why it was necessary to advertise in the American newspapers, why it was necessary to advertise in everyone of the States in America and <Col N="1520" /> in every city in America in which there is an Irish population.  I might say that that means advertising in every State in the Union, because everywhere people subscribed to these bonds when Deputy Coburn and Deputy Dillon would not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The total loan is of the order of £1,250,000, held in small denominations in bonds of ten dollars and upwards.  Of those hundreds of thousands of bondholders, I might say that not ten per cent. have assigned their bonds.  If this money is required, it is to repay the general mass of the bondholders and for no other purpose whatever.  The repayment will be carried out under the direction of a Government staff, by Government servants under the direction of the Minister for Finance, and every payment, no matter to whom it may be made, will be subject to the examination and audit of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be no question of the destruction of records and no possibility that any record will be destroyed as Deputy McGilligan, who was once a member of the Executive <Col N="1521" /> Council, ought to know, because if a record were destroyed, a record upon which a payment was based, the Accounting Officer would be held personally responsible.  He certainly will ensure that there will be available for the Comptroller and Auditor-General the fullest evidence to show that the payments were properly and justly made.  Of course Deputy McGilligan did not rely merely on his imagination for that point.  Deputy McGilligan had past experience to guide him. Deputy McGilligan knows well that in the interregnum in March, 1932, very valuable Government papers were destroyed on the instructions of Deputy McGilligan and his colleagues, when they were members of the Executive Council.  It would be very interesting if these files were available for examination.</P>

Walsh, a gentleman who has held high positions in America, a valued adviser of the President of the United States in the period from 1916 to 1920, who placed his services at the disposal of the people of this country at a time when Deputy Dillon and Deputy Coburn stood aloof and when Deputy McGilligan was, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, living in obscurity, an obscurity from which he emerged to serve the country only when he was certain that his services would be paid for.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £2,045 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh Márta, 1934, chun go bhféadfaí aisíoc do dhéanamh le taisceoirí i mBanc Sinn Féin.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,045 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1934, to enable recoupment to be made to depositors in the Sinn Féin Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Vote is required in order to enable recoupment to be made to sundry depositors of the unliquidated balances standing in their names in the Sinn Féin Co-operative People's Bank which was wound up under an order of the court in 1927.  Amongst the other accounts this bank had held was on current account for the trustees of Dáil Eireann, a sum of £2,397 odd and while it was first considered that any claim thereto should be allowed to stand over until other depositors had received payment of their claims in full the position created by the passing of the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Act of 1924 made it obligatory on the Minister for Finance to make due claim to the old Dáil moneys.  The Minister was subsequently admitted by the court examiner to rank as preferential creditor, but as it was evident that the payment to him of the amount in full would leave only a negligible sum for distribution to the other depositors, the claim for preferential treatment was not pressed.  Ultimately the Minister shared in the general distribution as an ordinary creditor and received a dividend of 10/- in the pound amounting to £1,198 odd which was paid into the Exchequer.  As I have already explained, this bank was dissolved by order of the High Court in March, 1925.  Many members of the Dáil will remember the circumstances under which it was established <Col N="1525" /> and will recollect particularly that the old Sinn Féin organisation had its first and only headquarters in the premises of the bank.  The bank, as has been indicated, held a considerable sum of Dáil Eireann moneys on deposit.  It was generally associated with the Sinn Féin movement at the time so that during the years in which an attempt was made to overthrow the Irish Republic and suppress the Sinn Féin organisation this bank received considerable and undesirable attention from the British forces in this country so that ultimately the bank was compelled to wind up.  For these reasons it is felt not merely by ourselves but by our predecessors that an obligation rests upon the State to recoup so far as it possibly can the depositors for the loss which they incurred through depositing their funds with this bank, particularly having regard to the co-operation given by the bank during the trying period to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The amount of the Estimate is made up of small sums ranging from £186 downwards and includes a sum of £25 for repayment to a few depositors whose claims were not received in time for participation in the distribution of dividends made by the official liquidator.  Disbursement of this latter sum will only be made on satisfactory proof of the <i>bona fides</i> of the claim.</P>

      <P>The adjournment for some seven weeks now, after practically that number of months of the Dáil in session, enables us to examine how far, and if at all, the Ministry which came into power on such a very big list of promises and so many undertakings, have been able to accomplish some of those things they set out to achieve. We were told amongst other things <Col N="1526" /> that the earnings of people on the land were to be increased by about £16 per head per annum; that some 80,000 persons were to be put into good occupations; that taxation was to be reduced; that economies were to be effected in public expenditure; and a host of other political nightmares which the Fianna Fáil Party had before they took up office.  Now, after some 18 months' experience of their administration, I think that outside of the Ministry very few people in the country are anything the better of their experiments.  Over and above all, there is the position in which they have placed this country in so far as its main industry of agriculture is concerned. On previous occasions I have referred to this as being the main failure on the part of the Government. The situation in which they found the agricultural industry was economically sound.  We were not free, any more than other countries, from the difficulties of the times.  The Oireachtas had made efforts to help that main industry, while at the same time fostering the secondary industries of the State, and we had a relatively smaller number of people unemployed than any other country.  According to the public returns of the Ministry these numbers have gone up, notwithstanding the fact that very much more money has been raised from taxation, and that in order to spend more money they have had to increase the burden upon the principal industry of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main complaint I have against this Government is, however, their repeated attempts to take the public mind off the present economic situation in this country by a series of political sensations, sensations which began with victimisation and will I presume go on in the same fashion; sensations which we may expect day after day, week after week, and month after month, as long as they find themselves unequal to the task of restoring to the main industry of the country the position to which it is entitled, the position which it requires if the other industries of the country are to prosper. Examined from the political point of view we find the status of the country <Col N="1527" /> no higher, if as high as it was when they came into office.  We find our economy much worsened.  We find unemployment very much worse.  We find taxation very much higher.  We find assistance that ought to be given to the main industry of the country denied to it.  We find a series of political, economic and financial experiments, such as no other country has, perhaps, ever known, being indulged in.  Last year the Government proposed to borrow £1,000,000 to balance the Budget.  They went near the mark&mdash;£700,000.  This year they propose to borrow £3,000,000 to balance the Budget, one and a quarter millions of it on the security of the land annuities which they are spending at present.  Legislation has been rushed through, estimates have been introduced and passed by means of long-night sittings, and even to-night we have to sit late in order to finish up the work of the session, having last week been able to adjourn for a couple of hours in order to attend what was described as a State function and which ordinary people recognise as a garden party.  The description &ldquo;garden party&rdquo; cannot be mentioned&mdash;it is taboo.  We have public attention directed to the fact that small savings have been made in certain respects and the attention of the public distracted from the enormous expenditure which is being incurred in other directions.  The sum and substance of the whole matter is that this Government is the most brilliant failure of all the Government in the world at the present time.</P>

      <P>It is quite true that it has been the practice on the adjournment of the Dáil for members of the Opposition to take advantage of the adjournment debate in order to review the sins of omission or commission of the Government.  I am not quite clear, however, why we should continue that practice.  I think it would add considerable zest to this discussion if, in addition to discussing the faults and virtues of the Government in office, we also discussed the faults and virtues <Col N="1528" /> of the Opposition.  We can look back over the Session which is now concluding with some pleasure.  We have succeeded in getting through a considerable amount of useful work and we have demonstrated to the satisfaction of everybody something concerning which we on this side of the House never had any doubt.  When the Party opposite was the Government everybody used to say that they would do well as an Opposition.  Even their own friends used to say &ldquo;Well, when the people do kick them out they will be a most effective Opposition.  With their experience of office, their knowledge of administration and their information concerning the conditions of the country they will be a really effective Opposition to the Government that succeeds them.&rdquo;  Look at what we got!  It is now quite clear that they are a bigger failure as an Opposition than they were as a Government.  I said here last night and I repeat it to-night that day after day we have had the appalling spectacle of Front Bench members of the Opposition participating in debates on Bills which they obviously had not read and which they certainly did not understand.  They were too lazy to read the measures put before them and obviously incapable of comprehending them even if they had read them.  They come in here and waste our Parliamentary time asking questions to try and find out what the measures are about.  It is no wonder that the new slogan of that Party is &ldquo;Abolish Parliaments altogether,&rdquo; because this Parliament, at any rate, has shown up their incompetence.  It may be that a case can be made for the abolition of the Parliamentary system; certainly a case can be made for its reform.  Certainly I think we should try to keep out of it or, at any rate, prevent from wasting time here those freaks of the electoral system that prevail in this country who always are the first to speak on and nearly always the last to understand any measure which comes before the House.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to the programme that this Government put before the people when seeking election and he said we were the most brilliant failure in the world.  It is extraordinary that <Col N="1529" /> nobody seems to realise that except himself.  I do not know if he wants another election.  If he does want another election I shall certainly try to persuade my colleagues on the Executive Council to let him have it.</P>

      <P>I think I shall be able to assure them that at least ten additional seats should be secured as a result of the exhibition the Opposition made of themselves since the last election.  This Government came into office in March, 1932, and, because we thought the people might like to express a judgment upon the manner in which we were carrying out our programme, we took the opportunity when it offered, an opportunity that we need not have taken, to go back to consult them again and what happened? Not merely did we get a renewal of the confidence given in March, 1932, but we got a renewal with interest.  And what is more, it is quite clear the confidence of the country in the Government is continually growing and will grow until we hold an election, when one Party only will come back into the Dáil, and then we will have the ideal situation desired by the Party opposite.  We will then have one Party Government.  They do not now believe in the Party system.  They are anxious to abolish the Party system since their Party was nearly abolished.  So long as the Party opposite occupied these benches and overflowed to other parts of the House there was great talk about democratic government, and the will of the people, and the necessity to preserve the Constitution and the right of free speech, but now they want that very absurd Constitution abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In times past I have often advised the Party opposite to agree amongst themselves about their policy upon any particular matter before coming to the Dáil.  I am now advising them to try and get agreement amongst themselves about their policy before making it public.  It is most confusing when we find Deputies opposite outside the House protesting against discussion. about wasting time in useless talk in the House and about the futility of the Party system. <Col N="1530" /> If the tactics of the Party opposite in this House are to discredit Parliamentary government, they are certainly most successful.  They have done more in the past 12 months to bring Parliamentary government into disrepute than people outside the House could do in a century.  We are going to change that and we propose to change it in a most constitutional manner by holding election after election until the Party opposite ceases to exist.  Then we will have an ideal situation.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the position from the point of view of the Government's record.  A programme was put before the country.  After our Party were returned we went back again and asked the electors if they approved of the way we were carrying out that programme. The people said most emphatically they liked our programme.  We proceeded to carry on, on the same lines; but Deputy Cosgrave told us that as a result of the Government's activity nobody outside the Ministry had benefited.  That is a very large statement. There are something more than 2,999,000 people in this State, and Deputy Cosgrave asserts that outside the ten members of the Executive Council nobody has benefited.  I do not think that he had given thought, if he ever does think, to that statement before he made it.  I think quite a large number of people have benefited. The peculiar thing is that the majority seem to have benefited; and they have said so.  When Deputy Cosgrave offered to relieve them, and to take the burden of this Government off their backs, they said: &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another peculiarity is the fact that Deputies opposite seem to have abandoned the base from which they started, and have come to consider that there must be something in the Government's policy, for they have come to adopt it.  For instance, Deputy MacDermot supports, and Deputy Cosgrave insists, that every industry in this country should use Irish fuel where possible, and do everything to encourage the use of Irish coal.  Deputy Cosgrave seems to say now burn everything English except coal.  And in regard to other problems they seem to have abandoned the position <Col N="1531" /> they formerly took up.  They are striving to out-Fianna Fáil Fianna Fáil, to go one better because they realise the direction in which the country wants the Government to go.</P>
    <P>I would like to give a brief statement concerning certain other people who have benefited as a result of the Government's activities.  These people, as well as others, are beginning to realise that when they talk in the strain that Deputy Cosgrave talks they are talking nonsense.  We found, on coming into office, an industrial situation which was most deplorable. Not merely had many of the industries, which had survived wars and foreign Governments and periods of depression in the past ceased to exist under the blighting influence of Cumann na nGaedheal, but the industries that actually did survive were in a very weak and precarious condition.  I frequently told the people, prior to 1932, that they would have to hurry up and get rid of the Government then in office, because each year that passed while they were in control was going to make the task of their successors more difficult.  Unfortunately the opportunity of getting rid of that Government was not offered to the people until a very considerable amount of damage was done and, to a large extent, our energies had to be directed towards repairing that damage before we were able to get to the stage of opening up new avenues of achievement in the industrial sphere.</P>
    <P>We discussed last night the flour-milling industry.  Deputies are, I am sure, familiar with the history of that industry since 1922.  It was quite a flourishing industry then.  There were prosperous mills all over the country.  Many of them went to the wall.  Those that survived were working two shifts instead of three shifts, and, after a period, those working two shifts were cut down to one shift only.  These people came to the Government, from time to time, to complain of their difficulties and to explain the nature of their position.  They asked for assistance.  On every occasion they were told by the Ministry <Col N="1532" /> of Industry and Commerce that their case was being considered. Nothing was done.  Those engaged in that industry entered into an arrangement with their competitors in Great Britain, which secured for them permission to mill up to one-half of their capacity, subject to their securing that no less than one-half of the Irish market should be supplied with flour from Great Britain.  These were the dictated terms of surrender following upon the war and these terms had not merely the approval of the Government in office but they were actually justified in the course of discussions in this House.  We have changed all that. The flour milling industry is flourishing once again.  Every mill works three shifts, or 132 hours in the week.  That means working full time.  In these mills employment is increasing.  Ancillary employment is being created. North, south, east and west there is, in regard to that industry, a degree of activity not experienced since the Free State was established.  We know that the enemies of Irish industry are trying to wreck it before it gets too strong.</P>
    <P>We had Deputy McGilligan last night talking about the possibility of a shortage of flour in the west of Ireland because we had cut down the quota of a particular group of mills.  I do not know if I made it clear last night that there was, for a period, a temporary shortage in the west of Ireland but an entirely artificial one.  It was a shortage deliberately created by that particular milling concern which had certainly got Deputy McGilligan in its hands when he was Minister and which was striving to force the Government which was controlling the industry to put it into a more favourable position than its competitors.  But that did not succeed.  The temporary shortage in the west of Ireland was rectified by the Associated Millers of the country as soon as its existence was made known.  The circumstances that produced it, being known, cannot possibly be repeated.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to give a detailed industrial review, but I want to mention some of the outstanding facts. Taking the industries in the order in <Col N="1533" /> which they appear in our trade and shipping statistics, I should like to merely mention the following particulars. In the confectionery trade we have completed our job.  The imports are now of no consequence.  The country's requirements of confectionery of all kinds are now being supplied from Irish factories.  The magnitude of what has been achieved in that direction will be realised when I mention that in the year 1931 the value of our imports of confectionery was £550,000.  The importations of bread and buns, which were valued at over £200,000 in 1931, have also ceased.  All the country's requirements are now being supplied from bakeries in the Saorstát.  We ended that job in the last week or the week before, when the last bakery necessary to supply our full requirements came into production, and the licences to import were withdrawn. Deputies are familiar with the Government's proposals in relation to sugar, and it is not necessary to reiterate them.  This year we imposed a duty upon yeast, an important industrial product.  In this month the job in relation to that product will also be completed.  Imports will cease entirely, and the home firms will supply all our requirements.  The value of those imports in 1931 was £40,000.</P>
    <P>In the case of glass bottles and jars, we have also completed the job.  In last week developments which had been in course of construction were completed, and the full extent of our programme was achieved.  Not merely have we succeeded in getting production to the point at which our home requirements can be supplied, but the beginnings of an export trade have been established.  In the case of constructional steel, the job is also completed. All constructional steel of all kinds likely to be required here is now being produced in Irish works.  The same applies to wire manufactures of all kinds.  Again I can say our task is done.  The value of the imports of those goods in 1931 was over £100,000. In respect of galvanised ware, considerable progress has been made. Concerning many classes of galvanised <Col N="1534" /> products I can again say that the job is done.  In relation to the others, it will be complete in the very near future.  The value of such imports in 1931 was over £200,000.</P>
    <P>The regulations made by the Department of Local Government in respect of building, which require that all materials used in houses built under the Government's housing scheme must, where possible, be of Irish manufacture, have produced very direct and substantial results in the industrial sphere.  In the case of stoves, grates and ranges, production has been very substantially increased.  All requirements in relation to the Government's Housing scheme can now be got from Irish firms.  The same is not yet quite true concerning other cast-iron manufactures. We are producing 80 per cent. of our requirements.  The erection of the buildings and the installation of the machinery necessary to bridge the gap are now taking place. The gap will be bridged within three months from now.  The value of the imports of such goods in 1931 was over £60,000.  The same Local Government regulations have brought new trade to our brass foundries, and new trade to many other subsidiary industries associated with the housing industry.</P>
    <P>We have had many discussions here concerning our attempts to establish firmly here the coach-building industry. In so far as commercial vehicles are concerned, the task was completed long ago.  There are now no completed commercial cars imported into this country. The imports of motor chassis for the first six months of this year show an increase of over 400 per cent. on the imports of last year.  Those chassis are now coming in here to be fitted with bodies in Irish works, instead of being imported complete as heretofore. In respect of private cars, there are now four or five makes of car available from Irish works.  In come cases those cars are completely assembled.  In other cases they are imported at the medium rate of duty, and finished and fitted in those Irish works.  We hope to be able in the near future to record a much more substantial development in that direction.  In the case of cycle assembly, a new industry has been <Col N="1535" /> created.  It is not perhaps of prime importance, but when establishing it we were taking the first step towards securing the manufacture here of the cycles required, and required in great number, by our people.  Now that the first step has been taken, the second step, which is the manufacture of certain parts, will be commenced.</P>
    <P>There are many industries for the working of timber, all important, and all eminently suitable to this country. In connection with them we have also a story of continuous progress to record. Last month we shut down finally upon the importation of planed and dressed timbers.  Although a duty was imposed last year, regulated imports had to continue, because many firms engaged in the timber trade had to build extensions and instal considerable machinery in order to enable them to produce the requirements in their own works.  They have done that.  That job is done, and in future imports of planed and dressed timber will not be necessary.  In relation to wooden cases and other wooden products, considerable progress has been made, despite extraordinary difficulties.  There is probably no trade in the world which has been so disorganised by the slump in prices which took place in the years since 1929 as the woodworking trade.  To such an extraordinary degree were freak results produced by the slump that in relation to many classes of those products one could buy the manufactured article cheaper than one could buy the material with which to make it.  However, again we are able to say that, with the passage of the worst of the depression, conditions have now been created in which that industry is making very rapid progress.  In relation to the furniture industry, the job has also been done.  It is true that the fire which destroyed one of our principal furniture factories a short time ago created a temporary deficiency in capacity.  That deficiency, I am glad to say, is being made good.  There are other manufactures of wood of various kinds, the imports of which in 1931 amounted to £250,000, all of which are now being turned out from Irish works.</P>
    <P>Similarly, our linen industry has <Col N="1536" /> been working very busily supplying the home market and maintaining itself with considerable success, despite the conditions prevailing, on the export markets on which it was heretofore almost entirely dependent. We gave the industry a new market valued £75,000 a year.  It has filled it and as a result employment and additional activity have been noted in that industry.  Similarly in the case of woollens and worsteds, there is probably no woollen mill in the country that is not at the present time installing additional machinery or erecting buildings to house such machinery. Some of these mills I have been told by their proprietors have more than doubled their capacity and doubled their output during the past 12 months. In relation to the industry for the manufacture of cordage, cables, ropes and twine, we took the first protective measures in May of last year.  I remember Deputy Mulcahy asking then was this intended to be a revenue duty.  I told him that though it might produce some revenue it was not designed for that purpose.  I am glad to say that in the very near future it will not produce any revenue at all because the industry has been developed with remarkable speed and a market valued at over £120,000 a year was retained for Irish workers. There are a number of other industries, particulars of which I could give but it is not necessary.</P>

      <P>I am sure most Deputies will agree that there are very few items of apparel that we cannot make for ourselves.  Yet in the year 1931 we imported apparel to the value of £5,500,000.  We set out to secure that market for Irish workers.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the success which met our efforts has more than exceeded our expectations.  In relation to men's clothing of all kinds, the job is finished.  We can shut down on imports and probably will.  I can state with confidence that the existing concerns can more than supply all the country's requirements.  In relation to women's outer garments, the same is not yet true although very considerable progress in that very difficult industry has been made.  In the case of hosiery I said here some time ago that we had in 12 months doubled the production of the home industry and would, in this year, double it again.  I am glad to say that our expectations have been realised, and I hope that in a very short time we shall be able to say in relation to that branch of the apparel industry that we have also finished our job.  In the case of the boot and shoe industry, I saw quite recently the figures for the production in the Saorstát factories during the first six months of this year.  These figures, for the first six months of the year, were more than double the figures for the whole of the year before Fianna Fáil came into office.  Extensions have proceeded very rapidly indeed.  We still, it is true, have a long way to go, a long way made difficult by the fact that workers have to be taken raw and trained in that somewhat difficult industry while the extensions are going on but the extensions are going on and plans have been made and approved of by my Department for the erection of new factories in the remaining portion <Col N="1538" /> of this year which will almost bridge the gap between production and requirements.  We will certainly close that gap early in the next year.</P>
      <P>I am glad to be able to report that the duty recently imposed on sole and insole leather has led to a very substantial revival of the old established tanning industry.  Not merely are existing tanneries increasing employment and increasing production, but steps for the reopening of tanneries that were closed or the establishment of new tanneries are being taken in various parts.  The manufacture of boxes and cartons of cardboard which is a considerable industry in other countries but which was only given the benefit of protective measures a short while ago, is also proceeding rapidly. I was in fact only this morning informed of proposals to erect a large factory for the manufacture of these goods, which factory, it is hoped, will be in production within three months. Printing and stationery, the imports of which amounted to over £300,000 in 1931, have also been greatly assisted and I trust that, when some additional measures that may have to be taken have been completed, we will have wiped out that item entirely off our import list.  In respect to soap and candles the job is completed, although the imports amounted to over £120,000 in 1931.  Medicines and medicinal preparations of all kinds, which figured largely on our import list, and the value of which amounted to £400,000 in 1931, are also being manufactured or prepared here to a very great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could continue naming industries of this description.  In those to which I have referred we have transferred to Irish factories from foreign factories, within a period of slightly more than 12 months, trade valued annually at over £5,000,000, and we hope to double that figure within the next 12 months.  There is, of course, a lot to be done yet.  I do not want to minimise the nature of the task to which we have set ourselves.  We planned that we would have five years to finish the job.  Already I think we can contemplate finishing our programme in a much shorter period because of the progress we have <Col N="1539" /> achieved.  I merely want to indicate the plans we have either maturing at present or which will come into operation in the near future.  In respect of the coal resources of the country certain investigations are in progress and we have indications that considerable development is possible, development which will give very much-needed employment in the districts affected and which will also considerably lessen our dependency upon external sources of fuel.  Other mine and quarry products also offer considerable advantages.  In relation to certain of these mine products, it has now been established without a question of doubt that resources, which in quantity and quality justify their economic working, exist in this country, resources in many ways more suitable for commercial exploitation than similar deposits in other countries which are being successfully worked at the present time.  We hope to be able to get development in that connection also in the near future.</P>

      <P>I hope that before the end of this year we will have succeeded in establishing a pottery industry in the Saorstát.  Plans, which are at present in contemplation, and which we expect will come to fruition, will have that desirable result, I trust, before the end of the year.  We have had very many inquiries as to the manufacture of asbestos products of many kinds. The principal use is for roofing slates. We have been in consultation with the Department of Local Government but it is not yet decided that it would be wise to permit of the production of these products here to compete with certain other products available and on that matter opinion may be divided. The Bill for the establishment of the cement industry has now become law and I hope that we will have established here factories working economically <Col N="1540" /> and supplying the country's total requirements.  As to the production of roofing slates, the industry, which has undergone considerable development during the course of the year, is still capable of greater development but there are difficulties in connection with the training of skilled workers and securing the rights to work the slate deposits where they exist.  However, I feel that, despite the great difficulties with which we met, considerable progress was made and, as Deputies are aware, several new quarries have been opened.  I hope, before the end of this year, to establish on a large scale the cotton - weaving industry in the Saorstát.  Inquiries have also been made with a view to the establishment of the artificial silk industry which is quite suitable for this country and could be established on an economic basis. We hope also to have established in reasonable time a rubber industry for the production of motor and cycle tyres and other products of that nature.</P>
      <P>I must confess that I have been disappointed somewhat with regard to the re-establishment of the paper industry. There were certain difficulties which, I think, have now been overcome and there is no reason why our plans for the re-establishment of that industry should not be brought to fruition in the near future.  We hope also to be able to establish a linoleum industry.  There are various other industries coming into existence which it is not necessary for me to enumerate.  Despite all the progress which has been made already, and despite all the plans which we hope to bring to fruition, we have still got to face grave social problems and we will continue to have them.  These social problems are grave but they are not peculiar to this country or, in fact, to any country in the world to-day. These problems are the product of the manner in which modern civilisation has developed.  I think that if we tackle them in the right way, and are not bound by precedent or scared of upsetting the existing order, then, we will succeed in solving those problems and removing forever from the backs of our people the legacy of poverty, unemployment and hardship which has been bequeathed to us by our predecessors.</P>

I said that in June of 1932, and at the end of that period we did not ask the Dáil to decide on the merits of our policy; we asked the country for its verdict, and we got it in a most emphatic manner.  There are many lines on which to approach our economic problem, and, though Deputies and Parties may differ amongst themselves as to which is the best line to pursue, so long as we have got agreement as to what the objective is, then discussion upon alternative methods will be useful and helpful.  But if we are working in opposite directions, each trying to establish in this country conditions different to those which the other is trying to achieve, then we will, in a large measure, nullify each other's efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The first remark that occurs to me to make about the Minister's speech is this: that if this Government had deliberately and treacherously designed to bring agriculture to ruin, they could not have acted otherwise than they have acted.  I am one of those who have always been in favour of creating new industries in this country and creating them to an extent, perhaps, beyond what strict economic necessity would warrant, for the sake of their social effects and for the sake of providing more varied occupations for our people than have been provided <Col N="1543" /> for a century past.  But it is simply absurd for the Minister to suppose that, by getting up and making the sort of dreary recital that he has made this evening, he can induce us to believe that he has proved the country is prosperous.  The Minister lives, no doubt, in a universe of his own, and if the world came crashing about his ears it would leave him undismayed because he would not notice it.  But it is simply astounding that he should expect people to sit and listen to him with serious faces when they are able to go round the country for themselves and see what the conditions really are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What number of bankrupt countries in the world could not make the same boast that the Minister has made here to-night?  If high tariffs and pure protection could save a country what country would not have been saved long since?  Is not the Minister simply hastening noisily along the path that other failures have taken before him?  Has there ever been a country in which there was less excuse for the kind of failure that he has led us into?  What was there fundamentally wrong with the economic condition of this country? Were our imports altogether out of proportion to our exports?  No. Taking into account invisible exports, the balance was pretty even.  Was there ever a country more sure of being able to maintain and improve on that state of things than we were? Is there a doubt that if the Minister and his colleagues had done their duty at Ottawa&mdash;to go back once again to Ottawa, because it is something that we must always go back to&mdash;they could have obtained a securer position for the home farmer in the British market than he had ever enjoyed?  Instead of England being engaged in making treaties with all sorts of foreign countries that are willing to take her exports which possibly she may no longer be able to send in here&mdash;and in exchange taking their agricultural products&mdash;we could have made a treaty, the outcome of which would be to increase the <Col N="1544" /> volume of our agricultural exports to England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>What did happen was this, that the farmers of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland did not have their case fought, and if their case had been fought, and if they had stood together, the farmers of this country would have been put in a better position, permanently, than they had ever been in before. Now the Minister talked about people having moved from the positions that they used to occupy.  What about himself and his colleagues?  Have they not moved at all from the position that they used to occupy, and when we hear this unconvincing litany of their triumphs, what about their promises?  I do not believe in going back, over and over again, on the past, but when the Minister gets up and makes a speech like that he simply forces us to remind him of the things that he and his colleagues promised the country.  Has he forgotten that they had a plan ready for the cure of unemployment within a year? They published that in their election manifesto all over the country.  Has he forgotten that they promised to relieve agricultural land of rates, and to relieve the farmers of the payment of their land annuities without any danger of an economic war?  Has he forgotten that at the last election they promised that, if returned to power again, they could bring the economic war to an end at once? How many of those promises have been fulfilled, and how has the Minister the impudence to get up and make the speech that he has made here to-night about the accomplishments of his Government?  Really it absolutely takes one's breath away.</P>

Was there ever a Government that was so wildly far away from all the things that they promised to do, and yet they are able to stand up and inflict on us the sort of self-complacency we have just had to listen to.

      <P>I have never boasted that I have sacrificed a lot for Ireland, and if I ever do have the honour of sacrificing a lot for Ireland I shall not boast about it.  I want to try and elicit a little information to-night under two or three headings.  First of all, in the matter of the preservation of ordered liberty in this country.  I will make no excuse for reverting briefly to the speech which the President made here the other night on this subject in connection with what he described as private armies.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If you have forces that follow army nomenclature on the one hand and an army organisation on the other hand, the Government are <Col N="1546" /> determined to see to it that armies of that sort, side by side, each fearing the other, using whatever the other does, are not going to be permitted to continue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the President hold by that declaration, and, if so, would he state exactly what steps he has taken, or is going to take, to see that these armies are not to be permitted to continue?  When the President says that he is against private armies in this country I am with him 100 per cent.  There is no one in this House who has a greater dislike for militarism than I have.  There is nobody in this House who is less inclined to glorify war than I am.  There is far too much glorification of war and soldiering in this country.  There has been too much war and soldiering and too much sham soldiering here as well. It would be a great blessing if we had not so many military metaphors from the Front Benches and so many allusions to the past military prowess of the Front Benches.  War is a filthy business, and war such as we have in this country with the characteristics of civil war is an especially filthy business.  The less glorification there is of it the better for the future of our country, and for the future of our young men.  People who go about talking of the noble trade of arms, and the inspiring effect of the tramping of armed men, and using military metaphors about marching to victory, are talking nonsense, and mischievous nonsense, and the sooner we get away from militarism in every shape and form the better for everyone.  What is remarkable is that, in spite of all our pressure, the President never developed this point of view with regard to private armies until a few weeks ago.  Why has he developed it? When the A.C.A. was still the A.C.A., and already in Blue Shirts and berets, with ex-Ministers marching about in procession with them, the Government paid little or no attention.  I might say that during that period the A.C.A., or some of them, were making speeches and declarations that personally I very much disliked.  There were speeches <Col N="1547" /> and advertisements about starting to do in this country what the Black Shirts did for Italy.  I strongly object to anything of that kind.  If anyone in this House wants a dictatorship, certainly I do not.</P>
    <P>When General O'Duffy took over, what happened?  It is true that he gave the new organisation, or the old organisation, whichever you call it, a military sounding name.  Frankly I wish he had not done so.  At the same time, however, he proclaimed objects for that organisation which definitely took it out of the category of a private army.  He declared it to be civilian in all its aims and methods.  As far as I can make out, the military side of it is something to appeal to the young.  I am very sorry that it seems to be necessary to appeal to the young by a military atmosphere of that kind.  There seems to be, as far as one can judge from the declarations of those now responsible for control, less danger about that body than ever in the past. Therefore, I am unable to understand this hasty enrolling of extra police, and these rumours that are spread about with regard to gunpowder plots.  The mystery and the sensation worked up during the last week with regard to the National Guard, and its possible activities, are to me incomprehensible and ridiculous.  I hope before we adjourn for the holidays that the President will throw some light on what was passing through his mind and through the minds of his colleagues when they took these peculiar steps.  Are they going to take steps to see that these private armies do not exist?  What are those steps?  As regards the I.R.A., do the steps they are going to take involve enrolling in the Government service every member of the I.R.A. as a paid servant of the State?  Is that the plan?  If so, will a similar offer be made to the other private army?  If not, why not?  What reason is there for treating one on a different basis to the other?  The objects of the I.R.A. are, at least, as much open to suspicion as the objects of the National Guard&mdash;I would say very much more open to suspicion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> The President told us the other night, when asked to express his views on the I.R.A., that their movement was unnecessary, and that that was a truth which would soon penetrate into their minds.  The reason it was unnecessary was because the objects they were after were going to be attained by him by peaceful means.  Is that a proper answer to that organisation or to any organisation? Surely it is immaterial whether their objects are going to be attained. The point is that no one in this country has any business to go after any object except by peaceful means.  If it cannot be attained by peaceful means, then it cannot be attained at all.  That ought to be the attitude.  I suggest that if the President is going to proceed by the method of reasoning kindly with the I.R.A., perhaps it is not a bad method.  He might talk to them in a rather different strain.  He might possibly point out that an illegitimate attempt to impose their will on the people by force is intolerable. He might mention the fact that if what they are after is a republic, there is nothing in the wide world to stop him from declaring a republic to-morrow, except, I should say in fairness, that he has pledged himself that he will not do so until he has consulted the people again.  If he does consult them&mdash;whether at a general election or by referendum &mdash;he can declare a republic without let or hindrance from anyone. Should persons with the slightest common sense, then, go about brandishing arms as a method of arriving at that or any other object?</P>
    <P>If I were an Englishman with no sympathy for Ireland&mdash;the kind of Englishman who had no particular sympathy for Ireland or particular interest in Ireland&mdash;I should be strongly in favour of the Irish Free State turning itself into a republic at the earliest possible moment because, as far as I can see, the English would have nothing whatever to lose by it. They are over-populated and hard-pressed for occupations for their sons and daughters.  By excluding the very considerable number of people from this country who still go into the <Col N="1549" /> position in various parts of the Commonwealth and in England, they would have all the more openings for their own people.  They are hard-pressed by the numbers of unemployed they have to provide for.  No doubt it would be very agreeable to them to do what the Americans do, to deport from that country all persons of Irish birth who are unemployed, on the ground that they were not citizens of Great Britain.  When they consider the situation in India, I should think it would be very satisfactory to them to have an object lesson, as it would be an object lesson, that the mere conversion of the Free State into a republic did not suddenly introduce an age of gold.</P>
    <P>For my part, as a citizen of the State, as an Irishman, I believe quite firmly that the ultimate destiny of this country is within the British Commonwealth. I believe that the Border will go, and that we will be in the British Commonwealth, not as slaves, but as co-partners and as co-proprietors.  I am certain that is the ultimate destiny of this country&mdash;though it may be long after my death, if the policy of the present Government continues. Even though that is my view of the ultimate destiny of the Free State I would derive considerable consolation from the immediate declaration of a republic if and when the President gets the verdict of the people.  I cannot see how without the declaration of a republic, and the experience of a republic, we are ever going to de-bunk Irish politics, and God knows they need de-bunking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order Paper to-day we had a series of Bills presented for First Reading, which represents the last word in the Government's constitutional wisdom.  This is their idea of giving more freedom and dignity to this nation.  It is absolute and pitiable rubbish, not worth bestowing a moment's thought upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning of this session they assented to a motion that the primary <Col N="1550" /> object of every Irish Government ought to be the reunion of Ireland and every other constitutional consideration should be subordinate to that.  To what extent have they implemented that motion?  What have they done to promote the reunion of Ireland during the last six or seven months?  The first thing they have got to do, if they want to promote the reunion of Ireland, is to put an end to quarrels with England and, besides putting an end to quarrels with England, putting an end to the sort of class antagonisms that their followers are never tired of raising all through the country and putting an end to the kind of allusions to the past and to the kind of reproaches about the past which, if justified, would turn men like Grattan, O'Connell and even Parnell himself into bad Irishmen.  I never heard that O'Connell was reproached because he stood aloof from the rebellion of 1798 or that Parnell was reproached because he stood aloof from the activities of the Fenians.</P>
    <P>Really, if this country is to come to anything, we must become a little more charitable and a little more broadminded. I would have no difficulty, if I wanted to do it, in formulating reproaches about some of the things that occurred in the years to which Deputies are so fond of alluding.  I can assure Deputy Cleary or anybody of his type that it is not from timidity that I would refrain from making such allusions; rather would it be because I consider such allusions disruptive and unpatriotic.  For Heaven's sake let us attribute the best motives to each other, whatever course we may have taken in the past. Until there is absolute proof that a man is unpatriotic, let us assume him to be patriotic.</P>
    <P>I hope the President will give us a little more information about his attitude towards the so-called private armies, and a little more information about the extent to which the idea of a re-union in Ireland still carries weight with him.  There are other matters I would also like to know about.  The Government are fond of stocktaking. They have an opportunity now for a little stocktaking.  During their holiday <Col N="1551" /> celebrations they will have an opportunity of stocktaking and examining their consciences.  Have they given up even considering the possibility of finding ways and means wherewith to bring to an end the economic conflict with England?  I am not going over ground travelled a hundred times already.  It is apparent from speeches that we read in the papers and rumours that we hear round and about that a friendly arrangement by negotiation with England is practically out of the question, because it involves some assurance with regard to our constitutional relations that the Government are unwilling to give.  If I am wrong in that I am open to correction.  At any rate, that is what I gather to be the state of affairs.  If that is so, is it really impossible to go back to the other method, the method of arbitration?</P>
    <P>I have never believed that we were as far apart on the question of arbitration as Government spokesmen have been inclined to make out unless on the assumption that the Government do not want arbitration at all and are refusing to come to close quarters on the question.  If they want arbitration, is it not really possible that the thing can be achieved?  Suppose to-morrow they appointed two Irish citizens to represent us, and asked the British to appoint two British citizens to represent them, and then left the question of a chairman to be settled by those four people on the basis that a few from within the Commonwealth could be selected and a few from without the Commonwealth could be selected.  Let us say there would be six names from within and without the Commonwealth, all of which would be unanimously agreed upon by the four people as suitable, fair and able men. One man's name could then be drawn out of the hat.  When I first spoke of the economic war in this House I ventured the statement that it would be more sensible to settle the whole land annuity question by tossing a coin than by having an economic war about it.  I felt exactly the same about the European War in 1914.  For some reason or other it is thought to <Col N="1552" /> be a childish thing to trust anything to chance, whereas if you are pigheaded enough to bring your country to ruin it is not regarded as childish at all.  I suggest, if the Government have to rule out an arrangement by friendly negotiation on the ground that we cannot expect to be treated as one of a family unless we belong to that family, they should explore again the method of arbitration and see if something cannot be achieved on those lines.</P>
    <P>The Government are fond of suggesting that everybody who opposes them is insincere in his opposition, and that we are all anxious to see them fail.  That accusation has been extended not only to the official opposition but to my colleagues and myself.  I know no way of proving the contrary to people who do not want to believe; but I cannot pass by in silence such accusations as were made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-night.  I, therefore, want to say most categorically, and I will allow anyone to reproach me for it afterwards if I ever act in a manner contrary to the spirit of the declaration, that not only have I frequently and almost officiously offered assistance to the Government in the past in matters connected with this dispute with England, but in those matters now and in any efforts of a constructive nature that the Government may make, I shall conscientiously refrain from unreasonable and dishonest criticism, and I shall do my very best to help them on in any enterprise that I regard as being for the good of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had to-night a very interesting speech delivered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He went to an enormous amount of trouble to explain to the House that the imports into this State were falling off.  He went through a very long category of things which he said are no longer being imported.  Of course, the imports of this State are falling off.  What else could happen except that the imports of the State <Col N="1553" /> would fall off?  But to say that the imports have fallen off and that the home market is providing the same proportionate quantity of goods to be purchased is absolutely a different matter.  There can be no question about it that the Government have succeeded in reducing this State and every person in the State to a condition of poverty such as has not happened within living memory, such as the people of the State have not had to endure within the memory of any living person.  That is a matter which no man can dispute.  Nobody who looks at this State and regards the condition of the inhabitants fairly and not through prejudiced eyes can deny that the country is poorer now than it has been in living memory. And because this country has been reduced to that condition of poverty, of course there is a falling off in the purchasing power of the people.</P>
      <P>When by your economic war you have reduced the farmers of this country to a state of abject poverty, then of course, you have killed purchasing power in this State.  It follows and flows from that that the home market is gone, and therefore it can neither absorb the amount of imported stuff it used to absorb nor can it absorb any largely increased amount of home produce.  That is obvious and plain, and it is happening everywhere.  As to all these millions of pounds that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was so glibly talking about, if all these millions were now employed in the purchasing of Irish goods how could it happen that the figures of unemployment would be increasing and steadily increasing?  How is it, with all these millions of pounds of a reduction in imports, that we have our workers flung out of employment and out of wages?  How is it, after all this talk about millions, that we have no increase of employment?  Any increase of employment that you can show is an increase of employment amongst girls and lowly paid workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is this great increase of prosperity, and as the Minister for Industry and Commerce says, &ldquo;we have settled this and we have settled <Col N="1554" /> that and we have settled the other thing,&rdquo; how does it come that the figures of those in receipt of home assistance have already reached such appalling dimensions, and that they are going up month by month at an appalling rate?  We have month by month 10,000 extra persons going upon home assistance in this State which is supposed to be flourishing and which, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has now been put upon a sound basis. Everybody in the State, we are told, is happy, well-off and rich.  But every month a population equivalent to the population of the very largest of our country towns is being added to the number who are receiving home assistance.</P>
    <P>In the face of facts and figures like that, what is the use of asking this House to believe that the State is getting rich, and that it is getting rich because these imports have fallen off? That was the whole tenor of the speech delivered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as far as he attempted to be apologetic for the Government at all.  Of course, he spent a good deal of his time attacking the Opposition.  We do not care for the Minister's attacks.  They leave us quite unmoved.  We know that the Minister is a gentleman of a flippant disposition with a flippant wit, and we do not in the slightest mind his attacks.  We would be rather disappointed if from time to time the dulness of Fianna Fáil oratory was not enlivened by the flippancies, possibly the cheap flippancies, of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not attempt to deal with and that was what was contained in the major portion of Deputy Cosgrave's speech. Deputy Cosgrave pointed out that there were promises made that agriculture was going to thrive and flourish under Fianna Fáil and that instead of thriving and flourishing it has been reduced to its present terrible position. The Minister for Industry and Commerce made no reference at all to that when he was on his feet.  He made no <Col N="1555" /> attempt to gainsay what Deputy Cosgrave had said.  On the question of the agricultural conditions in this country the Minister for Industry and Commerce was silent and from his point of view rightly silent.  There was nothing to be said and it was better for him, he considered, to say nothing.  But we have what is plain for every man to see, the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party as shown by its fruits.  We see that policy in the only way by which it can be best seen and that is by its fruits.</P>
    <P>We know that millions of money, the property of the State and of the ratepayers and taxpayers of this State, have been taken out of their pockets, have been spent by the Ministry and there is nothing to show for that expenditure.  We see that money is being wasted and that the State is compelling the private individual to live upon his capital.  The Government of this State is wasting the capital of this State.  But the Ministry have determined not to be satisfied even with wasting the capital of the State.  The Ministry are also wasting the moral resources of the State. Fianna Fáil have done a lot of terribly bad things; they have done a lot of noxious things and have done a lot of them deliberately.  They have done a lot of material harm to this State but in nothing is Fianna Fáil so blameworthy as in the way in which they have set themselves to work to demoralise the people of this State.  They have done many wrong and bad things, but the things for which posterity will most condemn them, is for the way in which they have set themselves to work to lower the tone of this State and to lower the conditions of the people in this State regarded from the moral point of view.</P>
    <P>You have got people in this State who are industrious and hard-working and the Government has simply set to work and has endeavoured to bribe them.  You have given them relief works when it became necessary by your action and on these relief works there was nothing whatsoever to be done and these people were not called upon to do any work.  Some of you Deputies have told them openly in this House &ldquo;it is no use to work upon your <Col N="1556" /> land; your land can never be made pay.&rdquo;  You have done every single thing that you can do to turn industrious hard-working people into idle people looking for their support not to the fruits of their hands on their own lands but looking to Government doles, to home assistance and things like that. That is not the only way in which you have demoralised the people.  You have deliberately told the people of this State that defiance of this State and defiance of the laws of this State are the things that pay.</P>
    <P>You have got in this State now an established body which despises the institutions of the State, despises or at any rate professes to despise the Executive of this State and what it stands for, and that body of men are the complete masters of the Executive Council. They tell the Executive Council what they wish them to do and meekly and humbly the Executive Council obeys. Do you want to know what is the next step the Executive Council is going to take?  If you want to know what their next step is read <i>An Phoblacht</i> and you will have a very fair idea of what is going to be done.  The I.R.A., through its organ, demand certain things from the Executive Council and every single thing that they have demanded the Executive Council with meekness and that pusillanimity which is the keynote of its character immediately accedes to their request.</P>
    <P>General O'Duffy is disliked by them. &ldquo;He must go,&rdquo; is their cry, and because the I.R.A. demanded it he goes.  Exactly the same happened with Colonel Neligan.  They are not satisfied with the Department of Justice. A solicitor, who was their standing solicitor, must be taken and put in as secretary of that Department.  One of their number, a man named Dempsey, was charged and refused to recognise the court.  <i>An Phoblacht</i> demands his release and he is released.  As to how far that release was actually dictated to the Minister's predecessor by armed men I do not know.  I do know that it was commonly stated and believed by most people that it was so dictated. It has been so stated in this House, at any rate, and it has not been denied. We know this much anyhow, that the Minister's predecessor did not carry <Col N="1557" /> out <i>in toto</i>, though he did to some extent, the orders that the I.R.A. gave him, and he had, at any rate, the manliness to refuse to hold an office in which he could not function, could not discharge the duties of the office as the duties of the office ought to be discharged, because no man holding the post of Minister for Justice should allow himself to be the mere puppet of any persons outside the House, and that is what we have in the present Minister for Justice.  &ldquo;This man must go; that other man must go; we want this, we want that, and we want the other,&rdquo; and the Minister for Justice does what he is told.</P>
    <P>He came into the House the other day to explain the extraordinary action of what he called taking stock of the arms in the country&mdash;taking stock of the arms of persons who had these arms legitimately because, in the opinion of the Guards, they required them.  Does he go to the I.R.A. to take stock of their arms? Not at all.  I should like to see the Minister for Justice facing the I.R.A. and saying: &ldquo;I want a list of your arms.&rdquo;  It was stated here the other night that there ought to be no arms left with the I.R.A., because Cumann na nGaedheal had ten years in which they could have collected those arms. Cumann na nGaedheal did collect a great deal of those arms and found a great number of dumps.  I should like to know how many dumps the Guards have found since Fianna Fáil came into office.  Either directly or indirectly they have been told not to search for those arms, or they know that if they found those arms, instead of being rewarded for doing their duty they would be punished by the persons who ought to reward them.  There must be some cause of that nature, because no dumps of arms have been discovered since Fianna Fáil came into office.  Look at the opportunities they had, and have still, in comparison with the opportunities Cumann na nGaedheal had got.  When the Ministers opposite were in opposition I again and again stated to the present Minister for Defence and to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce: &ldquo;One of <Col N="1558" /> you was the so-called Chief of Staff of the I.R.A., and the other was the so-called Minister for Defence.  You were determined to upset then, if you could, by force of arms, this State and its institutions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When there was an order to dump these arms nobody could have known better than Mr. Lemass, as he then was, and Mr. Aiken, as he then was, what arms there were and where they were placed.  Have they ever told the Minister for Justice what they know about the arms, what quantity of arms were dumped and where they are to be found?  They had every opportunity. That is information which they can give to the Minister for Justice, information which they most certainly would give if there was any desire on the part of the Executive Council to collect arms from the I.R.A.  But, of course, there is not.  There is no such desire, even though they know that that armed body is a body which has been condemned by the Church in Ireland and by the heads of the Church&mdash; that body and its associate body, Saor Eire; even though they know that body is there planning to establish not a republic of the type that Deputy MacDermot talked about, but a republic of the Soviet type.  That is the type of republic which they are seeking to establish and which they have armed themselves and are arming themselves in an attempt to establish in this State. Though you know all that, though you profess to regard yourselves as Ministers in a Christian State, yet you allow these bodies to arm themselves for the express purpose of upsetting the present established Christian social order, and, instead of facing them, you humbly do their behests, because you are wanting in courage and dare not face them.</P>
    <P>Then another body arises.  We had mention of it to-night.  Of course, such another body had to arise.  Anybody who knows this country knows that another body would have to arise, that you had made that inevitable.  Do you think that in a country like this, with the traditions behind it which this country has got, the young men who have been reared in Irish and Catholic traditions are going to allow themselves <Col N="1559" /> and to allow their State to be trampled upon by persons whose aims, objects and desires are so completely antagonistic to everything that they and their fathers held dear?  Of course, they have joined together; of course there has been a wonderful spontaneous movement of the young men of this country who are determined that they will keep this country a Catholic country.  That is what their association is.  That is what the National Guard is.  It is the spontaneous rising up of men, determined that the forces organised against Christianity and Catholicism, in this city, shall not be the only forces organised. If the forces of disruption are going to be organised, then there are going, also, to be organised forces that stand for the present preservation of society.  But the Government are brave against them.  They are an unarmed body, and the Government talks a terrible amount about them.  They get suddenly brave as regards them, and then we see such things as we have seen lately.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Justice to-day about this new armed force that has been organised.  He said it is not a new armed force; it is merely recruiting to make up the ordinary strength of the Civic Guards.  Some time ago the Minister for Justice informed me that there were 2,000 Guards too many when the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were in office. Now he is going to have more Guards than there were at any time from the time that I became Minister.  He is going to increase the force which he said was 2,000 too many some time ago. I said on a previous occasion that it was perfectly obvious that it was the intention of the Government to recruit for the Gárda this year.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;it is not our intention to recruit until the Guards have fallen in numbers.&rdquo;  Why then this sudden recruiting?  Why this parade of sending armed guards into Leinster House? What is the meaning of this force? The only armed body that could attack this House is an armed body that wishes to upset by force of arms the Constitution of the State.  Are these armed Guards all over the place here <Col N="1560" /> to defend this House against the I.R.A.?  They are not.  If the I.R.A. wanted to attack this House I do not believe the Executive Council would stop them.  Who then are these men? What loyal body is there in this city that would require these extra men hurriedly collected together?  Of course, we have not been told.  We have been left to gather, especially from the English newspapers, which I suppose have got the information through some Government Department, that this armed force was brought in here to prevent unarmed men&mdash;the National Guard&mdash;from seizing Leinster House.  Is there one single Minister or Deputy follower of Ministers who is not moved to tears of laughter at an explanation of that kind?  Does the Minister think that that sort of explanation is going to carry conviction to one single person in this country?</P>
    <P>It would be a very interesting matter to learn where were these armed men collected from.  We challenge the Minister to say whether they were recruited in the ordinary way.  He cannot get up and say they were.  There are regulations laid down by virtue of which certain things have to be gone through, and certain formulas have to be observed which could not have been gone through here, before a man could be legally attested as a member of the Civic Guards.  I challenged the Minister as to whether these things had been gone through, and he could not say that they had. I challenge the Minister here, and now, to say if these regulations have been carried out in respect of the new recruits.  I challenge him to say if each new recruit has been recommended by the chief superintendent of the district in which he lives.  That is laid down in the regulations.  I challenge the Minister for Justice to say if each one has been examined by a doctor and found to be medically fit, as laid down in the regulations.  I challenge him to say is each one of them between the legal ages of 18 and 27, or are some of them considerably over that age, and how many of them have passed the Civil Service examination, which must be passed, before they can be legally attested members <Col N="1561" /> of the Guards.  I would like to know these things and to have a specific answer upon each of them, but the Minister dodged giving any answer to these matters at question time to-day.</P>
    <P>There is one person, and one person only, in this State, who can select recruits for the Civic Guards. That is the Commissioner.  He is absolutely supreme in this matter. The Minister did not deny that to-day, when I put a question to him. I said to him to-day&mdash;and this appeared in the newspapers&mdash;that these new recruits were selected by Deputy Traynor, and not by the Commissioner, and the Minister could not contradict that statement.  It is a statement which, if untrue, should not have been made and, no doubt, would have been contradicted the very moment it appeared, by the Department of Justice.  Of course it would.  But it has not been contradicted here in this House, and we now know that the Commissioner recently appointed is considered by the Minister for Justice incompetent to perform the important duty of selecting those who are to be recruited to the Guards, and that the work that should be discharged by the Commissioner of the Guards has been delegated, by the Department of Justice to a Fianna Fáil Deputy.</P>
    <P>That is the way the law is observed.  I said in the beginning of my speech that I considered that, bad as I thought the economic policy of the Government was, much ruin and misery as I thought they had brought upon this State, yet in nothing have they done so much harm as they have done in demoralising the people of the State by putting the forces of disorder above the law.  After all, no matter how poor we may be, there is always the hope that once this Government goes, and sane people get into command of the forces of the State, it may be, slowly and painfully, but, at any rate, finally achieved that we will get back to the position of prosperity that we were in two or three years ago.  Financial losses may be overcome and recouped, but there is one thing that it is terribly hard to get back, that it is <Col N="1562" /> almost impossible to get back, and that is the morale of a people that have been once demoralised.  This is the great and serious injury which you have done, an injury which would be an irreparable one except that the people of this State have been determined that no matter what you may do to terrorise them, no matter how you may strive to demoralise them, they will not be demoralised, and when you put them in danger they are determined to save themselves.</P>

      <P>I listened with quite considerable interest to the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-night.  The more I listened to the speech of the Minister the more I was reminded of the defence of the small timid boy, who whistled in the dark in order that he might still his fears.  It seemed to me that in spite of the buoyancy, largely artificial, which was displayed by the Minister, there were streaks of despair and patches of cold feet in the industrial policy upon which the Minister has mainly relied so far.  We were told by the Minister of what had been accomplished by the tariffs.  We were told of the extent to which certain industries were supplying the home market.  We were told by the Minister, for instance, in relation to confectionery, that the imports had dropped enormously, and that the home factories were now supplying practically the whole of the home market.  The amount of employment in that connection was something which apparently pleased the Minister extremely, but in this House, on the 11th July last, the Minister stated that the number of additional persons who had secured employment in the confectionery trade, including the sugar and jam trades, was 151 for the previous 18 months.</P>

      <P>It seemed to me that the buoyancy of the Minister might well have been leavened with some sense of reality, some sense of responsibility, and, indeed, some kind of knowledge of the real position of industry and unemployment by somebody who is able now, as the Minister was in other days, to devote some time to consideration first hand of what the real position in the country is.  The Minister's speech showed that his mind was the mind of an enthusiastic tariff reformer, but his own figures give no consolation whatever, and no justification whatever for the apparent clear and sole dependence of the Government upon tariffs as a means of producing industrial regeneration.</P>
      <P>On the 11th July, 1933 the Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce supplied this House with certain information as to the number of persons engaged in 18 industrial or manufacturing groups.  Those 18 industrial groups ranged over tobacco, boots and shoes, soaps and candles, coach and motor bodies, confectionery, brush-making, shirts and collars, spinning, hosiery and knitted goods, wholesale clothing, furniture, margarine, and woollens and worsteds, many of the principal industries of the country. I find that in respect of those 18 industries an additional 2,465 persons secured employment during the previous 18 months.  Let us remember that at some portion of that time at least 100,000 people were registered as unemployed, but that in five cases in respect of those particular industries there was actually a fall of 771 in the number employed, notwithstanding the multiplied tariffs in operation under the Government's policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one takes the trouble to examine the real position a good deal of interesting information is presented to one.  The Minister for Industry and <Col N="1564" /> Commerce stated this evening that in respect of the wearing apparel trade the progress made had more than exceeded his expectations.  I do not know what the Minister's expectations were in the first instance.  If his expectations were to ruin employment in the trade it seems to me that those expectations are near realisation, because&mdash;again according to the information supplied by the Minister's own Department&mdash;there are 490 less persons employed in the wholesale clothing industry to-day than were employed on the 30th September 1931. Yet the Minister stated this evening that the progress made in that respect more than exceeded his expectations. It seems to me that any Minister who makes statements of that kind is completely divorced from any practical knowledge of the real position in industry.  There is no justification on the face of those figures, those unchallengeable figures published by the Minister's own Department, for the buoyancy, and indeed to some extent the flippant buoyancy, displayed by the Minister this evening.  I certainly could find no reason to share that buoyancy with him.  I can certainly find no reason to be satisfied with the statistics in those 18 trades.  I am sure the Minister on cool reflection, and his colleagues in the Executive Council, if they take the trouble to ask the Minister to give them the figures for March, 1933 and September, 1931 in respect of tariffed industries, will find poor consolation from reading those figures.</P>
    <P>There is another example that is well worth quoting.  It ought to be an object lesson to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce; it ought to be a sign post to show him the direction in which he is proceeding.  Again, quoting from the Minister's own figures, I find that there are 20 less persons employed to-day in the brush-making industry than were employed in September, 1931.  I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to find out to what extent the output has increased in that particular industry with less hands employed to-day than were employed in 1931.  I had actual experience of that industry.  I <Col N="1565" /> know the position of the workers engaged in that industry.  I know the complaints of the workers engaged in it.  You find to-day that a lesser number of people in the brush-making industry are producing at least four times the output they produced two years ago.  Now we get some idea of the picture with which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is satisfied. It seems to me that the Minister this evening is making a very good capitalist out of himself.  The Minister's speech this evening was the speech of one who wanted effcient capitalism even if it meant very little humanity.</P>
    <P>To purport to believe that he can be satisfied with less people employed when production is being increased by four times what it was two years ago, seems to me to be a lamentable exhibition of the Minister's feelings on the matter, as is his attempt to balance production with the human needs of the people engaged in the industry or unemployed, because industry is being run on highly mechanised lines to-day. One thing I was tempted to ask the Minister during his speech but I refrained from doing so lest I might let loose a cat amongst the industrial pigeons trotted out this evening.  It seems to me that the Minister imagines that all we have got to do is to supply the whole of the home market and then everything will be well.  That kind of mentality seems to be as &ldquo;daft&rdquo; as a halfpenny watch&mdash;to imagine that once you supply the home market everything in the garden will be lovely.  I want to ask the Minister and some of his colleagues in the Executive Council who will participate in the debate on what grounds there is any justification for pinning our faith to the belief that when we are supplying our own home market, under the existing systems of society, currency and credit, we are going to get prosperity and the industrial and economic wealth that some people so glibly talk about.  If supplying the whole home market could bring prosperity many countries in the world would be reeking with prosperity to-day. In America we find a country that can supply in little more than half the year, all its needs for its home requirements.  There is no question of <Col N="1566" /> anybody invading the American market.  The American manufacturers have the market to themselves.  They supply in seven months of the year all the home requirements for the year. Yet we have 12,000,000 unemployed in that country to-day.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that even if you reach the stage here where you can supply all your own home requirements, you will still be a long way from solving the unemployment problem.  You will still be a long way from giving to the people of the country that prosperity and economic security to which, in my view, they have an inalienable right. Only a person with the most elementary notions of economics, only a person with the most amateurish visions of industrial and economic practice, could possibly be so foolish as to imagine that our economic ills will be solved and disappear automatically once we supply our home market with all the commodities which our people require. The Minister's speech this evening gave me the impression, at all events, that he was the dutiful child of the capitalist system of society, the dutiful imbiber of the capitalist philosophy. His flamboyancy this evening gave me the impression, at all events, that he was impregnated with a new enthusiasm for a false, and what, I have no hesitation in predicting here to-night, will be a very ephemeral faith.  In my opinion there can be no solution of the unemployment problem so long as you have a system where the exploitation of the many in the interest of the few is the only impetus to producing goods.  So long as you have such a system, you will inevitably have unemployment, misery, poverty and destitution, because that system can only survive by keeping the many in poverty and destitution in order that the few may walk off with the commercial swag.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us of the many new industries that were being established. He told us of the new industries he hopes to establish.  I wonder why the Minister did not produce an industrial balance sheet in this particular connection?  As a result of the imposition of tariffs, certain financial interests who want high dividends on their money, high dividends on <Col N="1567" /> money surplus to their own personal requirements, in order that they may store and store and store, come into the country and unloose their money in one way or another in starting industries. The Minister speaks of the number of people put into employment, but not one word did he say about the rate of wages they get, not one word about the age of the people who go into these factories, not one word as to whether the factory is in a main street or in a hygienic building, not one word about the fact that many of the so-called factories might be put in inverted commas, as I said here before, when reference was made to them.  They are in kitchens, cellars, basements, lofts and in back lanes, the workers existing under conditions that even in ancient Babylon would have excited condemnation.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes no stock of the position, as to what is happening in any field of activity.  The Minister talked about the progress that was being made in the milling industry.  I am sorry the Minister is not in the House until I would put one simple question to him.  Perhaps some of his colleagues would be good enough to probe this.  Though there is now prohibition of the import of flour, and though we are doing all our milling in the country to-day, there is one big mill in this city which has enormously increased its output as a result of the prohibition of the importation of flour, and I challenge the Minister to deny that concurrently with the substantial increase in production in that mill there has been a very substantial reduction in staff.  What is happening seems to be happening unknown to the Minister. The Minister, with the aid of tariffs, is assisting the small huckstering manufacturer to establish himself in kitchens, in lofts, in back lanes, under appalling conditions, sweating people and not merely sweating adults but sweating children.  That is happening in the small and inefficient factory, and the efficient manufacturer is installing machinery, the man who employed 20 people for the one who found juvenile employment in back <Col N="1568" /> lanes, kitchens and lofts with the inefficient manufacturer.  The man who could pay decent rates of wages is introducing machinery and sentencing to economic death two and three times the number of people who have secured child wages in the child farms and in the sweating shops that are being established as a result of tariffs.</P>

      <P>We have statements in the paper each week almost that the number of registered unemployed this week was less than last week.  I want to commend the prudence which the editorial staff of the <i>Irish Press</i> displayed some time ago when they seriously warned their readers not to take it that this actually meant a drop in the number of unemployed in the country.  These were very wise words, and a copy of that particular issue of the paper might well be sent to those people who suffer from excessive buoyancy, because to-day even on the Government's own admission we have 57,000 people registered as unemployed at the local labour exchanges.  I venture to say that if you announced in this House to-day that another £1,000,000 would be made available for every county in the country, and that it would be distributed on the basis of the number of unemployed registered, that that figure would go up from 57,000 to not less than 100,000, because in my view &mdash;and I might as well be frank; there is no use in burying our heads in the sands&mdash;the unemployment problem to-day&mdash;I have no hesitation in saying it, because we gain nothing by dodging facts&mdash;is as serious as it was 12 months or two years ago.  I said before that I do not believe it is possible to cure the unemployment problem under a system of society that is as mad as it is outworn.  Even without asking the Government to adopt another system of society&mdash; although the present President, in one of his sensible and more revolutionary moments once said that he would have no hesitation in going <Col N="1569" /> outside the present system if it was necessary to do so&mdash;without asking them to adopt a radical alteration in the existing system, much could be done to help the problem of unemployment. Here, perhaps, I might ask the President at what time or in what year he expects to make up his mind whether the present system will give him the industrial regeneration he expects to have.  We have seen the effects of the Government's policy in the clothing industry, in the brush-making industry, in the soap and candle industry, and we have seen the generally poor results of relying on tariffs in stimulating industry.  My complaint is that the Government has no organised plan whatever behind its industrial policy.  They have no push behind their policy and no scientific drive.  I will concede that there is plenty of enthusiasm, but a bear in a china shop can be very enthusiastic without being very effective.</P>

      <P>My point is that while each Minister is trying to prove that he is a very efficient Minister in his own Department, there is no national thinking-box in existence thinking out national policy.  If any member of the Government comes along to say that there is a thinking-box and that it has been in operation for the past 18 months it is presuming too much on our credulity altogether when we have the Dáil sitting four days a week and sometimes all night, to suggest that they are doing anything except in the sense of remembering what they are losing by this business.  The Government has no thinking-box, no industrial plan.  It seems to me that they are just travelling from one policy to another, from one piece of legislation to another, patching up here and there, and bolstering up generally, the rents in the capitalistic system of society which have not been patched in other countries in the world and which will not be patched even with Fianna Fáil cloth and thread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time that some members of the Fianna Fáil Party, who are not wholly innoculated with the policy of capitalism, should say something to the <Col N="1570" /> Executive Council which, perhaps, the Executive Council would take in a more friendly fashion than from these benches.  It is time that some such members should suggest that the Government should take up their oars from the sea, and instead of rowing here and there, sit down in the boat and think out a plan and then have the courage and the vision to put that plan into operation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce talked with a good deal of flippancy about what might happen in this State industrially if certain things were done, as if working in factories and workshops was the beginning and end of all human happiness&mdash;as if working for 10/- and 12/- a week and being exploited by capitalists at that wage was something to be aimed at.  The Minister, however, was significantly silent this evening as to what the Government's industrial plans were.  There was not a word from the Minister as to the hours of labour to be worked in these industries, or about the labour to be employed in these factories, or about the extent to which machinery in these new factories is displacing human labour and condemning that human labour to the industrial scrap-heap. There was not a word from him as to what the currency policy of the Government was, or as to what the credit policy of the Government was, or as to what the Government proposed to do in respect of banking, currency and credit; though every thinking member of the Fianna Fáil Party must realise that these problems are at the root of every scheme of industrial and agricultural regeneration, especially in a small country such as this.  Recently, the Minister for Lands and Fisheries was sent to America on some mission or other.  I have no doubt that he did his duty very well while there and I think he has gained considerably by the fact that he probably had an opportunity of reading, while in America, some of the schemes which even that Mecca of capitalism, that economic madhouse of capitalism, is finding it necessary to devise for the protection of its own people.  I would not mind sitting here <Col N="1571" /> until 6 o'clock to-morrow and voting for an amendment to send the whole of the Executive Council to America in order that they could stay there and study at first hand some of the methods being employed, not in a country where the Government talks about the revolutionary methods that the Fianna Fáil Party talks about, but in a country where the capitalistic system predominates. If they studied the affairs in that country I doubt whether the Government, which is so revolutionary at election times, would even have the courage to follow in the footsteps of what the Americans have found it necessary to do in the interests of their own people.  Speaking recently on the subject of his proposals to try to assist America to recover from the economic depression which had swept that country with such appalling consequences the President of the United States said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In my inaugural address I laid down the simple proposition that nobody is going to starve in this country.  It seems to me equally plain that no business which depends for its existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country.  By business I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers&mdash; the white-collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level&mdash;I mean the wages of decent living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a pretty sound philosophy which might be studied profitably, and which, more effectively, could be acted upon by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>Recently the London <i>Times</i>, a responsible Press organ, discussing the way that American employers were likely to look upon President Roosevelt's proposals in his endeavour to restore prosperity to American industry, pointed out that the President could, under his Industrial Recovery Act, &ldquo;compel all businesses to secure federal licences without <Col N="1572" /> which they would be forbidden to operate.&rdquo;  It pointed out that the Industrial Recovery Act empowers the President of the United States to &ldquo;fix minimum wages and maximum hours per industrial employee.&rdquo;  Here in the Board of Works we find that, instead of minimum rates of wages being fixed, there is a definite instruction to pay less wages than even those paid in the most debased industry in the country to-day.  The following quotation from the London <i>Times</i> of the 11th July will not be wasted on the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Referring to the activities of President Roosevelt under what it describes as the &ldquo;Cotton Code&rdquo; of the Industrial Recovery Act, it says: &ldquo;The new Code establishes a maximum working week of 40 hours, prohibits the employment of persons under 16, fixes a minimum weekly wage of 12 dollars in the Southern mills and 13 dollars in the Northern mills... it will have the effect of raising the average wages in the textile industry by about 30 per cent. and reducing working hours by more than 25 per cent.&rdquo;  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Minister for Finance in particular, might take special notice of that, because instead of fixing minimum rates of wages and reducing working hours and attempting to raise wages in industry by 30 per cent., we find the Minister for Finance, the chief purse-holder of the Executive Council, enforcing wage reductions on persons in the Post Office service who have less than 20/- per week on which they are expected to rear a family and maintain them in ordinary decency and comfort.  £1 per week is very much less than £300 or £400 per annum referred to by the President in his famous speech in the Rathmines town hall last year when he said that £300 or £400 a year was only just adequate for the support and education of a family.  Yet we find the Executive Council, through the mouthpiece of the Minister for Finance, actually slashing wages in the Post Office which amount to less than £1 per week, and on this a man is expected to maintain his wife and five or six children in a state that, we <Col N="1573" /> are told, is shaping towards a Christian social policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not hear one single word from the Minister for Industry and Commerce this evening about any plan which the Government have in mind. We have no indication from the Minister as to the Government's policy to create a credit bank, to deal with working hours, rationalisation, or any attempt to generate here a planned economic, industrial and agricultural life.  The most noticeable thing about the speech of the Minister this evening was not so much what was in it as what was left out of it.  I hope that somebody on the Government Benches will attempt to repair that omission and give the country some indication, as the country is entitled to expect, especially in an economic crisis, as to where it is going and for what reason it is going there.  If the country is going to be asked to row in the boat, it ought to know where the boat is being driven to.  I do not want merely to indulge in condemnation of the apparent inability of the Government to put up any kind of a systematised plan to restore the prosperity of the country.  It seems to me though, without asking the Executive Council to commit what I feel would be the unpardonable sin of getting away from the capitalist system of society, that they might do much more than they are doing in the way of endeavouring to restore prosperity to the country. What we need to-day, firstly, is a national thinking-box, a piece of machinery which will think and plan and order and get things done with reasonable expedition.  Will anybody attempt to say that that is being done to-day, or that the Government's housing policy is being carried out with the expedition that it ought to be?  If any divine prophet were to come amongst us here to-night and tell us that in six months' time the inhabitants of every insanitary house would be poisoned by some particular fumes which would penetrate into these insanitary dwellings, because they were insanitary, would we lose through sheer indulgence and inactivity the opportunity of saving those people by our inability to build decent <Col N="1574" /> houses for them?  The Government needs a thinking-box and it needs a plan.  If it gets that, then I shall have more faith in the future development of its policy than I have now, but I see no reason to have faith in a Government that seems to me to be without what is essential in every intelligent organism, namely, some piece of machinery to enable one to see where that organism is going.  A human being cannot walk the streets inteligently without the use of his intellect.  The Government is attempting to give the country an intelligent life without the capacity to know in what direction it wants to order that intelligent life.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Government that it ought to set up that thinking box immediately, and that it ought to charge it with the responsibility of overhauling our credit system, and especially with the responsibility of putting up a suitable plan for the creation of new money, not against a commodity which we have not got, but against the newly-created capital assets of the nation.  I would charge that thinking box with the responsibility for carrying out on specially created credits a comprehensive scheme of public works to solve our housing problem, to provide decent sanitation and water schemes in all our towns and villages, and generally to take steps to lift our country out of the web of decay and misery which unfortunately hangs over many of the rural portions of our country to-day.  I would tell that national thinking box especially that there is no justification for the roseate view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to get on with a scheme for reducing the hours of labour in industry.</P>
    <P>When asked recently to consider a scheme for forty-eight hours per week in American industry, General Johnson, who is administering the Industrial Recovery Act there, told a deputation which waited upon him that a forty-eight hour week was so long that he would not even consider it. That national thinking box ought to be told that there is no reason whatever, especially with the development of machinery, why people should be condemned to work for long hours <Col N="1575" /> per week while other sections of the community are denied the opportunity of work at all.  Primitive man only worked when there was a scarcity.  To-day we have a surplus, at least an unconsumable surplus, and we have highly intelligent modern man working for long hours, notwithstanding that unconsumable surplus.  That national thinking box ought to be told to get rid of child labour in factories at once, and to bring in proposals for raising the school leaving age.  It ought to be told, too, to bring in proposals for a comprehensive high wage policy which would enable our people to purchase the products of our own industries instead of being compelled to waste the best years of their lives depending on home assistance or cursing the inability of the Government to satisfy them with their human needs.</P>
    <P>I would like some member of the Executive Council to say definitely what system of society they stand for.  Clearly they are not standing for any comprehensive code of Christian social principles, because of the unemployment problem we have in our midst.  The existence of slums, poverty, misery and squalor is a negation of Christianity, and the continued existence of these evils is a perversion of every Christian social principle worthy of the name.  I suggest to the Executive Council that they should not presume too long upon the inherent sternness and resoluteness of our people, in the face of any foreign challenge against our independence, and against our economic liberty.  If that were the only challenge to be met, the only problem we were confronted with, it might be easy to solve it.  We have that challenge on the one hand, and we have a pauperised land on the other hand.  The Government would fail utterly in its duty if it did not use the British challenge to our economic and political liberty as a means of building up here a system of society which will make our nation for all time invulnerable to any challenge, whether by Britain or any other nation which may seek to dominate over us.  I advise the Government not to presume too long on the sympathy and the credulity <Col N="1576" /> of our people.  I advise them to use the interval in thinking, and in thinking hard, and to come back when the Dáil reassembles, and to put before it some comprehensive plan for bringing into existence here the Christian social policy which was so much talked about at election times.  After all, while freedom is a thing highly to be prized, not because it is an end in itself, but because it is a means to an end, what is the use of having secured freedom from foreign domination, if it only means freedom to starve in our own land, because we prefer to follow the social and the industrial policies pursued by those from whose thraldom we have escaped?</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, before getting on to what always seems to him to be his great treasure, the I.R.A., dealt with a few matters in regard to the Department of Justice. He mentioned that it had been the policy of that Department for some time to proceed to move officials and to plant others there.  He referred to the removal of General O'Duffy.  I hope before I conclude to be able to prove that the removal was in the best interests of all.  The Deputy mentioned that a solicitor was placed in the position of Secretary to the Department.

The Deputy may not be aware also that that person was offered a position by the late Executive.

      <P>&ldquo;The organisation has the support of the members of the late Government, the most active being General Mulcahy.  Mr. Blythe supports the organisation through the medium of the <i>United Irishman.</i></P>
      <P>&ldquo;The majority of Cumann na nGaedheal T.D.s and ex-Army officers throughout the Saorstát are also organising.</P>

      <P>So said General O'Duffy.  It will be noticed that since the institution of the A.C.A. one of the most active members was ex-Colonel Jerry Ryan.  I do not know if he was the proposer or seconder of General O'Duffy at the Hibernian Hotel meeting.  At any rate, they were throwing bouquets at each other; each was very pleased with the other.  We have that report.  There are other reports to show that in General O'Duffy's opinion these people were armed.  I assume that the people on the opposite benches who have encouraged and advised people to join this organisation are also aware that, in the words of the Chief Superintendent to General O'Duffy, &ldquo;it is a very formidable danger to the State.&rdquo;</P>

What effort has been made by him to get his first lieutenants or his second-in-command, Mr. Jerry Ryan, to gather up all the arms?

Was there any effort made by the Cumann na nGaedheal Executive Council to try to procure the arms?  How many raids were carried out by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government to secure the arms taken away in 1923 and 1924? They knew perfectly well that these people were retiring and that there were arms missing.  How many of the ex-Army officers who were known to have taken arms away were prosecuted for taking those arms?  We hear a lot of talk about fair play&mdash;fair play all around.</P>

      <P>In an interview given to the Press on the 15th August, 1932, Deputy O'Higgins stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Our objects are peace.  We are an army of peace.  Policy may, however, <Col N="1581" /> not be able to control circumstances. If policy cannot control circumstances in the future, then policy in the future must be directed to some extent by circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we have articles in the <i>United Irishman</i> on the 1st April, the 15th April and the 15th July.  I will quote some of them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... this country has been injured in consequence of the <i>naiveté</i> of the first Saorstát Cabinet, which at a time when the whole world was beginning to sicken of parliamentary demagogy gave us a Constitution in which all the absurd and hurtful refinement of the expiring system are prominent.  Someone has said that the members of our Constitution Drafting Committee should have been hanged, drawn and quartered.  I think the exponent of that view was not unmerciful, for I believe the time will come when suggestions of boiling oil will meet with more general approval.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The article proceeds:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There are indubitably good grounds for the world-wide tendency at present apparent to supersede, modify, or side-step the old Parliamentary system.  The days of its usefulness are gone.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was never discovered that its usefulness was gone until Cumann na nGaedheal was put out of office, and when they saw no prospect of getting back again through the ordinary electoral methods which they themselves provided they began thinking of some other method of getting back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Good Government, honest dealing with the public, political foresight and stable national policies can only be got by abandoning parliamentary <Col N="1582" /> demagogy and creating a popular associative system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will leave it to Deputy McGilligan or someone else to explain what is meant by a popular associative system.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;We may learn from Fascism but we must not attempt any close imitation of it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What is Fascism adopted for in this country?  Does it mean that we are to get away from Parliamentary institutions, to maintain which a war was carried on in this country?  A war was carried on here in the name of the will of the people in order to maintain those Parliamentary institutions.  The article goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Democracy is not self-protected; if assailed it must turn to undemocratic methods of defence or go under.  What is everybody's business is nobody's business.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We have often heard here about the independence of the judges.  This party would not leave the judges out.  Here is an interesting extract:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Judges, civil servants and military and police officers would not be debarred from the Diastral Union but would in fact be expected to join it. Discordant political propaganda and action would only be permitted within narrow limits.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then they would allow propaganda.  I think there is very little doubt about the object of those articles.  Certainly they were not for the purpose of raising in the estimation of the readers of the paper, if it has much of a circulation, any respect for State institutions.  They were not calculated to excite in the minds of the people who would read them any great respect for the institutions in defence of which so much blood has been spilled and so much suffering has been gone through in this country. I would like to take some of General O'Duffy's own statements.  Before I deal with them I will take a report given by him to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, when he was Minister for Justice, before the election of 1932.  It states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The strong action taken by the Government and the courageous manner in which the members of the Dáil and the Seanad supported the Government has saved the country and the people may now exercise the franchise at the coming election <Col N="1584" /> without being terrorised or intimidated.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>We have some more of General O'Duffy's statements on this organisation.  He speaks of &ldquo;people who are not satisfied with other political parties and who thought that debates were undignified and barren of good results for the people.&rdquo; He does not approve of the methods of Deputies here in the Dáil nor does he approve of the debates that have taken place.  He is a good judge now. He talks about &ldquo;working for changes in the Parliamentary system.&rdquo;  He does not, however, tell the people by what means he is to carry out these changes.  &ldquo;Including,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;in their policy what they considered good in Fascism or any other movement.&rdquo; He speaks of &ldquo;Ministers yielding to the advice of permanent officials and that with a change of Government new Ministers became just as objectionable as the old before three months.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Then he goes on to say: &ldquo;A change is coming and that before long the National Guard is going to bring about that change.&rdquo; He says: &ldquo;The Parliamentary system in the Saorstát is un-Irish,&rdquo; that is, un-Irish after ten years.  &ldquo;Every day it is becoming more and more detrimental to the best interests of the Irish people.&rdquo;  It is a wonder he did not impress that view on Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney when he was Minister for Justice and get the view effective in some way.  It must have been obnoxious to him to be carrying out police duties under an un-Irish Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these statements indicate the frame of mind of the individual concerned with this A.C.A. force as it was formerly called, or as it is now, the National Guard.  All these statements indicate the ideas that have been inculcated <Col N="1585" /> into that organisation.  With an organisation such as that, General O'Duffy has stated in his reports to the Department of Justice when he was a Commissioner of the Gárda, with the knowledge that he has of the arms that are under the control of that body of which he is the head, you have a position created where that body can be a danger to the State. What the Executive Council has to bear in mind is this: that it is not going to permit a situation to develop in this country where there is a possibility of civil war.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the viewpoint and the outlook of these people who are parading in uniform, people who have made statements indicating their ideas as to their future policy and having, on the other hand, the other people, you have a situation where, if the matter is not taken in hand by the Executive Council, a position might arise where very serious responsibility would rest on the Executive Council for not having dealth with the situation in time.  That situation is known to the Government.  The Government is in possession of the facts.  What I do object to is that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, who could have got the information from many on his own benches as to the strength of the arms not held under permit out through the country by people who are members of the A.C.A., did not give the House that information.  I do suggest that if he paid any attention to the Department when he was there, he would have known the position with regard to the possession of arms held by ex-members of the Free State Army.  If the Deputy did not know of that, what steps did he take to secure these arms?  He knew they were held by people who did not have any permit for them.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say: &ldquo;Oh, the I.R.A. have arms and we will take them off them.&rdquo;  I challenge the Deputy to point to any single raid to get arms held by ex-members of the Free State Army.  These arms are there and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney knew that they were there.  The Deputy was well aware and the Cumann na nGaedheal Executive was well aware of the considerable amount <Col N="1586" /> of arms that disappeared out of the Templemore Barracks at the time of the mutiny.  But the Deputy never made any attempt to bring ex-Colonel Ryan to justice.  No attempt was made to do that and we had all this talk about it here.  Yet not a single attempt was made to collect these arms which he knew were under the control of the gentleman who is now one of the leaders of the National Guard in this country.  It is all very well to talk about Communism.  That is only trying to create a great scare in the country.  I saw a statement the other day by General O'Duffy that he would give the names of 150 Communists in Kilkenny.  I understand he was challenged to give these names, but he has not given them.</P>

That is all the strength the Communists can show in the City of Dublin.  Deputy <Col N="1588" /> Fitzgerald-Kenney was in office for a good while.

      <P>With the exception of the last speaker, buoyancy has been <Col N="1592" /> the note of this debate.  I am giving the last speaker as the exception.  He served the useful purpose to-night of distracting attention from the debate that was promised.  Except for his success in doing so, he might again resume the rôle he played for many years of keeping a reputation for wisdom through silence.  Deputy Norton used to be the buoyant member of the Fianna Fáil Governmental system.  It is a pity the Minister for Industry and Commerce was not in his place to hear him to-night.  He played a different rôle to-night.  He was more the heavy lump of lead that might be cast around the Minister's neck if Deputy Norton had any chance to deal with him as he desired.  He did one good thing, even if it was merely repetition&mdash;he got out again the definite facts which were given out by the colleague of the Minister who acted for him in his absence recently and which were the answer to the bombast that the Minister gave out of him to-night, or that he can give out so fluently when industry is being spoken of in this country.</P>
      <P>There were two notable events this year in relation to parliamentary procedure, and these were that on two occasions, at least, the Government ran away in two debates.  I think it is unparalleled in the history of the institution of the Dáil that the Minister, who was supposed to answer for the Department of Industry and Commerce, on a vote for that Department, should have moved that the vote be closured before he got a chance of replying in the debate, and yet that happened.  The other case of a Minister running away was that of the President.  The debate on that vote was closured after 20 hours. To-day we are given four hours for this particular debate.  After the closing stages of the Land Bill and a few additional Estimates, we are allowed this time for the President's doing&mdash;the war he brought on and the futile attempts he made recently through certain negotiators who were rebuffed and would not get a hearing.</P>

      <P>It is always opened up in such a way that it can be repudiated when it is found necessary. The Minister got a typescript put into his hands on the occasion, but I shall deal with that in a moment.  I said, already, about the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that when speaking on industrial matters he possesses a property which, when I was young, I was taught to believe was associated only with gases, and that was that gas could expand itself to fill up any space. There are just two spaces that the Minister cannot fill up in this way. One of these is Gallaher's tobacco factory and the other is the unfortunate Naas sausage factory. There is a lot more, also, that he cannot expand sufficiently to fill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton stated to-night, and he was quite right, that a good many of the figures which the Minister's colleague gave, proved to be a real test of the Minister's statements and their authority.  But Deputy Norton had not the full facts.  I quoted them before, and I shall quote them again.  The Minister gave a list of industries in the country, the imports for which he said were phenomenal at one time, but now there are none; and the Minister concluded that there has been a whirl of industrial activity in this country.  Deputy Norton asked if that is so, where is it reflected in the employment figures and where are all the new factories to be found. Why does not the Minister produce the tot of the factories, the necessary preliminary to the directory of Irish industries, which is going to be published some day, that is, if the Minister is long enough in office.  Let us take two tests.  I tried to reduce this matter to two simple tests before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 11th May the Minister for Industry and Commerce in a high flight of oratory said: &ldquo;Take the confectionery industry!  Employment in that industry has doubled; the output has <Col N="1594" /> been more than doubled; there is an equation between output and employment.&rdquo; Employment in the confectionery industry was more than doubled according to the Minister on the 11th May last.  After that he went away, apparently forgetting to leave behind him an order that no figures were to be given out during his absence.  His complaint now is that his unfortunate colleague, the Minister for Education, did give out the figures.  We find that in the 18 months from September, 1931 to March, 1933, employment in this industry had gone up by 151 people. We find that employment had increased from 5,096 to 5,247.  Yet the Minister says it doubled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say there is a bigger increase than the increase the Deputy mentions in one factory alone. The Deputy is simply playing tricks with the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the confectionery and jams as well.  But in confectionery alone the Minister said last May that employment had doubled.  That is to say that the figure of 5,096 had doubled which would mean something over 10,000.  The facts are as the Minister's colleague told us that employment at the present moment in these trades is 5,247.  I have said before, and it is a proper thing to say, that that is the ratio the Minister's statements ordinarily bear to truth. The difference between the figures 5,096 and 5,247 is 151.  But that, according to the Minister, is the double of over 5,000.  There is the test.  Take that as the test, and we find the main industries of the country blooming up.  But we soon get to the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting the figures published in the Minister's absence.  I take one other industry and it is an industry that the Minister himself <Col N="1595" /> took to-night, the apparel industry. On the 11th May here is what the Minister said about the apparel industry. &ldquo;Progress in the apparel industry has greatly advanced even beyond what was contemplated.&rdquo;  He said that they had got so far&mdash;and this is really a prize statement&mdash;Deputies, he said, can read for themselves in the newspaper that there is a dearth of skilled workers in this particular trade.  Every skilled worker, he said, in that particular trade has been employed.  This is a fairly good rotund statement.  &ldquo;Increase of production has been held up by the fact that additional skilled workers are not available and the people concerned in that industry are writing to my Department asking for sanction to bring in skilled workers from abroad.&rdquo;  Then the Minister unfortunately fell ill and in his absence his colleague, the Minister for Education, gave away the game, and we got the actual figures.  So that we see in this particular trade not the small increase of 151, but that there were actually 500 fewer employed in the trade.  That is the figure Deputy Norton quoted to-night.</P>

      <P>The Minister can repeat it as much as he likes but the figures are against him.  Here I have taken two industries which are given as tests.  In one 151 extra persons employed is to represent the figure of 5,000 doubled.  That is in the confectionery trade.  Then we are told that no skilled worker has been left unemployed in the apparel industry, whereas the figures show that close on 500 people occupied at work in our time are walking the streets to-day.  The Minister boasts about the flour trade as his greatest triumph.  Anybody can triumph in relation to tariffs if they are negligent about the price the community is going to be charged for the particular product.  It is notable that at this moment flour is costing 5/- a sack more than when foreign imports were coming in.  That is admitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no false estimation.  The test is easy.  Take any well-known brand of flour and compare the price at which it is bought at the other side.  Add the freight and that is an easy addition to make. Then take the price at which the sale is completed here and there will be found to be at least 5/&mdash;I think 6/&mdash; in the difference.  And then what do we find the Minister saying?  Already, he says, we have more than 300 extra people employed.  When there was an application before the Tariff Commission some time ago the applicants did not claim, even if they got the whole manufacture of flour for this community, that they could put into employment more than 153 people. That was their own claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that we have got 300 extra people employed.  I doubt it.  Supposing we did, there is the ordinary calculation made that as far as the white peoples are concerned the consumption of flour is one sack per head per annum.  It is costing £750,000 to put 300 people in employment. If that is victory, you can have <Col N="1597" /> it.  A tariff was discussed here in the early part of last year, a tariff on fertilisers.  Deputy Dillon made a prophecy on that occasion that if that tariff were persisted in we would find less fertilisers would be used.  The Minister for Agriculture explained to the Dáil his knowledge of the use of fertilisers in this way: On the 3rd June, 1932, he said that it was very well known that there was less manure used last year because of the fact that there was less tillage in the country. He went on to make the statement that there is more artificial manure used on tillage than on grass.  The argument was that less artificial manure was used because there was less tillage.  We have much more tillage now, we are told.  The import of fertiliser has been stopped.  Yet to-day we have the firm of Goulding complaining that their sales have dropped about 20 per cent.  Why?  Is there more tillage, according to the argument of the Minister for Agriculture? If there is more tillage and less fertiliser used, what is the explanation?  Is there less money to buy fertiliser, and is this another of the results of the tariff policy of the Minister?  The Naas sausage factory is an object of fun.</P>

There is going to be&mdash;this most fatuous suggestion was made&mdash;a subsidiary industry of tanning attached to the sausage factory.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce took a day off to sample the products of the factory and the factory burst.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not the slightest doubt about it, if the thing had not burst so spectacularly we would be hearing a good lot about it when the Minister gets into his crossroads <Col N="1598" /> style.  This is a factory which, according to the Minister, had hoped to have an export trade with France, Belgium and Switzerland.  It is very different saying that subsidiary industries were hoped for from saying that they are there.  It is quite possible to reconcile what the Minister said to-night with what Deputy Norton said, and what I am now repeating, that you can close down on the import of certain products, or show a decrease in the value of those imports, and yet you may not have given employment at home, because if there is no purchasing power you cannot do so. Without purchasing power you cannot dispose of what is produced at home. There is clearly not the employment which the Minister pretended to believe there was, or evidence would not have been there, ready to the hand of his colleague when the Minister was absent, so that his colleague did give information to the Dáil to show just how hollow are the pretences which the Minister has made about industrial development.  I take the confectionery and apparel trades as tests.  The Minister is good at crossroads talk.  The Minister is good in this House when he can keep crying out figures, but the Minister cannot argue&mdash;brazen as he is&mdash;and pretend there is industrial development in this country when the figures that his own Department supplies give him the lie.</P>

    <P>There are many things that might be spoken of on an adjournment debate; the scandalous looting of the taxpayers' money for the paper which supports the President, the balance sheet of which showed that it was on its last legs; the illegalities worked by the Minister for Finance upon the Civil Service, illegalities which were, to a certain extent, exposed to-day; or this new Guard.  The stocktaking of revolvers was one fatuous excuse which the Minister for Justice thought fit to amend to-night.  It is a good thing the Minister now recognises that the test of a revolutionary is whether a man says he will give up his gun or not. That is the test of a revolutionary. The Minister recognises that a revolutionary force might become formidable if armed, and their arms should be <Col N="1599" /> taken from them.  That is also an advance.  The present Minister for Justice might have turned to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who before he was sacked by the I.R.A. was Minister for Defence in that squad, and ask him: &ldquo;Where are the dumped arms?&rdquo;  Or he might turn to the President who gave the dumping order, and say: &ldquo;You know where they are.&rdquo;  We have it now that the test of a revolutionary is whether or not a man will give up his gun, and we know the danger of a revolutionary in respect of the State institutions. Are you getting the guns that you yourself have knowledge of?  Are you going to produce in this House the police reports about I.R.A. guns?  Are you going to confine yourselves only to the foolish sort of reports read out here to-night?</P>

      <P>Exactly; we have had a good havest, but there is no place to sell our produce.  There is no alternative market.  We are told that we started the war, which any fool can do. If they do not stop this war the country will stop it, and it is not the soft talk of the Minister for Justice that will end the frightful demoralisation that has set in amongst all the people whom we left to him as a disciplined body.  Frightful demoralisation has set in amongst that body, and there is not a doubt about it, and no Deputy here can fail to realise and to see in his own constituency that that is the situation which we have to face, notwithstanding all the stoppage of imports about which the Minister for Industry and Commerce boasted to-night.  It is not because we have industries here, but because there is no purchasing power, and because there is no way to sell the goods which Providence has provided for us.  There is no way of selling our produce, and if any peace is to be made now it will be got on worse terms than were offered last Christmas or the terms that were offered to the President three weeks ago.</P>

      <P>It does not seem to be much use to give time when you have Deputies like Deputy McGilligan getting up and repeating and insinuating charges and statements which have been challenged a thousand times.  Never once has the Deputy put anything forward to substantiate his <Col N="1608" /> statements and charges.  We had Ottawa trotted out on several occasions and never once has anything been said to substantiate anything that was supposed to have happened in Ottawa. Again, we have some mysterious hints from Deputy McGilligan as to our supposed negotiations with Great Britain. As far as our relations with Great Britain are concerned, the public know everything with regard to any moves that either Government has made.</P>
      <P>Of course, we cannot prevent officious people from interfering.  Every person outside the Government, of course, is full of suggestions as to how this thing could be brought to an end.  The Deputies on the opposite benches, who pretend to be so anxious to bring it to an end, have been since we came into office doing everything in their power to prevent it being brought to an end because one sure way of preventing it being brought to an end is to induce people across the water to think that we will be beaten in this fight, that our people are weakening and are in a state of misery here.</P>

      <P>Talk of exposing our weaknesses!  Heavens, if we had them they would have been exposed long ago, and the fact that we are still as we are is good proof that in this particular matter, we are sound and solid in this country.  This terrible winter that we are going to be faced with is held up before us.  The same terrible winter was held up before us last year and yet it was after that supposed terrible winter, that we went before the people, put our programme before them and said: &ldquo;You have had a year's experience of us; do you want our programme or do you want the programme that Deputy Cosgrave holds out to you&rdquo;, and what was the people's answer?  Were it not for proportional representation, there would not be half a dozen of you on the benches opposite.  Of course Deputy Cosgrave could settle this war.  He told you before that he could do it in <Col N="1609" /> three days.  What happened when he was in office and when he sent over to the other side a piteous message asking for a moratorium of a quarter of a million pounds?  He was given the answer he deserved to get.  He is the man who is going to settle this thing, the man who paid out £50,000,000 during the time he was in office&mdash;and if you multiply that by 66 you will understand what would be the equivalent for England.  They ask us suddenly to try and remedy a situation that they created, a situation which they had done nothing to prevent coming about.  If speeches of mine made when I sat on the benches opposite are looked up in the Official Debates it will be seen that I begged the Government at that time to try and look ahead, to see that steps were taken to meet the situation that it was clear was going to face our farming community.  I asked them to see that proper measures were taken in time but they did nothing.  Listening to Deputy MacDermot's speech one would imagine that he had never read a bit of Irish History.  The Deputy told us about the wonderful things that would have happened if this new policy of ours had not come in.  What were the wonderful effects of the policy the Deputy advocates in the past century? One of them at least was to cut down our population by half, from 8,000,000 to 4,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy of course to sit on the benches opposite and say: &ldquo;If only we were there we would have done so and so.  We would have put into operation this wonderful policy of free trade that left us in the past dependant on the English market,&rdquo; a policy that brought us to such a state of wonderful prosperity that we are the only white people in the world whose population has been cut down by half.  The people of Ireland came to the conclusion, every single nationalist in the past, the people with the true spirit of Ireland came to the conclusion that we came to, the conclusion that the people came to when they started Sinn Fein and reverted to once more when they put Fianna Fáil into office: that if there is to be any hope of prosperity for this country <Col N="1610" /> it is by reversing that policy which made us simply the kitchen garden for supplying the British with cheap food.</P>

He said that they could get good meat at 2d. per lb., and that meat that he would be glad to eat himself was being sold to soapmakers at 1d. per lb.  That is the situation in England itself and that is a situation that no person here can remedy.  So far as I can see the British market is gone for ever.  The position to-day, so far as that market is concerned, would be the very same if the people opposite were sitting in our places, with this difference, that we are keeping at home the £5,000,000 which belongs to us but the people opposite would have continued to pay out that sum and still be in the same position.</P>

It would be just about as reasonable to blame us for some of the things that, as a Government, we have been blamed for to-night as it would be to give us credit for the good weather we are having.  The fact is that this country of ours, like other countries in the world, had to face a difficult economic situation.  Denmark used to be held out as a model, as something to be followed.
