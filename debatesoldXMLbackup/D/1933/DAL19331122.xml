      <P>asked the President if control of the sluice gates at Beleek has, with the approval of the Government, been handed over for a period to a local authority in the Six-County area; if so, for what period is this outside control to continue, on what conditions has it been approved; what is the purpose of this experiment; if the property in question falls within the scope of Article 11 of the Constitution, and if it is now being controlled and administered by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the Drainage Board which controls Lough Erne drainage has obtained the services of an engineer, nominated by the Northern Ireland Government, to operate the sluice gates in question for an experimental period, which, I understand, is not to exceed two years.  I have no information as to the conditions under which this arrangement was arrived at.  The Drainage Board, which is a body created under the Drainage and Improvement of Lands (Ireland) Act, 1863, and consists of nine representatives from Fermanagh and two from Cavan, is the authority charged with taking steps necessary to maintain the drainage works in a state of efficiency.  The Government cannot interfere unless the Commissioners of Public Works are satisfied that the Drainage Board have failed to carry out their statutory duty of maintenance. The sluice gates are the property of the Drainage Board, and do not fall within the scope of Article 11 of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>To ask the President if the Executive Council were made aware of the information, on which were based the false charges made against Deputy Mulcahy in the Dáil on 28th September last, and of the use which the President proposed to make of it; on what date the Executive Council were so advised; or if this matter was not discussed with the Executive Council, why was it withheld from them.</P>
      <P>To ask the President if the information received by him regarding the alleged meeting between Deputy Mulcahy and the British War Minister was communicated to the Attorney-General to secure his opinion in all the reported circumstances upon the credibility of the informant, the value of his information, and the advisability of making any ordinary or privileged use of the report; if so, did the Attorney-General recommend for or against its use with or without condition as to investigation, corroboration, or the personal attendance of the informant for examination on the matters alleged; if not, why was the information withheld from the Attorney-General.</P>
      <P>To ask the President if he sought from the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána any information as to the character and antecedents of the person who supplied the President with the falsehood about the Glasgow meeting between Deputy Mulcahy and the British War Minister; and, if so, what was the result.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether his attention has been drawn to the report which appeared in the Press of the 14th instant of proceedings in the Supreme Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland in which, is a result of the observations made by the learned Judge, a power of attorney stamped in the Irish Free State with the appropriate stamp under the Stamp Act of 1891 was to be re-stamped in Northern Ireland, and whether the Minister will state for the information of legal practitioners and the public generally what the present position is as between the Irish Free State and Great Britain or Northern Ireland with regard to instruments which are chargeable with Stamp Duty both in the Irish Free State and in Great Britain or Northern Ireland and on which the appropriate Stamp Duty has been paid in the Irish Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The President) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report in the Press of the 14th instant to which the Deputy's question refers.  The position as between the Irish Free State, on the one hand, and Great Britain or Northern Ireland, on the other, was settled by the provisional arrangement for relief in respect of double taxation made between the Government of the Irish Free State and the British Government in the year 1923.  The provisional arrangement was confirmed in the Irish Free State by an Order of the Governor-General made on the 14th April, 1923, under the Double Taxation (Relief) Act, 1923, and in Great Britain and Northern Ireland by an Order in Council dated 29th March, 1923 (S.R.O. 1923. No. 406).  Part III of the arrangement relates to stamp duty.  The effect of the provisions of that part of the arrangement is clear.  Where, on or after the 1st April, 1923, an instrument <Col N="340" /> is chargeable with stamp duty in the Irish Free State and in Great Britain and has been stamped in one of those countries the instrument shall, to the extent of the duty it bears, be deemed to be stamped in the other country. By paragraph (c) of Part III the arrangement applies as between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland in like manner as it applies between the Irish Free State and Great Britain until the Government of Northern Ireland signify that they have withdrawn their consent to such application. The Government of Northern Ireland have not withdrawn their consent.</P>
      <P>With regard to the observations which the newspaper report attributes to the learned judge on the occasion referred to, to the effect that he did not understand the language on the stamp which appeared on the power of attorney in question, I should like to add that specimens of all Irish Free State stamps are available in the Ministry of Finance of Northern Ireland, and that any doubt as to whether the power of attorney in the case was not duly stamped in the Irish Free State could have been removed by reference to that Ministry.</P>

      <P>A payment under Section 7 of the Local Government Act, 1933, in respect of absence from duty during the period <Col N="341" /> from the 1st July, 1922, to the 30th April, 1923, was sanctioned on the 27th September last to Dr. Seán Tubridy, formerly Dispensary Medical Officer and Medical Officer of Health, Lettermore, County Galway.  Dr. Tubridy at present holds similar positions in the Oranmore District at a salary of £300 per annum as Dispensary Medical Officer and £15 per annum as Medical Officer of Health. The payments appropriate to the period amount to £203 6s. 8d. as Dispensary Officer and £16 13s. 4d. as Medical Officer of Health.  These payments cover the maximum period of absence provided for in Section 7 of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his Department has recently refused sanction to the acquisition by agreement of certain sites for labourers' cottages by the Roscommon Board of Health and, if so, whether he will state the reason for such refusal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  The Roscommon Board of Health and Public Assistance put forward a scheme for the acquisition of land for the building of 57 labourers' cottages.  The prices proposed to be paid for the land, which were in some cases as high as £150 and £180 per acre, were considered excessive and the Board were informed that on this account their proposals could not be sanctioned and they were advised that if suitable sites could not be obtained by agreement at more reasonable prices resort should be had to the compulsory powers conferred on local authorities by the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.  At their meeting on the 4th instant the Board decided to take steps at once for the making of Compulsory Purchase Orders for the acquisition of the land required for their scheme of 100 cottages.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his statement (a) to the Dáil on the 11th May last, to the effect that one factory had come into operation capable of supplying 25 per cent. of our requirements in men's felt hats, and that two other factories were to be built during the current year; and (b) his statement to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on the 24th October last, to the effect that not one had yet gone into the manufacture of men's felt hats, were intended to refer to the same kind of felt hats for men; and if he will state how many persons, if any, are employed in the manufacture of men's felt hats of any kind and what is the average monthly output of such hats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 11th May last, the date of the statement referred to by the Deputy, there had been established in the Saorstát one factory for <Col N="346" /> the manufacture of men's felt hats. Since that date a second factory has been established, which has only entered upon production and has not yet completed the installation of its full plant.  The plans of these two firms should result in the production within a reasonable period of the bulk of the requirements of the Saorstát in respect of men's fur felt hats.  Wool felt hats, however, are not being manufactured in the Saorstát at the moment to any appreciable extent.  Certain proposals have, however, been submitted to me having for their object the manufacture of wool hats and are receiving consideration.  There are at present approximately 30 persons employed in the manufacture of felt hats in the Saorstát.  It is not possible to state the average monthly output of such hats.</P>

      <P>The steps taken to ensure that the fair wages clause in contracts entered into by the Office of Public Works is observed are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  An undertaking to observe this clause is required from persons or firms as a condition of inclusion on the Board's list of contractors.</P>
      <P>(b)  The clause is embodied in the form of tender, which all contractors are required to sign.</P>
      <P>(c)  Each contractor is bound by the terms of his contract to exhibit a copy of the clause on the premises where the work is being executed.</P>
      <P>(d)  Any complaint of infringement is enquired into by the Board's Officers, who are empowered to inspect all relevant books and documents, and the Fair Wages Advisory Committee is consulted.</P>
      <P>(e)  If an infringement has taken place the Board take the necessary steps to compel compliance by the contractor.  They reserve to themselves in the contract the power of cancellation in the event of non-compliance.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, the responsibility for the employment of workmen rests in the first instance with the contractor, but the specifications provide that work must be executed in a substantial and workmanlike manner, and all works are inspected during progress and on completion to ensure that the quality of the work is in accordance with the specification.

We received no complaint during the progress of the work that proper wages were not paid.  If the names of those who are alleged not to have been proper tradesmen or to have been paid trade union rates are furnished to us we will take the matter up with the contractor.

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last sitting of this House, sir, on the 16th November, the President made some statements which I regard as reflecting on my personal honour, and with regard to which you have given me leave to make a statement to-day.  I refer to column 335, Vol. 50, No. 1 of the Official Debates.  Deputy McGilligan had raised a question on the Adjournment arising out of a speech made by the President at Dundalk.  In reply to Deputy McGilligan's speech the President made the following remarks:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I spoke of this campaign, <Col N="363" /> this alleged campaign against the payment of rates</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I spoke of the activities of the people who were engaged in it as evidenced in various ways, just as I would speak of any other general campaign of crime or criminal activity which I thought it was in the public interest to advert to and to call public attention to.  I believe that my calling attention to it had one good result anyhow.  The gentlemen on the opposite side who were giving assistance to that campaign have been much more careful of doing it since.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Deputy: Name!</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The President: There were on the opposite side people who, on more than one occasion, gave help to that campaign.  We had here in the Dáil a speech by the former leader of that particular Party with so many `ifs' in it&mdash;`if a person is not able to pay then he will not pay.&lsquo;  Who is going to judge whether he is able to pay or not?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. MacDermot: Will the President please quote from the speeches?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The President: I am referring to the speech which the Deputy made but I have not got the quotation. Everyone remembers it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the particular speech to which the President was there referring was obviously one that he had referred to on a former occasion in somewhat similar terms, and it was a speech made here in the Dáil not before his Dundalk speech, but a month after his Dundalk speech.  It was a speech made on the particular point of showing that whatever activities farmers might have indulged in with reference to rates were of considerable less importance from the point of view of law and order than the matters of intimidation which we had been raising in that debate on the adjournment.  I am, therefore, not concerned with the President's allusions to that speech because that speech was made, as I say, a month after his Dundalk speech. What I am concerned with is his renewed implication that I was connected with a campaign of a criminal <Col N="364" /> character before his Dundalk speech. I have explicitly denied that several times, and I hope that my denial to-day is going to close the matter.</P>
    <P>In point of fact, extending over the period ever since the economic war began, I have had, if I may use the expression, to take my political life in my hands on numerous occasions on this particular matter.  It is no secret that a great many of the farming community were attracted to the idea of not paying these obligations on account of what was happening to them, and I had to take a very strong and a very definite line about the matter with my supporters, and I did that over and over again.  I resisted any such campaign and I defeated any such campaign being sponsored by our Party. I want to state that quite definitely, and if the President is still in any doubt about my line of action, my line of policy, and my line of speech on that matter, I am perfectly prepared to submit, and would welcome the opportunity of submitting, my conduct in that respect to a Parliamentary inquiry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The President) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann approves of the recommendations contained in the Report of the Imperial Committee on Economic Consultation and Co-operation, 1933, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 22nd November, 1933, and recommends the Executive Council to take such steps as they think fit to give effect thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee, as will be seen from paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Report, owes its origin to a resolution of the Imperial Economic Conference, held at Ottawa in July and August of last year.  The Committee was directed by the Conference to examine the functions, organisation and financial bases of the existing agencies within the Commonwealth for economic consultation and co-operation, and to consider what alterations or modifications were desirable.  Those who have read the Report of the Ottawa Conference will remember that during the discussions which led to the appointment of this Committee, the representatives of South Africa and the Saorstát made it clear that their Governments would not accept the principle of the establishment of an Imperial Economic <Col N="366" /> Secretariat or of any similar organ of centralisation.  The statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be found in paragraph 4 of the Report under consideration.  If Deputies will read the section of the Report entitled &ldquo;Principles Underlying Co-operation,&rdquo; beginning on page 73, they will see that the co-operation contemplated brings it into harmony with the principles on which international bodies are organised, for example: &ldquo;The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea,&rdquo;&ldquo;International Office of Public Health,&rdquo;&ldquo;The International Veterinary Bureau.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The task of the committee was broadly the following:</P>
    <P>(1)  a readjustment of the functions of the existing agencies for economic consultation so as to provide for that portion of the work of the Empire Marketing Board which it is decided to continue on a co-operative basis (The Empire Marketing Board was disestablished at the end of September).</P>
    <P>(2)  a weeding-out of those agencies which have proved to be of no practical benefit to the Commonwealth as a whole:</P>
    <P>(3)  the reorganisation of the remaining agencies so as to ensure the complete constitutional equality &mdash;in both administrative and financial control&mdash;of the participating Governments.</P>
    <P>Prior to the 1st October, 1933, the Saorstát participated in the activities of the following bodies: (1) The Imperial Agricultural Bureau; (2) The Imperial Institute of Entomology; (3) The Imperial Mycological Institute; (4) The Empire Marketing Board; (5) The Imperial Economic Committee; (6) The Imperial Shipping Committee; (7) The Imperial Communications Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>The Saorstát Government paid annual contributions amounting to a total of £825 to the scientific information bureaux&mdash;that is, the Imperial Agricultural Bureau, the Imperial Institute of Entomology and the Imperial Mycological Institute.  The <Col N="367" /> services and publications of these bodies have been of great benefit to the Department of Agriculture and to research workers generally in the Saorstát, and it is proposed to continue these subscriptions.</P>
    <P>Under the new scheme proposed by the Committee, certain economic services hitherto performed by the Empire Marketing Board, are to be undertaken by the Imperial Economic Committee.  This Committee, which investigates and reports on the marketing of Commonwealth commodities, was financed up to the end of September by the Empire Marketing Board.  The Board had been financed by the British Government, the sum placed at its disposal being intended to represent the money equivalent of the advantages which would have been conferred on the other States of the Commonwealth by the preferential duties on certain articles of food agreed upon at the Imperial Conference of 1923 and which, owing to a change of Government in Great Britain, were not subsequently granted. In view of recent changes in their fiscal policy, the British Government felt themselves released from the obligation to continue the financing of the Board.  The Imperial Economic Committee will now have to rely upon direct contributions from the States of the Commonwealth.  Our contribution will be £808 per annum.</P>
    <P>The Imperial Shipping Committee was also financed by the British Government.  Under the new system it will be financed by all the Governments of the Commonwealth.  The Saorstát's share is £80 per annum. The expenses of the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee are defrayed by a grant from Imperial and International Communications, Ltd. The Saorstát representative receives for his services an annual fee of £500 which is credited to the Irish Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There remained the question of scientific investigation.  A certain portion of the Empire Marketing Board Fund was devoted to the promotion of agricultural reseach by means of grants to research organisations <Col N="368" /> in the various States of the Commonwealth.  In view of the disbandment of the Board the Committee has to consider the method by which research projects of general interest to the Commonwealth should, in future, be conducted.  They recommend the holding of periodical conferences of research specialists throughout the Commonwealth for the purpose of framing, for submission to their respective Governments, programmes of research schemes considered suitable for co-operative financing.  The cost of these schemes is to be met by subscriptions from such Governments as may decide to participate.  As some time will probably elapse before the first conference is summoned, it is recommended that the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureau should be invited to consider immediately and submit a report on the question of what research activities should, in future, be conducted on a co-operative basis. The Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureau will be entrusted with the supervision of any research activities which, by agreement, will take place in the United Kingdom. These additional activities on the part of the Executive Council of the Agricultural Bureau call for an increased contribution&mdash;so far as the Saorstát is concerned&mdash;of £72 per annum.</P>
    <P>The total additional contribution required from the Saorstát Government is £960 per annum.  The Governments of the Commonwealth are asked to provide the contributions on the new basis for a period of three years as from the 1st October, 1933.</P>
    <P>The Report lays down the following principles in regard to the organisation of agencies for inter-commonwealth economic consultation and co-operation:</P>
    <P>(a)  The complete constitutional equality of the participating governments should be recognised in the method of appointment to, and composition and organisation of, each agency.</P>
    <P>(b)  The managing bodies should in no way be subject to financial control by the Finance Department of <Col N="369" /> any one Government of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the Committee has not confined itself to laying down these general principles.  It has pointed out the defects in the organisation of each particular agency and the modifications necessary in each case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Holding the views I do, I have no objection, naturally, to this motion; but I cannot forbear from pointing out that it is a motion which is very difficult to reconcile with the general policy of the Government. There are a large number of the more feeble-minded citizens of this country, including, apparently, even one High Court Judge, who have been persuaded that we are at present engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the British Commonwealth, provoked by the brutal aggression of Great Britain.  Nevertheless, here we are faced by the Government with a proposal for Imperial co-operation.  I have not heard previously in this House a speech in which the word &ldquo;Imperial&rdquo; came in so often as it did in the speech to which we have just listened, nor have I heard previously in this House a speech which had, in general, such an imperialist tendency.  I am glad to find that the President, apparently, accepts, without demur, one of the principles laid down in these recommendations and this Report, and that there is recognition of the complete constitutional equality of all the participating Governments in the Commonwealth. But it really is a little startling and confusing to find that we are invited, after recent public utterances and in view of the general trend of Government policy, to make contribution to a work of inter-imperial co-operation such as this Report is concerned with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, perhaps, noteworthy that one of the recommendations of the Report, which the President of the Executive Council is asking us to accept, states not only that adequate financial provision shall be forthcoming, but that it shall be forthcoming in such a manner that there is a reasonable certainty <Col N="370" /> of income over a definite period of years.  I take it, therefore, that the Government is committed to the view that this contribution of £960 by the Irish Free State is something that we are undertaking to continue paying for a number of years ahead.  Now, as I say, I welcome work of this kind.  As the President has pointed out, it has got a real practical value; but I ask the President and other members of the Government once again to reflect, from the point of view of public order and the maintenance of law, upon the impossible position that they have created and the confusing effect that all this must have on the minds of the young people who, in one breath, are told that we are in the middle of a life-and-death struggle with the British Commonwealth and yet are asked to join in inter-imperial co-operation of this kind.  It is not to be hoped for that any amount of firm administration will maintain law and order if the younger citizens of the country are left in such mental chaos as to the constitutional status of this House and of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the motion is put, I should like to make a few remarks on the speech we have just heard.  A few minutes ago we had a personal explanation.  The last person in the world, of course, to create any trouble would be Deputy MacDermot. He does not want to create any trouble of any sort&mdash;nothing like it. He does not want to get any political advantage out of anything he has to say.  He is willing to stand up and be unpopular with his own supporters, we are told.  I have listened to many a speech in this House and there were few speeches, to which I have listened, so calculated to do harm and to misrepresent as the speech to which we have just listened.  Everybody in the country knows full well what the policy of this Government is.  It was put definitely to them at the last election.  They got certain guarantees as to the line of action we would adopt and we have held strictly to those guarantees.  There was nobody in the country who did not know that as long as we were forced&mdash;and I use <Col N="371" /> the word &ldquo;forced&rdquo; deliberately as I believe we were forced by threats held out in 1921&mdash;that as long as the threats were there, and until we went definitely to the people and told the people to defy these threats&mdash;as we did on a former occasion&mdash;the position we inherited would be availed of to the fullest extent to secure for the people whatever advantages were in this forced connection.  We were taunted by the British Minister with wishing to have it both ways the other day.  Now evidently Deputy MacDermot would like that the British should have it both ways&mdash;that we should be forced into a certain position and denied whatever advantages might be in that position.  Is that the attitude of Deputy MacDermot and members on the opposite benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  Then what is the inconsistency in our administration continuing to co-operate on terms that we would be prepared to co-operate on if we were completely and absolutely free?  I can imagine the Government of a Republic for the whole of this country coming in here and, if there was a group of nations prepared to co-operate with them for scientific research or other international purposes, proposing that we should take part in such co-operation. Now what our Government is doing is insisting that where there is co-operation it shall be co-operation on a basis of equality.  And if Deputy MacDermot cared to be a little bit more careful of his terms a good deal of the confusion which he tries to create would not be created.  He uses the word &ldquo;Imperial,&rdquo; which has been mentioned several times in this statement.  Remember that a number of these institutions, to which the present Report refers, had their origin long before the Treaty and, though the original names have persisted, their character is completely and absolutely changed.  The co-operation suggested here is a free co-operation which at any time our Government can withdraw from and will withdraw whenever it does not suit its purpose (Hear, hear).  Now I ask a question. <Col N="372" /> I have heard several cries of &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; from the opposite side, but I have not heard any &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; from Mr. Thomas.  We are very anxious to get a statement from Mr. Thomas. Deputy MacDermot and others go round the country suggesting a certain position.  We are anxious to get confirmation of that suggestion, but we have not got it yet.  Our people are entitled to know what the position exactly is.  As regards this particular motion we are simply fulfilling our contract to the people.  We are using the position we found and inherited in order to get for our people whatever advantages there may be, and we do not wish to let the British Government have it both ways, as Deputy MacDermot would desire.  It is our duty.  There is nothing inconsistent about it.  There is nothing Imperialistic in this tendency.  The tendency is to get co-operation between nations, on a footing of equality, in matters of common concern in which it is their interest to co-operate, each nation retaining its freedom.  That is the position, and in that sense I recommend this motion to the House.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>If I might say one word further.  There was a remark made by the Deputy to which I would like to refer.  He said that we had stated that there was a life-and-death struggle with the Commonwealth&mdash;i.e., with Australia, Canada and other countries.  There is nothing of the kind.  There is a struggle between Great Britain and ourselves on certain issues, but that struggle, as far as we are concerned, does not extend to Australia, South Africa or the other countries with which we have agreements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that last season strong wheat was successfully grown with a yield equal to the most prolific soft wheat grown in this country.  In these circumstances I would like to know if the Minister proposes to give a sort of preference in his scheme to meet the need of strong wheat.  We have produced strong wheat in this country that will meet the requirements of the country, and will have the effect of strengthening the market that exists.  So far as soft wheats are concerned we were always able to complete our requirements, but in strong wheat we always failed, and we will continue to fail if the Minister does not offer some inducement for the growing of strong wheat.  Whether in the form of subsidies or bounties the Minister should offer a special preference if he wants to capture the growers of strong wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no distinction made in the scheme between strong and weak wheats.  The same subsidy will be given in both cases.  The Deputy is quite wrong in saying that the market requires strong wheat.  Our flour goes two-thirds for household and one-third for bakers.  Up to two-thirds comes from soft wheat, and 40 per cent. of the flour that goes to bakers is from strong wheat.  We want 13 parts weak wheat to two parts strong wheat.  We want 650,000 acres of weak wheat before we touch strong wheat at all.  There is a small proportion of strong wheat growing, and if we preserve the same proportion our total requirements in strong wheat would be supplied.</P>

The second question which I should like to ask, arising out of what the Minister has said, is whether he is in a position to inform the House now or hereafter what the average increase in the price of bakers' and household flour has been in the Saorstát since the Cereals Act came into force, and how much higher the price in the Saorstát for those two classes of flour has been, on the average, as compared with Great <Col N="375" /> Britain or Northern Ireland?  I readily appreciate that those figures would not be at the Minister's hand at the moment, but I think it would be of interest and of value that that question should be opened and examined on the Report Stage of the Bill for the purposes of which this Financial Resolution is moved.</P>

      <P>I want to clearly understand the Minister's answer to my query.  I understood him to say that in the coming season he did not intend to give any more encouragement to the growing of hard wheats than to the growing of soft wheats.  Is that the policy of the Minister?  I agree with the Ceann Comhairle's ruling that this is not the time to discuss the wheat policy.  I have only to say, as regards the other statements of the Minister, that I do not agree with them, and do not think they square with the facts of the situation, but as this is not the time to debate them I do not want to say any more.  I only want to be clear on the answer of the Minister, and my interpretation of his answer is that he is going to give some measure of encouragement to the growing of wheat in the coming season, but he does not propose to give any greater encouragement to the growing of hard wheats than to the growing of soft wheats.  If that is the Minister's reply I am finished.</P>

      <P>A Chinn-Comhairle, I want to ask the Minister a question, with your permission.  I should like to know from him whether he would allow imported seed wheat into the country free of duty.  In my own experience of the growing of wheat for a number of years I found that a better and more productive crop could be derived by the sowing of foreign wheat.  That is the reason I am anxious to know whether, in the coming season, the Minister would see his way to allow the importation of seed wheat free of duty.  I think it would be a great benefit to the farmers of the country.</P>

European wheat, as a class, is the same as the Pacific and other wheats that come from America, the Argentine, Australia and other places&mdash;all those soft wheats that come in for household flour.  As far as we are concerned it does not matter whether it comes from Europe or those other places.  Four per cent. was fixed because, in our opinion, it was as high a percentage as would absorb the wheat of the country this year. If the acreage is doubled next year we will make it 8 per cent.  The percentage is fixed in reference to the wheat we have on hands.  It has no <Col N="377" /> reference whatever to the imported wheat from any particular country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands it requires that the sale of wheat seed shall be in the prescribed form.  I think it advisable to have the words &ldquo;prescribed form&rdquo; removed.  The amendment is necessary because of our experience in issuing licences under the principal Act, when it is often desirable to issue a different form of licence.  We can scarcely foresee different cases arising, but there will be exceptional cases, and we would have to prescribe different forms.  I may say that this does not make any difference in the powers of the Minister.  Prescribing gives a considerable lot of trouble.  The regulations can be changed from time to time as circumstances demand, but it is difficult to deal with exceptional cases.  I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there are six paragraphs laying <Col N="380" /> down the conditions for licences, so that we may claim this is already prescribed, without going any further.</P>

This Horse Breeding Bill proposes to bring within its scope thoroughbred horses in racing stables.

I discussed the matter with the Minister, and I must say that he met the position very fairly.  But I do not observe any amendments down in the Minister's name.  The Minister, I think, is quite anxious to meet any difficulties which may arise, but I would like if he would say something on the matter, or perhaps, at a later stage introduce an amendment covering the position I indicated.

      <P>This section deals with definitions, and it appears to me that where there is reference to stallions in this Bill there should be some definition of the word &ldquo;stallion.&rdquo;  I do not think the amendment needs any justification, beyond saying that it appears to be necessary to have some definition of the word.</P>

      <P>If that amendment were accepted we would be back exactly at the stage we were at under the previous Act.  That is really the big difficulty, and why this Bill brings in owners of stallions who claim that they were not keeping them for stud purposes, but for working on their farms, and so on, although it was fairly well known to our inspectors, and to the Civic Guards, that they were being used illegally, although we could not prove it.

      <P>I would have liked if this amendment came after the amendment in connection with Section 4.  Certain stallions come under the definition of colts, but there is a distinction between a colt and a stallion.  Horses that were raced, but never used as stallions, are defined as colts.  Racing colts would come under the operation of the Bill unless there is an amendment excluding them, and it was partly with that intention I put down the amendment.  I should have liked this amendment to come after the amendment on which the main argument on this Bill will arise.  I am sure that the Minister intends to meet us, at least, helpfully in that regard, and if the Minister will allow me to postpone this amendment until the next stage of the Bill I think it would be the best course.</P>

      <P>This Act applies to &ldquo;every stallion which is for the time being of or over the prescribed age.&rdquo; There is the difficulty I see in connection with this Bill.  I think the Minister said here on another stage of this Bill that he intended this Bill to deal with stallions which were more or less outside the control of his Department. That is what I take to be the real purpose of the Bill.  The portion of the section I have read, as it stands, can apply to a two-year-old, and Deputy Norton will tell you that it is unreasonable to expect people who have two-year-old colts to be applying to the Minister's Department for permits to keep them.  I think it is ridiculous to put such a thing as that into the Bill.  The Minister may think that there is no trouble in applying for a permit, which will be granted, but <Col N="384" /> at the same time he does not intend to use it, and why put it into legislation if that is so?  According to the Minister's statement, the Bill is intended to get after stallions which have been refused permits.  Could the Minister not put words into the Bill to achieve that, and leave colts intended solely for racing alone.  I will admit that I cannot understand Section 3 of the Bill.  I do not know what the phrase &ldquo;of or over the prescribed age&rdquo; means.  I know that a stallion can be a stallion at two years of age, three years of age, 23 years of age, and any age.  That is my difficulty.  I should like the Minister to be a little more explicit in regard to the sections of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> The amendment should apply to sub-section (2) of Section 4.  My object was to reduce the fine and, perhaps, the Minister would accept the reduced fine that I suggest.  I would appeal to the Minister to accept a smaller amount than the £5 set out in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not consider this amendment at all as put forward by the Deputy now.  I considered it as it appeared as an amendment to Section 5.  It appears to me that to suggest a reduction of the maximum penalty is rather unreasonable because the Deputy is very well aware that maximum penalties are very seldom inflicted by district justices in cases like this.  Such penalties would be inflicted only in cases in which there was gross disregard for the law.  We might have cases in which there would be considerable difficulty in getting them brought to court at all and in which a considerable amount of evasion and contravention of the Act had taken place before the person was caught and where this had been done knowingly I think that the maximum penalty of £5 is not too severe.  The Deputy knows that under the Livestock Breeding Act we bring cases before the court in respect of unlicensed bulls and the maximum penalty is very seldom inflicted.  I do not think I have known of any case of a maximum penalty being inflicted since I became Minister for Agriculture. The maximum penalty does not seem to be excessive.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendment is to ensure that the person who examines a stallion shall be a qualified veterinary surgeon or shall be accompanied by a qualified veterinary surgeon.  One does not know if it is the Minister's intention that the inspector is to be a man qualified as a vet.  I have put down the amendment in order to get a declaration from him on that subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I mentioned before that in the inspection of stallions there are two aspects of the case taken into consideration.  One is whether the animal is unsound.  In a case where an animal is examined for a defect such as spavin, curb or so on, he would be examined at all times by a veterinary inspector, but for deformity or for appearance a lay inspector might suffice in some cases.  The big majority of inspections will be carried out by the Department's inspectors but in certain cases lay inspectors are quite as good or even better than veterinary surgeons.  We should be permitted in such cases to use lay inspectors.  I am sure that no Deputy will say that veterinary surgeons have all the knowledge necessary to judge a horse and that Deputies will admit that a lay inspector is quite competent to say whether a horse is a good-looking horse or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Minister that in regard to the examination of ordinary horses a lay inspector might be useful but there are other cases in which a veterinary surgeon would probably be needed.  The arguments, however, which some of us are putting forward against this Bill <Col N="389" /> will not be pressed as strongly as they otherwise might in view of the Minister's undertaking to exclude certain horses from the operation of the Bill. I for one recognise that the Minister in trying to improve the breeding of a certain class of horses is doing very much needed work, particularly in regard to horses subsidised either by the State or the local authorities.  The Ministry has a perfect right to insist on a certain standard in the breeding of those horses.  I do not think the House could object to that attitude of the Minister.  The Minister having practically undertaken to exclude thoroughbred stallions from the operation of the Bill I do not think I can press the amendment.  If the Minister exempts thoroughbred stallions from the Bill, as I think he intends, then a lot of our difficulties will have disappeared.</P>

I should like to see an amendment, if the other did not cover it, to exempt thoroughbred stallions in recognised stud books.  That would obviously exempt a two year old colt.  It appears to me that it would obviously exempt him, and that any amendment to exempt him would be superfluous.  If the Minister accepts the purport of the amendment excluding from the Bill horses in recognised stud books used for mating mares who are also recognised by these stud books, a two year old racing colt would be exempt.</P>

If we had a legal debate on that term I think that no <Col N="392" /> lawyer, and certainly no layman, would be able to argue a distinction between a colt and a stallion.

      <P>The whole trouble is that we think it is ridiculous to have two year old or three year old or even four year old racehorses, who are in the strict sense stallions, coming within the scope of the Bill.  Although in the strict sense they might be classed as stallions, they are not really stallions until they are put to the stud.  We want to keep racing colts out of this Bill altogether, and not to have their owners or anybody else put to the trouble of seeking a permit to keep them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with a view to getting an opinion expressed on the matter that the amendment standing in the name of Deputy The O'Mahony and myself, which has been withdrawn, was put down.  That amendment asked that recognised racing horses should be exempt.  That amendment was withdrawn on the understanding that, if necessary, it would be put down again on the Report Stage after we had discussed the later amendment which the Minister proposes to accept, and which we thought would possibly include these particular horses.  If anybody thinks that this section can be held to include these others and would like to argue the question on its merits, it is open to him now to put forward his argument.  Personally, I was under the impression that the amendment accepted by the Minister would include these other classes.  If the Minister says that it does not include two year olds that are racing, I for one must oppose this section.  It would be <Col N="393" /> altogether antagonistic to the views of the great bulk of thoroughbred breeders in this country if there was going to be any interference with colts used only for racing purposes.  It would interfere so much with racing that racing people would not know where they stood.  It would also create great difficulty for the Minister and his Department.  There is no great fear of any interference with the Minister's policy as regards the use of two year old racing colts as stallions. The people concerned are an honourable body of men and they are not likely to use these horses as stallions. In any event, a horse in training is not fit to be used as a stallion.  I am sure the Minister is aware that a colt in training is never used as a stallion. Before it could be used as a stallion it would have to be taken out of training and undergo a course of soft feeding.  I hope that the Minister, on consideration, will agree that two-year-old and three-year-old colts, until they are no longer used for racing, will be excluded from the Bill.  I think if the Minister accepted the word &ldquo;stallion&rdquo; it ought to cover the whole thing. Deputy Rice seems to think that there is a difference between a colt and a stallion, but if we say that an animal is a colt as long as he is racing and is only a stallion when used for stud purposes, it would meet the case.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the dictionary definition.  I do not know what terms are used on the racecourse. Horses that are used for stud purposes are called stallions, and only when used for stud purposes.  The word &ldquo;colt&rdquo; is not a dictionary word at all&mdash;it is a slang word&mdash;and we shall have to rule that out.  We cannot recognise it in law.  The amendment I said we might adopt was for thoroughbred stallions in the stud book used for mares in the stud book only.  We had in mind, of course, horses that are retired from the <Col N="394" /> racecourse, not young horses, two-year olds or three-year olds.

      <P>They must get a permit under the Bill.  I put the objection to the Deputy already that if we do not do something about these horses we will have to put in some form of exemption in the Bill, and whatever way we word it I am afraid it will be very difficult to administer the Bill.  If we say that horses used for racing are exempt from the Bill, we may come across a certain stallion and the owner may say that we cannot touch it, because it is a racer.  If we apply Deputy Bennett's test and say if he is on soft feeding, we may find it very hard to prove it.  The only way we can administer the Bill is to get every entire horse in the country into one class or the other.  As soon as we bring in the amendment spoken of, we shall have three classes.  We shall have the horses that are racing only, coming under Section 12, and give them a permit.  We shall have horses that are in a stud book used for stud purposes for the service of mares also in the stud book.  The third class will be the big class of stallions we are legislating for.  We shall have to get these horses into some class or other before we can deal with them.  If Deputies think it unfair to deal with these racing horses, we shall have to bring in some clause exempting them. The difficulty will be to get words which will exempt them and no others.</P>

      <P>Why not introduce some form of words which will keep them outside the Bill.  I think that that is possible.  The Minister will agree that it is troublesome and ridiculous to have various trainers who have two-year-old colts looking to his Department for a permit.  The Minister does not want to do that.  Why not, then, put a clause in the Bill exempting them.  There is no use in legislating if you do not desire to enforce the legislation.  It is not beyond the power of the Minister, or any Party in the Dáil, to introduce a form of words which will meet the case.  There is no necessity for bringing two or three-year-olds, used solely for racing, within the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the question of real importance is when the stallion is used for stud purposes. So far as I can gather, the Minister is agreeable that any stallion that appears in the stud book and is going to be used for serving mares in the stud book, will be exempt from the Bill.  Now, we come down to the question of colts racing, that are in the stud book and that may some day be used for the purpose of serving mares in the stud book.  The real point which we should stick to is the time when they will be used for that purpose.  Until they are used for that purpose, I cannot see any use in having a licence for them.  The moment they are put to the stud, if they are to be used for mares that are not in the stud book, then they must have a permit.  For the purpose of this Bill, the Minister could omit thoroughbred colts until such time as they go to the stud.  If they go to mares in the stud book, they are exempt.</P>

      <P>There should be no difficulty as regards the half-bred mares.  An amendment on the lines of that which we withdrew, and which <Col N="396" /> may be considered on Report Stage again, might meet the case.  That amendment would exclude thoroughbred horses in recognised racing stables and under the charge of a trainer, holding a licence to train under Irish Turf Club rules.  An amendment on those lines might meet the point.  I do hope that we shall find some way of excluding young racing horses from the operations of the Bill.

If we come down on an owner and say that he has a horse for which he should have a licence, he can reply, &ldquo;I am using it for racing only.&rdquo;  We want to be satisfied about that and we should, at least, have to give him some form to fill up in order to secure the exemption.  I think it would be just as easy for him to fill up the form to get a permit.  There is 5/- charged for the permit.  I should not mind if that were reduced to 2/6.  I think that the permit system is the better one. If Deputies are not satisfied, I shall consider the matter.</P>

      <P>(1)  Save in the manner and to the extent authorised by this section, licences and permits granted under this Act shall not be transferable.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where the right to the possession of a stallion in respect of which a licence or permit granted under this Act is in force passes from the holder of such licence or permit to another person (in this section called the transferee) either by a transfer or devolution of the property in the stallion or by a loan, hire, or lease of the stallion for a period exceeding six months, or by the cesser or surrender of any such loan, hiring, or lease, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the Minister may, on the application of the transferee and on notice to the holder of such licence or permit or his personal representative and on compliance with the prescribed conditions, transfer such licence or permit in the prescribed manner to the transferee.</P>

      <P>The following amendments are in my name:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> In sub-section (1), line 35, to delete the word &ldquo;save&rdquo; and in line 37, to delete the word &ldquo;not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In sub-section (2) (a), line 46, to delete the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These amendments deal with the transfer of licences.  We feel that the Minister ought to make certain that if a person holds a licence for a stallion he should have the right, on selling the stallion, to transfer the licence.  The point is partly met in the Bill as it stands.  It is provided there that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; allow the licence to be transferred.  We should like to see the provision more definite and I propose to substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo; by &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  It was pointed out to me that, on effecting this change, it would be necessary to delete the words &ldquo;save&rdquo; and &ldquo;not&rdquo; as proposed by amendment 7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments would make it very difficult to deal with certain districts because under Section 6 (4) Deputies will see that we can limit the operations of a stallion to a particular area.  The reason we have done that is that in a poor area, where service fees are not very big and where the number of mares is not very large, we might find it impossible to get a horse which we would regard as of good standard.  We might be compelled to allow a more inferior horse to be licensed in that area.  If these amendments were accepted a person could get a horse licensed in an area and immediately have him transferred to a place where we would not ordinarily permit such a horse.  The effect of the amendments would be that we would have to keep to a very high standard. We could not afford a low standard because if we lowered the standard in any district it would leave the road open to the possibility of an inferior horse being licensed and put into a district into which he would not otherwise be permitted to go.  I do not think there is anything to be gained by the amendments.  In genuine cases there never was any difficulty about transferring stallions.  There would not be any difficulty, under this Bill, <Col N="399" /> if the stallion were up to the proper standard for the particular area.</P>

      <P>With regard to Section 16, it strikes me that it gives very wide scope.  It sets out that an inspector, or any member of the Gárda Síochána, may inspect at all reasonable times any stallion to which the Act applies. Of course, that section can be interpreted in many ways.  I suppose we can take it that the procedure under this section will be the same as was adopted in a recent Bill, and the owner of a stallion will get reasonable notice from the Department of the intended inspection.  Under this Bill it would seem that an inspector may come down any time he likes to see a horse.  I think such powers should not be given to the inspector or the Gárda Síochána.  There ought to be some reasonable notification.  &ldquo;At all times&rdquo; is very wide.</P>

      <P>(1) Where the Minister refuses an application for a licence or a permit under this Act or revokes or suspends a licence or permit granted under this Act, or is of opinion that a stallion to which this Act applies is not suitable for breeding purposes or where an application for a licence or permit under this Act is not made within the prescribed time the Minister may serve on the owner, reputed owner, or other person keeping or having possession of the stallion the subject of such application, licence, permit, or opinion a notice in the prescribed form requiring such person within the time (not being less than fourteen days) specified in such notice to have such stallion castrated.</P>

    <P>This section gives the Minister power to order certain stallions under certain circumstances to be gelded.  The amendment aims at exempting that particular portion of the section.  To demand such a penalty from a man because of some slight mistake, possibly through absence or for some other reason, is not fair.  If a man fails to license his stallion in the prescribed time he is, under the terms of the section, subject to a very severe penalty.  It might happen that a man might be unable to license the stallion in the prescribed time and, just because he may not be able to comply with the law on a particular date, he is to be made subject to the penalty of having his stallion gelded.  I think that is a hardship, and in the circumstances the Minister ought to accept the amendment.  So far as the rest of the section is concerned the Minister should certainly have all the powers for which he asks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will see that there are many safeguards before this section can be operated.  The applicant has up to 31st December to make an application for a licence.  If he fails to apply before then he will have a further period by paying a late fee.  The Department, knowing there is a stallion there which is unlicensed, may decide to prosecute.  Probably that is what we would do in most cases. There may be cases where owners will not give satisfaction, will not apply for a licence or reply to communications. If such people ignore our communications and advice we have to take definite action.  We find in such cases that nothing will bring them to their senses except a notice to have the stallion castrated.  Then we cannot do it.  The owner can appeal.  If he appeals against the castration in this way we must let the appeal go.  Under Section 19 of the Bill his appeal will be heard, so that he has very many safeguards.  I do not think there is any danger whatsoever that the owner of the horse is going to be taken unawares, and have his stallion castrated without his getting due <Col N="402" /> notice, and in fact many notices, before action is taken.</P>

      <P>The Minister will, I know, have a difficulty in dealing with certain cases, the same as he had in the case of the Live-stock Breeding Act. There was difficulty there in dealing with some people.  But this is a very wide section where the Minister may order the castration of certain stallions. If the stallion is of the kind described in the section, the Minister should have these powers where the animal is infected with certain disease or defects, where the animal would be unsuitable for breeding purposes, or where the animal would be likely to beget unsuitable progeny.  In all these cases I agree the Minister should have power to deal with the owner.  The case however, is very different where it is only a question of the owner not making application for a licence or permit within the prescribed time. Such an owner is not guilty of using an improper horse.  It may merely be a case where there was a pure inadvertence, or the lapse may have been caused by circumstances beyond the owner's control.  The man might be having a holiday in Switzerland.</P>

There may be some cases which the Minister has in <Col N="403" /> mind where the owner might be defying the Minister and his Department.  The period in such a case would not be too short, but I think the provision in the cases I have indicated is entirely too severe, and I do not think it should be in the Bill.</P>

One Deputy mentioned the case of the wandering stallion, and another Deputy mentioned that the owner might be in Switzerland.  Deputies may take it for granted that the Minister is not going out of his way looking for stallions to castrate.  He is only going to enforce this section where it is absolutely necessary.  Deputy Rice raised a point about the late fee.  The late fee is put down as being not more than five guineas.  It may be less; it will be prescribed.  We cannot say to one man: &ldquo;You will have to pay five guineas,&rdquo; when another man may have to pay three guineas.  The maximum is five guineas.  I do not know at the moment whether that would be the figure that we will prescribe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister could meet us some way in regard to it, I would be willing to withdraw it.  I still think, notwithstanding what the Minister said, that the application of this particular section is rather drastic applied to a trivial offence.  I think it might be possible that we could arrive at some method by which this difficulty might be got over.  It might be incorporated in the question of fines.  To submit to the full penalty of this clause for the offence in the first part of the section is too much.  I think the very drastic remedy of castrating the stallion was meant for cases where the permit or licence was refused or revoked.  I think that particular penalty was meant for such cases.  I am of opinion that the inclusion of this particular penalty for this particular offence was not originally the intention of the Minister.  I do not think he originally intended to <Col N="404" /> subject people, who failed to make application at the proper time, to the same penalties as for that class of owner already referred to&mdash;people who have horses that are not suitable for breeding purposes.  I do not think the Minister will, himself, say that it was his intention to subject a man, who, because of some reason or other, has committed a trivial technical offence, to the penalty of having his horse castrated.  I think the Minister could legitimately accept the amendment.  I do not want to press the point any further or to labour the matter.  If the Minister refuses to accept this amendment, perhaps he could bring in an amendment of his own on the Report Stage so that the penalty of castration would not be inflicted for this trivial offence.  To inflict such a penalty appears to be obviously unreasonable.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that the real intention of the Minister was to impose this penalty in the case of a man who was keeping a stallion that was unfit for breeding purposes against the wishes of the Department and against the wishes of this House.  In such cases only should the penalty of castration be applied.  It should not be applied to people who, through neglect, fail to register at the right time.  It should not be beyond the powers of the draftsman to remedy that at the next stage.  This is quite different from a case where the owner of a stallion is deliberately defying the Department and keeping an unfit horse for stud purposes.</P>

By the wildest exaggeration I could not describe as extreme a case where a man failed inadvertently to give notice &mdash;cases where the man did not willingly commit the offence mentioned in the Bill.  The man may fail for reasons beyond his power to apply for the licence within the prescribed time.  I am strongly objecting to the extreme penalty in these cases.  The Minister has not dealt with the argument as to why a man, who may commit a trivial offence, should be subjected to this grave penalty.  The only protection given to such a man is the 14 days' notice.  That is a very small period to give a man to comply.</P>

      <P>I just wish to make a few suggestions to the Minister before the Report Stage of the Bill is taken.  The first point I want to make is, and it is an important one, because of the agricultural policy of the present Government, that there is a great scarcity of agricultural horses in the country.  To the farmer, who wants to have his land ploughed, thoroughbred horses are absolutely useless.  At the present time we have some horses engaged on tillage work, and they are scarcely able to drag their tails after them.  I hope that on the Report Stage the Minister will be able to introduce an amendment that will have the effect of improving the type of agricultural horses we have.  If he succeeds in doing that he will be conferring a great benefit on the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>And not the first time that it grated on the ears of Deputy Dillon either.  This decision, however, was not gazetted or otherwise formally promulgated at the time but was simply put into effect for official purposes.  On the 20th July, 1926, the then Minister for Defence, in reply to a question raised by Deputy O.G. Esmonde in the Dáil, stated that the &ldquo;Soldier's Song&rdquo; was the National Anthem.  On the 12th March, 1929, a band arrangement, prepared by Colonel Fritz Brasé, Director of the Army School of Music, was approved by the Executive Council as the official arrangement of the National Anthem, and on the 19th February, 1932, Colonel Brasé was instructed to prepare scores for orchestral and other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The music of the &ldquo;Soldier's Song,&rdquo; it is generally understood, was composed at the end of 1909, or the beginning of 1910, by a Mr. Patrick Heeney, and the words were written at the same time, it is believed, by Mr. Peadar O Cearnaigh.  Mr. Heeney died in 1911 and it is his legal personal representative who is interested, with Mr. O Cearnaigh, in the agreement which has been arrived at and in respect of which this Estimate is being brought in.  Throughout the period of 1924 and 1932 Mr. O Cearnaigh several times put forward claims for royalties in respect of the performing and publishing rights of the song, and these claims were brought to a head finally in 1932 when Mr. O Cearnaigh joined with the personal representative of the late Mr. Heeney and threatened to bring proceedings against all persons who performed the work or printed the music unless payments were made to them of the royalties which they claimed.  In pursuance of this, the Directors of the Army and Gárda Síochána Bands, the Director of the Broadcasting Station, and the managements of the various theatres and cinemas in Dublin were communicated with by the solicitors for Messrs.  O Cearnaigh and Heeney, and, ultimately, proceedings were taken by them against the Dublin Theatre Co., Ltd., to obtain an injunction to restrain <Col N="410" /> them from infringing the copyright which they claimed, and claiming damages for alleged previous infringements.</P>
    <P>It seemed most desirable that the copyright of the National Anthem should vest in the State and it was deemed inexpedient that an action such as this should proceed in the courts.  Accordingly, the Executive Council authorised the Attorney-General to endeavour to acquire on behalf of the State any rights possessed by Messrs.  O Cearnaigh and Heeney in the Anthem.  After negotiation, and the Attorney-General having satisfied himself that Messrs.  O Cearnaigh and Heeney had shown a good title to the rights in the Anthem, a settlement was arrived at in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  That the Minister for Finance should pay £980 to Messrs.  Peadar O Cearnaigh and Michael Heeney;</P>
    <P>(2)  That the Minister should pay £20 to the Talbot Press, Ltd., Dublin;</P>
    <P>(3)  That the Minister should pay £150 to Messrs.  Miley and Miley in full satisfaction of their costs;</P>
    <P>(4)  That the Minister should pay £50 to Messrs.  O'Hanlon and Robinson, Solicitors for the Dublin Theatre Company, in full satisfaction of their costs;</P>
    <P>(5)  That Messrs. O Cearnaigh and Heeney and the Talbot Press, Ltd., should cede all rights in the &ldquo;Soldier's Song&rdquo; to the Minister, should stay the action against the Dublin Theatre Company, and should agree to take no further proceedings in respect of breach of copyright or of royalties claimed; that the Talbot Press, Ltd., should be allowed to dispose of, for their own profit and without payment of any further royalties, any stock of the &ldquo;Soldier's Song&rdquo; printed by them and in existence at the time of settlement.</P>
    <P>An agreement embodying the settlement was executed by the parties on 20th October, 1933.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the facts that (1) the negotiations had been of a protracted nature, (2) that the settlement arrived at was satisfactory to all concerned <Col N="411" /> and that, consequently, the disposal of the whole matter by immediate payment was desirable, (3) that the deed of transfer signed on 20th October recited that the money due under the deed had been paid over, (4) that at that date the Dáil was not due to reassemble for nearly a month, and (5) that the necessary Estimate would more than likely be non-contentious it was decided that recourse should be had to the Contingency Fund to enable an immediate payment to be made.  Payment was accordingly issued on 26th October.  The Estimate now presented is for authority to repay the sum of £1,200 to the Contingency Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposing this Estimate, although, speaking purely as an individual and not as representing my Party, I frankly confess that the action we are taking, whereby we adopt, perhaps more formally than it has been adopted hitherto, the &ldquo;Soldier's Song&rdquo; as the National Anthem, is one which costs me a certain pang.  That is not at all because of the associations of the &ldquo;Soldier's Song.&rdquo;  As I understand it, the &ldquo;Soldier's Song&rdquo; was composed somewhere about 1911 and was the marching song of the Irish Volunteers from the time they were created, as a result of the movement in Ulster known as the Ulster Volunteer Movement. I think that, with that history, nobody would have a right to complain on the score of its associations about the &ldquo;Soldier's Song&rdquo; being the National Anthem or a National Anthem.  The reason that I regret its adoption as the one official National Anthem is that I think that both the words and the music are unworthy of the high position that is being assigned to it.  One would like to see a tune or a song of that kind preserved for sentimental reasons, in the same way as one who had fought in the European War in the British Army would perhaps wish to see &ldquo;It's a Long Way to Tipperary&rdquo; preserved for sentimental reasons. Although, however, one may feel <Col N="412" /> warmly over a tune of that kind because of its associations, it does not follow that it should be erected into the dignity of a National Anthem. Leaving out sentiment, I must confess, from both a literary and a musical point of view, I would regard the &ldquo;Soldier's Song&rdquo; as, shall we say, a jaunty little piece of vulgarity, and I think we could have done a lot better.  We have got a wide range of genuinely Gaelic melodies to choose from, and whether we want an air that is brisk and martial or an air that is tender and melancholy or one that is grave and majestic, we can find it.  We could find a National Anthem that corresponded much more nearly to our desire to develop Gaelic civilisation in this country and one also that corresponded to the antiquity of this country and the antiquity of our struggle for self-government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, the Volunteer Movement and the Sinn Féin Movement whether one approves of the whole of it or not &mdash;and, of course, my views about the Sinn Féin Movement are well known&mdash; were just an episode in the long struggle for self-government. Therefore, it is not either logical or necessary that the marching song that prevailed during those few years has now to be adopted as our only permanent National Anthem.  As I said, I am not opposing this Estimate, but I venture to repeat a suggestion that I put forward before: That a committee be appointed from the Oireachtas to consider the selection of another National Anthem not necessarily to take the place of this but to exist alongside it.  It is not necessary to have only one National Anthem.  England has two or three; she has &ldquo;God Save the King,&rdquo;&ldquo;Rule Britannia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Land of Hope and Glory.&rdquo;  The Germans have two or three: &ldquo;Deutschland Uber Alles,&rdquo;&ldquo;Die Wacht am Rhein&rdquo; and now they have the Nazi song, which I think is called the &ldquo;Horst Wessel Song.&rdquo;  The United States of America has two: &ldquo;The Star Spangled Banner&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sweet Land of Liberty&rdquo; and so forth.  I would like to suggest that a committee be appointed to select an old Gaelic air worthy of the country <Col N="413" /> and that we should have that set up as a National Anthem alongside the other.  If proper words for that melody do not exist, if the old words, as for example in &ldquo;O'Donnell Abu&rdquo; have relation to one family or district, then suitable words could be provided. We have Irish living poets both in Gaelic and in English and a version in each language could be wedded to the melody chosen.  I put forward that suggestion and I would be glad if the Minister for Finance would give it sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance and the Executive Council generally in bringing this matter to its present position. I think it is only right and proper that when an article is turned out by a person whether poor or wealthy and when that article is generally used by the people the manufacturer or producer should receive reasonable compensation.  We are not just examining, with a microscope, particular words and notes contained in what has been adopted by the people, and what is now called our National Anthem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular song was adopted as the National Anthem by the Executive Council in 1926.  Before the Executive Council adopted it as a National Anthem, it was adopted by the people, and so, the act of the Executive Council at the time coincided with the general wish of the people.  I think if any National Anthem was to be subjected to microscopic examination there would be a number of individuals found with something to complain of either about the words or the notes.  National Anthems come about, not because of the suitability of the particular words or notes, but because they are adopted generally by the nation.  That is exactly how the &ldquo;Soldier's Song&rdquo; became a National Anthem in this country.  It happened to be the Anthem on the lips of the people when they came into their own and when the outsiders evacuated the country and left the insiders here to make the best or the worst of the country.  It was adopted by the <Col N="414" /> people here before ever it was adopted by the Executive Council, and I wish heartily to approve of the Minister's proposal here to-day to compensate the authors of this Anthem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance not to jump too quickly at Deputy MacDermot's proposal for a committee to find out a new National Anthem for us.  I think I have complained before that neither the poets nor the musicians came along in great numbers during the time we needed a National Anthem. I am not blaming the poets, they might not have been able to do so at the time.  I do not think that even the Minister for Finance himself was driven to poetry by the atmosphere of that time.  I do not think you are going in any way to make a National Anthem except the anthem the people give you.  If anyone thinks they want a better National Anthem than we have, I think we ought to delay it until we have raised the standard of music and musical construction in the country.  I do not think, such as our musical establishments are, with the Government grants reduced, that we have yet achieved the musical training and education so necessary for the country.  At a time when there is so very little systematically being done in the schools for music I do not think we should set up such a committee. We ought to begin and change all that and see that something more is done in the schools for musical education than is being done at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to see as many National Anthems as there are national armies here.  Also I would remind the House that we are getting into the habit of perpetuating ugly incidents and memories.  If we are to submit our present National Anthem, both words and music, to any kind of examination we would want a very big microscope.  I suggest this committee is essential if we are to live up to the tradition taught in our school days that in the past we were celebrated in song and story.  Surely anyone with the most elementary knowlege of music and especially traditional Irish music could not for a moment suggest <Col N="415" /> that the music of the &ldquo;Soldier's Song&rdquo; is either inspiring or even musical.  I am not going to suggest a particular form of words. Deputy Corish might like &ldquo;The Boys of Wexford.&rdquo;  I might suggest the &ldquo;Boys of Cork&rdquo; for a National Anthem, but I suggest that we have old traditional words and melodies to be found in the Bunting collection, for example, that are quite inspiring and martial.  &ldquo;We are soldiers of a fighting race.&rdquo;  That is a line from the song.</P>
      <P>I see nothing wrong with &ldquo;Let Erin Remember.&rdquo;  I think all parties could unite in adopting an air of that kind and the words of &ldquo;Let Erin Remember&rdquo; as a National Anthem. I say that with all seriousness.  There is nothing of a partisan character in either the words or the music.  &ldquo;The Boys of Wexford&rdquo; had a partisan flavour at one time, and so had &ldquo;God Save Ireland.&rdquo;  I can well remember reading about the anti-Parnellites adopting &ldquo;God Save Ireland,&rdquo; and the Parnellites adopting &ldquo;The Boys of Wexford.&rdquo;  I do not wish to disrespect in any way the ability of either the composer of the music or the author of the words, but I feel that the whole thing is an abomination to any one who knows anything about music.  Another suggestion has been made here by, I think, Deputy General Mulcahy, that it was the people's song at the time. We do know that the people sang, right through the Great War, abominations in poetry and music, and any of them has not been adopted by Great Britain as a National Anthem.  I have hopes that some musician and some poet will collaborate one day, and give us a National Anthem something like the &ldquo;Marseillaise.&rdquo;  Awaiting that time, there is something in the suggestion that a committee should be set up to enquire whether we cannot get something that would bear greater relation to the traditions of Irish music and Irish poetry than the &ldquo;Soldier's Song.&rdquo;</P>

I do not know whether the remaining members of his party, in particular Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy O'Higgins, and Deputy Séan MacEoin if he were here, would agree with the statement that the &ldquo;Soldier's Song&rdquo; is just a jaunting piece of vulgarity.</P>

      <P>We have had a discourse on words and music from both Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Anthony. Everybody knows perfectly well that national anthems are never devised <Col N="417" /> with an eye to getting perfect music or perfect words.  Least of all in nations which have regained their freedom is any attempt ever made to produce a national anthem which reflects perfection from the point of view of music or from the point of view of words. Every subject people who fought for liberty in all times and in all parts of the world have always, as Deputy O'Higgins suggested, got their national anthem out of the period in which they fought for their liberty.  &ldquo;The Soldier's Song&rdquo; was written when this nation was passing through a period of trial and tribulation.  It undoubtedly then reflected the hopes and aspirations of our people, and no matter how much the members of that once great Party, the Sinn Féin Party, may be divided to-day, there are nevertheless people in this House who are always glad to look back with pride to the period when they could always assemble and march to the martial strains of &ldquo;The Soldier's Song&rdquo; in this country.  It reflected the hopes and aims and aspirations of our people.  If it was good enough to reflect our hopes, our aims and ambitions in that period of trial and tribulation it ought to be good enough for us to-day in the year 1933.  I see no reason whatever&mdash;without claiming to be an authority on music&mdash;why we should depart from or in any way try to slight or deprecate either the martial strain of &ldquo;The Soldier's Song&rdquo; or the spirit which is enshrined in every verse of that song.  It reflects the aims and aspirations of our people, and until such time as those aims and aspirations are fully satisfied there is at least no need to change the words of the song, and I do not know that any case whatever has been made for changing the music.</P>

    <P>When Deputy MacDermot was speaking it seemed to me that he wanted a few Soldiers' Songs, so that those who did not know where they stand politically might have a safe retreat.  Some of them could sing one kind of song and feel that they were national, while others could sing another kind of song to indicate their political feelings.  If there is a case for a national anthem it is a case for one national anthem&mdash;a national anthem <Col N="418" /> which will be free from all party politics, a national anthem which, whatever its period may be, will at least inspire in all of us an admiration and a veneration for this historic nation of ours.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that while we are here a sovereign assembly there are certain things which no sovereign assembly can do. One of them is to order the people of the country what songs they are going to sing.  I think you will find that persons who wish to sing will sing songs of their own choice, and not the songs which are laid down by any legislation of this House.  In consequence, I believe that if you did, here in this House, elect that there should be some other song, or some other air chosen as a national anthem, it simply would not work.  You might on State occasions have your bands playing, by order, that particular air, but it would not be in reality the national anthem, because the national anthem is, and must be in its nature, the song which the people of the country regard as their national anthem.  As has already been pointed out, national anthems are not written to order.  Nowhere have they been written to order or adopted by Governments in the first instance. They have always come naturally and spontaneously.  Take for instance the &ldquo;Watch on the Rhine&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Marseillaise&rdquo;; the former has come from a certain time in the history of Germany, and the latter from a certain period in French history.  The people of the country concerned adopted them.  The &ldquo;Marseillaise&rdquo; was put in the background in France for a period, but came out again because it was the wish of the French people that it should be their national anthem.  Even if it were desirable, I think it would be utterly impossible to change the views of the majority of the people of this State as to what ought to be the national anthem.  I am perfectly satisfied that &ldquo;The Soldier's Song&rdquo; is going to continue to be the national anthem, and that even if we wished to change it&mdash;which I personally do not think desirable&mdash;we could not do it.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a small point in connection with this <Col N="419" /> matter.  In most of the houses of entertainment in the city the national anthem is played, usually at the end of the performance.  I know of, at least, one house of entertainment where the musicians have to remain over until the end of the performance to do so. I think it would be appreciated by a certain number of workers, who have long hours, if it could be intimated to such houses of entertainment that there is no derogation of the position of the national anthem in such cases by having it played at the opening of the performance, whether at 7.30 or 8 o'clock, as is the case in many places. There is a mistaken idea that the anthem has to be played at the end of a performance, and for that purpose the musicians have to stay later than usual.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This Bill is consequential on the passing of the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act, 1933. Section 4 of the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act, 1923, provides that the allowance and travelling facilities to be paid to and received by each Deputy shall commence and be payable as from the day on which he shall take the Oath, which was formerly prescribed by Article 17 of the Constitution, after his then last election to the Oireachtas.  As this Oath is no longer part of the Constitution, the section mentioned has ceased to operate and the present Bill provides for the commencement of payment of the allowance and travelling expenses to members of the Oireachtas elected after the passing of the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act, 1933.  In the case of a member elected to Dáil Eireann at a General Election, Section 2 of the Bill provides that the allowance and travelling facilities shall be payable as from the date on which the Oireachtas is summoned to meet after the General Election, subject to prior compliance by the members with the Standing Orders of Dáil Eireann. In every other case payment is to commence as from the date of compliance with the Standing Orders of Dáil Eireann or Seanad Eireann. Sub-section 1 of Section 3 of the Bill follows the lines of Section 5 (1) of the 1923 Act.  In sub-section (2) of Section 3 provision is made for the first time for the payment of expenses incurred by a member of the Oireachtas in travelling to Dublin for the purpose of complying with Standing Orders on a date prior to the date of such compliance.  Sub-section (3) of Section 3 follows the lines of sub-section (3) of Section 5 of the 1923 Act.  Section 5 of the Bill provides for the payment of the allowance and travelling expenses to a Deputy elected during the period between the passing of the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act, 1933, and the passage of this Bill into law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be little or no additional <Col N="421" /> cost to the Exchequer as a result of the Bill.  It is true that the grant under sub-section (2) of Section 3 of travelling facilities on a date prior to the date of the actual compliance with Standing Orders will entail some small additional expenditure.</P>

      <P>I object to the passage of this Bill.  We are again discussing the question of the Oath, and its repercussion has again come home, as I warned the Minister, again and again.  It is not my business to do the work of the Attorney-General, but I think he will have to bring in further Bills to deal with the Oath.  I object to the Bill because we are asked to become accessories to the fact, after the Treaty has been broken. For the first time a Deputy took his seat last week without taking the Oath, despite the clear provisions of the Treaty.  It was rather astonishing that the Deputy concerned should be representing Dublin University. Dublin University has been always somewhat rebellious from the time it was founded down to the time of Edward Carson, and it was only right that a representative of Trinity College should be the first man to commit an overt act&mdash;breaking the Treaty.  I have examined this Bill, and I want to be quite sure that this Bill does not place us in the position of accessories after the fact.  Believe it or not, last night I read the Treaty after many years, and I was amazed. The experience was like a forced landing by mistake in another planet.  The Treaty is in a most extraordinary position.  Half of the clauses have not been fulfilled.  If the Attorney-General reads it he will find that practically half the Treaty is still waiting to be carried out.  Many of the clauses of the Treaty are obsolete, having fallen into disuse through neglect.  Article 6 is of very great importance, as it deals with national defence.  I think it has lapsed owing to the failure of both Governments to put it into effect.  There are also Schedules to the Treaty.  At any rate, that particular Article has been broken by the overt act of a representative of Dublin University.  This is a Bill <Col N="422" /> to treat such Deputies as if they were not breaking international law, and to pay them their allowances, the same as other Deputies.  I think they should be penalised for breaking the law and for that reason I object to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the illicit traffic in dangerous drugs has become a very serious problem in many countries. So far, however, the question has not become acute in the Saorstát.  Such misuse of narcotics as has come to the notice of the Department of Justice is by persons who cannot well be prevented from having access to such drugs, and the drugs used by them are imported and distributed in the ordinary course of trade.</P>
      <P>It is fairly safe to say that no smuggling of drugs, at any rate in quantities, has taken place.  Medical Deputies will no doubt be able to corroborate this.  One of the chief obstacles to suppressing illicit traffic in countries in which such traffic was prevalent was the fact that certain manufacturing countries permitted the export of drugs such as morphine and heroin practically without control or restriction.  Quantities of these drugs far in excess of the medicinal requirements of the world were being produced and exported.  Accordingly at a Convention signed at Geneva in 1931, it was agreed between the parties that steps would be taken for the limitation of the manufacture of these drugs.  It is clear that if the Convention succeeds in its object, and only the quantities of narcotics necessary for legitimate purposes are produced, a very heavy blow will have been dealt to the illicit traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Bill confers the powers necessary to carry out the obligations imposed by the Convention of 1931 to which the Saorstát recently acceded. <Col N="423" /> It incorporates the existing law which is contained in the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1920, together with the additional sections necessitated by the accession to the Convention and some minor provisions in accordance with the Convention of 1925 to which the Saorstát is a party.  The Bill is of its nature extremely technical, and several of the drugs mentioned therein are practically unknown in the Saorstát.  It is, however, necessary in order to conform to the Convention to include in the Bill sections relating to these drugs.</P>

      <P>So far as I understand from the Attorney-General's opening statement, this is a Bill which is carrying out an international agreement but there is really no necessity or need for the Bill so far as the condition of this State is concerned.  I rather gather that from the Attorney-General's opening statement and I believe from any knowledge I have acquired of that particular subject myself and of the existing legislation on the subject that that is so.  As a matter of fact, I think it is actually a fact that there are no wholesalers of these particular drugs in this State and that any quantity of these dangerous drugs which is required legitimately by medical men in this country for the practice of their profession has got to be imported.  In the circumstances, I am sure we are all very glad that it is a Bill which is not promoted out of necessity or from anything serious in the condition of this country but that it is simply being promoted to carry out international arrangements and as such it has naturally got the support of this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This Bill had its origin in the necessity for legislation to validate an Order made in November, 1920, closing Tralee Prison.  Subsequent to this <Col N="424" /> Order having been made, the prison was utilised first as a police barrack and afterwards as a military barrack. After its evacuation by the military, it was retransferred, on 11th January, 1925, to the Kerry County Council as the successors of the former prison authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 31 of the Prisons (Ireland) Act, 1877.  Ejectment proceedings were instituted by the Kerry County Council last year in relation to portion of these premises and it was then held by the Circuit Court that as the terms of the Closing Order of 1st November, 1920, were not in accordance with Section 30 of the Act of 1877, the transfer of the prison premises to the County Council had not been validly effected.  In this Bill provision is made to validate retrospectively the Closing Order referred to.</P>
      <P>The opportunity is also being availed of to amend the existing unsatisfactory statutory provisions governing the closing of local prisons and their subsequent disposal which are contained in Sections 30 and 31 of the Act of 1877.  Great difficulty has always been experienced in the interpretation and application of these sections and as a result considerable doubt existed as to the legal position of some closed prisons&mdash;portions of which were retransferred to county councils and other portions utilised for public purposes, such as police barracks.  These doubts were confirmed by a decision last year in the High Court in the Kilkenny case, where the interpretation of the section in its relation to the partial user of the closed prison, which had been acted on for many years, was rejected by the High Court.  This Bill proposes to clarify the position for the future.  Sections 30 and 31 of the Act of 1877 are being repealed and are being replaced by more explicit provisions. I may mention that Mountjoy Prisons, male and female, are excluded from the Bill, as there never was any reversionary interest therein vested in any local authority.  They were built out of State funds and are exclusively State property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Attorney-General if it is the <Col N="425" /> intention to close any further prisons, because when I first received this Bill and read it through, it appeared to me that provision was being made for the further closing of prisons.  I should like to know if that is so or if there is in contemplation at the moment the closing of any prison which is now open in the Saorstát?  I know that this is always a very difficult and complicated matter.  On the one hand, you have prisons with practically no prison population and you are keeping warders there; but on the other hand, if you close those prisons, you have got to bring prisoners to other prisons at very considerable expense and, at the same time, you prevent untried prisoners from having intercourse with their relatives and legal advisers.  If it is the intention under this statute to close any further prisons, I would ask that those considerations be very carefully borne in mind.  I also ask the Attorney-General if it is the intention to close any further prisons and, if so, what prisons the Minister for Justice contemplates closing.</P>
      <P>So far as the Bill itself is concerned, it is obvious that a Bill of this nature would have to be enacted because the law most undoubtedly is in an unsatisfactory condition at present.  While I am not opposing the Second Reading, I should like to get specific information as to how it is contemplated that the Bill will be enforced and with reference to what prisons, if any, these provisions are going to be applied, that is, to prisons which have not yet already been closed in whole or in part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Attorney-General whether this is an urgent Bill or whether he would allow the Report Stage to stand over the Recess, because this Bill provides an opportunity for raising a question of very considerable importance&mdash;the general question of the accommodation of convicted prisoners, juvenile and adult.  The present situation is that the places of detention reserved for juvenile prisoners are under the control of the Department of Education.  I believe I am correct in saying that the Borstal institutes and prisons are under the control of the <Col N="426" /> Department of Justice and that, therefore, the word &ldquo;prison,&rdquo; as defined in the Prisons Acts, 1826 to 1907, would include Borstal institutions and prisons. This Bill gives the Minister for Justice power to close prisons and makes other provisions referred to by the Attorney-General in his speech in introducing the Second Reading.  I am not entirely satisfied with the provisions made for juvenile offenders. I am not in possession of sufficient details to open the question at length on this occasion, but I should like an assurance from the Attorney-General that this Bill, if it be not an urgent Bill, might be postponed until after the Recess so that in the event of its being necessary to raise the general question of places of detention for juvenile offenders, an opportunity will be forthcoming to do so on the Report Stage of the Bill.  Would it be possible for the Attorney-General to accede to that request?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Bill is an urgent Bill.  It has been a long time in preparation but I do not see how an opportunity would be afforded on this Bill of raising the matter which the Deputy has mentioned. I propose to ask that the Committee Stage be taken next week and perhaps I would be in a position then to answer the Deputy as to whether the Report Stage would be asked for in this Session or not.  I do not see how the matters, which he suggests might be raised, arise on this Bill.  If he looks at the long title he will see that it is a Bill merely to amend the law relating to the closing of prisons and to the use, control and disposal of prisons which have been closed.  I explained in introducing the Bill that the necessity for the Bill arises owing to difficulties which have arisen in interpreting two sections of the Act of 1877.  It is that, and that alone, which compelled the Department of Justice to bring forward this Bill.  Owing to the defect which the Circuit Court Judge discovered in the Order made in 1920 by the Lord Lieutenant closing Tralee Prison, it was found that the county council were unable to recover portion of the prison <Col N="427" /> which they thought was vested in them.  In order to right that position and to give the county council title to the premises, it was necessary either to introduce a Bill specifically doing that or a general Bill making new provisions instead of Sections 31 and 32 of the Act of 1877.</P>
      <P>Another case arose in the end of last year, in respect to Kilkenny Prison. There was an Order made by the county council reserving part of the premises as a house for the Chief Superintendent of the Guards.  The matter came before the High Court and the High Court held that the whole of the prison should be made over to the local authority and that the attempt to reserve part of it was invalid.  That particular decision is not being affected.  It is left as the courts decided it.  There is one other prison, Dundalk, in respect of which it is necessary to have provisions made.  The provisions contained in the Bill, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney knows, are necessary to clear up the position in respect to these prisons. When we come to discuss the Committee Stage there may be some debate as to whether the particular provisions now substituted for the old ones are advisable or not or whether extended powers are being given or not.  In answer to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's question as to whether there is any intention to close further prisons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave way to the Attorney-General in order to get a reply to one particular point, but there are one or two other points which I wish to raise before he concludes. The reason I raise this question here is because the Bill does define the rights of the Minister to close a prison, and it might in certain circumstances be desirable to suggest to the Minister that instead of closing them they should be turned to other uses.  In dealing with questions of this kind I feel sure that the Attorney-General will agree that it is highly undesirable that they should be approached from a Party point of view.  I have no desire to say anything <Col N="428" /> now which could possibly be construed as an allegation against the Ministers responsible either in the Department of Education or the Department of Justice.  At the same time, before giving the Minister these powers, I should like to be in a position to make suggestions to him in the event of the Department of Education not being able to take certain steps that I think essential in regard to the provision that the Department at present makes for juvenile offenders.  It is merely a question of expediency.  I think it is quite possible the Department of Education will find itself able to take such steps as may be necessary.  At the same time, if they do not, I should like an opportunity to make an appeal on this Bill that the Bill be used for purposes which the Department of Education does not feel itself prepared to undertake.</P>

In answer to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's question, I am in a position to assure him that it is not the intention to close any further prisons.  This Bill is merely for the purposes which I have already outlined.  It does not spring from any intention on the part of the Department to close any further prisons.</P>

      <P>The Deputy took advantage of this Bill last week to express the opinion, or rather gave it as a fact, that during the period the Fianna Fáil Government have been in power there was not a single tenement dweller moved out of a slum house in Dublin.  I said then that I would be able to answer that.  The proper time to answer it was not then, because on the following Monday evening it was necessary for the Corporation to meet to give effect to the proposition to raise a loan of £1,000,000, the greater portion of which would be used in connection with its housing schemes within <Col N="430" /> the city.  I called the attention of the responsible officer of the Corporation to what had been said, and I asked him to forward details as to the work of the Housing Committee during the last two years or so.  He had not those ready on Monday, for some reason or other that I cannot explain.  I made reference to it, however, during the debate and to-day he favoured me with a report in the shape of a letter from the Department concerned.  He says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I regret that the information regarding the removal of families from tenement houses was not completed to enable me to send it to you on Monday.  The official to whom I had entrusted the preparation of it was unavoidably prevented from attending the office on Saturday, which had the effect of delaying its completion.  The facts as now disclosed show that on the housing schemes at Cabra, Marrowbone Lane, Beggars Bush and Beggsboro', comprising a total of 1,444 dwellings, allocations were made to about 650 families previously resident in the slums.&rdquo;</P>

However, having regard to the grave difficulties which are in the way, I think the work has been very well done during the last 18 months.  I think if the Deputy makes further inquiries from the City Manager's Department he will find that <Col N="431" /> still further efforts are being made and will be made in future, until we have this slum question finally settled, and these dwellings disappear from the midst of this city.</P>

      <P>I welcome the intervention of Deputy Kelly.  I do not know that the record he has been in a position to produce is as flattering to himself and to his Party as he hoped it would be.  I gladly disown any desire to make party capital out of this business, and I assure the Deputy that if I did keep up a pretty constant stream of criticism on this question, I was quite as vocal when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office as I am now.  I will recall to the Deputy's mind, perhaps, that I began to address myself in public to this question in 1930, and I have kept up a pretty consistent demand for the investigation and rectification of the slum problem, not only in Dublin but in the other cities and in the rural areas, since that time.  Perhaps the Deputy will understand that criticism of that character is very often helpful to those who, like himself, are doing their best to expedite the clearance of the slums. The Deputy's reply to my challenge as to how many families were removed from the slums, I submit, begs the whole question.  He first gave us an estimate of the number of families who were removed from tenement houses. He then says they were transferred to housing schemes in Marrowbone Lane and Mary's Lane.  A great part of the objection that I have to the present system of dealing with this problem is that we are taking the people out of one tenement and putting them into another.</P>

In reply to that, Deputy Kelly referred me to Cabra, Marrowbone Lane, Mary's Lane, Beggars Bush and <Col N="433" /> Beggsboro'.  So far as Cabra is concerned, I doubt very much if many tenement dwellers have moved to Cabra.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I had put it to the Minister that the building of other tenements was not a good remedy for the tenement problem.  As I understood, the Minister agreed with me in preferring that the residents of tenement houses should be moved thence into small individual houses of their own.  Now that this question has been raised by Deputy Kelly, I invite the Minister to say whether, in the expenditure of further large sums of money, he will exercise his predominating influence to prevent huge barracks of tenements being erected in Gloucester Street, Railway Street and in the area in respect of which the Corporation have announced their intention of going ahead with slum clearances in the immediate future.  If we are going to have a huge slum colony established on the site of the existing slums, then instead of improving the situation, we are going to make it far worse.  The tragic aspect of the situation is that, if it is made worse now, not in our generation will it be set to rights.  In my opinion, the construction of another slum of tenement flats in that area will be one of the greatest crimes that could be perpetrated against this country.  Before that work is embarked upon, counsel should be taken and the whole situation <Col N="434" /> reviewed.  This question arose on the point as to the necessity for re-enactment of the Rent Restrictions Act.  I feel deeply on this question.  I realise that I have not liberty to discuss it at length now.  But I do urge most strongly that the Minister, before he allows Dublin Corporation to build another huge slum in the middle of this city, should set up a competent commission to inquire into the matter. If there are men so dead to their sense of public duty as to create slums in the middle of the city in this age and generation, the Minister should exercise his powers to clear these men out of office and put in men who are competent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All I am asking is that he take steps&mdash;he has plenty of time&mdash;to secure that this money will be properly spent and the poor decently housed.  To do that, a commission should be set up which would give him expert advice and, if need be, give the members of Dublin Corporation expert advice.  If they resist that advice or set that advice at defiance, I should not hesitate to recommend the Government to take over their functions and place them in the hands of a competent Minister of State.  This is a grave problem and it ought to be met in a courageous way.  If the local housing authorities do not deal with it with prudence, it should be placed in the charge of a Minister responsible to this House. If the present policy is to be pursued by Dublin Corporation and other Corporations, the sooner housing is taken <Col N="435" /> out of the control of the local authorities and put in the hands of a Minister responsible to this House, the better for this country.</P>

In what I now say, I am not prompted by political motives.  What Deputy Dillon said last week, he said not as a member of the Corporation, but as a member of this House.  I, as a member of the Corporation, know, and Deputy Kelly knows, that the slum dwellers who have been accommodated in the last one and a half or two years are accommodated in houses built under schemes that were in progress before the present Government came into office.  I do not want to get any kudos for the old Government by saying that.  I say it as a matter of correction.</P>

    <P>I went on to urge the responsible Minister or a Deputy to produce a contradiction of that contention.

      <P>I did feel like, and I admit it, using strong language in reference to the statement on the housing situation in Dublin&mdash;the tenement situation.  Nothing like what is necessary has been done in Dublin.  I know that as well as the Deputy and probably as well as most of the people in the House.  Nothing adequate to the situation has been done; but it is certainly untrue to say that no tenemen dweller has been taken out within the last year or year and a half, and the Deputy knows that.  One other Deputy spoke on the question of combined purchasing last week and he also made a statement which, so far as my information goes, was very far from being true.  He made a statement, with regard to the Local Government Department, that he had called the attention of the Department to certain irregularities by local government officials in connection with purchases made under the Combined Purchasing Act and that the Department had refused to make investigations in the case.  That statement is not correct. The Deputy referred to&mdash;I do not know if he is in the House&mdash;did in a general way bring some cases to the notice of the Department.  He referred in a general way to abuses that were committed by officials of local authorities. He gave no details that would help us to identify these officials and we could not find any evidence that the Combined Purchasing Act had been wrongly used by officials.  We would be very happy if he or any other Deputy would give us detailed information that would enable us to trace offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Combined Purchasing Act has been criticised.  I often criticised it myself and other Deputies in my Party criticised it.  While I criticised it in days gone by, I was always prepared to admit that, taking it all in all, it was a good scheme and I am still satisfied it is a good scheme.  It has saved money, thousands of pounds, to local authorities and to the ratepayers in general.  One additional tribute to the scheme that we are able to <Col N="440" /> announce is that the Grangegorman Board has, during the last week or two, agreed that they can now purchase through the Combined Purchasing Department many items, running into a large sum of money, that heretofore they used not purchase through the Department.  They are giving full adherence to the scheme and are prepared to make their purchases of quite a long list of articles in future through the Department. The Grangegorman Board is a board that has, to my own knowledge, been very well run from the point of view of its purchases and contracts.  The members of it have been business-like in their methods.  In former times, I believe, they made good contracts and they now find they can do better, certainly with regard to a very long list of contracts, by taking these goods through the Combined Purchasing Department.  I think that is a tribute to the work of the Department, coming from a well-managed board like the Grangegorman Board.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there was any other point of importance referred to last week.  There was, however, a reference by Deputy Dillon to the Labourers Acts.  These Acts are necessary; they are the basis of the schemes for labourers' cottages.  Deputy Dillon asked about the tenure of labourers' cottages and the possibility of a purchase scheme.  The matter of a scheme for the purchase of labourers' cottages is under consideration.  Reports were received during the summer from the Committee that was set up but we have not yet had the final conclusions of the officials of the Department who are examining the matter.  The recommendation of the Committee set up by us was that a purchase scheme should be adopted.  When we have the criticisms of the officials concerned in order they will be laid before the Executive Council, but until then I am not in a position to say whether the purchase scheme will be adopted by the Executive Council and put before this House or not, or what the nature of the scheme if adopted will be.  I think Deputy Dillon may take it that in case a purchase scheme is put to this <Col N="441" /> House for adoption or if legislation for that purpose will be put to the House that every proper means will be taken to secure the tenure of the houses to those who do not wish to make use of the purchase scheme.</P>

      <P>It is unusual to experience at the hands of a Minister such unparalleled discourtesy as I have experienced to-day and that discourtesy tends to make one unable to discuss the question with the detachment one would like.  If the Minister had only referred to Volume 50, No. 1, column 26, of the Official Debates he would have seen at once that on that occasion I asked if the Minister would consider giving the local authorities power to relax the regulations for trivial purchases.  The Minister thinks it an absurdity that I should mention the incident of the seven screws.  I myself signed an invoice not later than yesterday for one penny.  This invoice was issued in connection with the central purchasing arrangement.  It took twopence to send that account to the man who got it.  It took another twopence to send it back to us.  It took twopence to forward it to the local authority; twopence to fill the check and twopence to send it back to us.  That is 10d.  altogether.  That was actually expended over a matter of 1d.  Why should it be necessary to spend that much public money without ministerial endorsement?  My suggestion to the Minister was that he should consider authorising local authorities to spend trivial sums without reference to the schedule of prices provided by the Central Purchasing Department.</P>

I think he knows that the store keepers have to deal with the stores ordered under the purchasing system; if the store keeper has any doubts in his mind that the goods are not up to sample, the local authorities send the sample up to the Central Purchasing Department, and they compare it to see if it is up to the standard sample in the office. One criticism I used to make long ago, before coming into office, was as to <Col N="443" /> the delay that used to take place when samples were sent from the country to the head office.  It sometimes took weeks.  I do not know if that has been rectified since, but I have heard no complaints.  Samples come up every day in the week to headquarters, and these samples are tested and compared with the standard samples held at headquarters. If the sample sent up is not up to the standard sample the store keepers are so advised.</P>

    <P>Deputy Dockrell proposed a series of amendments on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  The purpose of them was to remove from the Bill the discretion given to the Minister in respect to the holding of inquiries and the variation of harbour rates.  Since the Committee Stage, I have had an opportunity of meeting the representatives of harbour boards and of shipping interests. Various suggestions in connection with the Bill were discussed.  Two in particular were made.  The first was to the effect that where it was proposed to make an Order varying the maximum or actual rates in respect to any harbour a local inquiry should be held, if the local harbour authority so requested.  The second was the suggestion which is now embodied in the amendment before the House, that wherever it is proposed to make an Order varying harbour rates <Col N="445" /> notice of the intention to make that Order should be given, and that any person interested should have the right to make representations.  I decided to adopt the second of these suggestions, although at first sight it seems reasonable that, wherever a local harbour authority so requests, a local inquiry should be held, having regard to the fact that the local harbour authority itself will in any event have to pay the cost of the inquiry. It is the experience of the Department of Industry and Commerce, however, in relation to a number of the smaller harbour authorities throughout the country, that it is not very easy to get them to pay the expenses arising out of an inquiry of that kind, and that in any event it is preferable that there should be a discretion to the Minister whether a local inquiry should be held or not.  As I explained on the Committee Stage, in the majority of cases, when an application is made for the variation of harbour rates, no objection is made and no representations to the contrary are received.  In such cases it is obviously undesirable that a local inquiry should be held, whether at the request of the local harbour authority or not.</P>
    <P>The amendment that I now propose to insert in the Bill will, I think, meet all the points that were raised by the various interested parties.  It is designed to provide that where it is intended to make an order varying rates that notice must be given so that interested parties can make representations. Following on such representations, there will either be a departmental inquiry or a local inquiry.  The Minister will make up his mind concerning the representations made when he receives the observations of the officers of his Department, or the report of the person appointed to conduct a local inquiry.  I think the insertion of the amendment will meet all the representations that have been made in a manner that will ensure that the fears, which, of course, were mainly groundless, of harbour authorities will be finally removed.</P>

      <P>Last year, as Deputies are aware, we succeeded in reviving the glass bottle industry in the Saorstát. When that revival took place production was limited to green glass bottles. The company engaged in their production was operating a green glass tank only.  Since then they have made an extension by installing a white glass tank.  They are now producing all classes of bottles required, with the exception of those not subject to duty, such as bottles of a very small size or of a very special character.  In connection, however, with the green glass bottles the position is that the total output possible in the Saorstát works is larger than the total consumption in the country, and the fact that importers have cut their prices very substantially has created a position in which it is necessary to impose the minimum duty mentioned in this Resolution.  When the revival of the industry was being undertaken the price of imported beer bottles was from 21/- to 24/- per gross.  Since then the importing firms have cut prices to 9/- or 10/- per gross&mdash;that is the price exclusive of duty and exclusive of the stamping fee.  The industry elsewhere, as Deputies are aware, is highly cartalised.  All producers are secured in their home market, and obtain comparatively high prices.  They are in a position to undersell abroad wherever they get a chance, and they resort to these tactics unfailingly. The fact that since the revival of the industry here the price for imported bottles was cut by about 50 per cent., is an indication of what can be attempted, and the only way to remedy that situation is to impose, in respect of these bottles, a minimum duty, in the same manner as <Col N="448" /> we had to impose a minimum duty upon certain other articles recently. The present price charged for Irishmade glass bottles is lower than the price at which these bottles were imported before their manufacture was undertaken here.  Whether the price can be further reduced, following the imposition of this duty, is a matter that can be investigated.  It is to be assumed that, with the whole of the market reserved and the output considerably increased in consequence, some reduction in price should be possible.  However, as I have said, the position is that the price now being charged is lower than the price prevailing before the duty was imposed.</P>

      <P>In connection with the Minister's statement on this Resolution, I am very glad to be able to say that, in my experience, the products of the Ringsend Glass Bottle Company are of a very high quality and, in fact, that they are of a quality very much higher than that of the old Continental bottle that used to come in to the Saorstát.  It is true to say that the green glass bottle is being sold by the Ringsend Company at a price not in excess&mdash;certainly not materially in excess&mdash;of what it could be bought at prior to the imposition of the duty.  I do not think, however, that the Minister could quite stand over the statement that clear glass bottles are being sold at as low a price as they used to sell at.</P>

      <P>In fact, to green glass bottles.  I see.  As I was saying, here is a product of an Irish factory, heavily protected, which is being sold at a reasonable price, but I think that if the Minister would tender a little paternal advice to the factory on the subject of clear glass bottles he would be doing a public service.  So far as quality is concerned, it is very good. The quality of these bottles, is much better than that of the Continental bottles, and I should say that it is as good as that of any British bottles of the same class.  The price, <Col N="449" /> however, is still a bit out of the way and I think that, with a practical monopoly of the Irish trade, they ought to be able to come a little closer to a competitive price than they are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that there is a difficulty in that connection.  The only class of bottle used in huge quantities here is the standard beer bottle.  In the case of the small bottles the number of orders here is very small compared with that of other countries and, in any case, I think we must be reconciled to a higher price here because of the smallness of the orders prevailing here as compared with elsewhere.  So that, while we should certainly look into the matter of price in order to make sure that there is no undue profit taking&mdash; and I do not believe there is&mdash;I should like to say that the price of that class of bottle will probably be higher in any event because of the limitation of the market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this matter I shall give the Minister a piece of information and I invite him to investigate its accuracy.  Take the case of &ldquo;Baby&rdquo; bottles.  I am informed&mdash;and I would be glad to be corrected if I am wrong&mdash;that a person or a firm, who desired to provide their customers with these glass bottles without taking a profit on the transaction because they were in the whiskey business, offered to buy from the Ringsend Glass Bottle Company something like 100 gross at 14/-, on condition that they would be allowed to pass that on to their customers in smaller quantities at that price, and were informed by the Irish manufacturer that unless they would charge the Glass Bottle Company price per gross which, I think, is 16/-, the Glass Bottle Company would not be prepared to supply the bottles at all.  The figures I mentioned are 14/- and 16/-, but the correct ones may be 16/- and 18/-.  However, I think that where you have a monopoly it is not right for the factory to impose such conditions when they are offered a 100 gross order.  The matter will bear investigation <Col N="450" /> and I should be glad to be corrected if my information is inaccurate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The duty which was imposed by Emergency Order, which is being confirmed by this Resolution, applies to women's outer garments. This time last year, the women's ready-made industry was only in its beginnings.  I recollect speaking here during some of the discussions on the matter at that time, and indicating that comparatively little progress had been made in that industry&mdash;certainly, nothing like the progress that was made in the men's ready-made industry. A number of firms, however, had started in a comparatively small way, but during last winter very considerable developments took place, and there are now about 20 firms in the Saorstát engaged in the industry&mdash; some of them on a very substantial scale indeed.  These firms were manufacturing throughout the summer and, as is the custom, making for stock in order to supply the winter demand. They found, however, at the beginning of the winter, that to a large extent they were having difficulties in disposing of their stocks.  In one place a factory was temporarily closed and, altogether because of the accumulation of stocks, from 150 to 200 people became disemployed.  That accumulation of stocks was due to two causes. One of these causes was the abnormally fine summer which we have had, and which lasted much longer than summers usually do in this country. The buying season opened very late, and that was the position not merely in this country, but also in Great Britain.  There had accumulated, therefore, vast stocks of these goods in Great Britain as well as here, and some of the firms in Great Britain were proceeding to get rid of these stocks by dumping them into this country or anywhere they could get a market for them.  Another reason why the firms were finding difficulty in disposing of stocks was the tendency, which still <Col N="452" /> prevails amongst the buyers, particularly of the larger retail houses, to order supplies from abroad and not to consider the goods available to them from native factories.  I should like to refer, particularly to that aspect of the case, because it applies more in relation to this industry than to others. A number of the buyers&mdash;particularly buyers of the larger houses&mdash;have shown no inclination whatever to get their requirements from the native factories, although, I think, everybody who has examined the position impartially is prepared to testify that the native manufacturers are producing goods which, for price, design and quality, are as good as those available anywhere.  I can mention, perhaps, a particular incident that occurred in order to illustrate my point.  The proprietor, or managing director, of a certain firm here, engaged in the production of these ladies' garments and also with connections with an English warehousing company, invited a number of Saorstát buyers to inspect his stock of winter goods produced in his Dublin factory.  He could not get any orders from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an experiment he arranged to have a certain number of those lines submitted, from an English warehouse, to the same buyers, put the price up 5/- above that of the Dublin factory and sold them all.  Instances like that, which have occurred, indicate the difficulties that native manufacturers have to contend with.  These difficulties are much greater in relation to this particular trade than others.  In order to check that, and to secure that the attention of buyers in Irish houses would be directed to the stocks in Irish factories, we increased by Emergency Order the duty from 40 per cent. to 60 per cent.  The effect of the increased duty has been to procure that result, and although there are still stocks to be cleared, nevertheless, the position has been considerably eased. The duty applies also to garments made of fur in respect of which there have been substantial developments, and existing firms are now able to supply all the requirements of the country.  The increasing of this duty will permit us to reconsider the <Col N="453" /> position in respect of the cloths used by some of the manufacturers of the cheaper garments.  Heretofore we had permitted these manufacturers to import these cheaper cloths free of duty under licence.  That position may have to continue for some little while, but we are anxious to use the power now possessed in order to secure as wide a production of the cloth used by those manufacturers as possible in Saorstát mills.  While the lower margin of duty operated, having regard to the nature of the competition these clothing firms had to meet, it was not easy to take positive steps to that end, but with the increasing of the duty it will be possible, and we will consequently have not merely an improved position in this industry, but, possibly, increased production in another industry as well.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Dáil that there is no reason to doubt that existing firms will be able to supply the requirements of the country.  Under the auspices of my Department a conference with representatives of these firms took place.  Their productive capacity was actually measured, and we received, from a number of them, the very definite assurance that they would proceed at once with the extension of their premises, and the installation of new machinery required, to provide, not merely the quantity, but also the great range of varieties required in these goods.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why the buyers of this country are inclined to go abroad is that they have a much wider variety to select from.  Ordinarily they only purchased one or two samples of each design in ladies' overcoats.  If we are to develop industry here we must be satisfied with a smaller range of designs, but subject to that the designs produced here are very good.  I had some doubts on the subject and had investigations carried out and was myself astonished at the great range of designs and patterns now produced.  I do not think that any difficulty upon that score will arise even though we may produce a lesser range than was formerly available. But the position is that we will have sufficient variety to provide <Col N="454" /> for all tastes.  We will have excellent quality and workmanship and we will have prices lower than those at which the same goods can now be sold subject to the duty. There need not be any cause of complaint in any quarter, and if any young woman fears to meet another woman in the street wearing the same sort of dress she will have to remember that though her pride might be hurt she is really suffering for the good of the country.</P>

I am sure they would suffer anything for their country, that they would be prepared to lay down their lives for their country, but I cannot imagine either of them wearing the same coat as their neighbour.  I believe the Minister was never brought into contact with a lady selecting her coat or he would not compliment himself upon the wide variety existing in the Saorstát.  Let me hasten to say that there are some manufacturers in the Saorstát who turn out admirable ladies' coats.  But the Minister is doing himself disservice, and doing the manufacturers a disservice in reviving the old fallacy that Irish buyers have a predeliction to buy outside Ireland.  That is all nonsense.  The Irish buyer is as astute and able in his or her business as the American or the British buyer.  He buys the best value he can get no matter where he can get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that he found in the late October accumulations in the warerooms of the Saorstát manufacturers of women's outdoor wear. He attributed that to two reasons: First that the buying system was arranged late, but that won't wash. People do not buy ladies' wear for retail distribution in winter; they are usually bought in July.  No buyer of that merchandise goes out to buy when the weather gets cold.  Many of them have their buying done in the summer holidays.  If a buyer in a big retail store waited for the winter, and until the weather got cold to choose his stock he would not hold his job <Col N="455" /> very long.  And I think the Minister will agree that if it was repeat orders he was getting uneasy about, then, he was getting uneasy much too soon if he got uneasy in 1932 in the month of October.  He could not expect repeat orders until the middle of November.</P>
    <P>The second reason he gave was the inclination to buy abroad.  That is pure delusion.  The Minister knows as well as we know, that while there are good men in the trade, there were other men who rushed into the trade, and deliberately made skimpy garments. A great deal of that was thrown back on their hands, and there was a great deal of trouble.  One man of that sort, in a trade, can do more damage than a dozen good men can repair.  And there are good men, and competent men in trade in Ireland at the present moment.  The real reason for the accumulation&mdash;and there was a very heavy accumulation&mdash;which taxed the capital of some enterprising men is that the buying power in the country is waning.  In rural areas, where I think it would be true to say the bulk of the ready-made coat trade is done, the first thing people will economise on is clothing.  When women found that eggs were not making the usual return, or that the ordinary commodities they had to dispose of were not making the usual return, they made up their minds to make their winter coat do another year.  You had and have a serious contraction in retail buying power all through the rural parts of Ireland.  The first commodity that contraction hits is women's outside wear.  The Minister may make up his mind that no tariff, no matter how high, is going to overcome that difficulty.  The only way to overcome it is to restore the buying power of the women.  If that is done they will buy the coats quickly enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there is no use in painting a picture too brightly. He said that for price, design and quality the Irish manufactures are as good as anything else.  That is true of a certain grade, but where you are dealing with a woman's coat that retails at 15/- or 20/- the Irish manufacturer cannot deliver the goods.  He <Col N="456" /> does not get the bulk demand which makes it possible to manufacture a woman's coat for retail sale at 15/- to 20/- unless he produces it under sweated conditions.  Unless he gets juvenile girls, and works them long hours for bad pay in inadequate premises he cannot produce the type of coat that comes from Leeds and the centres of the women's cheap outer wear industry in Great Britain.  I remember suggesting to the Minister at one time that he ought to exempt from the operation of the tariff any coat, the delivered price of which in Dublin was say below 13/-, because that is a commodity which is bought exclusively by the poor.  No manufacturer will ever be able to produce it here under decent working conditions, because he is not getting sufficient orders to make it economically possible for him to do so.  The admission of a cheap garment of that kind would not interfere with the kind of trade which provides desirable work for female labour in this country. A woman who wants to spend three, six or eight guineas on a coat is not going to take a coat the retail price of which is £1.  It does not interest her. Nobody would dream of submitting it to her.  You can, therefore, maintain your three, four, six or eight guinea coat trade intact, and at the same time let in the cheap coat which is made by mass production methods in the industrial centres of Great Britain. That would secure for our girl coatmakers in this country decent employment at a fair wage, and obviate the conditions which do obtain in one or two clothing factories in the City of Dublin.  Those conditions are no credit to the industry, and I have no doubt the Trade Board Inspectors will come across them in due time, and be forced to deal very drastically with them.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the imposition of this duty, because the duty which was already in operation was&mdash; despite what the Minister said&mdash; virtually prohibitive.  I think the Minister should consider what effect his tariff policy, of which this is an integral part, is having on commodities which are exclusively used by the poor. In so far as this tariff hits the 12/- or <Col N="457" /> 13/- coat&mdash;I am now quoting wholesale prices&mdash;it is on a par with the tariff on cotton hose to which I referred on another occasion, and with the tariff on cotton underwear for men.  It simply imposes a burden on the poor, although, in my opinion, providing no adequate return for Irish industry.  I believe that the Minister ought to seriously consider that side of his tariff policy, and see if he cannot relax the operation of tariffs on low grade commodities which the poor must have, without in any way interfering with their efficacy as regards their application to commodities which are required by the middle and wealthier classes of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong the discussion, but there are one or two points arising out of Deputy Dillon's remarks to which I should like to refer.  It is true that the retail buyers place their orders for their winter goods with the British firms in July.  My complaint is that they will not do that with the Irish firms.  They send orders to an Irish factory and expect the goods by return.  The complaint I have received is that it is impossible to get the retail buyers to place their orders with Irish firms at a reasonable time as they do with the British firms.  I know from personal experience that that is so in relation to other industries as well. Definite instances have been brought to my notice recently in relation to other industries.  It is true also that it would be impossible to produce some of the goods imported into this country at the price at which they are imported, unless we are prepared to have very poor conditions of labour in the industry, because those imported goods are the product of sweated conditions.  The clothing trade, particularly in Great Britain, is so organised that the conditions in it are much worse than anything we would tolerate here.  The difficulties of the Saorstát manufacturers arise out of the fact that they are required by regulations made under the Trade Board Acts to pay rates of wages which are substantially higher than those which have developed in recent years <Col N="458" /> in Great Britain.  That is a situation which will no doubt adjust itself, because it is evident that in Great Britain also action will be taken to prevent the development of those conditions.  They are reminiscent of the conditions which existed very many years ago, and which were removed at that time by action of the law and of public opinion.</P>
      <P>I think we can be satisfied that, while there is undoubtedly point in Deputy Dillon's remark that certain Irish manufacturers, in their haste to get into the market at first, did not produce goods of the quality they might have produced, they have been made to realise their mistake, and are getting to the point where they can produce goods of a very satisfactory quality indeed.  Some of the manufacturers were wise enough to realise the wisdom of beginning properly, but others allowed their cupidity to get the better of their sense.  However, these manufacturers have learned the lesson which all those who adopt that policy are bound to learn sooner or later, and in this industry in particular I think we can be satisfied with the progress made and with the standard and quality which have been achieved.</P>

    <P>(c)  The following sub-paragraph shall be inserted in paragraph 6 of the said Third Schedule in lieu of sub-paragraph (b) now contained in that paragraph, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  any vehicle which is used as a public service vehicle within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act, 1933 (No. 11 of 1933), and was registered in Saorstát Eireann on the 21st day of April, 1926, as a hackney carriage within the meaning of section 4 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1888, and has an engine of the same specification and design as any class of engine for the time being entitled to the benefit of the foregoing paragraph (a)... £12;</P>

    <P>(2)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> This Resolution provides for reductions in regard to the tax on motor vehicles which fulfil certain conditions, and also provides for redrafting certain of the clauses of the Finance Act, 1926.  The reductions it is proposed to grant are, first, to provide that for all private motor cars assembled as to body and chassis in Saorstát Eireann, in accordance with a definition to be furnished by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which exceeds 16 horse power a maximum tax of £16 shall be leviable.  It is proposed to give effect to that intention by paragraph 5 of the Resolution. It is also intended to provide that, for all commercial vehicles, exceeding 20 cwts. unladen, and not exceeding 25 cwts, which are assembled as regards body and chassis in Saorstát Eireann, in accordance with a definition again to be furnished by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, a duty of £20 per annum shall be leviable.  It is proposed to have that by paragraph (b) of the Resolution.</P>
    <P>The Resolution also seeks to re-define the term &ldquo;hackney vehicle&rdquo; to be applied to public vehicles under the Road Traffic Act, 1933 in (a), (b), (c), (d), (e).  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will deal with the reasons which have actuated him in requiring a reduction of the duties on motor vehicles.  I would like to say a word by way of explanation of the proposals to re-define &ldquo;hackney vehicles.&rdquo;  The present definition of hackney vehicles is derived from an Act passed in 1888, and is unsuitable to present conditions.  This definition, by the exclusion or elimination of a class of private cars which, under this Resolution, would in certain circumstances be granted a reduction of the duty, is not defined in the Act, or in any other Act, since private motor cars constitute the residue, after all other classes, such as hackneys, commercial cars, and goods carrying cars, have been dealt with.  Consequently the narrow scope of the hackney class results in a too wide definition of the private motor class.  It is proposed in the Resolution to give a concession to private cars assembled in the Free State.  It is very desirable that the <Col N="462" /> class of private car should be limited correctly when the concession is being given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The two main changes effected by this Resolution are in the form of remission of duties.  It is in that respect different to the other Resolutions.  Although the Resolution provides for remission of duties it is not anticipated, on the whole, that it will result in a reduction of revenue. However, that is another consideration. In the first place it is proposed to levy a duty at the rate of £20 on a commercial vehicle which does not exceed, unladen, 25 cwts.  At the present time there is a duty of £16 on the vehicle which is 20 cwts., and which rises to £30 upon a vehicle not exceeding 30 cwts.  There is, therefore, a jump from £16 to £30 in the duty payable on a car which has an unladen weight of 20 cwt. and a car unladen of 21 or 22 cwts.  The position is that some 18 months ago, when the customs duty was imposed, it effectively prohibited the importation of bodies for commercial vehicles.  The manufacture of these bodies is now being undertaken in this country, but, with this difference, that the bodies produced here are, in the main, coach built, whereas the bodies used more extensively elsewhere are of steel construction, and weigh less.  We have definitely used the powers possessed under various Finance Acts in order to encourage the production of wooden bodies for commercial vehicles, as against steel bodies, because they can be produced within the country.  It has been found very difficult, if not impossible, to get Irish built bodies erected for a standard chassis under 20 cwts. which would entitle the car to the £16 instead of the £30 duty. The effect of the existing taxation position was, therefore, definitely to discourage the construction of these bodies in this country.  In fact there has been a falling off in the number of registrations of that type of car with, of course, an increase in the number registered up to 30 cwts. and the number registered as being under 10 cwts.  The effect of the change proposed is to impose an intermediate rate of duty of £20 on a car between <Col N="463" /> 20 and 25 cwts. unladen weight, subject to the condition that the body and the chassis are assembled in this country.  For the time being the concession is confined to two makes of cars, but there is reason to believe after the operation of the concession, that the number of types of commercial vehicles completely assembled in this country will be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second change imposes a maximum horse power tax upon a private car which is assembled as to body and chassis in this country.  The effect will be to encourage the assembly here of high powered cars.  The reason why we make this change is that American motor car manufacturers are showing more interest in the position created by the different duties here than British car manufacturers.  We have held the position for a considerable time so that the makers of the different cars in more general use here would have availed of the opportunities afforded in the market, if prepared to conform to Government policy.  They have not done so to any extent.  American manufacturers have, however, shown certain enterprise in this direction, and there is reason to believe that others will come in.  Consequently, we propose to give this concession, and this additional inducement to the higher powered cars which they make, so that they will not be at any disadvantage in respect of tax, over the ordinary type of car heretofore used in this country.  There will be a maximum tax of £16.  Cars up to 16 horse power will pay £1 a unit.  Any cars over 16 horse power will only pay £16 tax. That again is subject to the condition that they are assembled here as to body and chassis, and in accordance with whatever definition of assembly may operate from time to time at the discretion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is the intention to give these concessions in respect to cars assembled on what is known as the knock-down chassis. We have a three-tier duty operating in respect to motor duties.  There is no duty on unassembled parts. There is a low rate of duty operating <Col N="464" /> upon certain assembled parts which are defined in the Finance (No. 4) Act of last year, and there is a higher duty applying to the assembled chassis or other assemblies.  Cars which are assembled subject to importation at the intermediate rate of duty of the parts enumerated in the Finance (No. 4) Act of last year will be entitled to receive this concession here, at any rate for some time to come.  Perhaps at some later date we may decide that all parts of the chassis shall also be assembled here.  But that day is a considerable distance ahead.</P>
    <P>The effect upon our Road Fund will not be very substantial at the beginning, although it may, after a lapse of time, have the effect of increasing rather than decreasing this revenue, in so far as there will be a wider use of higher powered cars, subject to the £16 tax, by people who would ordinarily have purchased lower horse power cars, subject to a lower tax.  The concession in respect of these cars as in the case of commercial vehicles applies for the time being only to two firms, but we hope that the number of such firms taking advantage of it will be increased in due course.</P>

      <P>(1)  That where, on the taking out of a licence under Section 13 of the Finance Act, 1920, for a mechanically propelled vehicle, the excise duty chargeable on such vehicle under the said Section 13 as amended by subsequent enactments has been duly paid and at any time while such licence is in force&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such vehicle is used in a condition or manner or for a purpose which would, if it was used solely in that condition or manner or for that purpose, render it chargeable with the said duty at a higher rate than the said rate at which such duty was so paid, and</P>
      <P>(b)  such vehicle as so used is in all other respects a vehicle chargeable with the said duty at such higher rate,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> the said duty shall become and be chargeable on such vehicle at such higher rate.</P>
    <P>(2)  That whenever any person so uses a mechanically propelled vehicle that the excise duty chargeable thereon under the enaotments mentioned in the foregoing paragraph of this Resolution becomes chargeable under that sub-section on such vehicle at such higher rate as is mentioned in the said paragraph, such person shall, unless such duty has been paid at such higher rate before the commencement of such user, be guilty of an offence and be liable on summary conviction thereof to an excise penalty of whichever of the following sums is the greater, that is to say, twenty pounds or three times the difference between the amount of the said duty paid on such vehicle on the taking out of the said licence therefor and the amount of the said duty at such higher rate.</P>
    <P>(3)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Resolution, which I presume I may take as read, is to provide that where a mechanically propelled vehicle is licensed in one class and used in a manner rendering it liable for duty in a higher class, it shall be liable to a duty at the higher rate and failure to pay such duty shall be an Excise offence.  It has been ascertained that at present the owner of a mechanically propelled vehicle can be prosecuted for not licensing the vehicle, but it is not certain that he would be amenable to penalties if he used the vehicle for purposes for which it has not been licensed and for which it would be liable to a duty at a higher rate.  A provision to the effect which I have just recited was enacted in the British Finance Act of 1922, but this section has no force at present in Soarstát Eireann, and it is proposed to give effect to the same principle here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this motion has covered a good deal of ground and has occupied a good deal of time.  I would say at the outset that I hope that I will not occupy too long a time.  Some of the avenues into which this debate has wandered have rather mystified the House and, perhaps, it would not be any harm if we came back to the motion and approached it from a non-Party point of view.  Not having the advantage of belonging to either of the big Parties, I suppose they cannot accuse me of trying to secure Party gain from the motion.  I would rather approach it from the standpoint of a humble farmer representing an agricultural constituency and seeking to examine it from that standpoint and also to make some comment on some of the assertions that have been made.  The motion reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil condemns the action of the Government in reducing the total of the grants payable for the relief of rates on agricultural land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Why does the motion set that out? Why does it condemn the action of the Government?  I should like to go back to the contribution of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at an earlier stage as reported in column 2157 of the Official Reports in which he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is the duty of the central authority to help the farmers to weather this depression so that they will be able to take advantage of any trade revival that may come about with their productive capacity unimpaired.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the same ground with the Minister <Col N="468" /> on that and I proceed to examine it from that standpoint.  Has the central authority taken the situation seriously and has the central authority examined it from the point of view of giving those who are bearing the burden and the brunt of this economic depression, as he calls it, a chance to live?  I believe that we are confronted at this time with one of the most serious economic situations in the memory of most of us in the Dáil.  It is dignified by the name of an economic war.  War is a thing in which we usually expect to have two conflicting armies dealing blow for blow, but so far as one can see, the blows in this case are all on the one side, or, at least, the blows that are given in retaliation are very weak.  The reduction of the agricultural grant amounts to £448,000.  Is this reduction reasonable?  I think that anyone who examines it in the light of agricultural conditions will say that it is not reasonable for a number of reasons.  First of all, those engaged in agriculture are less able to meet their obligations. That may be true in many countries and yet the blame need not be laid at the door of the Government, but in our case the Government, by its own act, has brought 99 per cent. of this situation upon us.  They have taken away the farmers' market and the farmers' livelihood; they have destroyed his live-stock market and they have increased his production costs.  I come from a county of small tillage farmers, and I think that if there is any county in Ireland that would delight the heart of the President it is surely ours.  I had the opportunity this year of touring a good part of the Free State and&mdash;I do not know if my calculation is right, but taking a rough and ready calculation&mdash;I believe I could find more tillage in one mile of my own county than I could find in any five miles of any other county I passed through, so that it is not because we are ranchers that I am standing up here to fight the cause. It is because we are trying to take the most we can out of the soil and to produce all the food we can for man and beast and to have an exportable surplus.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> Now we ask what is being done for us?  What has the Government done for us to help us to weather this storm of economic depression that the Minister for Industry and Commerce mentioned?  We are thankful to Providence that we have had a splendid harvest.  We have had a fairly good crop and it is well saved.  What is the prospect for us this winter?  I say, and let us be under no mistake about it, that the farmer who uses his crop in the country is making the biggest contribution to the country's wealth. Without being disparaging to anybody else, I want to say that those who simply grow oats and sell it are not farmers in the true sense of the word. We grow these things to produce more, to produce the finished article.  We have been producing pork, beef, eggs, butter and other agricultural commodities. What prospect have we of disposing of our products?  I think the Minister for Agriculture on the last day on which we discussed this motion played a very poor role as advocate for the farmer.  We looked to the Minister for Agriculture to plead our case.  Yet he talked for nearly an hour and his main arguments were to prove that we were in fact better off than the farmers in almost any other country in the world and that if we were not really well off, if we were under any disadvantage, it was counterbalanced by the reduction of the annuities to one-half.  Surely it does not take any great intelligence, either in this House or outside it, to know that we are considerably worse off.  The annuities are merely a portion nowadays of the farmer's expenditure. If we are losing one million a month&mdash;and that is a very low estimate of what we are losing in our markets&mdash;surely it cannot be counterbalanced merely by a reduction on one-half in our annuities.</P>
    <P>Then, the Minister said that he was giving us this reduction.  I think that statement was misleading.  The Government at the present time are defaulting in the payment of the annuities to Great Britain and they are not raising out of the Central Fund the reduction that they are giving to us in the annuities.  Half the annuities which it <Col N="470" /> is proposed to collect now will cover the Government's obligation to the bondholder.  The Minister for Agriculture gave us many figures to prove that we were much better off than farmers in other places.  Surely no Minister in this House has ever given us such misleading figures as he gave us on that occasion.  For instance, in regard to eggs, he told us that on the 4th November we were getting 1/8¼ here.  Then he went away to 1931 and quoted the British market.  We find that on that particular date in Northern Ireland, a district which follows agriculture much as we do here, in some districts eggs were worth 2/6 a dozen.  He quoted the price of butter, but surely butter has not a market that is free here.  It is bolstered up by the bounty, by restrictions, and it is selling at an artificial price.  He instanced the case of sheep and said that sheep were really doing very well.  This year I sold horny ewes at 15/- each.  The same ewes in Northern Ireland were making 25/-.  Then he instanced the case of fat cattle.  Fat cattle have been averaging in the Dublin market from 18/- to 23/- or 24/- a cwt.  In other markets outside here they have been averaging up to 30/-.</P>
    <P>As regards pork and pigs, surely no greater fiasco has ever happened here than in regard to the pork trade.  Take the case of our own town on the day on which the Minister spoke, not the last day but the previous day.  On that day we had 800 pigs in the Monaghan Market, from one corner of Monaghan.  The price for these pigs was from 37/- per cwt. back.  On the same day in Northern Ireland for the best pigs it was 58/6, notwithstanding the fact that there was a bounty given to those who wanted to export our pigs.  Then take the question of feeding costs and I should like to draw particular attention to that item. People do not realise what we are losing by the mixture which we are forced to use at present.  I do not make any apology for comparing our price with the price charged in Northern Ireland because I live on the Border.  Without looking for them, the prices are sent to me.  In our town previous to any restriction on the <Col N="471" /> import of maize, the price charged to us was the same as the Armagh price. We may take it that the price of ground maize per two cwt. bag was 10/-.  In the case of the mixture which we now have to use, we will say that two-thirds of the bag is worth 6/-. Then a trader has to add one-third of oats at 6d. or 6½d.  per stone&mdash; a total cost of about 2/8.  Then he has to add the cost of procuring that, the cost of mixing it, the extra cost of grinding it and the result is that whereas the two cwts. of maize meal is being sold at 10/- over the Border, we are paying 13/- for our mixture.  We are paying 3/- more for the mixture than the farmers in Northern Ireland are paying for maize meal and we are getting £1 per cwt. less for the pigs to which we feed that mixture.  Surely the Minister for Agriculture with these conditions staring him in the face ought to be ashamed to tell the farmers that we are better off than the farmers in Northern Ireland.  The people who are selling oats to-day are selling it at a very low price but the people who are feeding it are giving far more for it than for the maize meal.  Our production costs have been increased and when we have our stuff ready for the market we get a very small price for it.</P>
    <P>Take the case of cattle.  I do not stand up to speak in this House about things of which I know nothing.  On the 27th October last a friend and I marketed 20 cattle in Killalea fair in the County Armagh for the simple reason that there was no market for them in our own town.  We paid £96 duty on them at the customs station. We paid that to get on the same footing as the farmer in Northern Ireland exposing his cattle, grazed on derating land, at the same fair.  Will the Minister or any person in this House tell me that we were as well off paying our £96 on these cattle to expose them for sale there as the man who started off without paying any duty and who grazed his cattle on derated land? Only to-day I handed over a guarantee cheque to export ten cattle which will cost me £60.  Will anyone tell me that I am on an equal footing with my competitor <Col N="472" /> across the Border?  The Minister says that I am recouped by the halving of the annuities.  My annuities run into £60 per year and, therefore, I am out of pocket to the extent of the full annuity on these ten cattle.  Of course, the Minister will say that I will get the bounty.  We hope to get the bounty, but we have not got it on the cattle that we sold a month ago.  It possibly will come in time.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I have not suggested that the Minister will not send the bounty.  It may come in time. In these days, however, money is not so plentiful that one can lie out of a considerable sum of money like this and not feel the need of it, because on every hand here is a demand for money.  I merely mention these things to show some of the fallacies to which the Minister for Agriculture treated us <Col N="473" /> on this day week.  I do not suggest, and I never have suggested, that the Minister is determined to mislead the House.  But, either he has not been informed of the real situation, or else he conveyed a wrong impression.  I am giving concrete facts.  I think the fair comparison to make is to compare our situation as farmers in the Free State with other farmers who are farming like us and I cannot get any nearer comparison than that of the counties which I have to look into every day, and I know the conditions there.  It has been stated over and over again that they are not rolling in wealth in the Six Counties.  Is it not all the worse for us that they have to bear the brunt of the decline in world conditions and prices?  If we are 40 or 50 per cent. worse off, is it not all the worse for ourselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of rates, I have not to trouble making assertions that I had nothing to do with the non-payment of rates.  It is a thing I never interfered with.  I always advocate that when people can pay their just debts they should do it rather than be looking for loopholes. I am responsible for the payment of rates on a number of farms and I can tell the Minister that these rates are paid for the last half year.  But there are people in whose confidence I can trust who are thinking seriously of whether they will be able to pay their annuities or the coming rates.  Their funds are depleted.  They seem to think that the Minister for Agriculture has forgotten us and that he has quit our cause.  We are not suppliants for charity or the dole.  We are here as responsible people carrying on the basic industry of agriculture, and we hold that if agriculture is not right nothing else in this country can be right.  To take away our power to pay our rates, to raise our rates because of increased services and other things, and to reduce the Agricultural Grant by £500,000 is surely neglecting the interests of those who are working hardest in the country.  The Minister for Finance, of course, has his own troubles to make his budget balance, but we have taken it very seriously to heart that the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="474" /> should have deserted us; that he should have, during the last two weeks, deliberately gone out of his way to try and convince us that we are better off than we were before he took office. If I might put it that way, he has taken one eye out of our heads and told us we are far better with one.  If he believes what he has told us it proves that our confidence in him has been misplaced.  He has given figures which have been confusing to most of us. He has gone back a couple of years. We do not expect to get the prices of some years ago for our stock.  All we want to get is the full market price to-day and to have a chance of getting it.  If we are not going to get it, then do not make it harder for us by reducing the contribution towards the reduction of our rates.  The summing up of the situation by the Minister for Agriculture shows that he is put ting his faith in wrong things and that he is willingly allowing himself to be misled.  If he believes in what he said, all I can say is that, as Minister for Agriculture and the representative of the chief industry of the State, he is as hopeless in the job as Moses Primrose at the fair of Wakefield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to a very interesting speech from Deputy Haslett, a speech which was full of first-hand information, a speech of a man who can speak from his own personal knowledge and who, from that personal knowledge, can compare the condition of the farmer in the Twenty-Six Counties and in the Six Counties.  Deputy Haslett's figures have been rather striking.  I do not think they have come as any surprise to any Deputy who has taken a serious interest in the agricultural condition of this State.  There is, however, one thing about Deputy Haslett's speech which rather surprised me and that was his statement that he is rather disappointed that the Minister for Agriculture was taking very little interest in the well-being of the farmers.  It surprised me that it has taken Deputy Haslett so long to make that discovery, because surely anyone who has listened to the Minister for Agriculture addressing this House must have had it driven in upon him that the Minister does not <Col N="475" /> consider the agriculture needs of this country except in so far as he thinks he can identify them with the political advantages of his own Party.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture is not making any serious endeavour to benefit the Irish agriculturist.  The Minister for Agriculture, in his speeches and in his actions, is doing nothing else than seeking how he can, even for the time being, to buy votes for the Fianna Fáil Party.  We heard a speech from the Minister for Agriculture which occupied portion of two days.  Part of that speech he devoted to defence, part to attack.  I shall deal now shortly with both his defence and his attack.</P>
      <P>His defence amounts to this&mdash;that the economic war was not doing the farmers any harm.  Then he proceeds to produce figures.  In the very middle of them he admits, out of his own mouth, that so far as sheep farming and cattle farming are concerned, the economic war is doing us very grave harm.  He starts off with a proposition. He brings forward arguments, as he said, to support that proposition. Then he gives us figures dealing with the two main sources of agricultural wealth&mdash;cattle production and sheep production.  He admits, as he has to admit and as no cooking of figures could possibly hide, that this State is suffering, and suffering desperately heavily, from the effects of this economic war.  That fact is so clear, so apparent, so well-known to every person who owns a single head of cattle, grazes a single head of sheep, rears a single pig or even owns a humble hen that lays a few eggs, that it does surprise me that the Minister for Agriculture or any other member of the Fianna Fáil Party should have, I shall not say the courage, but the audacity, to get up in his place in this House and make a statement which to the knowledge of every person in this House and to the knowledge of every person who follows the debates of this House, is not in accordance with the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us, of course, that he has got certain great schemes for the improvement of the lot of the Irish <Col N="476" /> farmer.  He has got his wheat scheme. We do not hear so much at present about that sorry wheat scheme.  I await with interest the figures of wheat production even in this favourable year.  In his other scheme, dealing with oats, it must be admitted that he has failed.  And for what reason?  He has failed for this reason&mdash;that he is not aware, seemingly, that there is only one way in which an oats crop can be used.  That is, by feeding live stock with it.  If you kill your market for live stock you are killing your market for oats.  It must be so.  After all, oats is not what one would call a &ldquo;finished article.&rdquo;  It is the raw material of animal feeding and nothing else.  If you make conditions such that animals cannot be properly fed on oats, then, of course, the market for oats tumbles down to absolutely nothing. If the Minister for Agriculture were in his place during this discussion, which deals with agricultural matters, I should like to ask him how does he think that the breakdown of the horse-breeding industry, which he and his Government has brought about, affects the market for oats.  I do not believe that you could get a collection of men in Ireland who know so little about farming or agricultural conditions as the Government Front Bench.  I wonder if a single member of the Government Front Bench or if the solitary occupant of that bench at present would make even a wild shot as to how many acres of oats and hay it takes to keep a hunter in the stable for a year.  I should like to hear the solitary occupant of the Government Front Bench interject some figure, but I am positive that the solitary gentleman who is sitting over there like a pelican in the wilderness will say nothing.  In order that he may carry away something of value to him, that he may at the next meeting of the Executive Council give them a little bit of practical information, I shall tell him that the calculation made by the best authorities is that it takes something like four acres of average land to keep a single horse&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that your <Col N="477" /> Party did not believe that Irish oats were good enough for Irish horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Party believe that Irish horses should be fed on the very best, that the proper thing for us to do is to turn out the best finished product.  I am glad that, at last, I have succeeded in getting the Minister for Education to break his silence.  It takes four acres under hay and oats to provide for one hunter during a season.  Consider what that means.  If you break down, as you have broken down, the Irish horse-breeding industry, then you break down successful tillage, regarded even by itself.  We had a short time ago some of the very best animals in this country.  Those are being steadily brought out of the country.  I do not suppose that the Minister for Education knows that some of the best-known horses have been removed from the country.  Stratford, Trigo, Soldennis, and others have gone.  The presence of those three horses meant that 90 mares were being fed here. How much land is put out of cultivation here by reason of those 90 mares being fed in England?  How much does that affect the growing of oats and the market for oats here, leaving out of account altogether the number of stable men and stable boys who are flung out of employment by the breakdown of the horse breeding industry? There is where the Minister for Agriculture is.  I think he must be wilfully blind, because I cannot understand any man being blind without being wilfully blind when the matter is so plain and clear as this matter is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one way in which you can farm at least three-quarters, perhaps more than three-quarters, of this country and that is by the production of live stock and live-stock products. Nobody can now have any doubt as regards the wisdom of the policy which was put forward by the former Minister for Agriculture, now Deputy Hogan, the policy which was summed up in the jingle: &ldquo;One more cow and one more sow and one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;  Nobody can now doubt that that is the only sound and possible method of farming successfully in this country.  By all means till <Col N="478" /> as much as possible.  That has always been the policy preached from this side of the House, but till in order that you will consume the produce of your tillage on your own farm.  Produce your tillage and feed it to your live stock.  That is the sound method of farming for much more than three-quarters of this State and that is the method of farming which the present Executive Council has rendered it absolutely impossible for the Irish farmer to follow.  The net result is that you have poverty all over this State.  I do not believe you can point out a single farm out of which the owner can make his livelihood.  It was quite different a couple of years ago, but you have changed the whole economy and by your folly and your bungling, and now by what I must describe as your wilful default, you are keeping the farmers of this State in that reduced position.</P>
    <P>This motion deals primarily, though it is spread out widely, with the relief of rates.  We heard a bit of ethics, surprising even from Fianna Fáil.  I am not often surprised at any new principle of morality that I hear from the Fianna Fáil Benches.  They seem to have a new principle of morality almost every day in the week.  The only thing is that it never happens to agree with the teachings of religion. I mean the Christian religion.  It certainly does not happen to agree with the teachings of the Catholic religion. We have had a completely new morality preached here.  &ldquo;We did give you a definite promise that there was going to be derating; we pledged ourselves to that.&rdquo;  That they do not deny.  &ldquo;We have broken our pledge.&rdquo; That they do not deny.  &ldquo;We have made promises and broken those promises and we glory in it, but we say, `Oh yes, we have lied to you, but we are justified in lying to you because we are giving you something else that we think you should like better!' &rdquo; They say also, &ldquo;Yes, we have not derated, but we have given you half annuities.&rdquo;  The things stand on absolutely different footings.  The pledge was definitely given by a Party standing for power and on that pledge, amongst other pledges, they were returned to power.  That pledge has <Col N="479" /> not been kept.  Under what new principle of morality can you pledge yourself and get returned by the people on the strength and faith of that pledge and then you become the judges as to whether you are justified or not in breaking your pledged word?</P>
    <P>What right have the Government got to put half annuities as against rates?  Where is their authority for that?  The farmers have suffered at the hands of the Government, not merely from the point of view of non-derating, but from the point of view of an increase of rates which this Government have brought about. Farmers have suffered in a great number of other ways.  They have suffered the loss of the produce which they sowed by reason of the economic war. They have suffered far more than half their rates and that is a matter that cannot be controverted.  Any gain they have got by the non-payment of half the annuities must not be put against the increase which they have to pay in rates.  It must be put only as a fraction of the loss they have sustained by reason of the economic war.  Let me look at it from another point of view.  Let me take the Corn Bill.  What does that mean?  It means half a million extra on the staple food of the people.  Take any protective measure you have brought in, increasing the price of articles to the farming community, whether it be clothing, boots, tobacco, tea, sugar, any of the hundred and one articles that you have taxed.  All those things press upon the farmer, with no compensating advantage to him.</P>
    <P>If, in the interests of industrial revival, you put taxes upon articles that the farming community must pay, then there must be some recompense made to the farming community out of public funds to make up to them for the extra amount which they are paying in the increased cost of necessary articles.  I say that not as against rates, or even as against the losses in the economic war, but as a permanent recompense to the agricultural community for the increased prices that they have to pay for the articles they purchase, these half annuities should <Col N="480" /> properly be put.  As a measure of fair play and not out of charity or anything of that kind the agricultural community should not be burdened by any attempt, successful or otherwise, at industrial revival.  Therefore, the argument, poor at the best, becomes wrong in fact, with the breaking of the pledged word of the Fianna Fáil Party that they would give complete derating. And they are merely not keeping that promise, but going the other way about and increasing the amount of rates by cutting down the agricultural grant.  That cannot be met either in fact or in justice by any reduction which has taken place in the amount of the land annuities payment.</P>
    <P>On that ground I may say that over a long period of time the Minister for Agriculture charged this Party with an organised effort to prevent the rates being paid.  That statement is not in accordance with fact.  This Party has never put forward the view that the rates should not be paid.  I may say that I myself both from inside and outside this House and on more platforms than one have declared it to be my view that this country is greater than any Party; that it is the duty of every single person to look to the welfare of this country first; that no matter how incompetent the Government in itself may be; that no matter how it may muddle up the affairs of the country, the necessary services of this country must still be carried on and that in consequence the rates must be paid. I have made that clear myself in many speeches.  As a matter of fact, I once told my own constituents that not only had I paid the rates myself, but I had paid the second moiety before it was actually due.  That is the view which is the official view and the view held by every single member of this Party. Putting any view to the contrary and stating that any member of this Party holds any other view is to make a statement which is false in fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister, however, went on to state that some members of this Party were prominent in refusing to strike a rate last year and insisted on having the matter brought into court.  Why should they not have the matter brought into court?  Why should they <Col N="481" /> not have it litigated?  What are courts for?  Our courts are to do justice between private citizens and this State and to do justice between private citizen and private citizen.  If private citizens, either in their own private capacity or as members and trustees for the ratepayers of the county, think that any injustice has been done, or that any illegality has been committed, they are perfectly entitled, and it is their duty to have that litigated in the courts of justice. That is what courts of justice exist for. When the Minister for Local Government and Public Health played the trick which he did play upon the county councils of this State, when the Minister for Local Government and Public Health allowed certain county councils&mdash;I think all the county councils of this State&mdash;to strike a rate and when, after that rate was struck, said to them: &ldquo;you are not going to get the Government grant you got last year&rdquo;; when the Minister had in that fashion deceived them and tricked them, then surely it was perfectly within the competence and perfectly within the legal rights of any member of any county council to have that question threshed out in open court as to whether that trick on the part of the Minister for Local Government was a trick which ought to be carried out inside or outside the law.</P>
    <P>I do not care whether the courts decide that the Minister for Local Government had acted within his legal powers.  That is quite a different question.  Whenever there is a matter to be litigated in court, one side must win and one side must lose.  But there was a matter there to be argued. That matter was argued and the decision of the courts was taken on it. For the Minister for Agriculture to get up here and to say that it is a wrong thing to suggest that any member of the community should have any single question where he thinks he is aggrieved, litigated in the courts, shows that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has got a very strange view of what the relation of the Government is to the citizen.  When the Minister gets up here and says in effect that it is a <Col N="482" /> wrong thing for any citizen of this State to litigate a matter with the Government when that citizen thinks the Government has acted tyrannously and wrongly, then I say that that Minister has surely mistaken the powers and the duties of the Executive Council to the citizens of the country.</P>
    <P>We have it here and it cannot be denied that the farming community has been brought down to a great state of poverty and has been brought there by the action of the present Administration. This motion put forward by Deputies Belton, O'Higgins and Minch does not go very far.  It does not even say to the Government: &ldquo;You made a definite promise and you gave a definite pledge&mdash;we are asking you to keep your word.&rdquo;  To another Government, of course, an argument like that would be unanswerable.  To a Government like this an argument of that nature I know carries very little weight.  &ldquo;You have broken your pledge.&rdquo;  But what does that matter to them?</P>
    <P>All the motion is asking here is not that the Government should keep their pledge.  They are not even asked to do all that they promised.  They are asked here, having definitely pledged themselves to do one thing, at least, to let matters remain as they were.  They are asked not to alter things from what they were at the time they gave their pledge.  They are asked not to go in the opposite direction to the direction in which they have pledged themselves to go.  We get no answer.  There has been absolutely no attempt at answering. That now is how the matter stands before the House.  This Government by the course of conduct it is pursuing is doing infinite harm to the agricultural community.  Yet it is going deliberately and in the teeth of this resolution to increase the burden flung upon the farmer and flung upon him by them.  The farming community will not be fooled very long.  The farming community are not likely to be taken in very long by some of these methods which the Minister for Agriculture has put into force.  The farming community are not likely to tolerate for long the injuries inflicted on them by the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" /> The position now is that if a man has got oats at home and wishes to buy yellow meal, he has got to bring his own oats to the mill, sell it to the miller and then buy back his own oats from the same miller.  If he wants yellow meal, having plenty of oats of his own, he has got to buy somebody else's oats and somebody else has to buy his oats before either of them can get the maize meal they need.</P>
    <P>Can sane people for very long be compelled by methods of that kind by any Government to act so that obviously they must be making a loss? Can it be thought that any single farmer or any two farmers can be made rich by Farmer A being compelled to sell his oats to Farmer B through the medium of the miller, and Farmer A being compelled to buy Farmer B's oats himself through the medium of the same miller; that the farmers are going to get rich because one farmer sells his oats to another and buys back that other's oats, in both cases the seller getting less, and considerably less, by the amount of the miller's profits on what the buyer pays. It is by that ingenious method, if you please, that the Minister for Agriculture thinks he can induce farmers to believe that they are getting a market for their oats.  The result is that the Minister has got his dumps of oats all over the State.  He has got nobody to buy them, and we have got this precious scheme which has been well discussed on another occasion.</P>
    <P>I think that if there is any sincerity in the Government at all they cannot refuse to accept this motion.  If they have any sense of honour, if they believe that a man's word should be his bond, and if they believe, above all things, that when a Party pledges itself as a Party and receives consideration from the people and gets into power, and when the heads of that Party reap the benefit of their false promises, they should at least not turn round and, with a cynical disregard for all decency, not only fail to keep their word, but absolutely turn around and act diametrically opposite to the way in which they had solemnly <Col N="484" /> pledged themselves to act.  As I say, no self-respecting man could act in that fashion.  No single self-respecting person, in my judgment at any rate, could support an Executive that acts in that fashion.  We will see if even the Party loyalty of Fianna Fáil will induce them to follow the Government into the Lobby against this motion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney need not have the slightest qualms as to the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party on this issue because the Fianna Fáil Party are not in the unfortunate position of the Party opposite, which, having conducted a thoroughly disreputable campaign in the country for the past year or so, are now going before the country to wash their hands, and to tell us how contrite they are, to tell us that they never had any evil intentions as regards the non-payment of rates, and so on.  In my own constituency I know that, so far back as last September twelve months, the campaign for the non-payment of rates, and, I think, of annuities also, was in full swing there although carried on in a subterranean fashion.  But the House, since its reassembly has been treated to endless apologies from our friends on the other side.  Nothing on earth could be further from their minds than to encourage anybody not to fulfil their legal obligations in the matter of the payment of rates.  I think that our Party are in quite a different position, and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney need not have the slightest doubt as to what their attitude will be on this particular question. If the Deputy could only bring his mind back to the period of the last general election he would realise that this question of derating versus a reduction of the land annuities, which was the policy put forward by the present Government to the electorate on that occasion, was fought out up and down the country.  We had the very same type of speech then that we have had on this motion: that the Government were running away from their promises and, in particular, were running away from the promises they had given in regard to derating.  But the Deputy must know that the country <Col N="485" /> had an opportunity then of giving its verdict as to whether it was satisfied with the policy that the Government had put forward as an alternative to derating.  The policy was put forward and was accepted by the country and the Deputy and his friends cannot forgive the country and cannot forgive the working farmers of the country for having given a majority to this Party on that occasion.  Their sole purpose in public life since that vote was given to this Government has been to try to weaken and demoralise the farmers in this struggle.</P>
      <P>The Deputy talks greatly of the farmers' difficulties, but he forgets what the policy of his Party was, when in office, towards the farmer.  What was their policy in order to collect their £3,000,0000 of annuities for John Bull?  They had the full forces of the law, with all the sheriffs and bailiffs working behind them, to drag that money out of the pockets of the Irish farmers to send across to John Bull, but now that that money is being kept in the country and is being spent for the benefit of the Irish people, these gentlemen have to find a new argument, and side by side with the campaign for the demoralisation and the weakening of the morale of our farmers they tell us that the present Government have no sympathy with the farmers in their difficulties.</P>

      <P>That is the kind of constructive criticism, the kind of patriotism that we get from the Party opposite.  That is the thing, we are told, that is going to appeal to the farmers.  Well, no matter what the difficulties of the farmers may be, and they are many and great, I do not think they have yet reached the despicably low level that the Opposition places them at, or that they are prepared, in a struggle such as is on foot at present, to sell their country in order to please the Deputies opposite.  The sorry wheat scheme!</P>
      <P>The Opposition have done everything they could to throw cold water on the policy of tillage farming, on the only policy, I maintain at any rate, which offers any hope for the future, or affords any reasonable possibility of placing a larger proportion of our people upon the soil of our country. Of that policy that has been recommended by statesmen in every country and that statesmen in every country are coming back to, the Opposition, in their patriotism, can only say &ldquo;the sorry wheat scheme.&rdquo;  It means nothing to them, in a period like the present when this country must inevitably suffer some depression, must inevitably be visited by some repercussion of the world-wide fall in prices, that a Government in office, elected by the Irish people, is endeavouring, in spite of great difficulties, to alter the system and to keep all those millions of pounds, that we were sending to the foreigner every year, in an increasing proportion in circulation amongst our own people. The sorry wheat scheme!  That is the kind of puerile and destructive criticism that, I say, is unworthy of the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look across the water to-day, we will see British statesmen proclaiming that their intention is to make England&mdash;Great Britain&mdash;a self-contained <Col N="487" /> country; that their intention is, as quickly as may be, to build up British agriculture in order to enable the British farmer to supply the entire requirements, as far as he can do so, of the British market.  That policy, apparently, has no interest for the gentlemen opposite.  They profess the keenest indifference to it.  They forget to tell the Irish farmer that, so far as that particular market, about which they talk so much and which they continually harp upon, is concerned, whether we like it or not and whether the British Dominions as a whole like it or not, whether or not they are prepared to go out to-morrow to protest against it, a definitely new economic policy&mdash;a Sinn Féin policy&mdash; is in operation over there in England. The gentlemen opposite ought, at least, instead of harping upon the difficulties of the Irish farmers, to appreciate that situation and not mislead the people as they are endeavouring to mislead them into a belief that if they were in office to-morrow there would be some wonderful change, and that a treaty at Ottawa or something else like that would give back a market to the Irish farmer that would put him on the same basis of prosperity as he was on many years ago.</P>
    <P>The gentlemen opposite know very well that for many years past that market has been declining.  I am not going to waste the time of the House by reading the index figures to show how agricultural prices have declined in that market.  The gentlemen opposite know it very well, and they know that if they pick up any farming or agricultural journal there is not a portion of England or of Scotland in which the farmers, and particularly the tillage farmers, are not crying out at this moment against the low prices, in spite of the fact that this policy of a gradual control of the entire British market in the interests of the British farmer is in operation at the moment. In spite of that fact, and of the fact that every day we have further quotas, further taxes and further restrictions of imports, not only from foreign countries but from every one of the <Col N="488" /> British Dominions, we know that the British farmer&mdash;and the Opposition cannot deny it&mdash;are in a very sorry plight indeed, and say themselves that they are worse off than at any time within the remembrance of the present generation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not 40 per cent. worse off.  That is the kind of argument that Deputy Belton uses.  He is as good a mathematician, sir, as his leader, Deputy Cosgrave, who, in order to tell us how much we are losing on the economic war, adds together the amount that is being paid in tariffs plus the amount this Government is paying in bounties.  According to the reasoning of Deputy Cosgrave not alone are we losing the amount the British are collecting in tariffs, but the amount that our own farmers are getting from the bounties is a dead loss also.  In order to get the total loss he adds these two items together, and instead of £2,500,000 or £3,000,000 you get £5,000,000 or £6,000,000.  Of course, like the £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 of former years you can go on increasing it by geometrical progression until it will be as big as the sum of the famous financial agreement long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney rings the changes on the statement that the farmers are getting no compensation for the policy of industrial protection, but he does not bring forward a single example, at any rate so far as manufactured articles are concerned, in support of his contention.  It has been stated over and over again in this House that at the present moment, in spite of the fact that this policy is in operation for only a very short time, we are producing, as far as boots and shoes and clothing are concerned at any rate, not only as good a quality of article but as cheap articles as we could have got had the market been open to the dumpers of British shoddy. Gentlemen on the opposite side do not desire, I suppose, that these new factories and new industries should be closed down, and I should have thought that they would have been sufficiently ashamed of the attack that <Col N="489" /> was made on the policy of protection when it was brought in here in the budget of 1932.  Why, the country was threatened with national bankruptcy. As some speaker said, every six months we were to go bankrupt in this country.  At that time we were to go bankrupt because it would have been absolutely impossible, we were told, for this country to produce the requirements that the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Finance sought to have produced here under these tariffs. We were told that prices would rise enormously, but these arguments have been belied by the trend of prices, because there has been a steady fall in the cost of living and no evidence whatever has been forthcoming to show that there has not been a fall also in the price of manufactured articles.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies opposite, instead of going around the country, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has been doing, telling the farmers that they are suffering from increased prices as a result of tariffs, had a reasonable or a sound case, I venture to suggest that they should go to the Prices Tribunal and make their case there.  If there are examples of profiteering, there is a way to deal with them; but at this hour of the day I think that the House should not be treated to such statements as those to which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has given utterance without some concrete support in the way of evidence.  This Government has no appreciation of the difficulties of the farmers, we are told.  We told the farmers that, so far as these moneys were concerned, we would give them the largest possible reduction in the charges for which they were liable to the State.  We did give the largest reduction possible, and any money that will be collected in the future from the farmers in the way of annuities will be collected because it has to be collected in order to meet the charges under the 1923 Land Act.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies opposite stand for the policy that farmers should pay no annuities and that the taxpayer, in addition to paying what he is paying already for social services and everything else, should pay the entire <Col N="490" /> charges under the 1923 Land Act, I hope they will say so.  But somebody has got to meet the minimum charges under that Act, and we have considered that the annuitants should meet these charges.  We have considered that very carefully indeed.  &ldquo;The Government has no appreciation of the difficulties of farmers; has done nothing to compensate them for their losses; has made no effort to remedy the situation.&rdquo; I would remind Deputies, once more, that the reduction in annuities means that £2,000,000 that would have been collected from the farmers, if the late Government were still in office, every year for Great Britain, now remains in the pockets of the farmers; that as regards their annuities for a period of two gales they have been funded, and that the sum of one and a half millions in arrears which the late Government, if still in office, would have been dragging out of the farmers, is being funded; so that in addition to the actual reduction of £2,000,000 the sum of four and a half millions of arrears, which was a gripping burden upon the shoulders of the farmers in arrears, is being funded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>But the other farmers have paid that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>And in addition to that the agricultural community is still getting a reduction in rates, from the Exchequer, to the extent of one and three-quarter millions.  According to Deputies opposite, something dreadful was done to the farmers when the agricultural grant was reduced.  We must realise that, in the first place every year, until these moneys were kept in the country, those who had the audacity to put the Resolution on the Paper that we are discussing to-night, reduced this agricultural grant by £150,000 while the farmers were still paying their full annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1931-1932, when the opposite Party were in office, they took £135,000 out of the agricultural grant to make up the deficit in the Guarantee Fund, so that John Bull would get every single penny.  And these are the people who talk to-day of the difficulties of the farmers.  They forget that every year that they dragged every penny in <Col N="491" /> respect of these annuities out of the farmers they made substantial reductions, indeed, in the agricultural grant.  The result was that last year the total paid in respect of the agricultural grant was £1,812,000, while this year the amount is £1,750,000, so that, as far as the actual amounts are concerned, when you take into consideration the fact that last year and previously these sums were withheld, there is no very substantial reduction in all the circumstances.  It is something like £62,000, although the actual sum as it appeared on the Paper was £450,000.</P>
    <P>The Opposition forget also that when the Unemployment Assistance Bill was brought in it took a very heavy burden off the shoulders of the farmers.  The British Government, the wealthiest in the world, has not done as much as the Irish Free State Government has done in the matter of the new unemployment scheme now put into operation in both countries.  The rural ratepayers, although losing the £450,000, are not asked to make any contribution.  The urban dwellers and taxpayers are making the contribution for that directly as taxpayers and also as contributors under the insurance schemes. Under the Unemployment Assistance Act, although the amount contributed by the rural community is strictly limited, although the whole of that £450,000 is only a proportion of the total requirements, everybody knows we will have farmers' sons, and small farmers, up and down the country, working on the roads and so, too, coming in under that.  And everybody knows that many thousands of able-bodied men and women who swell the figures of home assistance, of which the Opposition talk so loudly, will all be brought in under the new scheme and to that extent the farmers will be relieved.  Therefore, the Government, I maintain, in spite of the Opposition, and the efforts they have made to demoralise the farmers, have successfully proved to the agricultural community as a whole, and to those who are really interested, and who really want to give the Government a chance, that we have not been negligent of <Col N="492" /> whatever opportunities we have had in doing our duty to the agricultural community. The figures are very instructive&mdash;£2,000,000 reduction in annuities, £4,500,000 in arrears funded, and £1,750,000 in agricultural grants.</P>
    <P>Again, the new unemployment assistance scheme of relief relieves the rural ratepayers of the burden of maintaining the able-bodied unemployed. In addition to that there has been very heavy and substantial expenditure in the way of grants towards education, for example, and towards housing and towards public health.  Under each of these three heads the Government is giving far greater grants, if not in respect to individual cases, at any rate the gross total is certainly far greater now under the heading even of education, than it has been under our predecessors. But in addition to that, as I have indicated, you have housing schemes and public health schemes. Deputies opposite, when they talk of the reduction in the agricultural grant, conveniently forget the additions made for unemployment assistance, and the greater increase in State expenditure given in every county in the Saorstát in respect of housing and health schemes.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need delay the House further.  But I would remind Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that when the question of Irish oats was first discussed in this House, and when a demand was made from the Fianna Fáil Benches for a tariff on foreign oats, we were told by Deputies opposite, and on the authority of a then Deputy for Westmeath, Mr. Shaw, that Irish oats were not suitable for Irish thoroughbreds and at any rate for Irish racehorses.  Now Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenny is anxious about the four acres of oats that he says will be required to feed every Irish hunter and he is afraid that we may lose these few acres.  If the Deputy, and his Party, were really patriotic and had a real appreciation of the situation, I venture to say that instead of wasting the time of the House and the country, in making these gloomy speeches and indulging in these moanings and wailings that have no reflex amongst the good Irish national farmers in the <Col N="493" /> country, they would set out to support this Government, as the people of the United States, and the people of Great Britain and every other country to-day are supporting their Governments in the present juncture to build up a self-contained, a self-reliant and comfortable and contented country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate as I think that the action of the Government will bring its own condemnation, but I should like to refer to a few statements made by the Minister for Agriculture when dealing with this motion on Wednesday evening last.  The consolation which the Minister for Agriculture offered to the farmers whom he has brought to the verge of starvation was that if there was a reduction in prices here there was a similar reduction in prices in Great Britain.  It is cold comfort for the farmers here that their neighbours across the water are badly off, but apart from that he did not mention to the farmers here that they have to bear 40 per cent. tariff on the prices.  He quoted, from I think the journal issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce, the prices prevalent during the past six or eight months.  In his quotations he reminded me of the poor woman down the country who had a pig at the fair.  A buyer came up and she asked him &ldquo;What price are pigs to-day?&rdquo;  He said &ldquo;They are 50/-,&rdquo; and she replied &ldquo;Oh, the paper is paying 56/-.&rdquo;  If the poor farmers could go by the paper they would be a little better off, but unfortunately they have to face hard men in the buyers, and have to face a competitive market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come to the prices, I shall only instance one case of a neighbour of mine in West Cork who had six yearling cattle for sale.  Those six cattle are as famous as the Clonmel heifers. He was not offered a price for them at any fair, so he decided to send them to the British market&mdash;the market of which the President said &ldquo;Thank God it is gone, it was no good.&rdquo;  Those six cattle realised in Glasgow&mdash;and the figure is authentic, as he shipped them through the Cork Farmers' Union&mdash; £44 7s. 6d.  His net return was only £5.  The cattle realised almost £7 10s. <Col N="494" /> a head&mdash;a good price.  There was a tariff of £28 on them.  Freight and insurance were normal.  If this £28 were added to the £5 it would give him a profit of £33, which would be profit out of which that man could afford to pay the rates and annuities which he had to pay&mdash;but he is deprived of that.  That case is known through the country.  As I say, those six cattle have become as famous as the Clonmel heifers.</P>
    <P>Why is it that this motion has been tabled?  Why has this year, above any other year, been chosen by the Government to reduce the agricultural grant by £500,000?  Why is it that they have, owing to their policy while in office, deprived the agricultural community of their means of livelihood and endeavoured to change the whole economic situation? As I said here in this House once before, we had established a condition of affairs here under which we were able to produce certain commodities that we could beat the world on.  We produced butter, beef, bacon, eggs and poultry.  We produced also wheat, potatoes, oats, barley, mangolds and turnips.  We fed those to our cattle. As a result we walked those commodities to the market, through our fat pigs, bonhams, cattle, poultry and so forth.  We have been deprived of the market for those commodities and we have been told to grow wheat and to grow beet.  I have nothing to say against the production of beet nor the production of wheat, but at the present time when the market value of wheat is 17/6 a bag of 20 stone&mdash;bolstered up by the Government bounty it would be about 23/6&mdash;we are faced with a rate that is heavier than the rackrents which our grandfathers had to face 100 years ago.  A hundred years ago, when they were rack-rented and had no rates to pay, they were getting £3 a bag for wheat.  We are supposed to pay a rate greater than the rackrent which our grandfathers paid to the landlord, and to pay it out of the price of wheat at 17/6 a bag.  Those are the conditions to which the Government have brought the farming community through their foolish, mad policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> They have also compelled us to change our system of feeding.  In my own constituency recently a mill-owner told me that he was able to buy maize at £4 10s. a ton.  After grinding that maize he could sell it at £6 a ton.  The farmers were compelled to sell oats at £5 and come and buy their oats back mixed with maize at £7 4s. a ton. That is an increase of £1 4s. a ton that the farmer has to pay for a job which he could do much better himself. There is no miller or anybody else who would know how to mix the stuff as well as the farmer.  There is a pig feeder in my town who is, on that particular thing alone, losing £800 a year.  Not alone is he losing that directly but owing to the feeding value being inferior he is losing more time in the production of his pigs.  That £800 a year would be distributed amongst the producers of young pigs through the country, and he could afford to pay a better price to producers of the young pigs.  When the Government were seeking office they promised full derating of agricultural land.  They also promised to withhold the annuities.  They have withheld the annuities, but at this terrible cost.  This is the derating that they give us.  This is the promise fulfilled!  Instead of giving us derating they reduce the amount of the agricultural grant by half a million pounds.

      <P>That is another one of the ridiculous statements.  However, I will not say any more about that. The Deputy is a representative of the agricultural community.  He knows all about it.  The other Deputies are not here.  I doubt if there is a farmer amongst the Fianna Fáil Deputies who will go to his constituency and tell the farmers, as the Minister for Agriculture stated, that they are as well able to pay their rates now as they <Col N="496" /> were two years ago.  That was tried by Deputy Corry.  I do not see him here now.  The Deputy tried it in his constituency a few months ago, after the start of this debate, but he is not here now.  He made a speech about it then.  The Deputy will not make any further references to it in East Cork.  A great deal has been said about a conspiracy not to pay rates.  There is no such thing on the part of the farming community. The Minister for Education referred to the demoralisation of the farmers.  It is the Minister's Party that has brought about demoralisation, because the credit of the farmers was sound until this Government came into office.  Farmers always paid their way and paid 20/- in the £.  They were able to pay it.  They always paid their rates and their annuities.  It is only when this Party came along and preached: &ldquo;Pay no rates; pay no annuities&rdquo;&mdash;publicly preached dishonesty&mdash;that there has been any demoralisation.  It is they demoralised the farmers, if there is any demoralisation.  The farmer is an honest man, and a decent man, too, and he is going to pay his way, when we get another Government into office that will bring back our markets and restore prosperity.  The farmer will then pay 20/- in the £.  The Minister for Education should be ashamed to talk about demoralisation, because it is he and his Party that preached and brought it about.  The actions of the Government would bring about their condemnation without any motion of this kind being tabled.  That condemnation is growing and when the next election comes this Government will realise the mistake they made&mdash;when it will be too late.  However, it will be a lesson for this country when, once and for all, we get rid of this Government. We have been taught a lesson &mdash;probably we deserve it&mdash;but we will be rid of them and we will be able to restore normal conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting this motion.  The action of the Government in reducing the total of the grant payable for the relief of rates on agricultural land has had a two-fold effect.  In the first place it brought <Col N="497" /> about the impoverishment of the Irish farmers by depressing our main industry; and secondly, it brought about a corresponding depression in the towns and cities.  Speaking as a representative of a borough which embraces a city population and a large agricultural or farming population and as one having almost daily contact with farmers in that area, it has been represented to me by most of those farmers that never in living memory have they experienced, or has that important industry experienced, such depression.  When listening to the Minister for Education, who deputised for the Minister for Agriculture, I was struck by the unbounded optimism and the exaggeration of the Minister in relation to what he led us to believe was the wonderful prosperity of the Irish farmers!  He recited a regular litany of the grants given in relief of agriculture.  But no matter what Government functioned in this country for the last year and a half they would be compelled of necessity to come to the relief of agriculture in some way, owing to the economic depression that is admittedly world-wide.  What I want to suggest is that we went out of our way to increase that depression. If we were any way logically minded there should be no necessity to emphasise that phase of our present economic situation.  What do we find? Our former markets, the Minister for Education said, were gone, or almost gone and in support of that he made the astonishing statement that Great Britain was increasing her agricultural output.  Anybody who knows anything about conditions in Great Britain, particularly in what is left of the agricultural areas, must know that so long as Britain continues to be mainly industrial, she can never make even a feeble attempt to feed one-fourth of her population.  But this Government, whose mouthpieces tell us that our markets in England are gone, are paying away millions of the taxpayers' money in order to get into these markets.  In effect they say: &ldquo;We do not want your market,&rdquo; but they are paying to get into them.  Did anyone ever hear of such lunatic legislation in any country in the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> Owing to the lop-sided economics of this Government we have a situation created whereby our main producers, as I have endeavoured to show, are reduced almost to bankruptcy, a class that was at one time regarded as one of the most honest and decentest in the country.  They now find themselves reduced to the position that they cannot pay their lawful debts.  Because of this economic dispute they cannot pay their rents.  Those who sympathise with them are told they are defeatists, Imperialists, and that they are helping John Bull.  But, no matter what epithet may be applied to those who are honest enough to tell the Irish farmers that most of their ills are due to the activities of the present Government, honest men will be found in this country&mdash;even at the risk of being told that they are defeatists, Imperialists, anti-Irish or playing John Bull's game &mdash;to say what they believe; that the facts, as we find them, go to show why farmers to-day are depressed, impoverished, and unable to meet their legal obligations.  In addition to the illustrations given as to the depressed state of agriculture I could produce documentary evidence in a number of cases to prove my statement.  I am not going to weary the House, because we had a most convincing statement from Deputy Haslett, who gave facts that cannot be contradicted.  Therefore, I propose to cite only one instance and to produce any evidence that the Minister may require.  I have seen these dropped calves quoted in the official journal issued by the Department of Agriculture from time to time at £2 10s. to £3 10s. and I know that the price realised at the public markets in Cork are from 5/- to 10/-, and it must be a very good calf for 10/-.  A farmer in my constituency recently sold a calf through the agency of the Cork Farmers' Union and he got the large sum of 1/3 for it by the time the tariff had been deducted and so on.  I will produce the necessary documents for the Minister if he requires them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to that, we have a quite recent addition to the farmers' ills.  Anybody who knows anything at all about rural life must know that for many months preceding the Christmas, the farmers' wives and daughters engage in rearing a good deal of poultry for the British market. The turkey brought in the annual Christmas box, shall I call it, to the farmer's family and in many cases, it liquidated all the expenses of the Christmas dinner.  Now that industry has got another slap.  We find that in her efforts to get into the English market the farmer's wife or daughter who rears these fowls is very severely handicapped.  In this connection, I want to ask a question which I have frequently asked myself and with the answer to which I have never yet been satisfied.  The question has been put to me: &ldquo;Who gets the advantage or advantages of these bounties?&rdquo;  The farmer tells me that he does not get the advantage and the dealer, on the other hand, tells me that he does not get the advantage.  Where does it go? I understand, and I have endeavoured to explain to many farmers, that the dealer when buying his beast at a fair is supposed to include in the price he pays to the farmer the tariff which he must pay when he exports the produce into the British market.  The farmer is still unconvinced and tells me that in many cases where he paid £9 for a beast six, eight or nine months ago, he had to sell it quite recently at £6 to £7, showing a direct loss of £2 or £3.  If the rosy picture painted by the Minister for Education, speaking, I dare say, on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, were circulated around my area in Cork and Cork County, I feel sure that it would provoke very serious thought in the minds of many of the farmers.  To endeavour to persuade a man who is almost bankrupt and who cannot meet his legal obligations&mdash;let his intentions be ever so good&mdash;that he got relief under the various headings read out by the Minister for Education to-night would certainly provoke the remark that he could not be much worse off than he <Col N="500" /> is now and the question: &ldquo;Did anybody expect that he could exist if some kind of relief were not given to him?&rdquo; But, as I suggested a moment ago, any Government that would have operated in this country over the last 12 months or so would of necessity have to give relief of some kind unless we were to have an absolute breakdown in our agriculture altogether.</P>
      <P>We have, as I said a moment ago, the repercussions and reactions in the cities and towns.  We have at the moment very large numbers of able-bodied unemployed persons who cannot get work.  These, as I have attempted to show, have been rendered unemployed by the absurd economic policy of the present Government. These persons are now about to get some kind of relief because, again, there was the dire necessity for it, because it was found that the unemployment insurance scheme could not stand the strain.  It was also found that as a result of the facts I have just related, the St. Vincent de Paul and other charitable organisations were at the end of their tether and were appealing for still further funds. Anybody who has any connection at all with that organisation or anybody who takes an interest in social welfare work must know that I am underestimating, if anything, the present state of affairs in the towns and cities in this country.  As a result of the action of the Government in reducing the grants for the relief of rates on agricultural land, we have numbers of persons who usually found fairly remunerative employment at our docks and riversides unemployed.  We have dockers unemployed at the moment&mdash;a type of worker who is suffering from abnormal unemployment.  We have many persons engaged in the cattle trade unemployed and most, if not all, of these persons were brought up to these particular occupations, and are unfitted for any other kind of work. We have such people as cattle drovers, for instance, and others who usually made a good living, unemployed. These men have got no alternative employment no more than our Government has found us the alternative markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> We were told that we had a home market to cultivate.  So far as I can learn we have nearly exhausted all the resources of that home market.  If there are alternative markets, I want to ask the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Finance if those alternative markets are to be found in China, in Peru or in Kamschatcha or if he will name the place or places where these alternative markets are to be found.  Somebody said in this House, by way of irony, not long ago, that we might find a market for our produce in China.  We, of course, might be able to make them eat good beef instead of feeding on rice and we might be able to change them from a purely vegetarian race to a beef-eating community.  Our Government has seen fit to demand of the farmer that he should change his whole system of agriculture.  There is a good deal to be said for increased tillage&mdash;for the one pig more, the one cow more and the one acre more&mdash;but the fact that they are compelled without any preliminary warning as it were&mdash;at least, not sufficient, at any rate&mdash;to make these revolutionary changes is unfair and unjust to the Irish farmer.  But even granted that they had all the preparations and had made this complete change suggested by Government policy, they ask naturally: &ldquo;If we increase our tillage, increase our feeding stuffs and feed them to our own cattle, the natural corollary is that we must have more cattle to continue the increased products of our farms. Where are you going to sell your increased cattle?&rdquo;  The home market will not absorb all of them and we will continue to have an exportable surplus of cattle even under the Government scheme.</P>
    <P>The farmer, as I said a few moments ago, who was able formerly to pay his debts and meet all his obligations, is not at the present moment able to do so.  Personally, I have never preached the immoral doctrines I have heard preached by Government spokesmen. They began with the cry: &ldquo;Pay no land annuities,&rdquo; and it is rather late in the day now to be talking about the morality of that.  I have all the time <Col N="502" /> said that it was an immoral doctrine. A question that might have been easily settled by a round table conference was approached in quite a bandit-like way by putting a pistol to the head of the other fellow and saying: &ldquo;We are not going to pay.&rdquo;  That has more to do with the demoralisation that has set in than any other factor.  If there is any demoralisation amongst the people the Government are responsible for it. They said: &ldquo;Pay no land annuities.&rdquo; I have suggested, and suggested quite seriously, mind you, though I am sometimes given to joking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That, I suggest, would be a far more honest policy because then we would know where we were, but we have got that policy of dishonesty in small instalments. This demoralisation has been creeping in and is having its effects in a thousand and one directions.  It is having its effects on many of the younger people in the country who have lost all respect for law and order and who give, as a justification for many of their misdeeds, the fact that they heard it from Government platforms. This motion suggests that the action of the Government in reducing the total of the grants payable for the relief of rates on agricultural land should be condemned.  I have not heard one word from any Minister refuting the statements made by Deputies on this side of the House. We have heard a lot of high falutin' statements about what this Government has done.  We had one from the Minister for Industry and Commerce a few weeks ago when he told us about all the factories that had been started and all the employment that had been <Col N="503" /> given.  Yet we find that the position is infinitely worse than it was 12 months ago.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Education worked himself into a state of great excitement in regard to statements made from those benches.  He stated that they went to the country and that they were returned by the farmers, but he did not tell the House that they were returned under false pretences.  They told the farmers when they went before them that they would reduce taxation by £2,000,000, but instead they increased it by £6,000,000. They told them further that if returned with a majority over all parties in this House, they would succeed in settling the economic war.  That showed clearly that they thought then that it was <Col N="504" /> important for this country that the economic war should be settled.  They told them that they would find employment for the 80,000 unemployed.  What does the Minister say to-day in regard to that?  He says that they have to make provision for home assistance and for an Unemployment Assistance Bill for these people.  Deputy Norton at the time the Government were elected said that if they did not fulfil their promises to the people, he would have them out of office in 24 hours.  I do not want to dwell at any great length on this aspect of the case.  It has been referred to often before but you cannot tell the truth too often.</P>

      <P>I will give you a good whack of it before I am finished.  I have great pleasure in supporting this motion.  I should just like to quote a a few words from the speech made by the Minister for Agriculture last week, as reported in Vol. 50, page 144, of the Official Debates.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I was speaking on this motion some weeks ago when I had to move the adjournment of the Dáil.  At the time I was dealing with prices.  I had said that the prices were much lower now for farming commodities than they were in 1931 and that the fall in prices was due more to the fall in world prices than to the effects of the economic war between the two countries.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1931 President de Valera moved in this House that relief in rates on agricultural land be given to the extent of £1,000,000.  The Government of that time agreed to give £750,000.  When the present Government came into office, I suppose they wanted to make an appearance of fulfilling their promises and they gave £250,000 extra. This year, however, they came along and took off £480,000.  At the time, Dr. Ryan himself admitted that the farmers were in a very bad state.  The Minister for Education mentioned John Bull so often that I think I should tell you a story about Tim Reardon's bull. I think it will be a complete answer to the statement of the Minister for Agriculture in which he tried to show <Col N="505" /> the people of this country that they were getting better prices for agricultural produce than before the present Government came into office.  I met honest Tim at the fair and I said to him &ldquo;Had you anything at the fair?&rdquo;  He said &ldquo;I had a bull.&rdquo;  I asked &ldquo;What did you get for him?&rdquo;&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;£2&rdquo; said I.  &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;£3.&rdquo;&ldquo;£3 for the bull,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and £6 for John Bull.&rdquo;  Does the Minister for Education or the Minister for Agriculture say that that man who received only £2 for a bull on which £6 had to be paid to John Bull, received as good a price as before the present Government came into power? That is not the only bull on which £6 had to be paid to John Bull.  There are unfortunate farmers all over the country who have to pay £6 on two-year-old bulls, and in some cases, perhaps, a bull is the only beast they have to sell.  That is the position created by the present Government.  We are told that we are doing the work of John Bull in criticising the Government, but will the Government deny that at their Ard Fheis there was a motion brought forward that the present half year's land annuities should be funded?  Will they say that those who brought that motion forward were prejudiced against the Government?  There was also, I think, a motion with regard to derating.  Of course, the argument is used that they are conferring a greater benefit on the farmers by relieving them of half the annuities than by giving full derating.  I should say that Tim Reardon's bull paid the difference between the two.  At the Ard Fheis the question of the small farmer in the Gaeltacht was also referred to.  Anybody who has any connection with the Gaeltacht, or with the poorer parts of the country knows that with a £6 tax on two-year-old beasts they are worthless. What was the Minister's reply? The Minister said he could not solve that problem.</P>
    <P>The Government are trying to convince the people of the country that they are no worse off owing to the economic war.  Commissions have been set up from time to time to go into different questions.  I challenge <Col N="506" /> the Government to set up a commission and to call farmers before it and examine them with regard to the position and then the people will be able to see what is responsible for having the farmers in their present position. Deputy Dillon quoted last week what the Minister for Finance said five years ago when the taxation of the country was only £20,000,000.  The Minister then said that industry could not stand the burden of taxation.  To-day, instead of taxation being down by £2,000,000 as was promised by the Government before they took office, it has increased by £6,000,000.  In addition to that the Government say that they are keeping the land annuities, although England claims that we are paying £3,500,000.  The President was challenged in the House by Deputy Belton and he said: &ldquo;If you are paying you are not paying them to us.&rdquo;  That was an admission that we are paying them to England. I shall quote from the Minister for Agriculture when he was Deputy Dr. Ryan, an humble member of the House, as reported in Volume 21, columns 1048-9 of the Parliamentary Debates.  Speaking on Financial Motion No. 3 on 8th November, 1927, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Good talking about the tariff on boots said it raised the cost of that particular article and, therefore, raised the cost of living, and that the next step was that it made it impossible for the exporters of this country to compete in the open market with other people.  That reason is all right, but if it is, he asks later on, what will be the effect supposing England put up a tariff against our beef?  The effect would be to raise the price of beef in England, to raise the cost of living in England and, therefore, make it impossible for the Englishman to compete with the exporters of other countries, and so we would get our own back in that way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask are we getting our own back in that way?  What is the position to-day?  Are we not subsidising the people of England?  Are we not giving a subsidy in order that they will be able to buy agricultural produce <Col N="507" /> cheaper?  Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he then was, went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Finally, there is a lot of talk here about the cost of living being raised. That seems to be the big bogey held up.  I suppose a tariff does sometimes raise the cost of living, but other things must be taken into account.  For instance, one may take the simple case of a man who buys three pairs of boots in the year. Suppose these three pairs of boots cost him £5. 15/- would be the tariff. Does that mean that that man's cost of living has risen by exactly 15/-? Is it as simple as that?  I think it is a bit more involved.  For instance, before that tariff was put on, that particular man was paying something towards unemployment.  He may have been paying towards home assistance or in some other way.  But he is relieved somewhat of that on account of the increased employment in the country.  Further, we are told he is relieved by the result of revenue from the tariff on boots, so that the thing becomes very complicated. I believe that the person we are most concerned with is the farmer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what I am coming to.  I am just taking the Minister for Agriculture at his own word.  Continuing he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Good stated that the farmer produced 80 per cent. of what was produced in this country. Whatever the Government may cost, whatever unemployment may cost, whatever any public service may cost, will eventually go back to the producer and it is the producer who will have to bear it, because it is quite plain that the non-producer cannot bear it.  The man who buys his produce from the farmer can only live off the farmer, the man above him also lives off the farmer, and so on all along.  80 per cent. of the country is living on the farmer and 80 per cent. of the public services is paid by the farmer's money.  Therefore, if the increased cost of living comes, that we are told so often will come as a result of tariffs, it will fall on the farmer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> We are paying £6,000,000 in extra taxation this year and we are paying £3,500,000 to the British in tariffs. That is a total of £9,500,000.  80 per cent. of that would come to £7,600,000.  That sum, according to what the Minister then stated, is being imposed on the farmers and yet we are told that they are in a better position while they are being robbed of this £450,000.  That is not the only increase that is put on the farmer. Every article that he buys has a tax upon it.  Let us take the case of flour quoted by Deputy Dillon last week.  I believe that it takes 3,000,000 sacks of flour to supply the demand in this country.  The increase in the price of flour, I understand, is between 3/6 and 5/-.  Let us take it at 4/-.  Four shillings on 3,000,000 sacks would come to £600,00.  Eighty per cent. of that would be £480,000, so that on that item alone there is a tax of £480,000 on the farmers.  Then there is the case of coal on which there is a tax of 5/- per ton.  The farmer pays 80 per cent. of that too.</P>
    <P>The Minister also talks about tillage farming.  Tillage farming is all right. Deputy Hogan, when Minister for Agriculture, advocated another cow, another sow, and another acre of corn, but that was when the people of the country had a market for what they produced.  He never advocated the growing of oats and other crops as cash crops.  We have had experience of that this year when the Minister for Agriculture finds it almost impossible to get a market for the oats in this country.  Deputy Haslett has referred to the position of the small farmers. He said that you can buy Indian meal at 5/- a cwt. in the North.  That would be 12/6 a sack.  People in Cork are at present paying at least 5/- per sack more for the mixture and farmers will tell you that there is no comparison between them as a food, that it would take a month extra to fatten a pig on the present mixture.</P>
    <P>The Council of the Cork Chamber of Commerce drew attention at their meeting to the marked decrease in live stock exports and said that statistics as a whole reveal that the State, apparently from both international and <Col N="509" /> national reasons, was becoming gradually self-contained.  The Minister for Agriculture, on one occasion, told us in this House that the more you till the more cattle you will have to keep. According to what the Cork Chamber of Commerce state we have not the cattle in the country, with the result that we have nothing to consume what we produce.  Deputy O'Neill has told me that he sold last year's black oats this year at 2/9 per cwt.  That is being sold back to the poor farmers at 7/6 and 8/- per cwt.  We are told that the farmers, by reason of the bounties, are better off to-day than ever they were. Take the figures on that question. There is the sum of £2,500,000.  According to the Minister's own estimate, the farmers are themselves paying £2,000,000 of that.  Then, the Government turns around and takes about £500,000 away from them by reduction of the agricultural grant.  I take another quotation from the speech of the Minister.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy should reserve some of these good points until he is winding up.  There is an increase in the price of bacon in both countries over the price obtaining in 1931.  In the Irish Free State, bacon was 5/6 higher and in Great Britain 6/6 higher, so that, roughly, the farmer in Great Britain is 1/- per pig better off than the farmer in the Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What does the feeder in Great Britain pay for his feeding stuffs, as compared with what the farmer in the Free State pays?  There is a difference of 5/- or 6/- per sack, or 7/6 a cwt.  The Minister stated in the House that it took a quarter ton of meal to fatten a pig. That at a difference of 7/6 a cwt.  If the farmers were getting that amount more for their pigs than the farmers in Great Britain, they would think they were millionaires.  I know something about farmers, because I lived with them all my life.  I submit that I have put forward very strong arguments in favour of this motion and I am sure the House will unanimously accept it.</P>

      <P>In my ignorance of farming and everything connected with it, I have to use the little brains I have, as a city man, to try to find out for myself the truth, or otherwise, of all the distressful stories I have heard here for the last six or seven months. The only means I have of doing that is to ask questions.  I related before the many types of citizens I put questions to regarding the state of the country.  Since then I have put more questions to men and women who use the eyes, ears and brains God gave them.  One of the men I asked was a bookmaker.  He has nothing to do with the printing, binding or distributing of books.  He attends race meetings and he pays out when he loses.  He is a discerning man, a man of brains and a decent man.  I have always found bookmakers to answer that description. I knew this bookmaker for a long time.  I said to him &ldquo;I am now a member of the Dáil.&rdquo;  He used only know me as a member of the Corporation. I have got advanced in the world&mdash;a little late for my time of life.  The bookmaker said: &ldquo;I know you are.&rdquo;  I said &ldquo;I have been listening to debates and discussions regarding the position of the country for the last six months.  The distressed farmer has appeared at every meeting of the Dáil.  When they appear, they all tell the same story&mdash;that they are <Col N="511" /> in a terible state.  Can you, out of your experience, tell me whether the condition of the country is as bad as it is represented?  What provinces do you go to?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Leinster and Munster, principally, with an odd visit to Connacht.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;What is your experience; is there any diminution in the number of people who are attending race meetings?&rdquo;  He said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&ldquo;Do they appear to be a distressed body of men and women?&rdquo; I asked.  He replied: &ldquo;They are just as jolly as ever.&rdquo;  I asked: &ldquo;Do they put the same amount of money on horses?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;No, where they used to put down half a sovereign, they now put down half a dollar.&rdquo;  That is the difference.  I asked &ldquo;What about Connacht?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I only go to Galway.  That being a University town, it is a good town to which to go. University people generally patronise the races and always have money to put down.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>His summing up of the whole position was that the people were not depressed.  I asked him about the women folk, if the women and girls were going about gloomily, saying that their husbands and brothers and sons were putting money on horses that was wanted badly for the home and for the farm.  &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they put money on themselves.&rdquo;  That is a man who understands human nature, and he told me truthfully that there was no depression in the country.</P>

    <P>The farmers are hard up.  I am sorry for it.  They are an industrious, hard-working body and their fathers and grandfathers were that, too.  But so are lawyers hard up, so are doctors, so are merchants, and so are workmen. I am hard up myself.  That is general and there is no use in blaming the Fianna Fáil Government or any other government for the position of affairs. It has been said that Fianna Fáil got into office on false pretences.  No political party in my long experience of political parties ever proclaimed so boldly and so freely their policy as did Fianna Fáil last January.  No honest man or woman will deny that.  I met a commercial traveller recently and I <Col N="512" /> asked him what his experience was and how the country was doing.  He said: &ldquo;The country is doing fairly well.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Do the people appear to be depressed and downhearted?&rdquo;&ldquo;They do not,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;my experience does not reveal that at all. I went into a town, tired and worn out, one night.  I went to the local hotel.  The hotel was crowded.&rdquo; There had been races in the vicinity that day and there was any amount of hilarity, conviviality and hospitality going on.  He found that he could not go to bed until the company dispersed. He waited a long time but there was no sign of the crowd breaking up.  He continued to wait and there came a lull.  He believed they were all going home until he heard a stentorian voice announce: &ldquo;Come next Tuesday, boys, I will be 47.&rdquo;  That was the spark necessary to rekindle the hilarity at the idea of having a birthday celebration. The man who was going to be 47 the following Tuesday was wished many happy returns.  Then another member of the party announced that on Thursday he would be 53, so they had two birthday celebrations that night.  The commercial traveller put on his hat and rambled around the town.  He had a walk by the riverside and came back in an hour's time.  The landlord, and probably the police, had cleared the house by that time, but the company were all shaking hands outside and wishing one another happy birthdays.  These are comical incidents in a way, but they do not bear out all the gloomy tales we have heard, all the gloomy figures that have been quoted, and all the gloomy prophecies that have been indulged in for months.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health <Col N="354" /> whether he is aware that Mrs. Anne Kennedy, Ballintaffy, Claremorris, was recommended an old age pension of 10/- per week by the Claremorris sub-Committee in November, 1932; that an appeal was made by the Pension Officer against the recommendation of the sub-Committee; that claimant complied with the requirements of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1932, and if he will state the reasons for reducing the claimant's pension to 5/- per week.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the circumstances leading up to the submission of an appeal against the decision of the local sub-Committee in this case.  The case was investigated locally by one of this Department's inspectors.  After making deduction of the usual outgoings, the annual value of the claimant's means was ascertained to be £27 15s.  The pension of 5/- per week is that appropriate to an income of this amount.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the Mayo County Council have passed the necessary statutory resolution guaranteeing to pay 29 per cent. of the cost of the drainage of the River Robe as required by the Commissioners of Public Works and if he will state what steps, if any, are being taken by the Commissioners of Public Works for the publication of notices of the drainage scheme in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as required by the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mayo County Council passed a resolution on the 28th October, 1933&mdash; of which notification was received by the Commissioners of Public Works on the 8th instant&mdash;agreeing to make a contribution of £13,050, or 29 per cent. of the <i>estimated</i> cost of the proposed River Robe Drainage Scheme.  The Commissioners of Public Works wrote to the Council on the 14th instant pointing out that their contribution should not be limited to a definite sum, but should be 29 per cent. of the <i>actual</i> cost of the scheme, so as to ensure that any excess or saving on the estimate should be shared proportionately by the Government, the County Council, and the rated occupiers of affected lands.</P>
      <P>As soon as the County Council shall have passed a resolution undertaking to contribute 29 per cent. of the actual cost there will be no delay in submitting the detailed drainage scheme to the votes of the occupiers of affected lands and publishing the necessary notices.</P>
