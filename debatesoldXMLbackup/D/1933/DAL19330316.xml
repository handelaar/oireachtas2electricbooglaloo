      <P>Business will be taken as on the Order Paper, except that No. 5, Land (Purchase Annuities Fund) Bill, 1933, will come before the Central Fund Bill, 1933.  I want, also, to explain to the House, that when the announcement was made that the sitting of the House would terminate to-day at 2 o'clock it was hoped by the Minister for Finance that all the stages of the Land (Purchase Annuities Fund) Bill would be taken to-day, and that may necessitate the House sitting till 10.30.</P>

      <P>Is the President aware that the arrangement come to, for business, during the week, embodied the taking of the Central Fund Bill alone to-day, and giving to that Bill the whole time of the House to-day? With regard to the Land (Purchase Annuities) Bill, in respect of which the Minister for Finance indicated that he would like all stages to-day, the position on Tuesday last was that after hearing the Minister for Finance no useful purpose would be served by delaying any longer the final stages of the Bill to be taken to-day. It has not been found possible, on our side, to agree that the final stages should be taken to-day, for the reason that there are certain points which require further consideration, and, also, that it has not been made apparent that there is any real urgency on the part of the Minister for Finance in this matter.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of all the details of the discussion that went on.  I only know, as indicated by the Deputy in his statement, that the arrangement has broken down.  There has been some misunderstanding about the agreement.  The Minister for Finance has reasons why it is urgent that this Bill should be proceeded with to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, of course, that Deputy McGilligan regards the Seanad as a necessary tail to his Party. In this matter the Seanad must be considered, and they will probably ask for time to consider the matters raised here, and it is to give the Seanad adequate time to consider the Bill that I ask for all its stages to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad will have to do that in any case.  The point is whether the Bill should go to the Seanad to-day or next Wednesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all very well, but the point is that this is a one-clause Bill and any useful discussion that could take place upon the measure has already taken place upon the Second Stage.  Is there any justification for any Party to further disorganise the finances of the local authorities by holding up this Bill, or for imposing <Col N="976" /> further burdens upon the farmers of this country for whom the Party opposite professes such great anxiety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly certain there is no deficiency in my utterance whatever there may be in the Deputy's hearing.  What I should like to say is that, as already indicated, the measure was debated at length on Tuesday.  There cannot possibly be any rational reason for obstructing it further.  It is a one-clause Bill.  It is not unusual to take all the stages of a Bill in one day.  Much more important Bills than this have been taken in a day and this Bill is of sufficient importance to justify that all the stages should be concluded to-day.  It remains entirely with the Opposition. The Dáil can either adjourn at 2 o'clock after getting all the stages of the Bill through or sit until 10.30.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's hearing was not defective because he had a conversation with his friend on the left.  I asked whether the local authorities were deprived of any money.  Are they at present without this money, this £1,600,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I had already explained the position at length, I thought, on the Second Stage of the Bill.  Out of the £1,616,000, £500,000 had been already advanced to local authorities out of the Emergency Fund, £194,000 had been further advanced out of the Central Fund and the balance of £994,000 has yet to be disbursed.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister indicate why the introduction of this simple one-claúse Bill was delayed? The Ministry was returned on the 8th February and the Dáil met on March 1st.  This is the 16th March.  What was the cause of the delay in the introduction of this one-clause Bill to deal with that situation?</P>

      <P>The Minister has complained that we think so lightly of the Seanad that we are restricting the time which the Seanad will have to deal with this measure.  I submit to the Minister that it is he who is restricting the time of the Seanad.  He brought in last week an Agricultural Estimate, and last night he was facilitated by us in allowing through four or five important Estimates.  He got them in order that he would get all the stages of the Central Fund Bill through this week.  We have thus accommodated the Minister with his Estimates, and the Seanad are entitled to time to discuss this important measure.</P>

If that be so, how could we meet at 10.30 this morning?

      <P>I must say that the Deputy's arguments were very coercive and they were further reinforced by the fact that the organ, for which I understand the Deputy has a great deal of personal responsibility, has been clamouring that these moneys should be taken out of the Suspense Account and used for the purpose of reducing taxation or meeting expenditure.</P>

      <P>Then we have this peculiar thing that we have come up against two or three times, that when the Government proceed to legislate on foot of certain old contentions that they have put before the country, they manage always to let the cat out of the bag.  The Oath was not mandatory and yet when we came to the actual piece of legislation in regard to it, it bore on the face of it the recognition that there was a breach of the Treaty.  They purported to remove the Commissioner of the Civic Guards recently and we found that they had done it under a repealed Act.  Now, they come here on the old contention that these moneys were never payable to the British and on foot of a legal opinion to that effect, and the lawyers who gave that legal opinion were referred to here by the President on the last motion that was down with regard to this.  Let me quote from these legal opinions as set out in a pamphlet published by the National Executive of Fianna Fáil.  At a small cost of 3d, you can get all this lore. The lawyers were a little bit afraid of the courts intervening in this matter. They replied to the question as to why it should not be left to the courts to determine and this is what they said:</P>
      <P>When it is said that the question of implied repeal should be tested in the courts we must point out that a court might fairly decline upon an implication to determine so grave a matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> They continue, lower down:</P>
    <P>....and so long as Section 12 (2) with its express direction to the Minister for Finance is left on the Statute Book, the court will assume that the deliberate intention of the Legislature is to continue the payments directed by Section 12 (2).</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister for Finance will agree with that.  So long as that section was left in its present form, the court would likely assume that the Legislature's intention was there expressed and, therefore, would decide contrary to the opinion of the whole Fianna Fáil Party and their legal advisers.  They then continue in this strain:</P>
    <P>....and that, if the Legislature intends the payments to stop, it will make its wish clear by the ready and simple expedient of the repeal of Section 12 (2).</P>
    <P>Why not carry that out now when the people in office owe their positions simply to the fact that they founded themselves on the lawyers' opinion and bamboozled certain folk with it?  Why not adopt it in its entirety?  Why not adopt what was stated here so precisely&mdash;the ready and simple expedient of the repeal of Section 12 (2)?  I should like to give the answer as it appears to me.  You do not dare to do it because you know that it will leave the position very much as it was before and instead of there being an express direction from the Legislature in Section 12 (2) to pay these moneys over to the appropriate authority&mdash; and about that there might be argument&mdash;if you had simply repealed the section and left the whole situation to be governed by previous Acts, the lawyers' definite contention, by going into the implication of previous Acts and the old Land Purchase Acts, would be that the money would still continue to be appropriated for such purposes as the reduction of annuities and the payment of Sinking Fund on these advances.  So that we have here the position that neither the lawyers nor the old propaganda of the Fianna Fáil Party is believed in and we are going to take special directions.  This is not going to be left to any implication or to any lawyers' argument <Col N="987" /> about what was the situation under the old Land Acts.  Away with that now.  We are going definitely to enact here and now:</P>
    <P>That any moneys which are, at the passing of this Act or shall from time to time thereafter be standing to the credit of the Purchase Annuities Fund shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>That is the best and most effective turning down of the people who advised that these moneys should be retained here.  We have so little belief in them that we are not going to adopt their advice that the Legislature should now enact that the moneys should be so disposed of by the simple and ready expedient of repealing Section 12 (2).  No, we are going to make the section complete and secure by enacting that the moneys will be paid into and disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Are we to understand, then, that in paying out the moneys that are due to be paid in full to the stockholders under the 1923 and subsequent Acts, these moneys will be taken in full from the moneys that are coming in from the Land Purchase Annuities generally, or are they only going to be taken from the moneys coming in from purchasers under the 1923 and subsequent Acts? I submit that if the moneys coming in under the 1923 and subsequent Acts are going to be definitely ear-marked for the payment of the stockholders under these Acts, when you take into consideration the reduction in the amount <Col N="988" /> of land annuities contemplated by the Minister the local authorities will never get one half-penny of the £793,000 outstanding to them at the present moment.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension.  He assumes the Guarantee Fund arrangement is not going to be suitably adjusted in the new Land Bill to meet the situation which will be created by the permanent reduction in the land annuities.  I think that is the surmise that underlies the Deputy's question. Of course that is not the position. The Guarantee Fund will merely be of that size which will be sufficient to cover any arrears that may arise in connection with the reduced annuities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is one point that has been overlooked.  The largest sum outstanding for the whole period in respect of which the Land Purchase Annuities have been paid was on 31st January, 1932.  It was the sum Deputy Mulcahy has indicated, £793,000.  The previous year it amounted to £581,000.  Assuming for a moment that £200,000 was in respect of the December annuity of 1931, in respect of which the Ministry offered on 22nd June last a moratorium, and undertook to fund any outstanding instalments due for the November and December annuities of 1931, what is the position of the Guarantee Fund in respect of that transaction?  Are they going to get only the interest and sinking fund on the funded instalments, or will they get the full amount and let the Government or the Land Commission get the interest and sinking fund?  It is a considerable sum of money for local authorities.  It amounts to £200,000.  That particular point, whether or not the Ministry have considered it, is one in which the local authorities are very seriously interested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that in respect of deductions from central moneys going into the local taxation account the local authorities are out £793,000.  That sum of money is due to them.  It is to be observed that the highest sum previously withheld was in 1923, after the pronunciamento by the present Minister for Justice.  The amount was £642,000.  It is right to say that while the annuities collectible then amounted approximately to £3,000,000, by reason of the passing of the Act of 1923, £1,000,000 was added.  While the non-payments amounted to £526,000 under the pre-1923 Act, the 1923 Act was responsible for £139,000 of arrears on 10th January, 1931.  There is the question also of insufficiency of income, but the main point is that local authorities suffered deductions amounting to £793,000 on 31st January, 1932.</P>
      <P>There was an additional £200,000 lost for the year 1932.  That arose, we may assume, out of the non-payment of the November and December annuities of 1931.  The Minister announced on 22nd June last, or about that time, that they proposed to fund that particular instalment.  If they are going to fund it, presumably they look upon it as a good debt.  If they are going to fund it, and it is going to be repayable over the next 50 years, it means the local authorities, if they are only going to get interest and sinking fund, will be 50 years getting it.  That is not fair to the local authorities.  If it is a good debt they ought to get it.  If it is not a good debt, some of the responsibility in respect to it rests upon the Ministry. At any rate, it was never contemplated by any of these Acts that in the event of an instalment not being paid or some difficulty arising about instalments, the sum in question would be funded and that the local authorities would get the interest and sinking fund over a period of 50 years.</P>

      <P>I should like to direct attention to the fact that the sum of £700,000 odd is exceeded by the June and December gales of this year.  This money will not be going into current revenue in this year, next year, or any other year, owing to the condition of the collection of land annuities generally.  The sum stated by the Minister yesterday&mdash;the amount in arrear&mdash;was, I think, in excess of £1,000,000.  That is also supposed to be funded.  We may take it that approximately £2,000,000 will have to be funded.  In the meantime it is looked upon as a good debt.  I want to press home the total amount of that.  If the Minister states that we will have an opportunity of dealing with this when the new Land Bill is under consideration, the matter can be passed over now; but it cannot be passed over if the Minister does not give an undertaking that it will be dealt with in connection with the new Land Bill.  The Local authorities cannot stand this loss arising out of conditions imposed upon them by factors operating outside their administration.</P>

      <P>Including arrears arising out of that gale.  I think that was the position on the 31st March last&mdash;that is, that £793,000 was due. Some of those arrears have come in since and have been disbursed to the local authorities.  A considerable balance is still to be collected and a large amount of them might never be collected.  Our proposal is to fund those arrears over a period.  The position, according to a considerable body of opinion in this House, was that the farmers were unable to pay these land annuities even before March, 1932, and that a considerable portion of them would have to be written off.  They would have to be written off at the expense of the local authorities.  The <Col N="991" /> position of the local authorities has been, therefore, improved to this extent that, in funding those arrears, we are reducing the present commitments of the tenant purchasers by 50 per cent., thereby putting them in a better position to pay off those arrears.</P>

      <P>At any rate, we are creating a condition of putting up a good asset for the local authorities. The fact is that we are allowing the people time to pay by funding those annuities.  Consequently, the utmost the local authorities could expect is that they should be credited with these annuities as they come into the Guarantee Fund or, simply, as they accrue to the Guarantee Fund. Whether, in all the circumstances, that is equitable or not is a matter that can be discussed on the new Land Bill.  At any rate that is my present intention.</P>

      <P>The Minister loses sight of a fundamental principle of municipal finance.  That is that the ratepayer has a life of twelve months only.  His life begins on the 1st April and that life ends on the 31st March following.  During that period the ratepayer is responsible for and he should only bear the cost consequent upon the public services of the local authority for that period.  This particular transaction that the Government initiated on its own, deprives the local authorities of the £200,000 in question and spreads it over the lives of ratepayers some of whom are not yet born.  That is not municipal finance.  It disturbs the whole system. The ratepayers are entitled to get that money back, according to law, as it comes in.  We have arrested its coming in.  We say we do not want it for 50 years and in consequence local finance is upset.  Instead of getting a lump sum of money on a particular day the money is funded over a period.  The Ministry is only committing itself to give only the interest and sinking fund so far as this £200,000 is concerned for 50 years.  That is unjust <Col N="992" /> on the whole basis of municipal accountancy.  The ratepayer was entitled to whatever benefits he was in receipt of hitherto by these payments.

Is the Minister aware that so far as the collection of land annuities is concerned the collection was such on the 31st January, 1924, that the local authorities in that one year got £110,000 more than they would have got if the additional land annuities had not been paid?  Is the Minister aware that in the following year, up to the 31st of January, 1925, in respect of the situation brought about by the payment of land annuities, the local authorities got £90,000 more than they otherwise would have got if deficiencies created in previous years had not been made good.  In respect of the land annuities collected in January, 1927, is he aware that the collection was such that the local authorities got £100,000 more than they would have got if the deficiency had not been made <Col N="993" /> good?  More than that, when the Minister comes to the matter of the inability of the farmers to pay their land annuities, the fact is that when you come down to more recent years, as far as the payment of land annuities proper is concerned as distinct from the effect on the Guarantee Fund of insufficiency of income, which does not arise from farmers' non-payment, the collection in January, 1929, was such that £20,000 was released to the local authorities, and in the following year a sum of £21,000 was released in addition to their full yearly grants.  But it is only when we come down to 1931 and 1932 that the local authorities were deprived of moneys&mdash;in 1931, £46,000, and in the second year £66,000.  Now there is a sum of £793,000 outstanding from the local authorities.  A sum of £260,000 in respect of non-payments in the year ended July, 1932, has been withheld from them as a result of the campaign by the Minister's Party about the non-payment of land annuities leading up to the general election of 1932.  In respect, therefore, of more than one-third of what is outstanding it can be said that it is the effect of the definite campaign of the Minister's own Party.  The local authorities in their present condition of finance must remain out of that money now and no attempt will be made to pay them for 40, 50 or 60 years.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, I am sure, is very innocent.  He has the figures in front of him, and he knows that in July, 1930, the total amount withheld from the local authorities in respect of local taxation grants had amounted to, in the aggregate, £514,000.  That amount increased to £546,000 on the 31st January, 1931, and in July, 1932, the figures stood at £808,000, arrears which had accumulated in very much better times. Certainly it would be inequitable to collect this money in respect to which the local authorities would never receive one penny piece grant in 1932 or 1933.</P>

      <P>After all, the Deputy was here in 1930 and 1931.  Possibly that is an explanation of the fact that between 31st July, 1930, and 31st January, 1932, the total arrears in respect of the several gales had risen from £514,000 to £808,000.  The tenant purchasers failed by that additional amount to meet their obligations.  If the Deputy looks back on the haleyon days of 1931, which he probably never expects will come again, he will see that there is no unfairness, that we are not acting inequitably in saying that in so far as, by the reduction of the land annuities, we have made these arrears collectable, the local authorities should only get them as they come into the Guarantee Fund. They would never have been collectable if it had not been for the permanent reduction.</P>

      <P>That is a very strange statement for the Minister to make considering that the farmer had to pay the annuities in full last year to the British Government and that he has made a fair attempt to pay them to the Land Commission as well.  He has now held out the carrot before the farmer's nose&mdash;that half the Land Commission annuities will be remitted in the future.  Why saddle the local authorities with the entire arrears of annuities?  Why not halve the arrears? This £790,000 is only juggling with figures.  It is to be taken from the farmer on one account and is to go back to him on another account.  Why not be honest with the local taxpayers? You are going to get a windfall, if everything goes according to order, of half the annuities into the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a windfall.  Of course, that will not be the whole story.  A lot of water will flow under the bridges before that is as easily accomplished as it was when the doctrine was preached that it was illegal and immoral to pay land annuities to Britain.  Now we are engaged in legalising the non-payment of them to Britain.  The farmer was told that he would not have to pay his annuities at all.  During the progressive stages of that campaign of non-payment of annuities, arrears naturally accumulated.  Simply because the Minister was not on the bench on which he now is, he blamed those who were on the bench and who were suffering from the effects of the campaign the Minister and his colleagues put over on the country.  Now he has to face up to realities.  He was hardly landed in his seat to-day when he betrayed the new malady he is suffering from&mdash;&ldquo;farmerities.&rdquo;  He was hardly seated when he expressed his sympathy with the farmers.  Now, let him express his sympathy with the farmers in hard cash&mdash;that is the only sympathy the farmers want and it is the only sympathy that counts.  We do not want any more empty formulas if we are going to till our land.</P>
      <P>The farmer is going to be deprived of this £750,000.  He is not going to get the benefit, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, of the agricultural grant to which that is due, even if times become normal.  A big slice of that would be paid in if times improved, but now, whether they improve or remain stagnant or become worse, they cannot be paid in in full for 50 years. During that time, the local taxpayer has to remain out of the benefits of those arrears.  The Minister might consider the charging of that amount to the new windfall he is getting from half the annuities.  Let the half of the annuities that he is going to collect pay the arrears of the past and give credit to the local taxpayer for the arrears that are due to him.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious that the Ministry has not considered this question because, in the defence made for leaving things as they are and allowing money to flow into the <Col N="996" /> Guarantee Fund in relief of this enormous sum, the Minister emphasised the advantages that are being given by remission of half the annuities.  It so happens that landholders are not all paying land annuities.  Land is held in some cases in fee-simple.  In other cases, it is subject to fee-farm grants.  In some other cases, the people who are responsible for land annuities have either bought them out or bought portion of them out. I need not go into the various types of leases or other instruments under which people hold land.  These people are getting no benefit.  While they represent an inconsiderable number, it is unfair to impose upon them a liability in respect of the Government's policy which was not contemplated and which is not enshrined in either the Local Government Act or the Land Purchase code.  The matter has not been considered and, in respect of whatever instalments have been funded, the sum in question should be given to the local authorities in these very difficult times when their liabilities are increasing in practically every case and the collections are very considerably down in percentage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the state of affairs that has arisen in connection with local authorities when making the rates for the present year owing to the unsatisfactory treatment of them by the central authority.  The main thing is that a sum of nearly half a millon pounds in relief of agricultural rates has been withheld.  To give a concrete case, the Cork County Council should be making their estimate to-day, but I do not think they will be able to do so, because the reduction of the grants in the case of Cork County Council will mean withholding a sum of £56,000.  There is also a demand for an extra £73,000 on the local services, so that they have to meet an increased liability of £129,000.  That is an amount that the Cork County Council find it very difficult to put on the farmers, having regard to their ability to pay, to the fact that in this last month of the financial year only 50 per cent. of the rates have been collected, and that they are faced with the possibility of an increase of 50 per cent. in the rates for the new year.  I think that condition of things is not confined to the County Cork, but applies to many <Col N="999" /> other counties, particularly purely agricultural counties, and by that I mean counties where there are mixed tillage farms.  We must also consider the ability of the farmer to pay.  In a county such as Cork it has been reduced to about half.  If he is not able to pay a rate of 8/- in the £ at present, how is he, with his decreased profits, going to meet a rate of 12/6 in the £ for the coming year?  That is the practical fact that emerges out of the discussion, and the dishonest policy with regard to the land annuities, because it is coming back on the farmer again in a double and mischievous manner.  I am afraid the Minister does not realise the seriousness of the position into which the local services are being rushed.  It is evident that unless some extraordinary relief is forthcoming the rates will not be able to be collected, at all events in the way they were collected for the last year. There will be a serious and imminent breakdown in the local services administered by boards of public health, road services, etc., unless some serious step is taken by the Minister to come to the aid of the local authorities.</P>

      <P>Before we pass from the section I should like to refer to something the Minister said last night. I should not like this section to pass without some reference to the amendment of Deputy Cosgrave.  The Minister said last night that those who voted for that amendment voted in fact to prevent any grants being made to local bodies; in other words, that if we did not pass this Bill we would be upsetting all the machinery for making grants to local bodies.  I wonder how were the grants made to local bodies under the old conditions.  Does the Minister assume that if the campaign about the land annuities had not begun or had not continued the agricultural grant would have ceased to be payable and that all grants in lieu of rates would cease to be payable? I have another objection to this measure.  Deputy Cosgrave's amendment, even though the Minister assumed that it was directed towards <Col N="1000" /> the stoppage of grants, was directed altogether differently.  It was to end the conditions under which we are labouring at present owing to the unfortunate economic war.  Two Ministers last night said that they had done more for the farmers than they should have done.</P>

      <P>With all due respect, I am trying to argue that the disposal of the land purchase money in the manner in which this Bill proposes to dispose of it for the purpose of general taxation, as I hope to prove if the <Col N="1001" /> Ceann Comhairle allows me, puts the agriculturists and the ratepayers in a worse position than they were in before the introduction of this Bill, or if you like, before the introduction of the causes which led up to it.  The Minister last night on this very Bill challenged us that in voting for an amendment on this Bill we were voting for a cessation of grants-in-aid of local authorities.  If I am not allowed, speaking on the Bill the Minister referred to, to take up that challenge it is difficult to know how we are to meet any of the interjections of the Minister in ordinary debates.  He said, and his fellow-Minister, the Minister for Agriculture, said, that they had done more for us than they ought to have done.  I suppose again in this Bill they assume that they are doing more for us than they ought to do by using the money that the farmers in general pay in land purchase annuities for the general purposes of taxation, and, if you like, with the intention of using some of it to give him back in the way of a grant out of his own annuities the money which was hitherto provided in another manner.  In relation to that I think I am entitled to argue as to the respect in which the farmer or ratepayer is bettered by this Bill.  We have, as I said, during the last seven months been mulcted to the extent of a million a month by the cessation of our exports, and, because again of the cessation of our exports and the consequent dropping in price of a 40 per cent. tariff on home products, the home consumed produce of the agriculturists has dropped by the same proportion; in other words, what is being consumed at home has dropped to the same extent as our export products, and we have lost not only seven millions but fourteen millions in seven months.</P>

Day after day since 1922 their Deputies, who were outside this House at that time, told the people not to pay their rent.  Is it the case that the people who paid regularly have now got to pay for the people who never paid at all?  Are the people of the different counties, are the ratepayers of County Galway, who paid their rates and annuities regularly, going to suffer now for the gentlemen who were told by the Minister for Finance's Party time and again during the last ten years not to pay?  I would like to get that answer.  That answer is necessary for the ratepayers and honest people of this country.  I would say it is most unfair if that is to be so. If the Minister states that that £792,000 is irrecoverable, certainly his Government should not be the Government of this country.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to answer my question with regard to the provisions of the new Land Bill.  Take, for example, the County Donegal, where there are small farmers&mdash;small in the sense of their valuation&mdash;who have redeemed the land purchase annuities and are freeholders. They have discharged their debts to the State to the last penny. They paid their debts regularly and are now free of debt.  There is another class, the tenants under the Land Church Act.  In connection with lands that were church property new provisions were made under the Irish Church Act that the tenants were to pay annuities, or rather rents, at 3? per cent. interest.  Now they are paying those exorbitant rents.  There is no hope for them at all&mdash;and those are people who have paid regularly&mdash; because there is no funding operation for them, and they are under enormous <Col N="1004" /> rents.  We have an estate in Donegal which comes under the Irish Church Act.  It was known originally as the Wicklow Estate and now it has passed from under that name.  There is another class of people who purchased under the Board of Works loan.  There is also another class&mdash;where a man had a large tract of land which came within the Land Acts and he redeemed it and divided and resold it to tenants, and they are under this new tenancy.  I am not sure whether or not these tenants can be brought within the Land Acts.  I am afraid they cannot.  Those people will have to pay their new annuities, which are of course not annuities at all but rack rents.  They would have to be paid because that landlord would have the full force of the law.  Before we had the law, he could extract his rent annually and what happened here was very extraordinary and a rather unfortunate thing.  These men bought these redeemed lands, they first paid a price and then were put under rents&mdash;they were land hungry in certain districts. They paid a price first, then a rent to the new landlord.  It is a new form of landlordism which is arising in this country.  People foresaw this and it has arisen.  Men bought out redeemed holdings, or perhaps redeemed them, and then re-let them to tenants.  There is a new form of landlordism arising. There is no hope for these men.  Under this new form of landlordism there are three classes who have no protection. They must pay their rents and rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, this is an Act which sets out, perhaps in the first section, all that it means, and it states: &ldquo;it is hereby enacted that the moneys which are at the passing of this Act or shall from time to time thereafter be standing to the credit of the Purchase Annuities Fund shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer at such times and in such manner as the Minister for Finance shall direct.&rdquo;  Now, there is a publication in this State called &ldquo;Irish Oifigiúil.&rdquo;  On 10th January there appears for the first time a reference to some new account.  I think it is called the British Claims Suspense Account, and it indicates that in that fund there is a sum of something like over £4,000,000.  It has been gradually creeping up until within the last week I think it is over £4,600,000.  This Bill is apparently a Bill to authorise the transfer of moneys from the Purchase Fund Account to the Exchequer. By statute all these moneys, which are referred to in that British Claims Suspense Account, should be in this Land Purchase Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>All these moneys, excepting those which are included in the three items that are voted here on the Estimates&mdash;R.I.C. pensions, local loans and excess stock&mdash;should be in the Land Purchase Fund and neither the Executive Council nor any other authority in this State has the right to authorise the removal of moneys from this Account.  If the Executive Council has power to establish a Suspense Account then they have power to put money elsewhere and <Col N="1008" /> what they have done is illegal and they have no right to do it.  They could do it, I expect, in respect of the £2,000,000 for the three items I have referred to, R.I.C. pensions, local loans, and excess stock, although it is questionable as to whether they should without Parliamentary sanction.  So far as this is concerned they had no authority whatever to do it, not even that of the celebrated lawyers on whose opinion they are partially acting.</P>
      <P>This legal opinion that they have got is just in accord with practically the whole proceedings.  Paragraph 7 of it commits a certain number of legal gentlemen to an absolute untruth.  They say on page 12: &ldquo;we may add that the state of Ireland in the years 1920-21, the Anglo-Irish war, the prohibition by Dáil Eireann of the payment of annuities&rdquo;&mdash;a thing that never happened&mdash;&ldquo;the non-collection and impossibility of collection of the annuities during these years, the outstanding fact that to all intents and purposes the annuities were a lost asset to the British, and the fact that the 1920 Act was on the Statute Book, are strong factors to be considered in interpreting the Treaty.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first part of that states that there was a &ldquo;prohibition by Dáil Eireann of the payment of the annuities.&rdquo; The President of the Executive Council, when questioned in respect of that, said that he had no knowledge of it and could not find it.  Nobody even heard of it.  There was no decree passed, and consequently on the face of it that is an untruth.  As to the second part of the statement about &ldquo;the non-collection and impossibility of collection of the annuities during these years,&rdquo; £138,000 was the lowest sum outstanding in a period of 11 years&mdash;during the period when they speak of &ldquo;the non-collection and impossibility of collection of the annuities.&rdquo; It is the same kind of advice we are getting in connection with the passing of this Act.  I observe that most of the meetings of the Executive Council are held after dinner.  I am not surprised, having regard to the results. The Executive Council have acted illegally in transferring moneys without the authority of the Dáil.  Having <Col N="1009" /> regard to whatever advice they have been receiving and our experience of them here during this week in which, confessedly, the President of the Executive Council committed himself to a statement a fortnight ago, a statement that was wrong in law, I am not satisfied that the Executive Council is well advised in this connection. Unfortunately, it is people other than themselves who will have to pay the price.  I oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not know what lawyer advised Deputy Cosgrave when he made the statement that the Executive Council has acted illegally in transferring to this particular account these moneys without the authority of the Dáil.  I do not know whether the lawyer to whom Deputy Cosgrave presumably went for advice in this matter was presented with a copy of the &ldquo;Irish Oifigiúil&rdquo; and had his attention drawn to the following wording at the end of the Statement of Accounts: &ldquo;Cash at bank to separate credit of British Claims Suspense Account.&rdquo;  Quite obviously there was more than one account involved in this matter.  There is only one account which is not at the absolute disposal of the Minister for Finance, and that is &ldquo;The Purchase Annuities Fund.&rdquo;  I do not know whether the lawyer's attention was drawn to the wording of Section 12 of the Land Act of 1923, or whether Deputy Cosgrave himself recollects the wording of it.  It says: that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in certain agreements that the purchase annuities in repayment of advances made or to be made in Saorstát Eireann &ldquo;in pursuance of purchase agreements under the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1891, or any later Land Purchase Act other than this Act shall so far as not already paid into the Exchequer be paid into a fund entitled &lsquo;the Purchase Annuities Fund&rsquo; to be established under the control of the Minister for Finance, and there shall from time to time, be paid thereout by the Minister for Finance to the appropriate authority,&rdquo; certain other moneys.</P>

      <P>This is the Second Reading of the Central Fund Bill, which has been expressed already by the Minister for Finance to be the occasion upon which an opportunity is to be given to people who have not discussed already that portion of the Estimates which arises for consideration&mdash;in fact, the general financial policy which arises for consideration when the Vote on Account comes forward&mdash;I wish to avail of the opportunity.</P>
      <P>We are actually asked here in Paragraph 2 of the Bill to allow the Minister to issue out of the Central Fund the sum of £7,985,460, and that sum has got to be related to the Estimates for Public Services for the year ending 31st March, 1934.  I am going to avail myself of the opportunity to which the Minister referred, to speak of the general financial situation in so far as that is brought under our view by these Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the back of this Volume of the Estimates, I find the total Estimates given as £22,039,951.  On the back of the corresponding Volume, circulated about the same time last year, the total sum is given as £21,969,000. There is, therefore, a difference of something less than £100,000 as between the two; but in order to get the sums properly related we have got to take out the various items from both of <Col N="1015" /> these which do not appear under the same form in the other.  I find that from the old Estimate of 1932-33 there have been deducted payments amounting to about £2,300,000.  From Vote 16 there is a deduction of £1,231,000, the payment for the pensions of R.I.C. and other people.  From Vote 8, Local Loans, there is subtracted the sum of £600,000&mdash;Local Loans payments heretofore paid out of the Exchequer of this country across the water.  In Vote 55 there is a payment for Excess Stock amounting to £134,000.  Those three payments amount to nearly £2,000,000.  In addition, Vote 25 has been reduced by £448,022.  Vote 25 is the Vote on the Agricultural Grant, the grant in relief of agricultural rates.  So, there has been deducted from the old amounts which are not now inserted those four sums of £1,231,000 in respect of R.I.C. and other pensions, £600,000 local loans, £134,000 excess stock and £448,000 in relief of the agricultural rate.  If we are to get an equation as between the two sets of Estimates for purposes of comparison, we have got to see what has been introduced into the new one, and the total of the new sums is very much the same as those to which I have referred.  There is a sum of £1,000,000 of an increase in Vote 8; an extra sum of £230,000 in Vote 7; and an additional sum of £360,000 in Vote 41, sub-head T&mdash;Housing.  There has been introduced into the Estimates&mdash;I suppose we will have it described here as being in the normal Budget&mdash;a sum of £100,000 for the purpose of providing milk.  It is now under 41 subhead K (2).  May I put these two sums in another relation?  It means that £2,000,000 that used to be paid out in R.I.C. pensions, in Local Loans and in Excess Stock, plus the money that used to go in relief of the agricultural rate, are now being diverted from the old purposes to these purposes&mdash;old age pensions, extra provision for housing, £100,000 for milk and £1,600,000 undetermined in its distribution, but going to be paid out for local loans.</P>
    <P>On that sum of £2,000,000 I want to make one other remark.  The pensions, <Col N="1016" /> local loans, and excess bonus stock &mdash;that is the £2,000,000&mdash;they collected this year, are presumably somewhere in the Suspense Account.  So, they will not be there any longer.  That means that if there were anything in the way of bounties paid out of the Suspense Account, that Account will be down by £2,000,000 next year.  And there will be £2,000,000 less.  At any rate, so far as the Central Fund Services are concerned, we are still without the Minister's promise of a reduction of £2,000,000 and he has got a full year at it now.  There was to have been a £2,000,000 reduction made without impairing the efficiency of the Service and without counting the money which was alleged not to be due under the Treaty.  As far as these two booklets are concerned, there is no difference.  The Estimates for the Public Services do not show the promised reduction of £2,000,000 even in any faked way.  We are still where we were.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Minister took for the purpose of the Budget calculation a Central Fund expenditure as shown by the Estimates for Public Services, and the first big addition that had to be made to that was the Central Fund moneys which are roughly about the same from year to year. Taking it on that basis&mdash;let us assume that they will be the same this year. Of course, if there is to be any borrowing they will be up still further&mdash;the Minister for Finance has made no economies in his estimates for the Public Services.  I do not say that there are likely to be any economies in the Central Fund Services. The Minister had a tot last year of £26,750,000 on these two items. He will not have less than that this year.  In addition to that issue there was a thing referred to as an Emergency Budget and various schemes for relief.  £1,000,000 of it was money borrowed on the credit of the Road Fund.  That fund is not capable of standing these borrowings always.  No matter what is done in that way, it is only a forestalling of what would be done ordinarily.  It only means that there is going to be a deprivation for a certain number of <Col N="1017" /> people in the years to come even if the fund can stand the charges.  In addition there were certain sums that were to be paid; special provision for unemployment relief, grants for housing, free grants for local authorities for public health schemes and additional relief in respect of rates on agricultural land.  There will be nothing this year for unemployment relief.  There is a small sum of £150,000 which is set out towards the scheme which must be completed before the end of this month.  There is no sum of money presented to us as likely to be voted at this moment for unemployment relief.  The Minister is going to have to find the same sum of money as before for what he calls his normal Budget.  The Agricultural Relief Grant is the mystery at the moment.  It is a sum of £1,200,000. Vote 25 shows that the sum of £900,000 is the Central Fund provision for relief on agricultural rates.  It used to be something short of £600,000, so there is about 1½ million pounds.  We have been told that the county councils are promised a reduction of about £400,000 in the moneys they used to get.  Is the Minister likely to come before us again for the amount of the 1¾ million pounds promised?  In connection with this £600,000 and £900,000 voted, we are £250,000 short.  Are the county councils to be told that they are to re-make their rates once more? I presume not.  The grants to them are, in all, I think, £450,000 plus the £250,000.  If this provision is right another £250,000 has to be voted in addition to the amount in the Estimates and in addition to the old sum which used to be carried in the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>What else is there for the relief of unemployment?  There is £100,000 for milk which goes into the ordinary Budget.  There is a sum of 1½ million pounds for local loans.  Is that a revelation of the full intention of the Government with regard to relief this year or are other sums to be voted? If that is so, we know the normal Budget of last year required the taxation of last year and something in addition.  But we have to meet an X £2,000,000 Vote, that is to be voted <Col N="1018" /> for the relief of X plus £250,000 because I think it is clear that that £250,000 has to be voted for the relief of agricultural rates.  Even if it is voted the relief at that rate is down by £400,000.  The Minister in the second year of his office, instead of showing a £2,000,000 reduction so often, and so vehemently, and so precisely promised, does not seem to be able to find anything for his new Budget in the nature of economy except it is economy on relief works. How do his prospects appear at this moment with regard to the old taxation yield and the amount of revenue estimated as likely to come from it?  There are a variety of ways in which one could make an estimate. One might take the taxation imposed, and the revenue calculated to be derived from it in the preceding 12 months.  Then see how much of it comes in in the 11 months and make a calculation of what the new taxation will bring in.  Then see what the yield of the 11 months has been and then make a calculation as to whether the Minister is likely to get the full return.  The prospects are no brighter. There is likelihood of a deficiency of not less than 1½ million pounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>One would like to have that explained.  There is also another side to it.  If people estimate to get a certain revenue against a certain expenditure, if the expenditure is more there must be some deficiency. Again, there are two or three ways of approaching what is the expenditure of 11 months or of 11 months and a <Col N="1019" /> bit.  There is the expenditure of the previous period; there is the average expenditure; what is the addition that will have to be made if there is additional expenditure.  I understand the calculation was made last night, that £2,000,000 was going to be the deficit.  Does the Minister feel satisfied that there will be only £2,000,000 upon the Estimates this year leaving out the other items?  I do not know whether I am interpreting the Minister as to what the corrective factor is.  If there is a deficit it may be met by handing over or impounding any cash if there is any free after borrowing, or agricultural grants in the Suspense Account.  It may be met in that way but that does not say that next year if the same cash is not there that the Minister can with equanimity face up to his Budget.  He cannot face up to a £2,000,000 deficit which he may meet this year, if he has the cash.  He will not have the cash next year but he has got to think of a year ahead. Do we see any prospect of reduced taxation in any way unless there is decreased expenditure?  Does this prospect give us any indication of reduced expenditure?</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister to go back and look up the very carefully considered financial Fianna Fáil statement in connection with the Estimates of 1930-31 and in reference to which they said they could save £2,000,000 and let him produce that saving.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I want to be helpful I could not do better than to ask the Party who promised the people that if they got into power they would effect a reduction of £2,000,000 on the Estimates to go back to the calculations <Col N="1020" /> they then made and to enforce the savings that they promised.  They said that after very careful consideration they could make these savings without impairing the efficiency of the services and without calculating the payments that were made to Great Britain. They said a saving of £2,000,000 could be made under these conditions.  Let us start with the £2,000,000.  It will balance the deficiency in this year's accounts.  If it is likely that there will be a deficit this year and that expenditure is not going to be reduced, and that the present taxation is not going to bring in what it is estimated to yield to the Exchequer, and that a deficit of somewhere between £2,000,000 and £2,500,000 cannot be reduced then they have to do either of two things. They must have fresh taxation or borrowing and we would like to see the Minister for Finance deriding his purest ideas of last year on the question of borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one last calculation that has got to be made in this matter and that is the question of the Suspense Account.  I think it was about July, 1932, the statement was made that the moneys which, heretofore, had been paid partly to the British Government to meet certain debts and partly to the bondholders&mdash;as far as the annuities were concerned it was paid entirely to the bondholders in order to recoup them for the moneys they had previously lent or that their predecessors in title had lent for the buying out of land&mdash;were to be put to a Suspense Account.  That statement was made in July.  There was no mention of the Suspense Account as far as the national accounts of the country were concerned until this year, and in a footnote in the &ldquo;Gazette&rdquo; of the 10th January of this year we get the statement that the amount of cash at bank to the separate credit of British claims was £4,204,000. Where was the money held before that? At what bank?  There was some bank I am sure in which it was held, and it was cash.  If it was cash at bank what was the interest on it?  That is what we would like to know.  How much of the sum of £4,204,000 represents interest?  How did these payments accrue, at what rate were <Col N="1021" /> they lodged, in what bank and at what rate of interest?  We are told that there was cash at hand to the separate credit of British claims in a Suspense Account to the amount of £4,677,000, on March 14, but we have also to look at other items in these accounts which show that the Exchequer had obligations at least to the amount of 4½ millions in Exchequer Bills. There have been repayments of 2 millions, but there was a previous carry over of a million debit.  There were, therefore, 3½ millions outstanding in Exchequer Bills repayable at the end of this month.  If so, where is the money to come from for their repayment? Is there any Suspense Account mortgaged against that?  In other words, have we been pretending that we have had these moneys while in fact we have been borrowing in order to fill up the Suspense Account?</P>
    <P>Take the 3½ millions due on Exchequer Bills.  There is £4,677,000 cash stated to be held in the Suspense Account.  Then what is the amount free for distribution from the Suspense Account?  Some days ago we voted a sum of £1,616,000.  Has that passed out of the accounts yet or where is the money to come from for it?  When it appears, as it must appear under the heading of moneys paid out on expenditure on supply services this year, will we find that either the Suspense Account money has been lowered or that the Exchequer balance has been lowered?  What is the position between these four items&mdash;Exchequer balance, Exchequer bill borrowing, cash in Suspense Account and the £1,616,000 voted?  What is the net effect or what sum is there in suspense capable of being used to meet, say, the 2 million deficit in the Budget of this year? Again I would like if the Minister could relate the four of these things which are certainties and the result of these four, and of the fifth, which is at any rate possible if not probable, when he talks of cash, of an Exchequer balance favourable, when he talks of a Suspense Account which is said to be cash, in this formal account presented under the authority of the Government. There is cash in suspense of £4,677,000, and there is an Exchequer balance. <Col N="1022" /> Then let us think that one of these days, because the hurry about the Bill we have passed is to get freedom for the release of £1,616,000, let us think of that amount passing out of the account and let us think that there is some sum payable in Exchequer bills by the end of the month.  What is the net result?  Is the money that is said to be on hands enough to cover the deficiency which at this moment appears in the national accounts?  Is it enough to cover the deficiency that is likely to accrue at the end of the financial year?</P>
    <P>I want to stress the point about the Suspense Account for this reason, that I do not think people have yet got it into their heads that this year we have had the full benefit, not merely of the retention of the land annuities, but of the pension moneys and the other sums withheld.  I wonder is anybody going to be very happy, after we have looted all we can from those two accounts this year, if not even half as much will be available for distribution next year?  If the Budget is to be balanced, if these Exchequer Bills have got to be repaid by the end of the year, and if a sum of £1,616,000 has to go out in the supply funds this year after we have got away with the whole thing there is nothing to be distributed.  We have in fact distributed to the people of the country all that has been taken from the British.</P>
    <P>I want to see how that will work out next year.  There is said to be £4,667,000 to our credit in the Suspense Account.  Supposing all the annuities had been paid and that there were no defalcations, no arrears in the annuities which should be paid, and all the moneys had gone into the Suspense Account, there would be a sum of about £3,000,000 available from that source. The sums for the R.I.C. pensions, for local loans, for the excess stock, amount actually, as this year's Estimates show, to £1,966,000, let us say £2,000,000.  There should be therefore £5,000,000 in that account.  Two millions of that will not go into a Suspense Account next year because they are not provided for in the Estimates.  They are in the Estimates <Col N="1023" /> for other purposes or at least sums of money equivalent to them are in the Estimates for other purposes.  The Estimates have been reduced by these amounts and instead there is the equivalent for local loans, old age pensions, housing and milk.  That is equated by the pensions, local loans, excess stock and the £440,000 taken from the moneys that used to go in relief of the agricultural rates.  But the £2,000,000 will not go into the Suspense Account next year.  How much of the purchase money will go into the Suspense Account if we still carry it forward in a notional way?  The full sum that used to be collected and that used to be paid out to the bondholders, in relation to land purchase transactions, was £4,000,000&mdash;£3,000,000 under the Acts prior to the 1923 Act and roughly £1,000,000 under the 1923 Act. Next year, we are not going to collect any part of the first gale.  That means that £2,000,000 is gone and we are going to collect half of the next gale, £1,000,000.  What has got to be paid out?  The payments to the bondholders under the 1923 Act are not in dispute. They have got to receive their moneys and their moneys amount to nearly £1,000,000, so that there is no Suspense Account next year.  The Minister this morning referred to March hares.  Does he remember when Alice and the Mad Hatter sat down together and the Hatter said to Alice: &ldquo;Have some wine&rdquo; and her reply was: &ldquo;I do not see any&rdquo; and his retort was: &ldquo;There is not any&rdquo;?  The Minister is going to say this year to the people who are looking for money in relief of agricultural rates: &ldquo;Have some of the new £250,000 and the old £190,000 for relief of agricultural rates.&rdquo;  The farmers will say: &ldquo;We do not see it,&rdquo; and the Minister replies: &ldquo;It is not there.&rdquo; Deputy Norton will be asking one of these days: &ldquo;What about the £350,000 for relief works and this Supplementary Emergency Budget of three million odd pounds.  Let us have some relief&rdquo; and the Minister says: &ldquo;Have relief,&rdquo; but it is not there, either.</P>
    <P>Where is the money to be got?  If I am right in my contention that the <Col N="1024" /> Suspense Account money has already been, in fact, distributed and that really what we have got against that money in the Suspense Account is mainly a debt, the Exchequer bill borrowings, the fund from which bounties were paid is not going to be there next year, and the fund from which all these payments were made which were supposed to help those in the front line in the economic war are not going to be there.  I think my calculation is correct on that point. The £2,000,000, the pensions, the excess stock, the local loans moneys are diverted to other purposes.  Three millions that ought to be collected&mdash; what would have been in the Suspense Account or, notionally is in the Suspense Account this year&mdash;but there is only going to be 50 per cent. of the second gale collected&mdash;£1,000,000 out of £4,000,000 and, no matter what trouble there may be over the bondholders under the Acts prior to the 1923 Act, there is no trouble about the bondholders under the 1923 Act.  They have got to get £1,000,000 and that is the only sum that is going to be taken from the annuity payments this year.  There is no Suspense Account next year. There is no money from which to pay bounties and the Labour Party that was so vocal here the other day because of the Government's 24/- a week on relief works this year, I think, finds itself regretting that it ever criticised that 24/-.  It will not be there to be given next year unless it is going to be raised by extra taxation. That is the point that most people are going to pause at.</P>
    <P>The economies are not shown.  The revenue as estimated for this year as against expenditure as estimated for this year does not bring any hope that there is going to be a balance.  If there is no reduction and last year's taxation does not meet the expenditure on last year, which is the same as this year, then we are going to have a deficiency and there is going to be extra taxation to meet it.  If we are going to have relief works and if we are not going to deprive the farmers of this £250,000 which is required to make up the difference between the promise made by the Minister for Local <Col N="1025" /> Government to them and the sums that we know are likely to be voted, there is another £250,000 to be found.  Is there anything else in the way of relief to be given, and, if not, do we then enter on this second year of this war in this way, that the farmer has got certain remission, so far as his annuity payment is concerned, he has got his agricultural rates increased, and he has no fund from which there can be paid anything in the way of bounties or helps to him because he is bearing the whole brunt of the struggle?  At any rate, that would seem to be the prospect as foreshadowed by the Estimates put before us and in respect of which we are taking this particular Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>There is just one last point.  What is the reaction to all this on the local authorities going to be?  There is a definite attempt being made now&mdash;it can clearly be seen&mdash;to shift the burden of meeting the trouble which the Government has caused on to the shoulders of the local authorities. The amount that used to be paid for agricultural relief has been reduced. They have got to remake their rate. They were promised full derating, of course, but that was like the £2,000,000 economies.  A sum of £1,600,000 is put in the new Estimates for local loans. Is that going to be a grant or is it a loan?  If it is a loan, then, what are we doing?  This central authority is acting as a bank to local authorities; it is going to lend money to them at a rate which will remunerate the central authority for the money it pays out, and then there will be an attempt made to cast odium on the local authorities for charges it will have to make for any works which these local authorities do under the £1,600,000 Vote here in the Local Loans Estimate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish has pleaded here, every time this matter comes up, that if there is going to be any money lent it should be lent at very low rates of interest.  We should have some expression as to the policy of the Government in relation to this £1,600,000.  Is it going to be a grant <Col N="1026" /> or a loan?  If it is a loan, at what rate is it to be given and is it to be at a full rate which will remunerate the Government?  The local authorities probably see themselves in this position at a time when pretty nearly every member of the Labour Party who spoke in this House on the 1st March said that the life of a public man was becoming impossible, and the four of them who spoke related that phrase to the life of a public man in relation to the local authority system.  Deputy Davin hoped that we were not far away from the day when the Government would put its declared policy into operation and relieve the ratepayer of the responsibility for providing home assistance. He said further that he hoped</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that the policy would carry with it an acceptance of a national responsibility for the maintenance of the able-bodied unemployed and the determination not to allow the financial responsibility to be borne.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And Deputy Davin added this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;as it is being borne to an increasing degree by the ratepayers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was before Deputy Davin had any knowledge of what was ahead of him next year.  Deputy Everett said it was a scandal to get a man into work because, owing to starvation and unemployment in the area, he was forced to accept rates that he otherwise would not take.  He it was who used the picturesque phrase, later on, of &ldquo;the present wave of unemployment.&rdquo; Deputy Everett then continued and gave his experiences of local authorities:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The boards of health are overburdened at present.  We have deputations and marches from the unemployed demanding maintenance because they have got letters from the Local Government Department pointing out that it is their duty to go to the board of health.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The provision that has to be made up to the present would be some way useful in normal circumstances, but the present situation is not normal.  It is altogether abnormal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> Deputy Corish said at the same time:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... Owing to the abnormal situation prevailing in the country at the moment, I am very sorry to say that, in my opinion, the amounts allocated are absolutely inadequate&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>and then he added this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;with the result that the life of a public man at the moment is not to be envied.  We have demonstrations and marches by the unemployed and they are not to be blamed because they are faced with the situation where their wives and their families and themselves are faced with starvation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He wound up by saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I should like to stress the position with which local authorities are faced as a result of the abnormal demand which is being made for home help at the moment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the situation on the 1st March, before they had any idea of what was ahead of them.  When they get these Estimates they will know how much worse the new situation is going to be than the old.  They have already got the shock of the reduction in the agricultural relief grant and they will find, when they come to look at this whole business, no provision made for unemployment as before, but, instead, the clear intention that there is going to be thrown on to the shoulders of the local authorities the responsibility of making provision for unemployment while the Government simply contents itself with acting as the banker and supplying the money and that, so far as we know at the moment, from the refusals made by the Minister for Finance to agree to Deputy Corish's suggestions, interest is going to be charged at a rate that will sufficiently remunerate any money the Government lends.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances the farmer has to face the certainty of the continuance of the present situation with the outlet, the only outlet, as has been proved, for his surplus agricultural produce, blocked, with the relief given <Col N="1028" /> to him cut down, with the rates likely to rise higher still because of the necessity for home assistance, a necessity that has been increased by reason of the policy of the Government.  When all that is considered the farmer has to think still further.  The great volume of relief given to him last year by means of bounties and other things, will be considerably curtailed.  The fund out of which this relief used to be paid is now depleted.  There is no money there to be paid into it.  The farmer has to face the future with rates higher, with the demand for home assistance growing day by day, with the fund, out of which provision was made, by way of bounties, to help him to get over barriers raised against his produce, depleted, and with no question of getting bounties in the future.</P>
    <P>These are the items that I think properly fall for consideration on this Vote, based upon the Estimates of this year, Estimates which fail to show the promised £2,000,000 reduction.  There is no indication that in any other respect expenditure is going to be cut down, excepting the possibility that there will be a reduction in the expenditure on relief as compared with last year.  There is an item of £100,000 for milk and then there are the extra moneys for housing.  Excepting these two items, the only thing that there is a possibility of there being a saving on is the provision by way of relief and that is the first thing that has been cut down this year.  In so far as this booklet shows anything, it indicates that £440,000 has been taken out of the Estimates. There is no provision made for schemes for unemployment relief and there is a reduction in the grant in relief of the agricultural rates.  Those are the only things in which any attempt at saving has been made and probably it is along these lines we are going to pursue economies.</P>
    <P>That was not the promise made to the unfortunate fools who were led to support economic war by people who say at one moment: &ldquo;Of course our produce is going to be bought,&rdquo; and at <Col N="1029" /> another moment: &ldquo;It is a blessing in disguise, and we will have to stop the present system of production and get to some other method that will be more economic.&rdquo;  Let us hope we will get some clear indication of what the new policy is, what the new system of production is going to be, what the profits accruing to the people are likely to be in comparison with what they had in the past.  We should also have some idea when the change is going to be regarded as completed.  We must not forget that in the transition period there will undoubtedly be needed vast sums of money for the relief of farmers and people in the towns, both of whom are suffering. This Estimate holds out no hope to either.</P>
    <P>There are none of the promised economies, and we have no statement from the Minister as to his Budget prospects.  We have had no explanation as to what the situation next year is likely to be in relation to the moneys in the Suspense Account.  All these things might have been spoken about by the Minister if he had not been so much interested and in such a hurry to get through this and the other measure.  I am still of the opinion that the only explanation about the rush with regard to this morning's business is that money is urgently required for the purpose of balancing the Budget.  We have only three weeks to wait for the Budget, only three weeks and then we will be in a position to see whether my prophecy is fulfilled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to follow other Deputies by introducing election propaganda.  I have listened to this debate and I am frankly disappointed. Coming fresh from the country, I am aware that the people there are looking eagerly to this House for a solution of their difficulties. There are some who have argued that the situation in the country is not nearly so bad as is represented.  I have no concern with either of the big political parties; I represent the plain country people.  I am a member of the farming community, a community <Col N="1030" /> that has to bear many burdens at the present time.  Scoring petty points in debate here affords little comfort to the average farmer.  What we want those in authority to do is to grapple with the serious situation in which we find ourselves.  We would like to hear of some remedy for existing difficulties.</P>
      <P>I have listened very attentively to speeches made by responsible Government Deputies and I have not yet learned the Government's policy in regard to agriculture.  Last year, when the land annuities question was under review and when it was decided to withhold the annuities, we were told the Government had an alternative market for us, but later this alternative market did not materialise, and since July of last year the farming community have been faced with a serious situation from the point of view of the sale of their produce.  If the Executive Council have any definite plan in regard to the future of agriculture, we would be very glad to hear of it.  When approached on the question quite recently, the President said that the country had given a definite answer at the last election; the country had put the Fianna Fáil Party into a responsible position.  Fianna Fáil is in power with a majority of one over all other Parties in the House.  It is their duty to carry out the promises they made to the people.</P>
      <P>I maintain that the people who are suffering had not the voice in the election they should have had.  The people who are mainly responsible for the present position are people who had votes but no responsibility.  We are faced with a reduction in the agricultural grant to the extent of almost half a million pounds.  We were promised, but have not been granted, full derating such as the people on the other side of the Border have.  This is a keen disappointment.  I was at an agricultural meeting on Monday at which this matter was under review. The position, as we find it, is that the basic rate in our county will be higher and the grant towards the relief of rates will be lower.  It is the old story. Our income is fast diminishing and our expenditure is rising every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> We are told that we ought to be satisfied with the remission of half of the annuities.  I have been up and down the country as much as any other person, and the annuities question was not a burning question, because it was felt by those paying the annuities that they in the future possibly not themselves but at least their successors would live to see the time when the annuities would cease because they would be fully paid up.  The land annuities are not the big thing in agriculture at the present time.  Overhead expenses, rates, insurances, and other demands quite overshadow the annuities.  We are glad of any remission of the annuities just as a drowning man will catch at a straw or anything that will keep him afloat longer.  That is the only reason that the people of the country are accepting what is being offered to them at the present time.  But we are not getting back to bedrock.  The question is where are we to get the money for our industries and how are we to carry them on?  It is all right to have half the annuities remitted, but how are we to meet the rest of our liabilities? Take the case of a man paying an annuity of £20 a year on, say, a £20 valuation.  I come from a county where considerably more than half of the occupiers of the land in the county are under £15 valuation.  What great prospect has the remission of half of that annuity for such a man?  Say the annuity is £10, then the remission would be £5.  That is all the relief they are being offered.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has caused a great deal of alarm is the manner in which the agricultural grant is to be allocated.  We are told, according to the circular issued to the local authorities, that farmers in order to get relief must employ one male worker for every £10 of their valuation, otherwise they will not get the maximum relief.  Are we going to be turned into a country of market gardeners?  I cannot conceive of any farmer being able to employ one man for each £10 valuation, if he is to produce on anything like an economic basis.  We heard a good deal yesterday about the <Col N="1032" /> despised 24/- a week.  Even taking the wage on that basis that would mean £62 8/- a year for the farmer to pay to each labourer.  I suppose I may take it that on an average thirteen acres of arable land would be valued at £10.  I ask how could the farmer get £62 8/- out of every thirteen acres he farms? The thing is absurd.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the big question which was discussed yesterday with regard to the bounties I have to say that the Minister for Finance made a valiant effort to prove that the bounties on cattle are passed on to the farmers. I am quite aware that some bounties did go to the farmers.  Owing to their peculiar nature the bounties on turkeys were passed on to the farmers.  The bounty on butter goes to the farmer. But I must say and I am in a position to know, that the bounties on cattle have not been passed on to the farmers. If the Minister has time I would like if he would accompany me to a fair to-morrow and he will see for himself that no bounty on cattle is being passed on.</P>
    <P>When we begin to make comparisons I think we should always compare nearly identical situations.  Owing to where I live I attend as many markets and fairs north of the Border as on this side of the Border and I am in a position to know what is happening. The nature of the work of the farmers on both sides of the Border is identical.  We are tillage farmers, raising cattle and getting them as far as we can on for the grazier.  What is the position?  On this side of the Border a man buys a £10 beast at the fair.  Before he exports it across that beast will carry a £4 duty.  That is what the farmer should get for it at the other side of the Border in order to make his own.  I want to say that there is no competition for cattle at our fairs at this side of the Border other than by those buyers who try&mdash; and some of them do succeed&mdash;to avoid the duty.  That is the only competition there is in Free State fairs for our cattle.</P>
    <P>If we take the question of pork I am sure the bounty is being paid but yet <Col N="1033" /> one can take it that on the average we get 10/- a cwt. less for our pork than is paid for it across the Border.  Then take the question of eggs.  These have been the mainstay of the cottage farmer and, indeed, of all farmers who have been meeting their grocer's bill out of them.  What is happening in the case of eggs?  In Ardee yesterday, as I was on my way in, I saw that eggs were being sold at 5d. per dozen. Across the Border last week second grade eggs were worth 1/- a dozen. The bounties cannot be passed on in these cases.</P>
    <P>The situation is critical and the farmers are now facing the problem of putting in another crop and what is likely to be the result?  We have still a great deal of last year's crops on hands and we have last year's cattle on hands.  What are we to do with them?  Our demands are just as much now as they were when the prices for our produce were considerably higher. What is the prospect in front of the farmer?  The Minister yesterday and to-day said that certain expenditure was not met in better times than the present.  Admittedly the times are not good.  They are very critical times and the farmer finds it hard to meet his outgoings.  My plea is that we should face the situation as men; we ought to think of ourselves first and in this matter we should be all Sinn Feiners and get out of this economic situation in which we are placed.</P>
    <P>Let us hate the British people as much as we like but, for Heaven's sake, let us not cut off the one avenue in which to sell our produce.  There has been a good deal of talk that we here in the Free State are far better off than the people in a similar situation across the Border.  The leader of the Farmers' Party here used words from which I rather inferred that was his view.  Now I am in a position to speak on that.  I have been watching the Border situation since the inception of these tariffs and in no case that has come to my knowledge have we succeeded in inducing an individual farmer in Northern Ireland to come over and buy a farm in the Saorstát &mdash;not even have we succeeded in inducing a Nationalist farmer to do <Col N="1034" /> it.  The situation is critical for the farmers.  We have tried our best with our farms in order to make the most out of them.  We have followed and adopted the schemes proposed by the Department of Agriculture; we have at present, in operation, schemes for the improvement of our cattle, pigs and the produce of our poultry, and we are not in any sense big grazier people.  We are people who till the land, people who are not afraid to work, but we want to see some prospect before us when we do till the land.  We would like if the responsible members of the Government would tell us what prospect there is for next year's crops and next year's cattle which we are to raise.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I would like to emphasise in connection with the Vote for the Land Commission. It has been the practice in regard to the resumption of land that when it comes to fixing the price there is an appeal to the land court.  After the land court has fixed what is a right price for the land which they purport to acquire, it is not right for the Land Commission to reduce the price any further.  I have a case in mind in my own county in which an agitation was kept up for the division of a certain farm.  The agitation was so far persisted in that the owner said: &ldquo;take the land.&rdquo;  He had another farm alongside.  After the Land Commission had agreed to take the land and had fixed the price, he sold his other farm because he was not in a position to carry on.  He also sold his stock and implements.  The Land Commission sent him word, after he had done all that, that they did not require his land and that he could do what he liked with it.  That is not fair play.  If a court of the land decide, without appeal, that a certain thing is right, after hearing the two sides, it should be binding on one side as well as on the other.  It is a poor thing to make a fool of a man after all the agitation there was about the land and after he had put his cards on the table and destroyed the market for his land.  I do not want to make the lot of the people responsible for carrying on Government in this country <Col N="1035" /> any harder but, as one who is in contact with the land, I know how lettings are going.  Farms belonging to widows and orphans and people who are no longer able to work them are being let and the owners cannot get their rates, rent and taxes for the land, not to speak of interest on the capital.  That is not as it should be but it serves as a barometer of the times.  I make these few remarks in the hope that the Minister will let us know where he is leading us in agriculture in the economic situation in which we find ourselves.</P>

      <P>This Central Fund Bill, which includes the items discussed last evening on the Vote on Account, is an eloquent indication of the mentality of the Government as affecting agriculture.  Like Deputy Haslett, I come from the land.  What struck me very forcibly with regard to this discussion was that a lot of people on every side of the House have been straining at the gnat after swallowing the camel.  The three outstanding things in this Vote on Account are: the reduction in the Agricultural Grant, the reduction in the Vote for Agriculture, and the reduction in the Vote for the Land Commission.  Those three Votes are more intimately connected with the farming community than any of the others.  After the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party had destroyed the farmer's markets, after that Party had taken away whatever chance he had of maintaining himself in any decency, they have gone further and cut down every Vote that would afford relief to the farmers.  Take the Vote on Agriculture itself.  I have been obliged by being supplied with a copy of the Estimates for the coming year.  The Vote on Agriculture, I find, is suffering to the extent of about £90,000.  The reductions are made up mainly of such <Col N="1036" /> items as: improvement of milk, improvement of live stock, loans for agricultural purposes, improvement of cow-testing associations, provision of dairy bulls and provision of stock pigs. Was it not quite sufficient for the Government to have taken the market from the farmers without taking away from them the assistance afforded by the late Government in the provision of services which are absolutely necessary to the farming community?  In the Agricultural Grant we have a reduction of over £449,000.  If we add to that the reduction in the Land Commission Estimate and the reduction in the Estimate for Agriculture, we get practically three-quarter of a million pounds.  However, I understand that part of the reduction in the Land Commission Estimate is due to some new arrangement with regard to excess land stock.  Even allowing for that, there would be a reduction of £50,000 or £60,000 in the Land Commission Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I am told that after provision has been made for excess land stock, there still remains £50,000 or £60,000 of a reduction in the Land Commission Estimate.  I do not know what that £50,000 or £60,000 represents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It represents a reduction on account of advances in lieu of interest.  That is due to the fact that vesting is now taking place much more expeditiously than heretofore. The land is being divided more quickly&mdash;&mdash;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to come from a county where the people are clamouring for the division of land and yet no division is going on.  It has been at a complete standstill there.  Perhaps Fianna Fáil is going to make provision <Col N="1037" /> in the coming year for that; certainly it is not going on in our place at present.</P>
      <P>What is going to be the effect of all this on the State?  This reduction of the agricultural grant may appear to the Ministry to be quite a small matter. I was amazed yesterday evening at the speech of the Minister for Education. I never thought that the farming community were so well off as they are until I heard the Minister for Education.  He told us of all the things the Government had done for agriculture&mdash;the grants that had been given and the relief that had been given.  The change over of Fianna Fáil from this side of the House to the other side has made a profound change in the minds of the Fianna Fáil Deputies.  Have they learned any lesson from the fact that they have been obliged to bring in a Bill to halve the annuities?  Have they learned any lesson from the fact that their own Minister for Local Government has had to circularise and re-circularise the county councils and the local authorities to try to get in the rates? Has that taught the Ministry no lesson? If the agricultural community are as content and as well off as the Minister for Education would have us believe, what is the necessity for halving the annuities?  What is the necessity for trying to get in rates, 50 per cent. of which are still uncollected?  What is the compensatory advantage to be offered to the local authorities for this cutting down of the agricultural grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are to have increased loan facilities.  What is the meaning of that?  Deputy McGilligan, referring to this matter, said that it meant nothing more than that the Government were becoming the bankers for the local authorities, and that they were lending money at a rate of interest which would repay the Government.  I think, with all respect to Deputy McGilligan, that he has not any experience of local government or he would go much further than that.  I have never known a loan taken up by a local authority for any purpose, particularly for building purposes, that has not made a charge <Col N="1038" /> upon the local authority later on in some shape or form.  In reply to a question asked here the other day with regard to 14 cottages under construction in County Leix, the Minister for Local Government gave certain figures.  He said the estimated cost was £5,300; the contractor's price was £5,020; the actual cost to date, £8,333; and to complete the work it would take £8,505.  How is the local authority to come out of that?  That would be very interesting for Deputy Norton.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton yesterday on the Vote on Account asked the Government to take steps to see that local authorities would take advantage of these loans and build houses.  I happen to be connected with a local authority for a number of years and I am quite as anxious to see houses built as Deputy Norton or any other Deputy. But while a situation like this is confronting the country: that the Government is forced to reduce the annuities by half and to circularise local authorities to make some attempt to get in rates; while the farming community is in the position it is at present, not able to pay lawful debts, I certainly am not prepared to increase further the liability on the ratepayers and embarrass them further by taking advantage of a loan which will increase the liabilities and increase the rates.</P>

      <P>I would like Deputy Norton to work that out.  I do not know whether Deputy Norton is connected <Col N="1039" /> with a local authority or not, but I happen to be connected with one for a considerable number of years. Perhaps I have not absorbed this question as well as Deputy Norton but this is my experience of it.  In former years the old district councils built labourers' cottages and in our county the initial cost was supposed to be covered by a rent of 2/- a week.  It was covered on paper if you like, but with depreciation, repairs, etc., a certain liability fell on the ratepayers.  At the present time in Roscommon, according to the estimate of our engineer, we cannot let cottages at less than 3/- per week.  We think that we will be very lucky if we get out by letting them at 3/- but the people say they cannot pay 3/-.  If we let them at 2/- we put a burden of 1/-, per week per cottage on the ratepayers, plus the charge for depreciation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have as good engineers as Deputy Norton has.  I am sure he will agree with me that if we do borrow for housing we will have to make some contribution out of the rates.  How are we going to do that at present, when the Fianna Fáil policy has deprived the agricultural community of their markets?  Not alone have the agricultural community been deprived of their markets, but the Government have now cut down the services from which they would get any benefit.  They have cut down all the services which were essential to the progress and well-being of the agricultural community.  I am not a pessimist by any means, but I am afraid that this Central Fund Bill is an indication of the writing on the wall. Where the money is to come from I do not know.  We know the position of the agricultural community.  We have <Col N="1040" /> the Department of Agriculture complaining that the agricultural community are not purchasing any manures this year.  Why is that?  Why is it that the agricultural community have not paid rates and annuities this year? Because they have not the money. Now they are to be further deprived of what they considered was their right. The local authorities have been treated with the utmost contempt in this matter.  They met to consider their estimates.  The Local Government Department never budged about what they were going to do.  The local authorities met again and confirmed the estimates.  When all that was done the Minister for Local Government sent for the secretaries of the county councils and told them that the agricultural grant was to be reduced considerably.  That was treating the local authorities with contempt.  They waited until the local authorities had made what they thought was full provision for the public services, which was the right and proper thing to do. The Roscommon County Council, in considering the road estimate, were very careful not to cut it down, because they wanted to make provision where possible for employment.  They felt that they were taking on an obligation which should not be the obligation of a local authority, viz., the provision of employment apart from the ordinary necessities of road work.  The county council passed the estimate in full feeling that they were at least getting the same agricultural grant that they got last year.  When we had done all that, and when we could not re-open the matter, the Minister for Local Government invited the secretary up to Dublin to tell him that the grants were going to be reduced by something like £14,000 in the County Roscommon, and the rates there will in consequence be increased by something like 1/2 in the £.  We cannot get in last year's rates.  The merchants cannot get in their shop debts.  The farmers are not able to pay for their manures.  We have it on the authority of the Department of Agriculture that no manures are being bought.  To my mind, that is one of the most serious things that ever happened in an agricultural country like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> It is a most serious thing that the farmers have not put out artificial manure because they are not able to pay for it.  That is the situation; I know it; I am living amongst them; I am at their fairs; I am at their markets; I am one of them.  I know that that is the situation at the present time.  The people are not able to pay their just debts.  They are not able to pay for artificial manures. They have not paid a very large amount of their rates yet; they have not paid their annuities.  I am sure, as I said a while ago, that it is the writing on the wall, but some people on the Front Benches on the opposite side will refuse to see that writing. I say that before we are absolutely down and out some consideration should be given to the agricultural community.  The Government may think that because of certain concessions which they have made towards the agricultural community they have done their part.  I should like them to ask their back benchers up from the country to say honestly what is the situation in the country.  If they do, and if there is any honesty left in the Front Bench they certainly will take some steps to end the economic war which is the cause of that situation in the country.</P>
    <P>What are we being offered by way of compensation for our live stock trade? We are being asked to grow wheat.  I remember in 1928 the present President of the Executive Council asked in this House that an Economic Committee be set up to consider the growing of wheat in this country.  I remember at that time that the figure put up by President de Valera, the present Minister for Agriculture and the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, as the lowest figure which could be offered to the farmers who grew wheat, was 30/- or 31/- per barrel. That was in 1928.  The farmers of this country could well afford at that time, considering the prices they were getting for their agriculture produce and live stock, to grow wheat for nothing in comparison to now.  Yet we are asked now to substitute wheat at 23/6 per barrel for our live stock trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> I think it would be really superfluous for me to comment further unless the Government wakes up, unless the Government realises and after realising takes action.  There is no use in realising.  The Minister for Agriculture realised quite recently that if we had increased tillage in this country it would also mean an increase of live stock.  Those are the words of the Minister for Agriculture, and they are perfectly true.  If that is so, how are we going to exist without a live-stock market?  If this Government cannot do something to relieve the situation, if they cannot do something to win the economic war, then they should, for goodness sake, get out and let somebody in who will.</P>

      <P>There are just one or two matters which I wish to hear something about.  As to the National Housing Board, I would like to know what the activities of this particular Board are.  They have been in existence some three or four months.  When they were appointed I put down a question, but the information I got did not help a lot.  Those three gentlemen are costing the country in or about £2,000 per annum, but, so far, I have heard nothing of what they have done.  Would it be possible, seeing they have so much time, that they might advise different boards of health throughout the country as to the best means of carrying on under the Housing Act of 1932?  I think they could give very useful help in that respect.  They might also make inquiries as to the number of houses that are needed in each county.  I am sorry that Deputy Norton has left, because in the course of his remarks last night he said that the holding up of the building operations under the 1932 Act was in no small way due to the members of the local authorities who are members of this Party and also members of the Centre Party. I think that for the holding up of the building operations Deputy Norton and his Party are as much responsible as Fianna Fáil, because they brought us to the position in the country that the local authorities are not able to <Col N="1043" /> build, and all blame should not be put on the local authorities.  The Galway Board of Health, which is three-quarters Fianna Fáil, and the Galway County Council, the majority of whose members are Fianna Fáil, have recommended that in Galway County a hundred cottages should be built. Fancy a hundred cottages in a county like Galway&mdash;ten for each union!  I have here a resolution of the Athenry Housing Organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The county council have recommended the building of a hundred cottages.  I have here a copy of a resolution passed by the Athenry Housing Organisation in which they have applied for sixty houses in that one town.  I can tell the Minister that nineteen of those applicants are married men who are living in rooms and paying from 6/- to 10/- per week.  Under the scheme of the Galway Board of Health we will probably get two houses in that area. Fourteen of the houses which are at present occupied by applicants are condemned by the Medical Officer of Health.  I do not place all the blame on the Galway Board of Health or on the Galway County Council.  A good deal of the blame should be placed on Fianna Fáil and Deputy Norton's Party, because by the reduction of the agricultural grant County Galway loses 1s. 3d. in the £.</P>

      <P>I suggest that this is a Bill to provide certain moneys out of <Col N="1044" /> the Central Fund.  Yesterday we had a discussion on the Vote on Account, in which the advisability of providing these moneys for certain special services could properly have been discussed. I think that on the Central Fund Bill discussion should confine itself to ways and means of raising the money.</P>

      <P>On the point raised by the Minister, it is not desirable to have a duplication of yesterday's debate; in fact it is neither usual nor desirable to have a long discussion on the Central Fund Bill at all. Owing to an arrangement come to yesterday the Vote was taken at a certain hour.  There were certain Deputies anxious to speak.  On the one or two occasions on which a debate has taken place on the Central Fund Bill it was largely a continuation to the debate on the Vote on Account.  The Deputies called on to-day were Deputies who had not an opportunity of speaking yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to illustrate the point as to why the local authorities cannot build.  More unemployment <Col N="1045" /> has been caused for the past twelve months and the ratepayers are asked to pay 8d. in the £ towards its relief and this is being caused by the Fianna Fáil Government.  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce came into office in February, 1932, he said he wanted about eight months in which to relieve unemployment.  What has he done in twelve months towards relieving unemployment?  We had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance a few days ago telling us the people of the country were so prosperous and that the farmers were so prosperous and what the Government was doing for them.  The prosperous farmer is getting £1 a ton for his potatoes; 8d. a score for eggs; and the £2, which he formerly received for his sheep, is down to £1 &mdash;these are the people who are prosperous at the present time.  We had a suggestion the other day from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that the ratepayers should look out and that the Government should not be responsible any longer for the able-bodied unemployed and that they have got to go back on the rates.  If that is so there is going to be a big change in the rates next year.  I say that is one of the possible reasons why local authorities are not taking advantage of the Housing Bill of 1932.  It is not because they are supporters of Cumann na nGaedheal that they have tried to hold up the building of houses.  They are just as anxious as Fianna Fáil are that houses should be built but when they want to have houses they want to see their way to pay for them first.</P>

      <P>Some of the members are rather at a disadvantage in discussing these Estimates.  Of course, there are advance copies but the ordinary members are without them.  I do not wish, therefore, to discuss the Estimates in detail.  I merely wish to refer to one particular Vote.  It has been mentioned here that some of the Deputies are covering more ground under this than they are supposed to, but I would like to point out to the House that on the arrangements we were told that we would have the Estimates in front of us yesterday.  We <Col N="1046" /> are still discussing them to-day without having them.  Some of us, by arrangement, did not get an opportunity of speaking.  I think also the Minister after the arrangement come to that the debate was to be curtailed, curtailed his explanation of the Estimates so that I might say we are at a double disadvantage.  It may be thought trivial that I am only referring to Vote No. 6&mdash;the Office of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;after the survey which has been made of the main financial position. At the same time, I would like to point out that very important points arise from the decision of the Commissioners.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce speaking yesterday on these Estimates, said the present policy of the Government was that of putting duties on any articles that can be manufactured in this country economically.  That initiation will, no doubt, find general acceptance. At the same time when that comes to be translated into facts a number of points arise which leaves the general community in a very grave position of doubt and uncertainty.  I might say, without in any way finding fault with any of the duties that have been imposed by the Government, there is a very big line as to the interpretations placed upon those laws which are brought in by the Government, and there is a great difficulty on the part of the mercantile community in finding out what is the actual situation.  Now, I would like to point out to the Government the fact that reference has been made on the larger issue to the position which has been brought about by employment in this country.  Under these tariffs there are a number of questions that are not capable of getting a ready solution and that is holding up employment to a degree which I do not believe the present Government are aware of.  When people think that a debt is not leviable under the present law and they cannot get a decision on those matters what do they do?  They do nothing.  They wait until the solution can be obtained and in consequence employment is suffering. I will only mention a few things which are really more or less symptomatic of the classes of difficulties which the <Col N="1047" /> commercial community are under.  I brought under the Minister's notice some time ago the question of gold size. He mentioned to me very kindly that he would take up that question, but in my opinion the Revenue Commissioners will have to decide what is gold size. In other words, when they have imposed tariffs they will have to make up their minds as to what they will allow in free and what they will impose a duty on.  When the Minister was questioned he said <Col N="1048" /> some of the gold size contained more varnish than others and he tried to make a point that gold size was varnish.  I would like to assure him that they are two entirely different substances.  That really only brings me to the point that at the present time they have no definition for what gold size is.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if it is a fact that all the necessary preliminary enquiries and surveys in the case of the Bilboa River have been carried out; that the county council are fully prepared to go ahead with a drainage scheme; that there is great dissatisfaction in the district as a result of the report that the scheme is being held up pending the confirmation of a drainage scheme for the Mulcair and Cappamore district, which it is believed would not to any serious extent be affected by operations on the Bilboa River, and if he is prepared, in view of the delay in connection with the Mulcair and Cappamore scheme, to allow operations on the Bilboa River to be proceeded with without further delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Hugo Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have had preliminary investigations made with regard to a petition for the constitution of a drainage district for the Bilboa River area. From the report of their engineer it appears that the carrying out of drainage works on the portion of the Bilboa River, which is the subject of the petition, would tend in present circumstances to worsen considerably conditions in the Mulcair and Cappamore area, which lies downstream.  A drainage scheme for the latter area has lately been submitted to the occupiers of affected lands and, as a result of the voting on this scheme, a public inquiry in respect of objections to it will shortly be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> The Commissioners are of opinion that a decision on the Bilboa River proposal must be deferred until the works on the Mulcair and Cappamore scheme, if this scheme is confirmed, have been completed.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners have no evidence of the existence of dissatisfaction among the occupiers in the Bilboa River area as a result of the postponement of a decision, which was communicated to the Tipperary (N.R.) County Council on 14th October, 1932.</P>
