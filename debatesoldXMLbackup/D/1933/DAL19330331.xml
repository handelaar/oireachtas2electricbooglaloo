      <P>Business will be taken as on the Order Paper except that No. 6 will be taken before No. 5. Private Deputies' business will be taken at 12 o'clock.  If necessary we shall move that the Dáil sit later than 2 p.m. in order to complete the Second Stage of No. 3, the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill. I also want to announce that it is proposed that the Dáil should meet next Tuesday and adjourn on Friday, 7th April, for the Easter recess and meet again on 26th April.</P>

      <P>I see that it is proposed to take to-day No. 3 on the Order Paper, the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill.  This Bill got a First Reading this day week&mdash;24th March was the date of the introduction of it.  It was then stated, if my information is correct, that the Bill would be in the hands of Deputies on Monday evening.  On representations being made that that would give insufficient time to consider the measure the Minister undertook to consider that point and to allow a longer time.  The Bill was not circulated on Monday.  As between Monday evening and Wednesday there would have been close on two days which were considered insufficient for the consideration of the Bill.  The Bill, however, was only circulated, I believe, yesterday morning and it is now proposed to take the Second Stage to-day, so that 24 hours is all that has been allowed for consideration of the Bill while 48 hours were considered insufficient when it was introduced.  I, therefore, object to the measure being taken to-day on the ground that we have not had sufficient time to consider it.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle is in the position of receiving a motion for First Reading of a measure, and if agreed to, it is then put down for Second Reading.  If a Private Member were introducing a Bill the Ceann Comhairle would not allow the date to be fixed for the Second Reading unless he were in possession of the Bill.  This Bill got its First Reading in good faith and in the same good faith it was to be circulated on Monday evening.  There was a breach of good faith in regard to the circulation of the Bill and only 24 hours are allowed for consideration before being put down for Second Reading.  Not only that, but it is proposed that the Second Reading is to be finished in a single sitting 24 hours afterwards.  That is treating the House with discourtesy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that there would be a good deal of substance in what the Deputy says if this were a complicated measure involving a principle which it might be difficult to apply.  The principle of the measure which we are to consider on Second Reading is one which has long agitated the public mind, a principle which members of the Opposition themselves have already accepted: that is, that there should be during the present period of financial stress some attempt to secure economies in the public services. That matter, as I have said, was before the people at the General Election of 1932.  The necessity for trying to secure economies of this particular kind was referred to by me in my Budget statement last year.  It has been clear to every section of the House and to the public generally that the Government had this question long under consideration and the only thing <Col N="1821" /> that the House is asked to determine to-day is whether it is going to accept the principle of securing economy in the public services during the present financial crisis.  That is the only question to be determined.  I think that on such a simple matter as that, it is not necessary that a prolonged study of the Bill should be made in order to enable us to accept that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion of the introduction of the Budget last year the Minister indicated a saving in the public services of something like £250,000.  That was in May last.  The point I am putting, and I put it with force, is that while that information was conveyed to the Dáil and the country in May last year we suddenly got notice of this Bill a week ago.  The Bill is promised for circulation on Monday.  It does not circulate until Thursday.  We are asked now to consider it.  There is more than the principle involved in the measure; there is a certain segregation and a certain difference between the various classes of persons from whom deductions are to be made.  There are other questions involved.  There are the commitments and the statements of Ministers concerning this matter.  There is the statement, I believe, of the President of the Executive Council, that sums under £400 a year would not suffer any deduction, and there is a departure from the pronouncements&mdash;as we understand them&mdash;of Ministers in this connection. If one were to go no further, one has only to read what the Secretary of the National Teachers' Organisation says in this morning's Press in connection with the statement of the Minister for Finance himself, which also is before the public.  The points I am putting to the Ceann Comhairle are that he gets in this Bill on this day week; in all good faith he accepts the statement that it will be circulated at a certain time; on that understanding the Bill is put down for a certain date; that understanding is departed from.  The objection made in connection with the taking of it at 44 hours' notice stands much more strongly in connection with 24 hours' notice.  The Chair is, in my opinion, <Col N="1822" /> discourteously treated in connection with this proposal from the Minister.</P>

      <P>This is too important a matter to pass too lightly over, and the Minister's last statement increases, in my opinion, the importance of it.  Are we in the position that anything that has been made the subject of discussion by the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;particularly spoken from their election platforms&mdash;is to agitate the public mind so sufficiently that people will so think over the matter that Bills are to be introduced and dealt with in this particular way?  I submit to the House that this Order is on the Order Paper under false pretences, and that this House, and you included, sir, has been tricked in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has been tricked in this matter.  The House is in this position that it did not know last night&mdash;until Deputy Cosgrave asked at 10.30 what was going to be taken this morning&mdash;that this Bill was going to be taken. No voluntary statement was made from the Government Benches as to what exactly was going to be done.  On Thursday last, when the Government thought that they were not going to sit on Friday, they asked for permission to introduce &mdash;without its even being on the Order Paper-the First Reading of this Bill. As far as we were concerned we granted it.  It was not done on Thursday because the Government decided to meet on Friday.  Now, a procedure that has been adopted&mdash;contrary to commonsense and the proper doing of business&mdash;to facilitate Government business is being abused here.  Normally, a Bill should not appear on the Order Paper for a First Reading until the Ceann Comhairle had the Bill in his hands, and was in the position that immediately the House had made an Order he could proceed to carry out that Order by having the Bill printed. <Col N="1823" /> That procedure has been adopted for the convenience of Government business, and it is now being abused.</P>
      <P>I would like to call the attention of the House to what transpired on Friday last.  I asked&mdash;column 1391 of the Official Report&mdash;&ldquo;When will the Bill be circulated?&rdquo; The Minister for Finance replied: &ldquo;On Monday evening.&rdquo; This was when it was proposed to have the Second Reading on Wednesday.  I then said: &ldquo;If we find that the time for consideration of the measure is too short, will the Minister entertain favourably an application to postpone the Second Reading?&rdquo; The Minister answered: &ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo; Deputies waited from Monday until yesterday morning to get the Bill. They got the Bill, without even any explanation as to what the details of the measure meant, such as apparently were supplied by the Minister for Finance and to the Press, with no intimation&mdash;good, bad or indifferent&mdash; until the House was adjourning last night at 10.30 that this measure was going to be taken this morning.  I submit again, sir, that this business is on the Order Paper under false pretences, and that you and the House generally have been tricked in the matter.</P>

      <P>Surely to goodness, in all decency, when a motion comes up which proposes a Treaty between two countries it should not simply be moved by the Leader of the Government without comment.  Months ago this particular thing was circulated.  I do not know whether notice of motion has been on the Order Paper before in connection with this matter.  I think it has been.  From recollection, I would say there are three items we are getting advantages from, and we are giving advantages in about eight items.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It appears to me that the principle which has to be considered in this Bill at this stage, and which is embodied in this Bill, is a simple one&mdash;I have already stated it in reply to some of the remarks of Deputy Cosgrave&mdash; whether we do or do not think it expedient to reduce public expenditure in the manner provided in this Bill.  I do not want to go into all the points which have already been raised from the Opposition benches in regard to the measure, because I do not think they are points which would properly arise at this stage.  They are merely Committee points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to whether proposals are equitable between one section of the public service and another is a matter which would more properly be discussed in the debate on the schedules to the Bill rather than at this stage.  What we have to consider is whether, in view of the financial position of the State and of the community generally, we should make some attempt to reduce the burden of public expenditure.  These proposals which the Government is putting before the House now are proposals which have been long deferred but have also been long demanded.  Last year in submitting my Budget statement on 11th May I said: &ldquo;I shall have to ask for sacrifices from those who are engaged in public employment to help me to find the remainder.  I propose to find by reductions in salaries and allowances in the various branches of the Public Service, and I hope I may be able to say later that this has included the Judiciary, the sum of £250,000.  In the light of the community's urgent need this cannot be regarded as too large a sum to ask.&rdquo; It was hoped at that time to secure these reductions by agreement, and a large part of the time not only of the Minister for Finance but of other members of the Executive Council was <Col N="1826" /> taken up in endeavouring to secure what would be in all the circumstances a fair reduction and one acceptable to the various branches of the services concerned.  Unfortunately, after prolonged negotiation it was not found possible to secure the necessary acquiescence.  Having satisfied myself that nothing was to be hoped for from negotiation, I appointed a Committee of independent persons to consider proposals afresh.  I cannot speak too highly of the zeal and public spirit with which the members of that Committee approached a very difficult task.  They were asked to work within a time limit, and to consider all the relevant circumstances. I regret to say that the reports received disclosed such a difference of opinion among them and, I am sorry to say, such an inability to appreciate the requirements of the Exchequer, that their labours have not been of the assistance to me which I hoped.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Government was thrown back on this position.  Having failed to secure these reductions by negotiation, and an examination of the problem by an independent Committee having shown such a divergence of views as to what was proper in regard to these matters that no less than three reports substantially and radically different from each other were presented&mdash;to one of these three reports a reservation on a matter of vital principle was appended which constituted in effect a fourth report&mdash; the Government had to consider the position from its own point of view. Unaided by the services concerned and unassisted practically by the reports of the Committee which had been presented to it, it had to formulate its own policy in regard to these services. That policy, so far as we have been able to ensure it, is, I believe, an equitable one and is enshrined in the schedules to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is desirable at this stage to discuss the schedules.  As I have already indicated, I think if there is to be a debate it should confine itself entirely to the question of principle as to whether there should or should not be some reduction in public expenditure of the kind adumbrated in <Col N="1827" /> the measure now before the House.  I think what I have said in that regard applies with particular force to the amendment which I understand appears on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Dillon.  If I may suggest so, I think that amendment might be more properly moved at a later stage of the discussion after the House has decided first of all whether there should be economies and secondly, as to how the sacrifices which such economies will exact should be distributed over the several services. Then the House might consider whether the measure should be allowed to proceed further until the particular economy which Deputy Dillon thinks desirable should be made.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the House would like me to go through the Bill in detail.  Section 1 is merely the short title.  Section 2 is the definition section.  Section 3 is a special section defining the word &ldquo;salary&rdquo; to include &ldquo;all salary, pay, wages, commission, fees, and other remuneration, whether fixed or paid under statute, order, or regulation or otherwise howsoever, and whether calculated by reference to a period of time or by reference to work done.&rdquo;  It provides that salaries which include &ldquo;allowances and benefits (whether paid in money or given otherwise than in money) forming part of the remuneration attached to an office, but does not include any payment made by way of allowance for or reimbursement of specific expenses incurred nor any payment (whether separate or included in other remuneration) which is expressly made as an allowance (other than a uniform allowance) for or towards necessary equipment.&rdquo;  That is to say, that travelling and hotel expenses which may be incurred by public servants in the discharge of the duties of their office are excluded from the definition of &ldquo;salary&rdquo; as they most properly should be.  This section also provides that &ldquo;where a person holds two or more offices from the salaries of which deductions are required by the same Part of this Act to be made, his salary for the purposes of such deductions shall be taken to be the aggregate <Col N="1828" /> amount of the respective salaries of those offices.&rdquo;  Section 4 is a saving section which provides that &ldquo;nothing in this Act shall affect the amount of salary by reference to which the amount of any compensation, superannuation allowance, pension, or gratuity is computed.&rdquo;  That is to say, that as this is a temporary measure and will run for a period of one year, a civil servant who should retire in this year will not be prejudiced as regards the pension which will be properly payable to him because his salary in the year of his retiral has been subject to the deductions set out in this Bill.  Section 5 is a safeguarding clause.  It provides that the making under this Act of a deduction from salary shall not terminate a contract of service.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill sets forth the general powers to make deductions from the salaries of those who are directly employed in the public service. As will be seen from sub-section (1) of Section 6 this Part of the Act applies to every person who is employed as (1) commissioned officer in or a chaplain to the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann; (2) as a member of the Gárda Síochána; (3) as a teacher in a national school; (4) in any capacity in a preparatory college; (5) in any other civil capacity, whether permanent or temporary, in the public service of Saorstát Eireann, and is remunerated wholly or partly (whether directly or indirectly) out of the Central Fund or moneys provided by the Oireachtas or a fund under the control of a Minister.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) provides that &ldquo;this Part of the Act applies to a person whether his employment is whole-time or part-time, or is for particular work or a particular occasion, and whether the amount of his salary is fixed by statute or otherwise.&rdquo;  Of course this Part of this Act only applies &ldquo;to a person only so long and in so far as he is employed and remunerated in a manner mentioned in the foregoing sub-section of this section.&rdquo;  That is, remunerated out of the Central Fund or moneys provided by the Oireachtas <Col N="1829" /> or a fund under the control of a Minister.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of this section provides that nothing in this part of the Act shall apply to any Judge of the Supreme Court, the High Court, or the Circuit Court, nor to any Justice of the District Court.  I should not like any impression to be created in the public mind, or in the mind of the Oireachtas, that it is not proposed to ask the judiciary to accept deductions of a like magnitude to those which we are proposing to impose upon the other public servants by this measure.  A separate Bill will be introduced in the House to deal with those.  The necessity for separate proposals arises from the fact that that Bill will have to make provision for amending the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the deductions will only be made from salaries earned and payable during the coming financial year&mdash;that is, during the financial year which will open to-morrow.  I should like to emphasise the words &ldquo;earned&rdquo; and &ldquo;payable.&rdquo; There are salaries which will be payable after the 1st April but which will have been earned prior to the 1st April.  It is not proposed to make any deductions from these.  On the other hand, there are salaries which will be payable after the 1st April, 1935, which will have been earned prior to the 1st April, 1935, and such payments will not come within the scope of this Bill.  I am not saying that, if the financial position should not improve, it might not be imperative to deal with those salaries in another measure; but, at any rate, they are definitely excluded from the scope of this measure which proposes to make temporary reductions for a year only.</P>
    <P>I should like to call the attention of the House to sub-section (5) of Section 7, which provides that &ldquo;every deduction made before the passing of this Act from salary paid to a person to whom this Part of this Act applies which would have been a lawful deduction under this section if this section had then been in force shall be deemed to have been made under this section and to be and always to have been lawful accordingly.&rdquo;  It is not anticipated, <Col N="1830" /> and it was not contemplated that the House would take all the stages of this measure in one day. Necessarily, it is a measure which merits a good deal of discussion in view of the many interests which it affects.  It was not proposed, so far as discussion in detail was concerned, to limit that discussion in the House; but, at the same time, it is imperative, in view of the position which will confront the House next year, that economies should begin and be made at the earliest possible moment, and the most appropriate moment is at the opening of the financial year.  Otherwise, if they are deferred beyond that, the Exchequer is going to suffer and the ratepayers and the taxpayers are going to suffer also.</P>
    <P>However, I should hesitate, even though this sub-section were in the Bill which would give me power to do so, to apply the Act now and would prefer to await full legislative sanction at a future date.  I should hesitate certainly to enforce that section, desirable and all as it is that it should be enforced&mdash;essential almost as it is&mdash;I should hesitate to enforce it unless the House had first of all accepted the principle of this measure, and it is in order that the Department of Finance may feel itself at liberty to enforce this section that the House has been asked to accept the principle of this Bill to-day.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that &ldquo;every doubt, question, and dispute which shall arise as to whether a person is or is not a person to whom this Part of this Act applies, or as to the amount of the salary for the purposes of this Part of this Act of any person or the amount of the deduction to be made under this Part of this Act from any such salary shall be determined by the Minister, whose determination thereof shall be final.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is designed to give the principle of economy in the public service a wider application than, possibly, hitherto has been contemplated. Part I of the Bill, as I have pointed out, deals merely with the cases of those who are paid directly, whether wholly or partly, out of the Central Fund or out of moneys <Col N="1831" /> provided by the Oireachtas.  Part III proposes to deal with deductions from statutory and other grants and from certain salaries.</P>
    <P>Section 9 gives power, first of all, to make deductions from salaries paid by certain statutory bodies, and it is set out in sub-section (1) that this applies &ldquo;to every board, commission, company, or other body&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  which was established by or under a special statute or for the establishment of which express provision was made by a special statute or which, though incorporated under statutes of general application, is regulated in part by a special statute; and</P>
    <P>(b)  the whole or part of the surplus revenue of which is payable to the Exchequer either specifically or in the form of dividends or of repayment of advances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of that is to bring within the scope of the measures members of statutory bodies, such as the Currency Commission, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Electricity Supply Board, vocational education committees, and servants of agricultural committees, and a whole host of people who derive a large part of their remuneration either directly from the public by reason of the public duties which they discharge or indirectly from the Exchequer by reason of the grants which the committees or bodies which employ them receive from the Exchequer.  In sub-section (2) of this section it is provided that &ldquo;from all salary which, during the current financial year is earned by and payable to any member of a body to which this section applies in his capacity as such member, a deduction shall be made of such amount and at such times as the Minister shall, in each case, direct, having regard to the deductions from salaries to be made under Part II of this Act and to the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>That is to say, every member of the Currency Commission, for instance, would be subject to such a deduction as I should determine, <Col N="1832" /> having regard to the deductions which are being made, and which will be made under the Schedule in Part I of the Act, from public servants discharging work similar to or fulfilling functions analogous to those fulfilled by members of the Currency Commission or other boards such as the Electricity Supply Board.  Sub-section (2) deals with members of these boards or bodies.  Sub-section (3) deal with the employees of these boards or bodies and gives the Minister the following powers.</P>
    <P>Every body to which this section applies shall make, in such manner and at such times as shall be approved of by the Minister, such deductions from the salaries earned and payable during the current financial year by and to persons (other than members) in the employment of such body as such body shall determine after consultation with the Minister and having regard to the amounts of the deductions from salaries to be made under Part II of this Act.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that that provision has been introduced in order to ensure that any deductions which will be made by these bodies from the salaries of their employees will be equitable in all the circumstances of the case.  That is to say, that it will not be possible for any board of the sort to which this section applies to impose an undue burden on certain grades of their employees.  It also provides, as sub-section (2) provides, that in making the deductions the board shall have regard to deductions made from salaries under Part II of the Act. That is to say, where the State is deducting as far as possible the deduction made by these boards should conform. Sub-section (4) provides that</P>
    <P>All deductions from salaries shall be disposed of in such manner as the Minister, after consultation with the body concerned, shall direct.</P>
    <P>That is to say, it is not proposed to appropriate in every case for the general purposes of the Exchequer the results of the savings which may be made through the operation of this <Col N="1833" /> section.  For instance, in the case of the Currency Commission, there is no reason whatever why any savings that might result from this measure might not be appropriated for the general purposes of the Exchequer.  On the other hand, in the case of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, it might be better that such savings, instead of being brought into the Exchequer for the general purposes thereof, might be set aside to build up a reserve or a contingency fund to meet whatever losses might arise during a year of financial stringency of this sort.  That is to say, so far as any economies which might be made in these services at the expense of the staff, they should be used to strengthen the concern as a whole, and not merely be used for the general relief of the Exchequer.  Again, in the case of the Electricity Supply Board, if deductions were to be made there it might be desirable, so far as it could be significantly done, that they might be passed on to the general body of consumers. Accordingly, as the House will readily understand, it might be wiser than merely appropriating these moneys for the general purposes of the Exchequer that these moneys might be used to better purpose.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) of this section gives us power to utilise these moneys in these ways.  Section 10 deals specifically with grants</P>
    <P>&ldquo;made annually under statute or otherwise out of the Central Fund to a university, college or other educational institution (not being a secondary school) or to a board, commission, company, association, or other body (whether corporate or unincorporated) and such grant is wholly or partly available in the hands of such institution or body for the payment of the salaries of persons employed by such institution or body, there</P>
    <P>It provides that in such cases there shall be a deduction from the amount of such grant:</P>
    <P>such sum as the Minister, after such consultation with the governing authority of such institution or body as he shall think proper, shall determine <Col N="1834" /> having regard to the proportion of such grant ordinarily applied to the payment of such salaries, to the deductions from salaries to be made under Part II of this Act, and to the other circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill provides that where a grant is made out of the Central Fund to any local authority or to any committee or other body</P>
    <P>... the members of which are appointed wholly or partly by a local authority and such grant is wholly or partly available in the hands of such authority or body for the payment of the salaries of persons employed by it, there shall be deducted from the amount of such grant which falls to be made in the current financial year such sum as the Minister, after consultation with every other Minister who appears to him to be concerned, shall determine having regard to the proportion of such grant ordinarily applied towards the payment of such salaries, to the deductions from salaries to be made under Part II of this Act, and to the other circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>We are setting up a normal standard in these matters according to the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides in like manner:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Whenever a deduction is made under this Part of this Act from a grant, the body to whom such grant is made may make, from the salaries earned and payable in the current financial year by and to persons in the employment of such body, such deductions as such body shall, with the approval of the Minister, think proper having regard to the amount of the deduction so made from such grant, the proportion of such grant ordinarily applied towards the payment of such salaries, and to the other circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Before giving an approval under the foregoing sub-section the Minister shall consult with every (if any) other Minister who appears to him to be concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> So that the matter will be done by agreement between the Ministers and the public authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is the section which provides that sums deducted under this Part of the Act from annual grants shall be retained in the Exchequer and be available for any purpose for which moneys in the Exchequer are lawfully available.  I would like to point out the slight difference in the conditions between this section and sub-section (4) of Section 9.  Sub-section (4) provides that where deductions are made from bodies under statutory power it is to these bodies any savings that may result from the operation of the Bill will be applied and be disposed of in such manner as the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the body concerned, shall direct.  In this case, where salaries are paid partly by Exchequer grants, any savings which may result from the operation of this Bill will remain in the Exchequer and will be applied for the general purposes thereof.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general scheme of the Bill and the deductions which are set forth in the Schedule of the Bill, the Government long ago laid down the principle that if exceptional economies were required so far as civil servants were concerned, they did not propose to enforce such economies upon those who were in receipt of inclusive salaries&mdash;that is, including that portion which is known as basic salary and the portion which is known as bonus&mdash;of the amount of £300.  They definitely fixed that as the limit beyond which they would not impose a super-cut on the salaries of civil servants. The reason why the Government took that attitude was that, first of all, civil servants have endured considerable reductions in salaries as compared with other sections of public servants over the past ten years, and it was felt that in the circumstances of the present time, having regard to the manner in which civil servants' remuneration had been adjusted to the fall in the cost of living, a civil servant having a lower inclusive salary than £300 had no margin upon which it would be proper for the Exchequer to retrench.  Accordingly, <Col N="1836" /> when considering the scales set out in Part IV of the Schedule which applies to civil servants, this fact was kept in mind, and it will be noticed that in regard to salaries for whole-time service, where the annual rate of salary does not exceed £300, no additional deduction is now being enforced. Where the salary exceeds £300 but does not exceed £400, a cut of 2 per cent. per annum on the salary is being effected.  From that figure the cut is graded very steeply on each succeeding increment of £100 salary until, at the top of the scale, it reaches a figure of 25 per cent. on so much of the annual salary as is in excess of £1,600.  In going up the scale the Executive Council naturally had to take into consideration this very important fact that the majority of civil servants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a most unfair suggestion.  It is quite true that the Minister for Finance has been advised that he must take a holiday.  He broke down last year and he broke down this year again in the same way, but the urgency arises because, as I pointed out, under Section 7, sub-section (5) of the Bill, deductions will have to be made from 1st April and I want before I enforce the deductions to have the principle accepted that in the present circumstances economies in the salaries of public servants must be enforced.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept the second portion of the Minister's statement.  I regret that the <Col N="1837" /> Minister's health is not up to standard and any representation in that respect would have received as much consideration as was deemed desirable.  In other words, the Minister would have been facilitated by all sections of the House if a representation of that sort had been put forward.  Apart from that, the House will never expect to get from the Minister more service than his physique is capable of giving. The House has convenienced Ministers very much more since this new Ministry came into office than it did during previous years.  Ministers often sat from 3 o'clock until 10 o'clock dealing with Bills prior to this Government taking office.</P>
      <P>The point I want to put is this: the question of principle does not arise at all here.  The Bill has been introduced and any Deputy or any person in the public service knows that there is a majority in the Party opposite to pass any Bill here, to amend the Constitution, to make any arrangements or changes the Minister desires to bring about.  The question of the principle of the proposals does not concern the case at all.  The principle is already adopted whether or not there is a vote of the House taken.  The House sat for three days this week and it is going to sit on Tuesday.  Members who live in Donegal and places of that description will go home to-morrow morning, arriving late that night, and they will have to start out again on Monday morning to get here in time for Tuesday's meeting.  That is unreasonable.  The Minister has taken 40 minutes to explain the Bill already. The House is now asked to sit late to convenience a Ministry who were late in producing this Bill, a Bill which everybody knew for the last 12 months was going to be brought forward, and it is asked to rush it through within 24 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that it is the details, as has been pointed out by the Minister, that require close consideration.  There is no reason why any question the Opposition desire to raise cannot be raised on any section of the Bill.  My view of the matter is this.  The Minister is particularly anxious that the principle should be <Col N="1838" /> passed.  I agree that we have sufficient members in this Party to pass it, but that is not the point.  The point is whether the principles of the Bill are to receive formal sanction by the Dáil. There is no question of curtailing any discussion whatever.  As everybody knows, the discussion on each of the particular items will give an opportunity for such criticism as might be necessary.  I doubt if any member of the House would say that this is not the time that such economies as can be effected, in the general manner suggested, should be effected.  I think this is a Bill which the Minister had every reason to feel that the House would deal with on Second Reading in the manner which he suggested himself.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's health, he has not put that forward himself as any special reason why this Bill should be pushed forward to-day.  I am informed that the Parliamentary Secretary, when talking to the Whips, did indicate that it would be an advantage if the Minister were enabled to deal with the general principles of the Bill before he would have to go away. Personally, I should like to have that done, but we did not put forward that as a reason why the Bill should be taken to-day.  It was mentioned casually in conversation with the Whips, so that the opposite side were aware of the fact.  The Minister's point is that he is anxious to have approval of the principle of this Bill before any cuts he proposes proceed to run.</P>

      <P>I should like to know to whom it was conveyed.  I think it is very unfair to the House that, if this is Government policy over which the President and the other Minister stand, the Minister for Finance, who can plead ill-health, and has to get away, should be interposed between this House and the discussion of this measure.  I submit that the reason the Minister for Finance is asked to discuss this Bill is that there is not another Minister, knowing what his Department has done, and being in full health to listen to what this House can say to him, is prepared to stand over this measure.  The Minister for Finance can stand over it as the steel-minded financier, but there is not another Minister, having sat down and worked out the problems they worked at with their officials during the past 12 months, seeing what these officials do and appreciating the difficulties they found themselves in in reconciling their speeches at the cross-roads with the co-operation and return they got from civil servants, could comfortably get up here and make a case for what has been put in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has not explained the Bill; the Minister for Finance has read the Bill.  We were able to do that pretty well ourselves. We were able to read even between the lines here and there.  The Minister has not told us what the reason is for this Bill or how much he hopes to save by it.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to refer to anything said during the interruption of my speech, except to say that I think it is a most unseemly argument to advance to the House that in order to enforce the passage of a Bill of this sort the physical condition of a member of the House is to be taken into account.  So far as I can understand the urgency of the measure, it arises from sub-section (5) of Section 8 and from nothing else, so far as I am concerned.  As to the manner in which this Bill should be debated, I want to say that, if the principle is accepted, the Committee Stage can be deferred until after Easter so that a detailed consideration of the proposals in the measure can be undertaken by any Deputy who is interested in it and who wishes to advance any particular point of view when the debate on the Committee Stage is taken.  I was dealing with Part IV, which may be taken, very largely, to determine the magnitude of the cuts which are imposed upon other members of the public service.  I was pointing out that the Government had decided that those in receipt of salaries under £300 per annum would, in all the circumstances, be exempt from any further cuts.  But in determining the amount of the deduction to be made from those in receipt of salaries above that figure, the Government had to give very serious consideration, indeed, to the fact that no later than 1st January last, owing to the operation of the cost-of-living figure, which fell substantially, the Civil Service, as a body, had endured a net reduction of £125,000 in their remuneration and, that, in fact, if the original intention of those entering into the agreement for a bonus over the basic salary, the amount of which was to relate to the cost-of-living figure, were to be carried out, the deduction would not be £125,000 per annum as in fact it is, but would be at the rate of £160,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>The Government mitigated, so far as employees in receipt of salaries not exceeding £2 a week basic go, the severity of that blow, and that concession will cost the Exchequer no less than £35,000 per year.  But as I have said, notwithstanding the concession already given to civil servants, they will still suffer, in the aggregate, a reduction of £125,000 in their remuneration during the current year, due to the fall in the cost-of-living bonus.  That fact was taken into consideration when the scale set forth in Part IV of the Bill was drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same circumstances do not apply to any of the other services. Although corresponding, to some extent with the form in which the Schedules have been prepared, they differ in respect of each service.  In regard to each service there were circumstances which had to be taken into consideration but what was aimed at was that, so far as possible, people in corresponding ways, and in receipt of similar salaries, would endure similar cuts.  It has happened that owing to certain peculiar factors, particularly in the lower branches of the service, some get off lighter in certain cases than civil servants enjoying <Col N="1845" /> corresponding salaries would, but if the table which will be circulated to the House before the Committee Stage is examined properly it will be found that very close corresponding, indeed, has been secured between the deductions that would be made from civil servants and from those in other branches of the public service.  For instance, in the case of a civil servant enjoying a present total remuneration of £200 the amount of the deduction, due to the fall in the cost-of-living figure, which that civil servant has now imposed upon him would be £11 7s. per annum.  In the case of an unmarried sergeant of the Civic Guard he, if cut in accordance with that part of the Schedule would suffer a deduction of £10 12s. 9d.; and a national teacher, at the same rate of salary, would suffer a deduction of £10 1s. 8d.  In the case of a married sergeant of the Gárda the position is much more favourable, and the sacrifice he is asked to face is much lighter and so far as his case goes the amount would be £5 18s. 2d.</P>
    <P>In the case of a civil servant enjoying a total salary of £250 per annum, the amount of the deduction which he already endures, owing to the fall in the cost-of-living figure, is £13 3s.  In the case of an unmarried station sergeant, on the same rate of pay, the deduction he would suffer would be £11 16s. 4d. per annum.  In the case of a national school teacher the amount would be £13 15s.  In the case of a civil servant enjoying £400 per annum the total reduction that he will suffer, due to the fall in the cost of living bonus figure, plus the overriding reduction, will be £25 14s.  An officer in the Army, with a corresponding salary, will suffer a reduction of £22, while an officer in the Gárda Síochána will suffer a reduction of £20 3s. and a national school teacher, at the same point in the salary scale, will suffer a reduction of £27 10s.  In that particular case, I would like to point out, the national school teacher draws what is known as a residual capitation grant which, in most cases, would make the total emoluments he would draw, if he were on a salary scale of £400, exceed £400 per annum <Col N="1846" /> and when that fact is taken into consideration it will be found that the deduction the national teacher suffers will correspond to the deduction that the civil servant, on a scale of £400 per annum, would suffer.  At the point of £500 the civil servant under this Bill would suffer a deduction of £31 2s.; the officer in the Army, drawing the same pay, would suffer a deduction of £30 per annum; the officer in the Gárda Síochána would suffer a deduction of £27 10s. and the national school teacher would suffer a deduction of £31 7s.</P>
    <P>Taking some of the higher salaries, the civil servant enjoying a salary of £1,000 per annum will suffer a deduction of £71 1s. per annum; the officer in the Army will suffer a deduction of £75 per annum and the officer in the Gárda Síochána would suffer a deduction of £68 15s. per annum.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil approves of the Trade Agreement between the Irish Free State and the Union of South Africa signed at Ottawa on the 20th day of August, 1932, the text of which is contained in the Report of the Imperial Economic Conference held at Ottawa, 1932 (Supplementary Volume) laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 28th day of November, 1932, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps to ratify the said Agreement.&mdash;(Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most striking things in the speeches which we heard upon this motion from the Government Benches was the unwillingness of Fianna Fáil speakers to discuss the motion at all&mdash;to come down and deal with the substantive proposition embodied in it.  We had <Col N="1847" /> a very long, a very wearisome, speech from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and, during the whole course of that speech, he only once dealt with the motion.  He never once expressed a view as to whether, in the present circumstances, it was necessary or advisable to give financial assistance to farmers who are now unable to make ends meet, to purchase the necessary manures to fertilise their crops.  The speech was a very typical speech coming from the Parliamentary Secretary.  It was full of all those personalities, all that abuse, that is so very typical of the ordinary speech which we get from him, and it was, indeed, more typical of his mind than the ordinary speech that comes from him because that speech, from beginning to end, showed a complete ignorance of the very elements of the matter with which he was professing to deal.</P>
      <P>I think that if the Executive Council have any spare money they might invest a little, or make up a whip amongst themselves, for the purpose of purchasing a primer on political economy for the use of the Parliamentary Secretary.  He wants such a book very badly.  I do not suggest that they should buy any of these little booklets about deportment in good society, or how to behave, or relating to good manners.  I do not think a book of that nature could possibly improve him.  I do not think he is susceptible to improvement in that respect.  I think, however, if they purchased a little book on political economy he might master some of the elements of that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was very strong upon the worthlessness of the English market and he seems to think that the English market is a market that can be controlled completely against the people of this country.  He talks about our people having only one purchaser for their produce.  It seems the Parliamentary Secretary has got an idea that there is a sort of collective trading between State and State, that Ireland as a whole deals with England as a whole and that there is a collective selling <Col N="1848" /> and a collective buying.  There is nothing of the kind.  When we talk about the English market we mean not one particular market but a number of markets scattered all over Great Britain, and we talk not of one individual purchaser but a very large number of purchasers.</P>
    <P>When we talk about selling cattle in the English market we do not talk about selling our cattle collectively.  It is a case of each individual Irishman selling his own stuff.  So far as we are concerned, until this economic war broke out there was no difference between the Dublin and the English market.  They were located in different places, but there was no greater difference between the market in Dublin or the market in Cork than between the market in Dublin and the markets in Birkenhead and Glasgow. There is no such thing involved as collective buying or collective selling. Dealings between countries, when they are unregulated by Governments, consist of dealings between individual citizens of each country.  If the Parliamentary Secretary could get that very elementary proposition into his head he would be saved from falling into the pitfall into which he is rapidly falling.</P>
    <P>I am not going to take up the time of the House by following the Parliamentary Secretary through his long speech.  I will just say this much, that when he talks about frozen or chilled meat as being superior and more attractive to the housekeeper than home-produced beef, and when he says you can get from your butcher chilled meat which is ready to be cooked, but if you go to the butcher and buy home-produced beef you can never get it fit to be cooked and you have to keep it for some days and that is an enormous disadvantage to the housekeeper, he is not speaking quite in accordance with the facts.  I do not know who is the butcher who supplies the Parliamentary Secretary's household with meat, but I think if the speech were made outside that the butcher cannot supply tender meat to his customers, that butcher would have an action for slander against the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1849" /> Of course, the market for chilled and the market for fresh meat are completely different markets.  Fresh meat and chilled meat are different articles. They are as different almost as butter is from margarine.  If people are hard up and there is not much purchasing power they will not buy the very best stuff.  They will not buy home-produced beef.  They will fall back on the inferior article.  In just the same way, if they are too poor to buy butter they will fall back on margarine. When you get a country which is well established in its trade and doing well financially, the market for home-produced fresh beef or mutton increases and the market for chilled meat declines.  In times of depression the reverse operation takes place.  At the present moment there is a very big trade depression in England. Indeed, there is a trade depression the world over and many persons have been driven off the fresh meat standard on to the chilled meat standard. But let there be a revival and they will go back from the chilled meat standard to the fresh meat standard.</P>
    <P>I will pass over an equally long speech by Deputy Corry, because when that speech was over I asked the Deputy whether he was in favour of or against the motion and he did not know what was his attitude.  I will come down to the speech of the Minister for Agriculture, who dealt with general propositions and not with the particular motion before the House.  I will follow him to some extent.  I think the Minister has not consciously deceived the House, but before he got up to address the House he might have done Deputies the courtesy of doing a little thinking and a little reading.  I think if he had consulted even the most obvious sources of information he would not have made the extraordinary speech which he did make here.  He started off in an endeavour to show that the economic war has not hurt the Irish agricultural industry.  He starts off by what he calls a little bit of arithmetic. He wants to get the average prices for cattle in 1931 and 1932 and he says that the enormous drop in the value of exports is due very considerably <Col N="1850" /> to the fact that 120,000 fewer head of cattle were exported in 1932. He then proceeds to do a bit of division and he says the loss or the difference in price is only £2 a head.</P>
    <P>If, as I say, the Minister for Agriculture had done a little bit of thinking&mdash;if the Minister for Agriculture had ever visited a fair&mdash;I do not know if he did since he became Minister&mdash;or if he consulted anybody who knew anything about the cattle trade, he would know that when cattle are down in value, there is no demand for them.  It is only the very best cattle that are bought.  The cattle that are rough, unfinished, lean or not very well-shaped young stores, are the ones that go home from the market unsold.  When one is comparing the prices of cattle in 1931 and 1932 and when one takes 120,000 less exported in 1932 one must bear in mind that it is those cattle that remained unsold that are not exported.  When you are making such a comparison you are comparing as it were the prices of cream with the prices of milk.  That is what the Minister is doing when he is comparing the exports of 1931 with the exports of 1932.  In 1931 all the cattle that we wished to export were exported and sold.  To use a metaphor I used a moment ago, the cattle exported in 1931 may be regarded as the milk, but as to the cattle exported in 1932 when we were forced to export 120,000 less cattle, an enormous proportion of them would be the cream of our cattle.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture had given any thought to the matter he would have seen that in that little calculation he was making he was comparing the prices of cream with the prices of milk, a most fallacious thing to do.  Then he goes on again and we get the most extraordinary statement from him.  He says: &ldquo;Again if we look at the export of sheep and lambs there was a reduction of 124,000 and in pigs 173,000.  There was a very big percentage reduction in the amount of eggs exported amounting to 800,000 eggs or 25 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the conclusion one can draw from that?  That we have lost our <Col N="1851" /> live-stock market and cannot export. That is the conclusion that any reasonable person would draw.  The Minister for Agriculture however invents an extraordinary individual whom he calls a fair-minded person. I am afraid his &ldquo;fair-minded&rdquo; person must be a very strange person because apparently he has got no mind at all.  The Minister says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any fair-minded person, looking at this would come to the only conclusion he could come to, namely, that the number of cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry at the beginning of 1932 was considerably down compared with the number in 1931.  But if the Government is to be held responsible for the economic conditions that prevailed, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has tried to establish, we can retort and say that the Cumann na nGaedheal Governmen for ten years brought this country to such a state of bankruptcy that the export of cattle, sheep, pigs and hens was killed and that we had neither cattle, sheep and pigs to export nor hens to lay because of their action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the conclusion which he says any fair-minded person would draw.  I presume that that is the conclusion which the Minister honestly drew himself.  What are the facts? The Minister for Agriculture can turn to such a very ordinary book as the Statistical Abstracts for 1932 and he can compare the number of live stock in this country in 1931 which was just six months before the last Government went out of office.  He can compare the figures of the amount of live stock in this country in 1931 with those in the preceding years.  I will take for instance the year 1925 as the beginning of a six-year period.  In 1925 the total number of horses in this country was 433,971; in 1931, there were 449,697 or an increase of nearly 16,000 horses in six years.  If we take the cattle we find that the number of cattle in the year 1925 was 3,947,000. The number of cattle in 1931 was 4,029,000, again showing an increase. If we take the number of sheep in 1925 we find that the number was <Col N="1852" /> 2,800,000.  In 1931 the number of sheep in the country was 3,500,000; that is to say the number of sheep had increased by nearly three-quarters of a million between 1925 and 1931.  But he says there were no hens left to lay. The number of laying hens in the country in 1926, the first year for which the figures are available was 6,900,000.  In 1931 the number of laying hens in the country was 7,700,000; that is an increase of 800,000 in six years.</P>
    <P>Now there you have a very ordinary book, a book carrying the figures down to 1931, a book which the Minister could have consulted if he wished. But instead of consulting it, instead of looking at the actual figures, he makes this extraordinary statement about the number of live stock having been reduced during the time of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. I have no doubt that if the Minister went to the Department of Industry and Commerce he could have got the figures for 1932.  But instead of taking that course, instead of doing the obvious thing, instead of raising this &ldquo;fair-minded&rdquo; person he comes along here and states that there were no cattle left in the country, and that there were no sheep left in the country because of the action of the last Administration.  I wonder if he thinks he is treating the House fairly? I wonder if that is the way a grave and serious problem of agriculture should be tackled by the Minister for Agriculture?</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister should do the House the courtesy of thinking a little and verifying his figures before he comes into this House and makes a speech on agricultural matters.  He goes on then to deal with other matters connected with agriculture, and he says that it is a very excellent thing that the price of seed oats is up.  I mentioned that I got £8 a ton for seed oats.  That he says is a very great benefit which is due to the action of the Government.  Let us agree that it is.  But what advantage is it to the Irish farmer that seed oats is dear?  Who buys the oats from the Irish farmer except a neighbouring farmer?  How does that enrich the <Col N="1853" /> farming community as a whole?  In fact it is only a question of transferring money from one pocket to another.  That is not enriching the farmer.  He goes along then and says that if seed oats are up the farmers are getting rich.  The truth is that in a year like this it would be more helpful to the Irish farmer if seed oats were cheaper.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister talks about dairying.  There is no question but that the dairying industry did require assistance.  He said that we voted against the Bill he introduced.  We did but when we were voting against that Bill the Minister was plainly told by the previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Hogan, that he considered it was necessary to help the dairying industry; that he considered and brought before the then Executive Council this Australian scheme which was ready cut and dried to hand to the Minister for Agriculture. He took that scheme and considered that it was not the best and most effective way in which to help the dairying industry.  Deputy Hogan said that he considered there were other methods by which the industry could be better helped than by that particular method which was devised not by the Government but by a body of producers in Australia for their own protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on again and shows how little he knows about Irish farming conditions.  He says that if there were no dairying there would be no cattle production; there would be no calves and the live-stock industry would cease if there were no dairying. I tell the Minister that there are large areas in the country in which there is no dairying carried on at all.  I would ask him if he ever heard of Hereford cattle, Polled Angus cattle and Galloway cattle in the rougher parts of the mountains?  Does he think that anyone ever kept Hereford and Polled Angus cows for the purpose of dairying?  Is he aware that there are those breeds in the country; that the beef breeds exceed in value very much the dairy breeds; and that the export of live stock, even at peak <Col N="1854" /> point, is four times as important at least as our dairy produce ever was?</P>
    <P>There are huge areas of the country in which there is no dairying carried on at all.  In my constituency, the part of the country in which I am most interested, there is one dairy, and that dairy last year spent in the purchase of milk a sum of £3,000.  To do one of those sums in simple arithmetic that the Minister is so fond of, that would work out at something like 8d. per head of the population in that constituency.  The dairying industry is a tremendously important one to Irish agriculture.  It is an industry that did require assistance and had to be assisted, but as to whether it was assisted in the right way is another matter with which I am not dealing. To say that the dairying industry is the beginning and the end of Irish agriculture is completely wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with other matters in this effort to show that the economic war is not ruining the country when everybody knows that it is.  He spoke, for instance, about bacon being kept out of the country, and he put as an asset to the farmer the fact that less bacon was imported last year than the year before.  How did that help the farmer?  The one thing that interests the farmer is what price he gets for his pigs.  Of course there was less bacon.  If people have to kill their sheep and lambs and sell them at 3d. per lb., as was done all over the country, of course there will be no bacon imported.  Who is going to buy bacon when he can get mutton and lamb at 3d. per lb., and very often less than that?  One of the serious things that the Minister will find is that sheep farming was being carried on last year at such a terrific loss that the number of sheep in the country will be terribly depleted and it will be very difficult in a great number of areas to get an adequate supply of breeding ewes when times improve and this wretched economic war is brought to a conclusion.  When I was listening to all these arguments put forward by the Minister, not a single one of which would hold water, a phrase came into my mind of Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes.  He said: <Col N="1855" />&ldquo;The mind of a bigot is like the pupil of the eye, the more light you pour into it the more it contracts.&rdquo;  That seems to be the position of mind into which the Minister has brought himself. The more clear, the more obvious, and the more apparent it is from the facts of everyday life that agriculture is being ruined by this economic war, the more the Minister contracts his mind and refuses to deal with the patent and obvious facts.  Of course this country is being ruined. The Minister, in one portion of his speech, gave the better part of his mind a little fair play when he stated: &ldquo;We are told that all this thing is due to the economic war. There may be something to be said for that, that paying duty on our exports to Great Britain must necessarily take something off the value of the exports.&rdquo;  One would not mind if it was stated as an ordinary fact that it was due to the economic war, but the implication is always there, and something more than the implication, the definite assertion is there, that it is due to us that the economic war came about.</P>
    <P>He admits in that statement, or certainly goes very near admitting, that the present condition of agriculture is due to the economic war, as everybody knows it is.  He says they are not to blame for that war.  Why did they fire the first shot?  I am using the President's own phrase.  He stated in the House that they fired the first shot in the economic war, and if they fired the first shot in the economic war surely they are responsible for the war.  And they fired the first shot without having made any preparation or thought out the matter at all or foreseen what the effects would be.  There is where the present Administration is doubly culpable.</P>
    <P>The live-stock industry is in a most terrible condition at present and I wish the Minister would recognise that.  In March, 1914, before the outbreak of the war, the average price of fat cattle in the Dublin market was 33/- per cwt.  I do not know what the price was yesterday, but on yesterday week the price was 27/6.  In other <Col N="1856" /> words, fat cattle are now selling 5/6 per cwt. cheaper in the Dublin market than the pre-war price.  Take the fall from last year.  Cattle were 27/6 per cwt. this year in that market; last year they were 41/- &mdash; a tremendous drop.  They were 6d. per cwt. dearer in 1932 than in 1931.  When the Minister goes through the figures of exports he ought to bear in mind that in the spring of 1932 fat cattle were going well.  As I have said, in 1932 they were slightly dearer than in 1931. Anybody who deals in stores knows that in the first months of 1932 store cattle were going very much better than in 1931.  They are dropping now every day.  We know that cattle bought while this 40 per cent.  duty was in force are not now paying anything for their winter feeding.  That is the common experience.  The profit made on the winter feeding of cattle bought after the economic war had been declared ought to be the same as in any other winter, but it was not.  The reason is that the market is completely glutted.  There were these 120,000 cattle that were not exported, could not be sold, and cattle were not slaughtered indiscriminately as sheep were.  Really the Government have established a sort of blockade around this State and we are suffering now as a result.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the affirmative part of my motion, and I wish the whole discussion had been kept upon that part.  The Minister says it was vindictively put because it states that in the opinion of the Dáil the economic policy of the Executive Council has in its results impoverished a majority of the farmers.  The Minister says that is vindictive.  If the fair-minded people that the Minister alludes to, if the Fianna Fáil Party would honestly face the facts, it would be and ought to be common case in this House, that this economic policy is ruining the farmers.  Everybody knows that, and it ought to be frankly admitted.  I could understand the Government saying: &ldquo;The agricultural community is suffering very heavily at present but there are advantages to be got elsewhere from our policy.&rdquo;  I could understand that <Col N="1857" /> case being made, though I do not agree with it, but I cannot understand people saying that this policy is not injuring the country.  There ought to be common case, and it should be recognised that it is not merely injuring but breaking the State.  &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I am asked, &ldquo;did you put that in?&rdquo; I put those words in for this reason, that because your policy is putting a burden upon the agricultural community you have greater responsibility to them than you would otherwise have.  You said they gave you a majority, and because they gave you a majority&mdash;because you have 77 Deputies in this House&mdash;you think all your responsibilities are gone.  You take up this attitude, as far as I can gather: &ldquo;Those farmers put us in here.  They knew our policy. That policy is working and destroying them.  It is their own fault and we will not go out of our way to alleviate their condition.  We will simply come along and say: &lsquo;You are not suffering at all&rsquo;.&rdquo;  We know it got them in at the last election.  We know there were 77 Fianna Fáil Deputies elected, or, as it was very happily put by a Fianna Fáil Deputy some time ago, 77 living tomb-stones, &mdash;Fianna Fáil Deputies.</P>

We do not want to see those living tomb-stones erected over the grave of Irish agriculture. My proposal is that the farmers of this country who have not got the capital to buy seeds and manures for their land should be provided with those seeds and manures.  I never said, and this motion does not ask, that every farmer in the country ought to be given all the manure he wants.  That was the case which, as far as he dealt with the motion, the Minister endeavoured to refute&mdash;a case that is not put up. <Col N="1858" /> What I say is that the farmers who have not the capital requisite for the carrying on of their industry should be given an adequate quantity of artificial manures, agricultural seeds and spraying materials, to enable them to utilise fully the resources of their farm.  I am referring there to the farmers who have not now got the capital to enable them to farm their land; I do not include all farmers, men who have money, as some of them have, because there was an excellent period in this country; because up to the year 1932, when there was a change of Government, this agricultural community&mdash; due to the fact that the country had been properly worked and properly looked after&mdash;were better off than any other agricultural community on the face of the globe.</P>

The difficulties are not insuperable; the country is not hopeless; the country is not entirely broken, but it is being hurried to complete destruction by the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>If there is a bad harvest it would be a most appalling thing for this State, and how anybody could contemplate a bad harvest with equanimity, as the Minister seems to contemplate it, I certainly am entirely at a loss to understand. There is need for this help in connection <Col N="1859" /> with the purchase of artificial manures.  There was a circular sent out by the Minister's own Department, deploring the fact that artificial manures were not being purchased this year in their ordinary quantities, and making an appeal to the people to purchase them in their ordinary quantities and even to increase the amount, because&mdash;according to the circular, which I am sure is correct&mdash;the price of artificial manures is not unduly high, proportionate to their value, at the present moment.  It is, then, admitted by the Minister's own Department that there is a need for something to be done to make available a greater supply of artificial manures.  Why is there a falling off this year?  Why is a circular like that necessary?  The reason is because a huge number of farmers have not got the money with which to buy artificial manures and they have got to do without them.  The result of that will be deplorable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says he will make £25,000, or, if necessary £50,000, available to pay the losses on loans by the local authorities.  He has told the House that he endeavoured to think out some scheme and it had completely beaten him; that he could not think out any possible scheme that would improve upon the scheme which had been at work before.  The Minister evidently can do nothing for himself. His butter scheme he borrows completely and entirely from Australia; his method of dealing with manures and fertilisers is the old method for temporary and small emergencies; he can think of nothing new.  He makes appeals to us here to give him a scheme.  I am glad to see that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is now in his place.  He also has been making appeals across the House.  He says, like the Minister for Agriculture, &ldquo;our job is too heavy for us; we cannot carry it out.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary cannot think of anything else to spend money on except roads.  The Minister for Agriculture cannot think of anything else except old established schemes.  They cannot do anything new.  They make appeals to us to formulate schemes for <Col N="1860" /> them; we are to do the governing of the country from the Opposition Benches.</P>
    <P>The natural and proper thing for the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to do, if they find their jobs are too big for them, is to resign their jobs.  Have we got nothing else except a Government of limpets hanging on? Why can there not be a scheme?  Of course there could be a scheme if the Minister set himself and the officials of his Department to work&mdash;because there are very competent officials in his Department.  They could formulate a scheme.  Statistics are collected every year, and the collected statistics ought to be available.  In order to know how many acres are under potatoes they have to find the acreage under potatoes in every individual farm, and that is what the Guards do.  Would it not be possible to get those figures?  For instance would it not be possible to see how much land was under potatoes last year, let me take it?  Potatoes are an important crop.  I would be willing to withdraw this motion at the present moment if the Minister would give an undertaking that he would see that the potato crop is properly manured this year.  He could go out and discover the amount of land under potatoes last year, and from that he could see, when a man&mdash;whether he had one, two or three acres&mdash;made a statutory declaration that he had not the means of purchasing manures himself, that he was supplied with the necessary manures.  There is nothing impossible in devising a scheme.  If the Minister set himself to work, or got his officials to work, they could devise a scheme without great difficulty.  All we get from the Minister is: &ldquo;Oh, yes, I would like to help.&rdquo;  The Minister is very inconsistent.  At one time he declares that the farmers are not suffering in the economic war, and at another time he admits that they have not the necessary capital to carry on their industry. He regards the whole of this matter as being one that should be dealt with in a casual and off-hand fashion.  It is really terrible to think of the danger that is hanging over the people of this State, and the way the Government are facing it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1861" /> I have been told that I brought this motion forward on behalf of the large farmers.  That is not true.  It was brought forward, mainly, on behalf of my own constituents, the people amongst whom I have lived all my life&mdash;who are not cyphers to me but are men of flesh and blood.  I am not like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  I did not spend the best years of my life out of this State.  He can, if he wishes, when this country is ruined fold up his tent and, like the Arab, quietly steal away.  I am anchored here.  I have spent my whole life here.  All my affections are centred here.  The people on whose behalf I brought forward this motion are those amongst whom I live, the people who sent me into this Dáil.  I see them now being brought to a condition of misery by the incompetence of the present <Col N="1862" /> administration.  They are not, as they are to those on the Front Bench, mere cyphers.  They are my friends and my neighbours, the people amongst whom I have spent all my life, who are tied to me by every tie which can tie one man to a community, the ties of race and religion and of common interest. These people ought to be equally known to the Fianna Fáil Deputies all over the country.  They are the neighbours of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who should take the same interest in their constituents and feel for them as we feel for ours.  It is because of what I shall call the inhuman fashion that this Government is proceeding, bringing poverty and destruction on the unfortunate people of this country that I ask the House to pass this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donovan Mr. T. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of the Dáil the Executive Council should take steps to relieve the agricultural community from rates and annuities during the continuance of the economic war.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So much has been said on questions of this sort recently in this House that there is very little necessity for going into the reasons why we tabled this motion.  Since the commencement of the economic war last July nobody can deny that the farmer is in the front line trenches, and I am hoping, as a result of tabling this motion here, that the Government will accept the motion and have the farmer removed from the front line trenches, and help him until this economic war has ended. If this is not done, I fear for the future of the agricultural community and for the future of the business people.  I feel that, if this motion is not accepted, as I say, the farmer is going to remain in the front line trenches for all time.</P>
      <P>Often, I have wondered during the period of this war, if the Government realise the conditions that exist down the country.  I know that the Government have not on the Front Bench a farmer who knows anything about conditions.  They may be depending on some back benchers who can spout down the country that this is a war which is going to end the conditions that have existed in this country for hundreds of years.  I do not want to go back to Cromwell's time about this matter, but what I do want to stress is, that if the Front Benchers knew conditions down the country and realised what is happening, there would be no necessity for a motion of this sort.  With regard to conditions down the country, they must know that the trade with outside countries which absorbed all our surplus produce is down by £8,000,000 in eight months.  They say that they have saved £5,000,000 by the retention of the annuities and the other little items that are included, but that trade which is down by £8,000,000 in eight months, I think, speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>They must realise also that unemployment is not decreasing.  There is scarcely a change in the figures with regard to unemployment during the eight months period, and they must realise certainly that public services are practically at a standstill.  They must realise that the rates outstanding up to yesterday would amount actually to 50 per cent. of the total amount. When I put a question to the President recently on de-rating I asked him had he definitely abandoned it, and he answered &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  I asked him if he knew the conditions, and that 50 per cent. of the rates was uncollected and, moreover, was uncollectable, and his reply was: &ldquo;We shall see.&rdquo;  That is only one of the many threats that the President has made to the agricultural community during recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the financial year 30 per cent. of the rates in my county were uncollected.  I am speaking of County Cork, one of the best and the soundest counties in the Free State as far as the payment of rates and annuities goes.  The Government and the President have no mandate from <Col N="1865" /> the farmers and the ratepayers of West Cork or from Cork County to carry on this economic war.  Of course, we are reminded that in order to relieve agriculture the annuities have been reduced by 50 per cent.  On the other hand the Government has reduced the agricultural grant by £448,000, and that amount will have to come out of the rates.  The reduction of the agricultural grant, and the funding of the arrears of annuities&mdash;for which civil bills were issued last autumn, on which the people had to pay the costs&mdash;represent four and a half millions.  I doubt if relief from 50 per cent. of the annuities will represent anything over 25 per cent. when all the items are totted up.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals fall short of what was promised when the Fianna Fáil Party were seeking office and fall far short of the promises that were made by responsible Deputies in that Party throughout the country.  On July 25th, 1932, at a meeting held in Cork County Council Chamber, at which Deputy M.J. Corry presided, Deputy P.S. Murphy said that President de Valera had promised a deputation to retain the land annuities and to give full de-rating if we had industries.  The land annuities have been retained at a fearful cost, but de-rating has been abandoned.  The one industry that was in the country&mdash; the agricultural industry&mdash;has been killed.  Some people say that 300 industries have been established; others say 200 and others, 150.  We do not know how many have been established.  If industries have been established, they have been established at the cost to this State of tariffs of from 25 per cent. to 75 per cent., and articles value for £100 are going to cost £125 to £175.  In the industry that keeps 2,000,000 people employed, and that would employ far more if the opportunity were there, owing to the economic war we have to sell produce value for £100 for £50 and possibly less.  How does any Government expect that a big industry that was giving employment to two millions of people is going to live under these conditions?  None of the promises made by responsible members of the <Col N="1866" /> Fianna Fáil Party has been carried out, except the retention of the land annuities at a fearful cost.  As a result of the economic war I could site cases to prove conclusively that farmers have lost more than the equivalent of the rates and the annuities.  The price of pigs at the Farmers' Union abattoir at Cork varies from 55/- to 59/- a cwt. according to quality, but the price in Birmingham is from 70/- to 75/-.  There were big pig feeders in my constituency who produced both for the Irish and the English markets.  As a result of the tariffs they have lost 21/- per 1½ cwts. dead weight.  In one case a farmer with an annuity of £20, who fattened pigs has lost on pigs alone more than the amount of the annuity. What has that man lost on the other commodities he produced?  We are told that he has got bounties on live stock.  The bounty is 12½ per cent.  I may say that a bounty comes from one source and one source only, from the producers and taxpayers in this State. In the country the saying is that a bounty is like feeding a dog on his own tail.  The tariffs are charged on the gross value but the bounties are paid on the net value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only one bounty has been of any advantage to the producer in this country, and that is the bounty on butter.  When the Minister for Agriculture produced his Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Bill he knew, if the industry was to be kept going, that something of the kind should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Motions similar to this have been debated for such a long time in the Dáil that I think it would be unfair for me to inflict on this House many further examples but what I do want to stress is that unless some relief is <Col N="1867" /> given and unless the Government come to a sense of their responsibilities to the State, and end the economic war and give the farmer an opportunity of living as he did in the past, living an honest life and paying his way as far as he can, paying his just demands, I am afraid there is no hope for this country.  You cannot continue to pay bounties, subsidies and tariffs for ever. Responsible Ministers advocate the distribution of land.  They want to encourage tillage and to change the whole economic policy of this State so that as a result of that the farmer will be able to meet half the annuities and all his rates.  That in the face of it is a hopeless situation.  If Ministers and Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches were only honest with themselves and honest with the country they would tell the President that that is a hopeless policy, a policy that cannot work.  I come from a tillage area.  I have been engaged in tillage all my life.  I buy very little foreign foodstuffs.  I find to-day with practically over 40 per cent. of my land under tillage, producing excellent wheat, excellent oats and an excellent potato crop, that there is no market for any of them.  I fed them to cattle and I find to-day that the cattle to which I have fed them, which I have in the pink of condition, and which I as a small farmer must sell at the moment to meet my demands, which 12 months ago would realise £10 each, would not realise more than £4 or £5 each to-day. That sort of thing cannot continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture in his speech on Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's motion mentioned that he had added considerably to the wealth of the State and the wealth of the producer by the compulsory admixture of grain under the Cereals Bill.  In 1932 we had 760,000 acres of cereals.  The admixture of 10 per cent. took 76,000 acres.  The Minister said that the producer of barley and the seller of corn gained anything from&mdash;I cannot give his exact figures as I have not the Official Report before me&mdash;4/- to 5/- per barrel.  The admixture took 10 per cent. of the amount produced.  Let us <Col N="1868" /> say that we have 760,000 acres of corn and that the yield on the average would be a ton per acre.  That would give us 760,000 tons of cereals for the whole State and the admixture would take 76,000 tons of that.  The farmers who were fortunate enough to sell these 76,000 tons possibly got that extra 4/- or 5/-, but what did I get?  I had to feed my cattle with my corn and I am forced to sell my cattle at a huge reduction, at a price that they would have realised as dropped calves 12 months ago, after working my farm for 12 months, feeding my men, and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">

      <P>We will get a buyer for you if you are willing to sell them at that price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I put a question to the Minister last week about alternative markets he was very evasive.  He would give no information. The Deputy's buyer is the buyer who will buy at his price, if he can put a revolver to my head and take the cattle from me.  We had enough of that before.  I want to say that under these conditions this motion of mine is a motion that should be accepted by the Government, and if it is not accepted God help the country.  I want to say further, with regard to the remission of half the annuities, that we are not going to get half the annuities.  I do not think we will get a remission of a quarter of the annuities.  Of course, we do not know where we stand in regard to that matter at the moment and I do not think the Government know where they stand either.  What is the advantage of the remission of half the annuities to a man who is unable to market his produce, a man who is unable to meet his labour bill at the moment or unable to pay his shop debts?  How is he going to educate his family and lead a decent life under conditions of that sort?  Within the past fortnight we had the Labour Party in this House trying to make a fight against a wage of 24/- per week on relief schemes in this country.  I say that the Labour Party are responsible for what has happened in this country, because it was they who put Fianna Fáil in power <Col N="1869" /> and kept them in power.  It is as a result of their policy that a man is getting 24/- a week this year, but if he can get 12/- next year he will be a lucky man.  The Labour Party is the Party responsible for bringing about this state of affairs.</P>
      <P>I think that there is an unanswerable case for the acceptance of the motion.  If the President or any responsible Minister would take the trouble, instead of getting information from people who know nothing about the matter, of going around and visiting the fairs and markets of the country, he would see for himself the very sorry conditions that exist down the country.  He would accept this motion and he would immediately take steps to recover the one and only market that is worth looking for, to negotiate and stop this economic war and bring us back our markets so as to put us in a position to meet our demands and to rear our families as we think they should be reared.  We had a demand in Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's motion for free seeds and manures for farmers.  Let the President look over the list of farmers who received these free seeds and manures last year.  The farmers accepted them in good faith and the local authorities gave them in good faith and took it for granted that every farmer who got seeds and manures was going at the end of the harvest to be able to repay the price of them.  We have it now stated that the cost of them has not been repaid, and cannot be repaid, because the farmers have not the wherewithal to repay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said, on Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's motion, that they were prepared to give seeds and manures to farmers who are in want of them.  If, last year, the farmer thought he would be in a position to pay and he finds that as a result of last year's foolishness and folly he is unable to pay, he will have, this year, to go out of production because he is not going to add a further load to the impossible load upon him at the moment.  I think I have made a good case for the acceptance of this motion.  I hope that the Government <Col N="1870" /> will give it the consideration that it deserves, that they will not be carried away by any insane or foolish policy, that they will come to realise the conditions that exist in the country and that, as a result of these considerations, they will accept this motion and do what it seeks while the economic war lasts.</P>

      <P>It is indeed strange but pleasant to have this brilliant oratory from West Cork.  Looking at the whole thing on its merits, it seems as if my friend, Deputy O'Donovan, in the past allowed the roots of the tree to be cut into, leaving it, as it were, to weather the storm, while now he blames the Government for stepping in.  What is really the whole issue?  The Deputy went into the technicalities and avoided the main issue at stake.  What has been the position of the farmers in recent years?  I know what the position has been in West Cork.  From 1922, they have had shrinking markets. They had only a bit of oats declining year after year.  It is easy to look at the technicalities, but what is the real issue.  Is it not to weaken the armour of Ireland in the interests of the British Empire?  What is England's policy, and why is she persisting in this fight to-day?  In 1883, the Lord Lieutenant opened the Cork Show. How did he define British policy in Ireland?  He defined British policy in Ireland once and for all.  He said: &ldquo;I congratulate you, but remember that you, magnificent Irish people, must be content with a small population of two and a half or two and three-quarter millions.  You can never hope to be an industrial people.  You need never hope to be even an intensively agricultural people.  The fair lands of Ireland are alone suited to produce beef and mutton for the British Army and Navy.  Any extra population you have we can absorb in the great Imperial forces.&rdquo;  That is their policy in Ireland, to weaken the armour of this country.  What does the whole of this issue amount to?  This tree has been cut for the last ten years, and Deputy Cosgrave's Government <Col N="1871" /> and his Party backed up the forces who were trying to weaken and blight that tree.  Is not that the fact?  Was not the policy to weaken this country's armour?  Not a hand was lifted to strengthen it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has spoken about pigs. I have an invoice here from Cork which shows a 72 per cent. advance on the price of a little pig weighing 113 lbs.  There is not a word about that. Some of Deputy O'Donovan's lieutenants were in the front trenches one time, possibly serving under the flag of another country.  How is it that the things they can do to expose the present position of affairs they will not do?  If the Deputy wants this invoice he can have it.  The Deputy has spoken about this admixture.  In the closing stages of the last Government, were we not coming to a position in which Rankes would mill every lb. of meal in England and dump it over here for the benefit of the pig rancher. Does the Deputy not remember that the small man keeping up to half a dozen pigs was fast going off the market?  The one thing that stopped that was the admixture of oats and barley in the meal.  It gave a chance to the small man&mdash;and rightly so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hales</NameTxt>
      <P>The big pig rancher was going to dominate the whole market. This admixture has stopped it.  Why has it stopped it?  It is easily seen why it has stopped it.  I am not going into the figures.  The main thing is that that was stopped by this admixture, which was a brilliant idea. Take the question of cattle? Undoubtedly, the prices are down. But they would have been down even if these circumstances had not arisen. The arguments that have been used are bound to confuse and mislead the people.  This Government have to <Col N="1872" /> face and realise the position as it is. The fundamental principle is that there can be no retreat from the fight against the attempt to make the will of England dominate the will of Ireland. The farmers who are in the front trenches will either hold them or they will find themselves in the backwoods.</P>
      <P>I may relate a little incident that happened in West Cork in the old I.R.A. Council.  I put a question regarding the land.  I put it at one time to my brother during the civil war.  The question was: &ldquo;What is the position of your Government about the land annuities?&rdquo; I am not going to belie the dead now or to belie Michael Collins.  He said: &ldquo;We would never have fired a shot for Ireland if it was not for the freedom of the land because it was through the agitation for the land that the whole Volunteer movement started.&rdquo;  Why do you not stand united on the whole question?  You are asking us now to retreat.  That cannot be done.  What is the alternative? The alternative is for every man to put his shoulder to the wheel manfully once and for all.  I admit that the Government may not be going far enough, as Deputy O'Donovan said, but it is in a different direction that I think they are not going far enough.  I ask them to move more quickly in the big reforms&mdash;finance for instance&mdash;to see that the soldiers in the front trenches are supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To conclude, motions like this undoubtedly are confusing as any honest man on one side or the other can see. You are mixing up a clear fundamental principle with details.  You are putting up a position in which you say: &ldquo;Go and cut the roots of the tree&rdquo; and then you go back and abuse the man who is not responsible at all.  Now is your time, if you are Irishmen, to nurse these trees in one direction and in one direction only.  Stand united and say to England, once and for all, &ldquo;Ireland will win and the day will come when you may be glad to get our cattle and possibly that day may not be far off.&rdquo;  You will be strengthening the armour of Ireland not alone against England but against the world and strengthening the position of defence. Increase population and industry.  That <Col N="1873" /> possibly cannot be achieved in a month or six months or 12 months.  How can a tree come to perfection and maturity when the roots are cut?  That is what should be considered in all these debates.  It is your duty to heal now what you have inflicted in the past.</P>

      <P>I am supporting the motion in the name of Deputy O'Donovan, and I propose to approach it from a different aspect from that touched on by the previous speaker.  I think that this country, if I am to judge by the speech of Deputy Hales, is suffering from an overdose of high falutin'.  The kind of mentality that suggests a speech of the kind we have just listened to is unfortunately too prevalent in the country to-day.  The sensible, the sane and the prudent man who advises his people as to their course of action in a crisis, is told if that advice does not coincide with the views of the apostles of high falutin', that he is a traitor and an anti-Irishman, and that he is fighting England's battles.  In God's name, will we ever get back to sanity and sit down even in this House and discuss economic problems in the way they should be discussed and not by invoking the names of the dead, of Fionn MacCumhaill, Brian Boru and everybody else?  We cannot, apparently, approach these subjects in a sane and sensible manner without working ourselves into paroxysms of rage and enthusiasm on the invocation of some celebrity like Cuchulainn or Brian Boru.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience in the city goes to show that many of the purveyors of seed, fertilisers, etc., are unable to collect from the farmer their lawful debts.  The Irish farmer had a world reputation for honesty but, to-day, the Irish farmer, as a result of this economic war, is not in a position to pay his lawful debts.  I know many farmers who are actually ashamed to come into the city to-day fearing that they might meet some of their creditors and possibly be asked to square up their debts.  Ask any seed or manure merchant in the City of Dublin or the <Col N="1874" /> City of Cork how his books stand in relation to the farmer.  It will be news, I am sure, and, perhaps, unwelcome news, to the Minister for Agriculture to learn that all over the County of Cork, with very few exceptions, the farmers have almost gone bankrupt. Let us see what the repercussion of this poverty-stricken state of the farmer is on the citizens.  Any person walking along the docks in the City of Dublin or Cork will have ample evidence there of the results of this economic war.  We have idle dockers; we have unemployed seamen and we have unemployed workers in all departments of industry in the cities as a result of the impoverishment of the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is admitted by every Deputy in the House that agriculture is our main industry, and even the ordinary schoolboy in the second or third standard would understand that if our main wealth producer is in an impoverished condition, it must of necessity react on the remainder of the community, represented by 25 per cent.  Ask any commercial traveller who is travelling for any of the wholesale houses in Dublin, Cork or Limerick, what is happening in the country.  He comes back at week-ends with very few orders, and he will tell you that he can get plenty of orders, but very little money.  Take any country town and ask the small shopkeeper there how he stands.  He will tell you that, in many cases, there are hundreds of pounds out from him, and in some cases, thousands of pounds, by way of credit, and he sees no hope now of getting any of that money on account of the continuance of this economic war.  We have, as I suggested, unemployment becoming more intensified in the cities as a result of the war with our best customers, and the farmer, after all, is not asking for a whole lot in this motion when he suggests that he should be relieved from rates and annuities during this economic war.  As a matter of fact, I am already convinced that, whether he is relieved by law or not, he will not be able to meet them.  There is an old saying that you cannot get blood out of a turnip, and I do not see how <Col N="1875" /> you are going to collect 100 per cent. of rates or annuities from the farmer when he has not got the money.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the case which I would submit to the Minister for Agriculture.  What is the natural reaction on the farmer of decreased markets and uneconomic prices?  I would put it to him this way: What would be the reaction of the merchant tailor, for instance, if he were getting no orders and no money for suits of clothes?  He would certainly go out of production, and produce only for himself, and my greatest fear, and a well grounded fear, is that the farmer's reaction to present-day economic conditions will be that he will go out of production.  As Deputy O'Donovan suggested, he will, of necessity, have to go out of production, because he is selling a finished commodity&mdash;a pig or a beast&mdash;at a price which does not pay him.  His reaction to that state of affairs will be that he will produce only for himself, and it would be very hard to blame him.  How will the rest of the community be affected by a change such as that?</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister for Agriculture to say that we will have to increase tillage to provide a sufficiency of plain food for our people, but I would remind the Minister that while it may be good policy to preach the hair shirt, and the tightening of the belt, people do not want to wear hair shirts and do not want to tighten their belts.  We have gone away from that stage; there is a strong objection on the part of most people to it to-day. There is very strong objection&mdash;and some of it may come from the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;to going back to the simple life envisaged by President de Valera. I feel that if we do not grant the farmer the relief sought for in this motion then, whether we like it or not, we will have to accept the fact that he will not be able to pay.  Deputy O'Donovan suggested that 40 per cent. of the rates are uncollectable.  That is absolutely true and the sooner we face up to that fact the better.</P>
    <P>Most of the arguments that can be put forward were used when similar <Col N="1876" /> motions came before the House on former occasions and I do not want to labour the question further, except to ask the Minister how does he think the Irish farmer and the working-class people as a whole will be able to pay under the conditions, which are gradually becoming worse, that have resulted from the economic policy of the present Government.</P>

      <P>I think the irresponsible Deputy was the first to introduce it, but I do not profess to understand his Northern brogue.  This economic war is having effects that are felt far beyond the agricultural community. Anybody who has even a remote connection with charitable organisations, welfare leagues or similar organisations must know that in the cities and the towns the resources of these organisations are taxed to their utmost limit.  The sick poor associations, the St. Vincent de Paul Association, and so on, are ample testimony to what I have said.  We have a growing number of unemployed in Cork.</P>

Will he state what effects it has had already, not only upon the agricultural community, but upon the people of the country as a whole? Deputy O'Donovan referred to the establishment of factories.  What are these factories?  Factories are established giving employment to numbers of little girls, while the fathers of those girls are walking the streets of Dublin and of Cork, unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I was proceeding to demonstrate what were the reactions and repercussions on the townspeople of the impoverishment of the agricultural community.  If you say it is out of order to relate the economic conditions of the townpeople, to-day, to the conditions of the agricultural community then I find myself cribbed, cabined and confined within a very narrow circle.  However, I want to give a further instance of the way in which the farmer is impoverished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may not be widely known to Deputies, but it is well known to most agriculturists, that many farmers who have vesting orders have vested in them riparian and game rights.  I know numbers of farmers who used to derive anything from £50 to £200 per annum out of fishing, not to talk at all of what revenues were derived from the letting of shooting.  I know that from Cork to Macroom on the River Lee, many farmers were able to let their fishing rights, and I know that one mile of that fishing has not been let this year.  That represents a very serious loss to the farmers to whom I have referred.  In addition, <Col N="1879" /> it may not be known, either, that these farmers have to pay pretty heavy rates for this fishing.  All this is a loss of revenue to the country and, if this economic war is allowed to continue, it will mean that the farmers will have still further losses. For those reasons, amongst others, I beg to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMichaelBurke" hpid="Mr. J.M. Burke Mr. J.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it ought not to be necessary to stress to this House the impoverished condition, the pitiable plight of the farmers, because I think it is obvious to everybody in the country who is not blinded by political prejudice.  The pitiable condition, the plight of the farmers has reacted most disastrously on every member of the community.  I am personally aware, and I am sure it is well known to various Deputies, that many honest, thrifty and industrious farmers are at the present time not only unable to pay their rates, but are not in a position to meet their ordinary obligations.  It is perfectly true, as Deputy Anthony has pointed out, that many of the farmers are actually afraid to go into the towns lest they may meet their creditors. That is a fact that cannot be denied, at all events so far as County Cork is concerned, and I am sure County Cork is no worse off than any other part of the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a serious motion of this kind is brought forward, a motion affecting what is admittedly the key industry of the country, it is regrettable that it is not met by any serious arguments from the other side.  Here, the other evening, I listened to a speech in reference to another motion and, so far as I remember the arguments that were put up against it, they were to this effect: &ldquo;Our Party was returned to power by the farmers of the country who know their business a great deal better than any one of their representatives in the House knows it.&rdquo;  Of course, that statement is not true, but admitting it is true for the sake of argument, it will be borne in mind by everybody that seven or eight years ago the slogan was that minorities were always right.  The watchword to-day is that majorities <Col N="1880" /> can never be wrong.  I was forcibly reminded, by a remark from a Deputy the other night, that in a place called Jerusalem on a very memorable occasion a highway robber named Barabbas got all the preference votes.  It is within the memory of most Deputies that a man named Horatio Bottomley used to get the immense bulk of the votes in the Borough of Hackuey, or somewhere in North London.</P>

      <P>I am merely endeavouring in my humble way to answer the arguments put up from the other side in reference to a motion which was cognate to the motion now before us. We were told here by, I think, Deputy Flinn that we were all pessimists on this side of the House, that we were all donning the mantle of Jeremiah who, like Deputy Flinn himself, was the greatest publicity agent of his time and probably the greatest poseur Jerusalem ever produced.  But he did not go so far as to say that we were putting on the robe of Cassandra.  I am an unrepentant optimist.  I hope I will not hurt Deputy Flinn, because he is a man for whose ability I have the greatest admiration, although he is a master of flouts, jibes and jeers, by saying that if he lived in ancient times, in the days of ancient glory, he would be a master amongst Sophists, who had the reputation of being able to make the worse appear the better reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1881" /> I am sure Deputy Flinn will not take it in an offensive spirit when I say that I am optimistic enough to think I could make a profit by buying a barrel of cured herrings from Deputy Flinn and selling them to a New York Jew.  We were told we will have to get rid of our cattle.  Having got a long dissertation about chilled meat, we were told that we should get rid of our cattle.  That reminded me of a classical story.  Some of you may have read Homer.  There was a character named Ajax and he got it into his head that all the sheep were his enemies.  Apparently Deputy Flinn has got it into his head that the cattle are his enemies.  I am quite satisfied that Deputy Flinn is perfectly sincere.  I believe he actually has an implicit belief in what he has stated. But sincerity is not always the test of merit.  Why, the sincerest man I ever met in my life was in a mental home. He was perfectly convinced that he was the square root of minus one.  He really believed it, but he was not the square root of minus one.</P>

      <P>I was showing the effect on the various Services of the respective scales which are set out in the Schedule of the Bill.  I was showing how equitably they would apply to the various branches of the public service, <Col N="1882" /> taking all the circumstances into consideration. I think I had dealt with the position of those who are at a point on the various scales of salaries up to £1,000 per annum.  At the point of £1,00 per annum a civil servant would, under the provisions of the Bill and due to the operation of the cost-of-living figure, suffer a deduction of £84 4s. per annum; an officer in the Army enjoying the same pay would suffer a deduction of £85 per annum, and an officer of the Gárda Síochána would suffer a deduction of £77 18s. per annum.  Up to the point of £1,200 a civil servant would suffer, due to the Bill and the fall in the cost-of-living bonus, a deduction of £99 13s.; an officer in the Army would suffer a deduction of £100; an officer in the Gárda Síochána, £91 13s.  At the point of £1,300 in the scale, a civil servant would suffer a loss of £117 5s., and an officer in the Gárda £107 14s.  Up to the point of £1,400 per annum the civil servant would suffer a reduction of £136 19s., and the Gárda officer £125 1s.  A civil servant whose total remuneration was £1,500 will suffer a reduction of £158 19s. per annum. There is no civil servant in the State with a salary of £1,600 per annum, but if there was such a civil servant he would suffer a reduction of £180 12s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures which I have read will give the House and the country some idea of the economies which we are enforcing on the public service.  These figures will give an idea of the magnitude of these economies.  They will also I think serve another purpose. They will indicate that so far as possible the burden has been imposed equitably upon all branches of the service.  I do not know whether it would be necessary at this stage to discuss the question whether that in fact is true or not.  All I know is that it has been the purpose of the Government to realise such an equitable distribution.  I would suggest that, possibly, it is a matter which does not arise immediately for debate at this stage of the Bill; that in the Committee Stage the Schedules can be discussed in detail and, as I think I have indicated, it is not proposed to take the Committee Stage of the Bill <Col N="1883" /> until after Easter.  So that the various sections of the House will have time to formulate any criticisms they may have to make as to the manner in which the sacrifices are being exacted from the various classes of public servants.</P>
    <P>As to the amount which we hope to gain from this Bill, I want to say that speaking last year I indicated that we hoped to secure by a reduction in the salaries and allowances in the various public services a sum of £250,000 per annum.  Of course at that time already almost six weeks of the financial year had elapsed.  It would be necessary, then, if we were to secure that sum in the remaining portion of the year to have imposed burdens possibly at a heavier rate than they are imposed in this Bill.  Leaving that fact out of consideration, and remembering that the scope of this Bill is somewhat wider than was in my mind at any rate when I made that statement in May last year, the total amount which I hope to secure by the particular operation of this Bill as distinct from and excluding any savings we may secure in the cost-of-living bonus, will be about £280,000 for the year as contrasted with the figure of £250,000 which I mentioned last year as the saving in something less than 12 months.</P>
    <P>This year we hope to make the saving effective for the whole 12 months.  The burden may, if possible, be increased in some cases, in other cases our experience was that it would be desirable not to impose our original intentions in their full rigour but to ameliorate them in some way. I do wish to say, speaking personally, that I feel that these are heavy sacrifices. I do not want to disguise that from the community at all.  I do not want to lead any section of the public service to feel that we are indifferent to the sacrifices which we ask them to accept now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, only for one year.  Our need is very much greater this year than last year.  The need <Col N="1884" /> everywhere of all Governments to secure economies is greater than it was last year.  If we have to cast our net a little wider, and if in some instances we have to ask for increased sacrifices, it is merely, as I have said, because our need is greater, and that more drastic measures must be taken to meet that need.  The year which is closing, I am happy to say, as far as present indications go, will be much less unfavourable, and will turn out to be much more satisfactory than some of the dismal prophecies which we were hearing during the last three months would have foreshadowed.  The revenue has been in all circumstances fairly elastic. I believe that our Estimates in that regard are going to be realised if not exceeded, but the preliminary estimates of the revenue for next year which we have prepared, indicate that we may expect a substantial decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, there has not been a corresponding decline in expenditure.  Such a decline in expenditure could only have been secured at the cost of the social services and it is not the policy of the Government to secure economies in that way. On the other hand, if revenue is going to decline, and if expenditure cannot be reduced, there is only a choice of two ways in which the deficiency may be met, either by imposing additional taxation or meeting it to some extent, as the Government propose to meet it, by reducing, not expenditure on the social services, but by reducing the remuneration paid to public servants. I do not want to be taken as, in general, favouring that as a principle. I feel that the community ought to pay as much to its public servants as it can afford to pay, but the time comes when the ability of the community to continue to pay salaries at rates which were fixed in more prosperous times comes to be one for consideration and one for doubt.  I believe that in our case it has gone past the stage for doubt, and it is now a certain and an assured fact that, for the coming year at any rate, public salaries and remuneration could not be maintained at the rates and the standards which have hitherto obtained here.  Consequently we are <Col N="1885" /> in this position: We cannot, and we do not wish to impose any additional taxation.  We have got to balance our Budget; we have to pay our way. Therefore, in all the circumstances, we have got to ask these public servants, who, taking every factor into consideration, can best afford to make the sacrifice, to make a sacrifice which will enable this State to maintain its good reputation and its good credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill, 1933 until provision is included therein for the reduction of allowances payable to Deputies and Senators.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The position that we on these Benches have taken up in this matter has been on certain occasions deliberately misrepresented and, therefore, I propose to preface my remarks by saying that we fully recognise that it is essential to secure the truly democratic character of this Assembly, and to do that it is the duty of the State to make it possible for people, no matter what their resources may be, to come here and represent their fellow-citizens if their fellow-citizens desire to send them.  Therefore, every Deputy is entitled to an adequate allowance to make it possible for him to do that.  I personally recognise that in arriving at an estimate of what an adequate allowance is we must have in mind the position of a wage earner who is obliged to absent himself from his work, possibly to leave his position, in order to discharge his public duties in this House. I certainly fully recognise that an allowance, sufficient to make it possible for such a person to exercise his democratic rights is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance suggested in the course of his observations that he would have preferred me to have taken a different course from that of putting down an amendment at this stage.  I would have preferred to have proposed an amendment to introduce <Col N="1886" /> a new section, but the structure of the Bill did not permit of that.  I would remind the Minister that the reason I have taken this occasion to bring this question to issue is that 12 months ago in introducing his Budget it was suggested to him that before he asked for further sacrifices from different sections of the community he should take steps to see that the members of the Oireachtas made their contribution on a fair and equitable basis.  In the last 12 months we have heard nothing from the Minister as to his intentions on that matter, nor, so far as I am able to see, has he in this Bill, or in any of his public speeches, given any sign that it was his intention to examine this matter from the point of view from which we wish to have it examined.</P>
    <P>I move the amendment in order to extract from the Government a Bill designed to effect economy in public services which we can support. Personally, I should much prefer to see the Government pursuing economy at the expense of the public services along the lines of reducing personnel and as and when they have reduced personnel as low as they can, consistent with an efficient public service, then and only then should they proceed to bring salaries down, if the public purse demands it.  It seems to me, however, to be a strange form of economy to make a great public <i>démarche</i> of reducing salaries and, at the same time, increasing the junior staff in certain Departments to the tune of £60,000 or £70,000 as the Government are doing by the tariff policy in which they are at present engaged.  To my mind it is going to serve the public purse very little to reduce the salaries heavily all along the line and, at the same time, to introduce a horde of new officials under the Wheat Bill, under the Tariff Bill, under the Prices Control Bill, and the hundred and one other measures that the Government have brought in, so that what we save to the public purse at the one end we are going to scatter at the other end in the creation of new officials.  To my mind that line of economy is all wrong.  The <Col N="1887" /> object of the Government should be to reduce the personnel so far as it is consistent with efficient public administration, and then, and only then, if public economy required it, to call upon that personnel to make such sacrifices as are just and equitable in the common good.  We feel that to call upon that personnel to make these sacrifices without showing ourselves to be prepared to share the sacrifices is to give them reasonable grounds for resentment.  If there are to be sacrifices&mdash;and the President did not put a tooth in it, because he said on a historic occasion, &ldquo;We cannot have omelettes if we do not break eggs&rdquo;&mdash;if we are to have sacrifices in order to prosecute this economic war, then our position is that the sacrifices should be equally and fairly divided amongst all sections of the community. The Government should not look to the agricultural community to bear the whole share of the burden, and they should not look to civil servants to bear the whole share of the burden.</P>
    <P>The burden should be distributed evenly between professional classes, the Civil Service; the members of this House, the agricultural community and the labouring man; all should bear a fair and equal share.  I know it may be said in certain quarters that it is comparatively easy for somebody who is not dependent exclusively on his Parliamentary salary to advocate deductions.  I am not suggesting, nor will I at any other time suggest, that we should reduce the allowance of members of this House below the figure which we have laid down as sufficient for a civil servant or a public servant to rear a family on.  I am of opinion that if we equate the Parliamentary allowance to the salary which was given by the State to a civil servant in 1922, when our allowance was fixed, we cannot feel that we are doing the poorest man in this House an injustice by bringing his Parliamentary allowance down to the same level as we are prepared to bring a civil servant's salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about members of the Oireachtas who attend the Dáil on an average of 72 days a year, and are accordingly remunerated on a basis of £5 per day.  I am fully aware that a conscientious Deputy has expenses in going about his constituency at home, and that he has expenses in looking after the true interests of his own people, but it should be borne in mind always that he has free 1st class railway expenses to and from his constituency.  I do not want anyone to imagine that we are going to advocate the cutting of Deputies' salaries down to some preposterous figure.  I am prepared to defend the principle that if the true democratic character of this House is to be preserved an adequate allowance must be made, but what I say is that if a certain sum was adequate in 1922 for a member of this Dáil, and for a civil servant or public servant of any kind, then the same sum is adequate to-day for a member of the Dáil or a member of the Civil Service.  I feel that when we put our hands to the task of reducing our neighbours' income we ought to be sure that we are not ready to ask any man to bear a burden which we ourselves are not prepared to bear. It is very easy for Deputies to get up and say &ldquo;so-and-so has plenty, and it does not matter to him what allowance he gets.&rdquo;  There are very few people in this country, after the last 12 months, who have plenty.  I might remind some Deputies that those of us who are trying to do our best to prevent the growth of unemployment, and who are trying to keep on our pay-rolls men who served us well in the past, and who now, as a result of the policy to which this country has been committed, have no work to do, find it hard enough to make ends meet.  There are many <Col N="1889" /> people, though perhaps they had enjoyed the reputation of being persons of substance, who, in consequence of the burdens that are being put upon them&mdash;unless they turn their employees out into the street&mdash;are left with a very little margin.</P>
      <P>No one wants to drag his own affairs before the public notice on an occasion of this kind.  I merely wish to discuss this question on its merits, without reference to the personal affairs of any individual Deputy.  I admit the principle that once we have a flat rate we must resolve that the poorest man who is called upon to discharge public duties will be adequately provided for, otherwise he would be at a disadvantage, and there should be no question of advantage or disadvantage as between any two men coming into this House.  I quite admit that.  I also hold that we should not ask public servants or other persons over whose income we have control, to make sacrifices we are not prepared to share in the same proportion.  It is for that reason, and in order to secure an undertaking from the Minister now, or a Bill, drafted in different form, which will spread financial sacrifices evenly between us&mdash;the members of this Oireachtas&mdash;and the people whose salaries we propose to reduce, that I introduce this amendment.  If the Minister will introduce a Bill giving effect to these proposals, then we will support his Bill.  We believe in the reduction of public expenditure, and we believe that it is the duty of the Minister to effect a substantial reduction in public expenditure.  We will co-operate with him and assist him in any way we can, but we ask that he should proceed on a fair and equitable basis.  If and when he signifies his intention to do so, he is assured of our support, but until he is prepared to give that undertaking this amendment stands, and I move it.</P>

He does not know whether or not he can afford to appear before the Civil Service as leavening the spirit of a holiday abroad with the feeling that his duty has been done by fixing in some way or another the cuts in the Civil Service salaries. In fact, the decision has been taken to-day in order to relieve the mind of the Minister, when he is away on holidays, from the anxiety that might hang over it if this decision were not taken now. We oppose this measure.  We oppose it because it is introduced by the most uneconomic and the most spendthrift, as well as the most destructive, Government this country could have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister yesterday evening at 7.30 took a breathing space in the middle of a Second Reading speech on the Damage to Property Bill.  That is a Bill under which, in the circumstances of the bad financial conditions <Col N="1891" /> that the Minister implies but does not describe in his speech, he proposes that the taxpayers of this country would contribute money for its payment over to persons who had suffered injury in property or in goods in circumstances in which they were associated together for the purpose of destroying property and goods&mdash; persons who, according to Section 9 of the Damage to Property Act, 1923, were &ldquo;associated or combined or in league with the person or persons by whom the injury was committed for the committal of that injury or for the committal of other similar injuries to property.&rdquo;  Those persons combined together to destroy property, their own amongst others.  They gave their own property for the purposes of an organisation that carried out the destruction of property, and they are to be compensated in this very bad financial year for damage that they themselves did to their own property, if necessary.</P>
    <P>When the Budget was introduced last year, a Budget and a general policy which, as Deputy Dillon has indicated, has left very few people in this country in the position in which they can boast of any great riches after 12 months experience of it, it was described from the benches on this side as the economic counterpart of the civil war.  This Bill is a continuance of the attack on the administrative machinery of this State that was begun in 1922 and that has continued ever since, an attack not only continued on the lines proposed in this Bill, but continued in many other ways.  The Government that is so careful to cut down the expenses of the machinery of administration in this country sent to the courts within the last few days not only its Attorney-General but Senior Counsel and Junior Counsel, for what?  To prosecute individual units in the machinery of the administration of this country, individuals in that machinery that they have been after since 1922.  No expense was to be spared, not for the prosecution of communists caught on the roofs of houses in Dublin with revolvers, but <Col N="1892" /> for the prosecution of responsible officers who were, if you like, part of the machinery that carried on the administration of this country against the attacks of the party now in power.</P>
    <P>It is because of the general policy of the Executive Council and the general losses that they have brought on the country that we are opposed to this measure.  They tell us that they are going to save £280,000 by this Bill.  They say it is only for this year.  That is untrue.  That is not their intention.  Yesterday the Government were convenienced by getting through all its stages a Bill dealing with the dairying industry. I do not know what information was given to the House as to what that Bill is going to cost the country.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> states, following its examination of the situation created by it, that it is going to cost the consumers of this country £1,200,000.</P>

      <P>The figures in connection with that measure are such as to suggest that for the butter alone that is exported out of the country £480,000 approximately is to fall on the people of this country, or nearly twice the amount of money that is to be saved under the Bill we are discussing. The farming community know <Col N="1893" /> that that is a very small figure in their total losses.</P>
      <P>It is at this time when a policy is being pursued which is costing our farmers millions of pounds, and is going to throw on the consumers of butter a charge of £480,000, that it is proposed to save this sum of £280,000 and from whom?  From the men who, in my opinion, are standing between the people of this country and the destruction of the State.  I suggest that the Minister for Finance could not get another Minister to take this Bill and pilot it through the House because, as politicians at the cross-roads, they had told the mob that they were going to go and cut off the big salaries in Dublin.  As administrators in office they met civil servants, big and small, and realised something of the work that falls on the civil servant, realised how very futile and very often misdirected will be the effort of a political head if he has not the preparatory work done for him and if he has not the guidance and the experience that is enshrined in our Departments of State.  They find it difficult, coming from the cross-roads and having addressed the mob there as to what they were going to do with the big salaries&mdash;after spending a couple of months working in co-operation with the heads of the Civil Service, or the middle and lower classes in the Civil Service, to stand up in public and say: &ldquo;These men are not worth their money.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested in many ways that this country is over-officialed. When I think of the incompetence of some officials in various parts of the country that members on the opposite benches stand over in the administration of local government work and the salaries they pay them, and then think of the work that is done up here, I find it very difficult to have any respect for many persons on the far side or to have any belief in their sincerity that they want this country administered in a sound or economic way.  I say to members of this House that this country in its Civil Service is not over-officialed. In 1922 we took over the Civil Service of this country such as it was then.  It was a Civil Service that <Col N="1894" /> fed straight into the head Departments in London.  Over that Civil Service we put a top: we put the necessary keystone that made the Civil Service here a self-contained unit and linked it up with the Oireachtas.  We did that with an economy of numbers and an economy of salaries.  I personally take exception to statements made by persons in responsible political positions in the country, such as Deputy MacDermot, who from time to time seems to make it as one of the foundation stones upon which he will build up a farmers' organisation in this country that &ldquo;Mr. Cosgrave introduced a horde of officials into this country.&rdquo;  Mr. Cosgrave did nothing of the kind.</P>

      <P>Any responsible section of people in this country that takes up the attitude that there is a horde of officials around the Government here in Dublin who are overpaid and underworked is doing as big a disservice, as a class, to themselves as they could possibly do, and is doing a very big disservice to the country as a whole.  I do not think that there is a single Deputy in this House, whatever may be his politics on this measure, who has attempted to do any serious work for his constituents, who does not realise the excellence and the merits of the civil servants generally and the absolute necessity to this country to have a good Civil Service, and to have it so well paid that you will relieve the heads of the Civil Service from anxieties that might otherwise be theirs.  It must be remembered that, while a Minister can leave his office at any time, the man who is at the top of the Civil Service has, night and day, the responsibilities and the worries of everything that is a matter of policy and of administration in the country here.  I say that this Bill before us is nothing but low politics on the one side, and, on the other side, a continuance of the attack on this State that has gone on since 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, personally, do not approve of the amendment that Deputy Dillon has put down to this Bill.  I think that the proposal in the Bill should be discussed <Col N="1895" /> on its merits, and on its merits alone.  I think, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves here, and with this measure coming from the hands of those from whom it is coming, that the country or the representatives who can in any way stand for any scrap of the policy with which it is associated&mdash;the present economic war that is completely undermining our whole economic conditions in this country&mdash;are only reducing themselves to a very absurd and a silly position. What Deputies are paid or what they are not paid does not matter twopence in a country in which policies are being pursued such as those being pursued here.  So far as proposals like it are concerned, they are as a smoke-screen drawn across the situation here and designed to feed further the stirring up of feeling among the mob and the unemployed that there are big people at the top with money, including Deputies, who can be stripped in order to provide them with the things they want.  In so far as things of that kind are concerned, it is designed to help the Fianna Fáil policy of developing a very strong, very active, and well-mobilised left wing in this country.  We are asked in this Bill to cut the salaries of members of the Civil Service, who are doing hard, solid and necessary work, men who, by the very fact of their existence&mdash;notwithstanding the policies that are being pursued on the opposite side, and which are actually being put into force&mdash;by their very existence and their work saved this country from some of the dangers and from some of the losses that would otherwise have fallen on this country. These people are going to be cut in their salaries.  Their standard of living is going to be reduced.  The domestic anxieties under which they labour, and under which they labour increasingly with the rise in income tax and the increasing difficulties that they are finding in placing their children into employment in this country, and with the hope of doing that receding in so many homes are to be increased&mdash; and these are the people whose salaries you are being asked <Col N="1896" /> to cut.  You are being asked to cut the salaries of these men by people who, while individually digging themselves in pretty well, are destroying the economic foundations of this country&mdash;for that is what is happening.</P>
    <P>We have been told that this Bill is urgent and that this Bill is necessary. We got it yesterday.  We were told voluntarily from the opposite side that it was going to be discussed to-day. I suggest that it was deliberately left in that position in order that in a short session of the House&mdash;in a Friday House&mdash;there might not be the critical examination of this measure that it deserves.  From the first letter to the last full stop we are opposed to this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that the Labour Party is opposed to this Bill, and equally opposed to Deputy Dillon's amendment. Before I deal with the Bill, I should like to say a few words about Deputy Dillon's amendment.  In my opinion, Deputy Dillon's amendment is so much eye-wash and so much claptrap, and nobody knows it better than Deputy Dillon, who, I am sure, is capable of working out a simple sum in arithmetic in order to see how much money would be saved to the taxpayer if the allowances to Deputies were halved.  Deputy Dillon says that the present scale of salaries for Deputies was fixed in 1922; but he says that since then reductions were made in the allowances to civil servants and that, consequently, there should be a reduction in the allowances to Deputies.  Everybody knows that the civil servants very vigorously opposed the reductions.  In face of the protest by the civil servants, Deputy Dillon wants to offer them some consolation, or rather pretends to deceive them into believing that he is offering consolation, by an amendment of this character.  Deputy Dillon took 1922 as the starting point for the purpose of his comparison.  I am sure that Deputy Dillon is not unfamiliar personally with the fact that in 1909, 1910, 1911, 1912, 1913 and 1914, members of the old Irish Parliamentary Party were paid a salary of £400 per annum.  If that was a fair and adequate <Col N="1897" /> remuneration for a member of Parliament from 1908 to 1914, and no protest, on the ground of extravagance against that remuneration was made, surely an allowance of £360 per annum in 1933 is not extravagant, when we remember that some members of the old Irish Parliamentary Party, admired then and admired now by Deputy Dillon, received at that time the sum of £400 per annum.</P>
      <P>I believe what the Deputy said to-day was just part of the supercilious, superior nonsense that emanates from people who talk about doing things with a high public spirit, but who make sure that they themselves are well fortified with this world's goods, behind all their protestations of public spirit.  There is not a member on these benches&mdash;and I make the offer now to the Leader of the Centre Party; and I do not mind if a Commonwealth chairman arbitrates &mdash; who would not exchange this world's goods with the leader and the deputy leader of the Centre Party.  Deputy Dillon knows perfectly well, and so does Deputy MacDermot, that even if the amendment is carried, and even if there is a substantial reduction in the allowances paid to Deputies, so far as the leader and the deputy-leader of the Centre Party are concerned, there will be no sacrifice.  Yet, apparently well endowed with this world's goods, they propose to set a standard for other people.  I suggest that that kind of supercilious patronising outlook ought to be dropped.  If Deputy Dillon feels that he has more salary or allowance than he can use, there are abundant ways to put it to some useful purpose, instead of coming to this House, fortified, presumably, with a good bank balance, and purporting to prescribe an economic existence for other people.  I suggest to Deputy MacDermot that ordinary good taste should induce him to persuade the deputy-leader of the Party to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to deal with the Bill. I did not catch what the Minister said, but I understand from Deputy Mulcahy that he hoped to save approximately <Col N="1898" /> £280,000 in connection with this scheme of economy.</P>

      <P>Presumably it is necessary to save £280,000 this year. On the Second Reading of the Railways Bill I stated that the Government definitely and deliberately decided to hand over £280,000 to the railway companies, which it is admitted by the Government and the railways is actually owing to the State to-day.  I said to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was in charge of the measure in this House, that I hoped that as there was an economy crisis or when furrowed brows were endeavouring to balance the Budget, that someone would remember the generous gift which the State gave to the railways, because under the Railways Bill they are given £280,000.  Apparently that £280,000, handed over to the railways by the State, is now to be got out of the pockets of the public servants who are attacked in this Bill.  Does the Government want to act the part of Brewster with the railway companies and, in many cases, act the part of Lazarus with its own underpaid servants?  The Minister said it was necessary to have the cuts, and this Bill is introduced to attack public servants, whose remuneration is threatened in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a doctor who is carrying on his practice and receives an income up to £1,000 yearly.  Is it fair that a doctor in the Civil Service, receiving £1,000 per annum, should be asked to make this sacrifice when the doctor outside is not going to be asked to make a similar sacrifice, even though the outside doctor's remuneration may be twice as great as the remuneration of the doctor in the Civil Service.  Of course this Bill is not confined to the cutting of the remuneration of civil servants in receipt of substantial salaries.  The Bill is an attack not merely on salaries which are fairly substantial but on low salaries, because whole groups of wage earners will be assailed by the wage slashing policy enshrined in it.  The <Col N="1899" /> Bill is endowed with the title &ldquo;Public Services (Temporary Economics) Bill.&rdquo;  That title is a masquerade.  It is a wage-slashing Bill, and the Minister knows perfectly well that those in receipt of £2 10s. a week will be cut.  I put it to the Minister, to Deputy Cooney, and to Deputy Cormac Breathnach, who have trade union connections, are they going to stand for trade unions or for an attack on the wages of people with £2 10s. a week?  If that principle is announced, as Deputy Cooney and Deputy Breathnach know, there is a definite incitement to private employers to follow the example.  If Deputy Good or Deputy Dockrell were here, I am sure they would have no hesitation in saying that the mentality postulated in this Bill will be noted with considerable glee in the Chamber of Commerce, and will be noted with care by employers' organisations in the city and elsewhere throughout the country. One can imagine the statement of the Minister for Finance being read carefully and analysed by some wage-cutting employers, in order that they may obtain from him the requisite amount of philosophy to &ldquo;put over&rdquo; wage cuts on their employees.</P>
    <P>Call this Bill what you will, it makes a definite attack on the remuneration of people in the wage-earning category. Because it does that, and seeks to cut wages as a remedy and as a recipe for the existing crisis, which, in fact, will not be found to be either a remedy or a recipe, I am completely opposed to this Bill.  The mentality behind it is the old capitalist philosopy; cut wages and everything will be all right.  I could understand the Minister desiring to effect certain kinds of economies in the form of eliminating waste, but this is not a Bill to eliminate waste.  It is not a Bill to cut out unnecessary or redundant services.  This is not a Bill to get rid of trimmings which are unnecessary in this country.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill steeped in the philosophy of cutting wages and that then everything would be all right.  What is the economic problem the Minister is attempting to deal with?  What is <Col N="1900" /> the economic crisis to which the Minister refers?  If there is any crisis in this country it is the problem of poverty&mdash;chronic poverty with a large section of the people.  That is the real and indeed the only problem.  The economic crisis which confronts the country is due to the fact that our own people are unable to purchase what we produce here.  The economic problem in this country and in the world to-day is due to the inability of consumers to purchase the products of industry. The gap to-day between production and consumption is widening and widening.  That is the problem confronting this country.  The Minister imagines that by cutting wages and salaries and by reducing purchasing power he is going to provide a remedy in a country where the purchasing power is already too low.  Cutting purchasing power is not a remedy for an economic problem brought about by inability to purchase the goods and services that are produced here.</P>
    <P>If cutting wages could ever have made the world prosperous, the world of the last ten years should have been a very prosperous world indeed. Wage slashing has been recommended here and elsewhere as a remedy for almost all industrial and economic ills.  Has the wage slashing that took place in this country for the last ten years produced the remedy that some people claimed in 1922 that policy would produce?  Has the wage slashing that we have seen indulged in in other countries in the world produced the remedies that those who sponsored such a policy prophesied it would produce?  Everybody knows that the attack on the purchasing power of the community, in the form of cutting wages and salaries, practised for the last ten years, has not made the world better or more prosperous; it has made the world poorer and it has brought about the economic crises through which these countries are passing to-day.</P>
    <P>If there is anything to be learned or any significance to be attached to the speech of the Minister for Finance, it is an indication that the Minister, at all events&mdash;and perhaps in this matter he is speaking for the <Col N="1901" /> Government&mdash;has got cold feet on his own economic and industrial policy. The speech of the Minister clearly indicates that he has no faith whatever in his own industrial and economic policy because if the Minister had any faith in the policy of his Government to bring about that economic and social regeneration, which is spoken of so glibly at election times, he has no case whatever for cutting purchasing power and attacking wage standards such as are being attacked in this Bill.  This is just an attempt to apply a cut plaster to a disease which is not an external disease but which is a disease affecting the whole organism of society in this country. Merely to apply an external lotion, in the form of a wage cut, is not going to cure all the diseases from which the organism of society is suffering to-day.  The Minister imagines, in the old capitalist way, that all you have got to do is to cut salaries and wages and that then everything will be all right.</P>
    <P>Instead of the Government facing up to their responsibility, by implementing the Christian social policy we hear spoken of so often outside the House but which is never implemented in this House, we find the Government patching up to-day a system of society in this country which is neither Christian nor Irish nor moral.  Instead of dealing with the matter by way of implementing the Christian social policy, about which the Minister speaks so eloquently at times, we find no attempt made to implement that social policy.  Instead, we find the Minister following figuratively and literally in the philosophy of &ldquo;cut purchasing power, cut wages and salaries and everything will be all right.&rdquo;  Instead of bolstering up the foreign and unnatural social system, for which the Minister is standing in this matter, the Minister might well tell the House that he does not propose to deal with the economic crisis by wage cuts, but that rather he intends to build up a Christian social system without which we must have always wage cuts, always unemployment and all these social evils and sores which follow in <Col N="1902" /> the wake of an unnatural foreign social system.</P>
    <P>Other Government, says the Minister, have found it necessary in other countries to cut wages and salaries. Is that any reason why we should do the same?  Surely the Minister for Finance is not going to say that we will make up our own minds as to what is good for our country, so far as our governmental institutions are concerned, but, that in the matter of wage cutting we will follow the example of Chinamen or Japs.  Governmental institutions, hall-marked 22 carat Irish, are the only kind of governmental institutions that satisfy the brand of patriotism that the Minister vaunts. We must have genuine 22 carat Irish political institutions, but when it comes to wages and salary cutting, let us look around the world for any example.  No matter what country it comes from it will be good enough so long as it means a wage cut.  That is the extraordinary omelette I find in the Minister's speech to-day.  He wants to take his political institutions from Ireland and his examples for wage attacks from any part of the world.  Surely the Minister will hardly contend that the economic conditions and the unemployment that exist in other countries are such as to justify him in following the examples of these countries in their economic or social policies?  Wage cuts in these other countries have not brought the prosperity that those who stood sponsor for the cuts, maintained they would.  Wage cuts there have brought what wage cuts here will bring, namely, a reduction in the purchasing power of the people and the enforcement, on those affected by the cuts, of a standard of living which in many cases cannot be reconciled with the vaunted Christian social policy for which the Minister claims to stand.  In my opinion, there is neither vision nor remedy, as there is certainly no statesmanship, in this Bill so far as an economic and social policy is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to have wage cutting.  He wants to reduce wages. He might make some slight show if he were only cutting the remuneration <Col N="1903" /> of those in receipt of salaries approximating to £600, £700, £800, £900 or £1,000, but let the Minister and every member of his Party remember that every vote given for this Bill is a vote for cutting the remuneration of people with approximately £2 10s. a week.  It is a definite incitement to private employers to do the same thing.  Now that Deputy Good has returned I am sure he will have no hesitation in saying that the speech and action of the Minister for Finance will be a very potent argument in the hands of employers when they come to endeavour to enforce wages reductions on their employees.  This mentality displayed by the Minister will be welcomed, as one would expect, in the Chamber of Commerce, another institution which, with a few exceptions, believes in wage cutting, more wage cutting and still more wage cutting.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making it perfectly clear in this Bill that, for his part, he is not concerned with what standards of living he breaks or what standards of life he invades.  The Minister is only concerned with one thing in this Bill, and that is to cut the remuneration of wage earning groups.  I challenge the Minister to go out into his own constituency or into the City of Dublin and defend there cutting the remuneration of people with £2 10s. per week.  If the Minister tries to do that, I think it will not be long until he is sadly disillusioned because every working man and every trade unionist in this city and throughout the country knows the significance of this Bill.  It is an attack on wage standards; it is telling private employers that wages of £2 10s. per week can be reduced. That philosophy is good enough for certain sections of society in this country, but one would expect that, after the radical and almost revolutionary declamations of the Minister in other days, he would not be the one to come into this House to claim the doubtful honour of setting a headline to private employers by cutting the wages of Civic Guards and teachers &mdash;setting a headline for private employers to invade and attack the <Col N="1904" /> wage standards of their own workers. It is because it is an attack upon wage standards, because I believe it will not cure the existing depression but aggravate it, that I am opposed to this Bill and to the whole philosophy of the Bill.  Not merely is it an unwise departure for the Government, but, judging by the Minister's speech, it seems to me to be the first step along an economic and social road which will bring this Government to the same end to which the last Government came&mdash; a road which means low wages and a low social standard, the bringing down the level of our people until this country is just another Balkan State in Western Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. V. Rice Mr. V. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to complain, as other Deputies have done, regarding the manner in which this Bill has been introduced.  It is a Bill which introduces a very big principle and a very big change in the social and economic life of a very important section of our people.  It was circulated yesterday morning.  Other Parties not having been told until late last night, time is taken to-day for the purpose of passing this revolutionary measure with a single day's discussion.  Deputies have not been given a reasonable or proper opportunity to examine the provisions of this Bill.  While I reserve the right and intend to criticise this Bill, section by section at a later stage, I wish to make some observations on it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is described as a Temporary Economies Bill.  I adopt the expression used by the Leader of the Labour Party in another connection in his speech just now as a proper description of that title, and I say it is only &ldquo;eye-wash.&rdquo;  The Minister knows perfectly well that this is not a temporary reduction of the remuneration of public servants.  He knows that, having regard to the economic policy his Government are pursuing, it is a permanent reduction in the remuneration of the public service.  I take the view that the reduction of the pay of the Civil Service is a step to the detriment of the country.  We have in this country a public service surpassed by none.  This measure is calculated to introduce discontent and to interfere with the efficiency of the service rendered <Col N="1905" /> to the State.  One section of the public service is the police.  The police of this country have always had a high reputation for the cleanness of their work.  The policemen of this country do not, as happens in other countries, put out their hands for tips. There have been very few instances in this country of police officers having been accused of receiving bribes from persons with whom they had to deal. The police here should be kept above all forms of temptation, and they ought to be given reasonable remuneration such as is given to a workman for his week's work.  Our police are a very important body in the carrying on of the work of this country, and it is in the interests of the country that there should be clean administration and decent work done.  I say it is a retrograde step for the Minister to propose to reduce the remuneration of the police below what is a decent living wage.</P>
    <P>I complain, as I have said, of the manner in which this Bill was introduced without giving Deputies any reasonable opportunity of studying its terms.  Perhaps I, with a certain amount of training in construing documents of this kind, have less right to complain than the ordinary Deputy who is without that training, but I do say that I, and Deputies like me, have a right to complain of the Bill being introduced in this way.  There are sections in this Bill the construction of which might occupy a court for days, and Deputies are asked to discuss the terms of the measure without any such consideration.  The manner in which the Minister introduced the Bill is on a par with the manner in which the President introduced this morning the first motion on the Paper.  As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, the first item on the Order Paper this morning was a proposal to effect a trade agreement with another country under which we were giving eight concessions in return for three concessions. If the President had had his way, we should not have been given an opportunity of discussing the relative advantages of these concessions. The Minister for Finance, in introducing this Bill, adopted a similar line. <Col N="1906" /> He took up what appears to me to be a novel attitude.  He suggested to the House the lines on which the Bill should be discussed, and that we should only discuss the principle that he introduced.  My view as to the rights of the House in discussing any Bill that comes before it is that it is entitled to discuss every aspect and every implication of the Bill, subject to the rules of order and the authority of the Chair.  I am very glad to say that Deputies have refused to be led by the nose by the Minister for Finance as to what they should discuss. The Minister referred to what he said on 11th May last.  The Minister said many things on 11th May last.  We shall have a more appropriate opportunity of discussing what he said on 11th May last on the day on which he introduces his Budget for the coming year.  I do not intend to be tempted now into comparing what the Minister said on 11th May last with what he said before he sat in his present position. But we do know that immediately before he took up that position he told us our taxation would be reduced by £2,000,000.  We know now our taxation has been increased by about three times that amount.  I am very glad to see that the Labour Party are at last wakening up to the implications of the alliance in which they have been engaged for the past 12 months.  The President laughs. I am pleased to see him laugh.  It is a pleasure and a novelty to see the President laugh.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to see the Labour Party wakening up to the implications of the alliance they formed with President de Valera's Party.  It is a good thing to see that the representatives of Labour have awakened to the fact that what is behind this Bill is not really a proposal to save £280,000 a year out of the pockets of the Civil Service.  We know, as a matter of fact, on a rough calculation; that the Government, by their present policy of what is called an economic war, are wasting just about <Col N="1907" /> that amount per week in carrying on a controversy and a dispute which they can settle any day they like on fair and reasonable terms.  They are wasting each week they carry on this economic war the amount they propose to save in a year by reducing the remuneration of the public service.  If this Bill had been introduced by the late Government, everything could be said in its favour from the point of view that they were economising and husbanding the resources of this country but, if a person spends half his income in buying dope and drugs, it is foolish economy to save a halfpenny on the price of his tea.  That is what this Government are doing in introducing this Bill.</P>

I am glad also to see that he has adopted the scheme that was accepted by President Cosgrave, as he then was, and the then Minister for Finance for the financing of that scheme&mdash;for raising a loan and spreading the building of houses in Dublin over a ten years' period. Deputy Cooney's interruption reminds me&mdash;and it might have been irrelevant otherwise&mdash;that even this Government is capable of learning something.</P>

      <P>It might be better to get a scheme of that kind from a Government which had the confidence of the people in the matter of the raising of <Col N="1908" /> the money rather than from the present Government.  As I have said, I am glad to see that Deputy Norton and his Party have at last awakened to the implications of the alliance they have formed with Fianna Fáil, because Deputy Norton is right.  The purpose of this Bill is not the purpose shown on the face of it at all.  Its purpose is to carry out the policy announced by the President to reduce the standard of living in this country all round.  We are living too well, he says, and we are all going to wear hair shirts.  If the Minister for Finance could only remember the speeches he made immediately before he took office, he would not come into this House in a hair shirt but in sackcloth and ashes, having regard to what he has done since he took office.</P>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Norton has awakened to these implications, and I may say, with regard to what he has said here, that this is the foundation of a policy to cut the remuneration of working people all round.  That is true.  I said to a large employer of labour, as soon as the terms of this Bill were indicated: &ldquo;I suppose the big employers will be in favour of this Bill, because it will give them a headline to cut wages?&rdquo; He did not answer me, and I said to him: &ldquo;What do you say to that?&rdquo; and his reply was: &ldquo;I am deaf on that side.&rdquo; Deputy Norton is right.  This is a headline deliberately laid down by the Government for the purpose of introducing a system of wage-cutting all round.</P>

I have not met them and, when Deputies come to consider how they <Col N="1909" /> will vote on this Bill, I ask them not to be misled by the talk of Deputy Norton about the wage-cutting policy of the late Government.  Where was the wage-cutting policy of the late Government?  How does their policy as regards wages compare with the policy of the present Government?

      <P>I said that I lost my seat in that election, and the one main element in causing me to lose my seat was the illusory promise made by the now President of this State to the Civil Service, because in the constituency I then represented and now represent again a very big element of the voters belong to the second and third grade of the Civil Service.  They were deluded by the promises made to them and which have been broken by the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite want to hear what the President said at that time when he was Leader of the Opposition.  Ten days before the election he told the civil servants of the city, and the rest of the country, before they went to the polls to register their votes: &ldquo;It is not our idea to start to cut the lower salaries.  With regard to the salaries of £300 or £400 a year, I hold that those in receipt of them are getting nothing excessive.  These are not the salaries I had in mind for a cut.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the eve of the general election he went further.  In this article&mdash;the article, I may mention incidentally to the President, is headed &ldquo;Broken Promises&rdquo;&mdash;he promised immunity not only to the lower grades but to the middle grades.  &ldquo;We do not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;propose to seek economies by restricting the social services or cutting the salaries of the middle or lower grades of the Civil Service.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave it to the House to judge as between the Deputy and myself.  The President secured at least one seat by the promises he made in the general election of 1932.  The Minister for Finance made a point in his speech that was worthy of him.  He said that the President did not say £300 a year.  I read the quotation which referred to smaller salaries of £300 or £400.  Is not that a really pettifogging point of the Minister for Finance?  Now what are the conditions that produced the change of attitude of the President of the Executive Council? Why, having given that promise and secured a very considerable number of votes in the City and County of Dublin, the change?  What is the reason for the change of his attitude? Why should he propose now to cut down a miserable wage of £2 10s. a week which a man receives as his remuneration?  I suggest the explanation is that the promises were made for the purpose of securing votes in that general election.  It was on a par with a promise made by the Minister for Finance and published in posters by the Fianna Fáil Party before the election that the taxation in this country would be reduced by the Fianna Fáil Party by £2,000,000 a year if they were returned to office.  I do not propose to go in detail into the different sections of the Bill, because there will be an opportunity of examining them later.  But there is one section that I wish to say a word of comment about now.  I refer to Section 8.  That section provides:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every doubt, question, and dispute which shall arise as to whether a <Col N="1913" /> person is or is not a person to whom this Part of this Act applies, or as to the amount of the salary for the purposes of this Part of this Act of any person or the amount of the deduction to be made under this Part of this Act from any such salary shall be determined by the Minister whose determination thereof shall be final.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of that?  Here you have the whole Civil Service of this country robbed under the terms of this Bill of their rights if their remuneration is curtailed.  This section reintroduces the old futile system that the King is supreme and that there can be no appeal.  King MacEntee ought to recognise that in this country there are courts of justice who have the right, in law, to determine the rights of individuals, to decide impartially and fairly as between individual and individual and between the Government and individuals, as to whether a grievance exists or not.  No individual who is aggrieved by the position under this Bill, if it becomes law, will rashly or inadvisedly rush to the courts to have his rights determined.  But what is the object of this section?  Its object is to oust the jurisdiction of the courts as between the Minister and the subject.  It introduces a most reactionary principle, and one that this House should not stand for, because we have courts of justice to decide these matters.  No Minister should be in a position to say: &ldquo;I am the great I am, and that is an end of it.&rdquo;  It is a wholly undemocratic thing to introduce.  The rights of the courts to determine as between the State and the individual were built up after a long struggle by democratic forces. These rights were settled, and were recognised in the Constitution of this country, and they were recognised by the Government that operated here up to 1932.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>They were recognised. The Minister is going off on a false trail and trying to draw a weak red herring across the track of my <Col N="1914" /> argument.  I am pointing out that the humble subject is entitled to protection and that the right of the subject was recognised by the late Government. Here is a measure introduced to prevent determination by the courts of the people of this country as to whether an individual has a grievance or not.  The Minister can sit down in his office and determine the rights of any individual and there is to be no appeal to the courts as against his decision.  I say that is the introduction of an undemocratic and retrograde principle.  I ask Deputies, when they come to consider this measure, whatever they may do with the measure in general, if they have any regard for the preservation of democratic rights, to vote against that section.</P>
      <P>I would like to say a word or two on the subject of Deputy Dillon's amendment. The subject-matter of the amendment was discussed in this House some years ago and I think the view the House took at the time was that, while a case could be made for the reduction of the allowances to Deputies like myself who represent metropolitan constituencies, no case could be made for such reduction as regards Deputies who represent rural constituencies. That distinction, if it is worth making, is sound.  We are supposed to be working under a democratic system and all classes of the community in this State are entitled to be represented in this House.  If the people want to be represented by Labour Deputies, they are entitled to have that right and we cannot expect the working men to finance Deputies who represent them here, to pay the expenses of these Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is wholly false to suggest that the allowance made to Deputies is a salary.  It is really an allowance to cover expenses and on that principle it is wholly justifiable.  There are many other classes besides those who return Labour Deputies who are not in a position to finance their representatives in this House.  I will refer to what happened in another House in another country on this very subject as a headline to Deputies like Deputy Dillon, who has made this proposal.  There is a simple method for every Deputy who feels that he can do without this allowance. <Col N="1915" /> He can return the money to the Treasury or he can apply it to charitable work.</P>
    <P>In another House on a certain occasion not very long ago a taunt was thrown from the Government Benches at a Deputy in the form of saying to him: &ldquo;Well, you take your allowance, anyway.&rdquo;  It did not transpire on that occasion that the Deputy in question did not, in fact, take one penny of his allowance.  It transpired at a later meeting when the Minister who threw the taunt apologised and said he had learned that the Deputy had applied every penny of his Parliamentary allowance to charitable purposes.  I suggest to Deputy Dillon and Deputy MacDermot that every member of their Party who favours the policy of cutting down or even abolishing the allowance to Deputies has that simple course open to him.  He can hand his allowance to the St. Vincent de Paul Society or to other charitable societies in Dublin and that money will be certainly as well applied as if it is left in the Treasury.</P>

      <P>I suggest that is a simple course and it is one that I will commend to the mover of the amendment. The foundation of this system of an allowance for Deputies is in order to procure representation in the Dáil for all classes of the people.  That is the reason and the justification for the allowance to Deputies.  I propose at a later stage, when I have had a chance of considering its implications, to ask the Minister what he means to carry out by Section 5, a section that <i>prima facie</i> may be the section which is designed entirely in relief of civil servants.  I do not propose to deal with that to-day, but at a later stage I hope to have an opportunity of asking the Minister to elucidate what is intended by the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government were announcing their economic policy to the country they represented that they could make tremendous savings without hardship to anybody. I suppose this Bill represents their attempt at the fulfilment of that assurance. Looked at from that point of view, it is not possible to congratulate them upon it.  They seem to have overlooked a fact that they are rather fond of repeating, that they cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs.  There is no doubt this particular omelette involves the breaking of a good many eggs.  In the present serious condition of the country's trade and finances, we of this Party feel it is our duty to give support to the Government's economy proposals. No matter how much their own policy has been responsible for the necessity of them, we feel it is our duty to give support to the Government's economy proposals, leaving on them the onus of the equities as between different classes of public service, but supporting the general principle, provided that we are put in a moral position to do so.  That is the point of Deputy Dillon's amendment.  All the criticism I have heard of it to-day is absolutely beside the point.  If we were recommending the reduction of Deputies' allowances for the mere sake of reduction there would be some meaning in the attacks made on Deputy Dillon's amendment, but we are not.  What we feel is that it is absolutely indecent for the Oireachtas to be imposing cuts on other people and refusing to submit to any cuts themselves.  When we hear about the sacrosanctness of this particular figure, £360, we must realise that if it is unjust to call for any reduction of that figure then it was unjust not to consent to a considerably higher salary in 1922, because you have reduced the salaries of civil servants since and the cost of living has gone down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy has entered an objection to the type of controversy that he says we are addicted to on these benches, which consists in saying that there are too many officials in the country, and blaming the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, in <Col N="1917" /> part at any rate, for the extent of public expenditure and the multitude of officials that exists.  I am unrepentant on that point.  I consider the public expenditure in this country is definitely too high.  Deputy Norton speaks as if there was absolutely no limit to which a nation could go in the matter of public expenditure.  One would gather from his speeches that he thinks the country can spend and spend and spend, and that nothing but good can come of it.  When the Deputy says that the economic troubles the world over are due to the insensate policy of Governments in cutting down salaries and effecting economies, he is merely flying in the face of facts. Everybody knows that is not true.</P>
    <P>You might take, perhaps, as a supreme example the United States of America, where you had unreasonable expansion, optimism and the rising of salaries of every sort.  And ever since the great crash in 1929, the Congress has been ineffectually struggling to deal with the situation.  One of the main reasons why they have been so completely ineffectual in dealing with it is that they refused to get down to economy.  They committed the same mistake, I am sorry to say, that is shown in the Government attitude here to-day.  Such proposals for economies as were introduced into Congress were never allowed to contain any sacrifice for the members of Congress themselves.  It is only when the country is going to crash over the precipice, when President Roosevelt comes in and gets semi-dictatorial powers to enable them to make economies to save the country from financial ruin, that economies in the remuneration of the members of the Congress at Washington are introduced.</P>
    <P>I say, in reference to the general question of public expenditure, that I consider public expenditure in this country is too high.  I admit I was not living in this country at the time and my evidence is not first hand, but I have the impression that the Sinn Féin movement as a whole was not alive to the true financial situation in this country.  I do not believe that very many of them realised that under the <Col N="1918" /> old regime a great deal more was being expended in Ireland than was being drawn from it in the way of revenue.  Ever since the Old Age Pensions Act was introduced in the British Parliament that has been the position.  I do not believe that the Sinn Féin Movement realised that under the 1912 Home Rule Bill we were going to get substantial subsidies from the British Parliament in order to enable us to carry on the services which were then established and which otherwise we would not have been able to carry on without an enormous increase in taxation the moment Home Rule came into operation.  I think they had an idea that by simply cutting adrift from Great Britain this country was going to come into a fortune, and I think they were under the impression after the Treaty, that in the negotiations that went on they had done extremely well for this country and that they had made &ldquo;a damn good bargain.&rdquo;  That is, as may be but this much is certain that if our cutting adrift in the way we did and in the circumstances we did from Great Britain, led to a great improvement in the financial position of this country, that improvement was not passed on at all to the unfortunate taxpayers and ratepayers.  We find to-day that even taking into account the change in the value of money, and the expansion of the social services that the figure of public expenditure for the Free State alone is grossly out of proportion to what used to be to the expenditure for the whole of Ireland under the British regime.</P>
    <P>That being so and the times being as bad as they are the world over, and especially bad in Ireland in consequence of this so-called economic war, this wasting disease which the Government has inflicted on the country, I feel we have no choice but to give general support to the economy proposals, much as we dislike them provided they put us in the moral position to do it.  Are we in that moral position?  I say we are not.  Take first the most flagrant case, because the case of the Seanad is the most flagrant.  I want to know is there any Deputy in this House who could justify the salaries paid to <Col N="1919" /> Senators?  Senators have no constituents to meet.  They have not the same kind of work to do between the sittings as the members of this House have.  They meet 35 times or perhaps 36 times in the year.  Suppose we take it that they meet 36 times, the position remains that they get, as Deputy Dillon has pointed out, £10 for each sitting.</P>
    <P>Is that a thing that can be defended?  I say it is not.  I think it is specially difficult to defend in view of the desire of the Government that the Seanad should be somewhat different in character from this House. I suggest that the Seanad should not be regarded in any way as a whole-time job and that the people who go to the Seanad, poor as well as rich&mdash; if there are any rich still left in this country&mdash;should be paid on the basis of their attendance, and that it should be something like £2 a day, plus first-class travelling fare, instead of £10 for each session as at present.  I have yet to hear of any sort of reasonable defence put up for the salaries paid to the Senators.  The result of the present salary or allowance is to make it a laughing stock and to turn it into what it has become, that is, as a place for providing for persons for one reason or another that people wish to provide for, rather than in sending people there who would make the best possible Senators.</P>
    <P>As regards this House itself it is quite clear that the member who does his work honestly as a Deputy will earn the £360 to the full.  I admit that quite readily.  But this proposal of a reduction last year as well as this year&mdash;for I was the one to make it last year&mdash;was not made as something desirable for its own sake, but only in relation to the proposals for economies to be imposed on others.  I make my proposal in that situation&mdash;a situation where it is proposed that economies shall be imposed on others, shall be imposed upon men who have no other means of livelihood.  The civil servant has no other means of living. He is not like the Deputy who has got a chance to earn something outside his work here, as a great many of <Col N="1920" /> them do.  I say it is a perfectly impossible situation&mdash;it is impossible for a Deputy here to be put in the situation of being called on to support cuts that will cause so much resentment and hardship unless he is prepared to lead the way himself.  Deputy Norton has talked of the bad taste of Deputy Dillon in proposing a sacrifice in the case of an individual civil servant. He said it was bad taste for Deputy Dillon to suggest it.  I call it much worse taste and very bad taste to enforce cuts on unfortunate State servants and not impose cuts on themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the bad taste of the action of the Labour Party here?  The Labour Party do not feel there is any sort of bad taste when they get up and make all sorts of proposals that would destroy other people's income by causing a high income tax to be imposed, or when they destroy people's income by voting for the economic war and when they propose that unfortunate railway shareholders should have their interests disregarded.  That is not bad taste at all.  It is only when one gets up and makes a proposition that should appeal to the most moderate sense of decency and good taste that Deputy Norton gets up and talks about the old Irish Party and say they were not ashamed to take £400 a year.  That is an entirely different matter, because that £400 did not come directly out of the pockets of the Irish taxpayers.  It came out of the pockets of the British taxpayers, who supplied the largest portion of it. Besides that, for years and years the old Irish Party did their duty at Westminster without any payments whatever from the public purse.  There are a few unfortunate remnants of the old Irish Party alive to-day and in a state of almost destitution after all the years in the service of the country. All that service is now forgotten.  We are ready to ladle out money for the new heroes at any time on any pretext.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies of this House have very little cause to sneer at the old Irish <Col N="1921" /> Party, least of all on financial grounds, no matter on whatever other grounds they may sneer at them.  At any rate that question of £400 a year was beside the point.  It is not because we think £360 a year too high for a Deputy that we introduced this amendment at all.  It is because we really feel it is asking us to do something that we should not in decency be asked to do when the Government calls on us to support their economy proposals, unless something was first done on our part to show that we ourselves are ready to make sacrifices as well.  I think that the amendment moved by Deputy Dillon is, perhaps, as reasonable a one as could be moved; that we should be linked up with the civil servants to about the same scale of salary.  Taking into account the time when this salary was fixed the deduction to be made from it should correspond to the deduction made from the salaries of civil servants. I appeal to the Minister to give us some satisfaction on this point, to declare that the Government will definitely introduce proposals for the substantial reduction of the Seanad salaries and that they will, at least, institute an inquiry, if nothing more, although I would like them to go a bit further and say definitely that they would make some reduction in the salaries of the Dáil in order to make our moral position stronger.  We must not forget, although I do not wish to raise unnecessarily contentious points, that a number of Deputies during the last election were going around the country hounding the people on into the economic war, calling on them to put Ireland before their purse, to strike a blow for the good old country, to destroy the brutal British and discomfort John Bull.  How they can have had the face to do it, or how they can have the face to do it again, while they take up the attitude that they will not sacrifice one penny themselves, is something beyond my conception.</P>

With reference to the amendment proposed by a Deputy belonging to the Centre Party, I humbly submit to him that he is illogical. Either Deputies should be paid or they should not be paid.  If he proposes that they should not be paid, I am with him.  I have always held that men or women who wish earnestly to serve their country ought to do it without fee or reward.  I am probably the oldest member who can speak with any authority on the Sinn Féin movement that has been alluded to more than once to-day.  Probably I would not have spoken only when it was mentioned it came into my head that an opportunity might arise for me to say something concerning it.  I will tell you about the Sinn Féin movement.  If you lived nearly 30 years ago you might have rambled into a house in Fownes Street, and if your curiosity led you to go upstairs you would have found a man in a back room sitting at a broken desk on a three-legged chair engaged in writing.  That man at the end of his week, having spent nearly all the six days and some of the nights there, would draw about 30/-.  He had the greatest and the most subtle pen wielded in the cause of Ireland since the days of Swift.  That was the beginning of the Sinn Féin movement.

      <P>You can very conveniently speak about a reduction of other people's salaries or allowances <Col N="1924" /> because you are on fairly safe ground. As I was saying before being interrupted, in connection with this matter of money and the Sinn Fein movement in its earlier days, the efforts of the late Arthur Griffith and those associated with him to keep up the Sinn Fein paper were almost superhuman. We went from door to door almost begging for money to keep it going. When the Sinn Fein daily paper was started the same thing happened.  It only lasted six months, but during that six months the salaries paid were almost laughable they were so small. Towards the end&mdash;this has never been told before&mdash;two Irishmen undertook a mission to America to collect money for its continuance&mdash;the late Mr. Bulfin and the late O'Rahilly.  Both of them spent three months in America and came back without even the price of a box of matches.  Mr. Bulfin died a short time afterwards, and we know that the O'Rahilly was found with bullets in his heart during the fight in Easter Week.  These things do not suggest in any shape or form that the Sinn Fein movement was founded by money grubbers.  When other men and other methods prevailed, and the Sinn Fein movement, so to speak, almost passed away, and when, as a result of the work of these men and their methods the Easter Week insurrection was possible, and the events which followed it, you know very well the intense enthusiasm which was created amongst the Irish people, and you know that millions of money flowed into the Exchequer of the then young Irish Republic that these men brought about.  When the first Dáil was elected I was one of a committee appointed to arrange the salaries for the President and Ministers of the Irish Republic, so that I know thoroughly well what I am speaking of.  The salary arranged for the Ministers was £300 a year, and that for the President was £600 a year.  He declined to take £600; he said £500 would be sufficient. That will give those gentlemen of the Centre Party, who were speaking to-day in connection with the Sinn Fein movements and things national in a spirit I do not like, to understand the self-sacrificing spirit of the men who <Col N="1925" /> founded those movements, who carried them on, and who, I think, brought them to success.  I have nothing further to say on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought, in my knowledge of debate, that the amendment only would be before the House, but I understand that both the Bill and the amendment can be discussed.  My connection with the Bill will be very brief.  It was my job, on the opening of the first Dáil in 1919, to read the democratic programme of Dáil Eireann.  That programme set out what was proposed to be done for the workers and for the poor people of this country.  I read it with pleasure. I believed it was going to be carried out.  I give general credit to many of those associated with that movement that they had an honest intention of carrying those things out, but I fearlessly say here now that, until President de Valera and his men got together this year, no effort was made to carry out the democratic programme of Dáil Eireann.  That was the reason I came in here to give them my little support in their effort to do so.  When I heard just the last word of Deputy Norton's statement, to the effect that the men here on these benches were going to meet the fate of the men over there, because of their wage-cutting and because of their depressing the conditions of the poor and the workers of this country, I came to the conclusion that I am afraid Deputy Norton is not strictly speaking the truth.  I do not think he was justified in saying such things, and I should remind him, and the members of the Labour Party generally, that there are other men here on these benches as closely associated with the Labour movement and as much in sympathy with it as they are.  I should like them to understand that perfectly.  If there was anything in the shape of interference with an honest living, with good wages, with good housing accommodation, or with good general support for the working classes of this country, we would have nothing to do with it.  I honestly believe that President de Valera and his men are now engaged in carrying out the programme laid down 13 or 14 years ago. <Col N="1926" /> I believe they are honestly engaged in carrying it out.  For that reason I support them, and will continue to support them as long as I am here. Whether that will be long or short I cannot say.</P>
    <P>As regards my own position, I intend to keep an exact account of the £330 a year or whatever it is that we get for our services here.  I intend to keep an exact account of it, just to see how it will pan out at the end of the year. At the present moment I have to shut up my shop for three days a week.  I calculate that at a loss of about £80 or £90 a year, to begin with.  I do not know what other losses I may sustain, but to think that we are here for the purpose of the £360 or £330 a year is wrong.  There are men behind me on these benches&mdash;more vigorous and ardent, and probably more national than I am&mdash;who may be losing a good deal more than I am. I did not want to interfere in this matter at all, but having regard to the insinuations which I believe were made concerning men on these benches, I had to make a protest against them, and make it with all the vigour I possess at present.</P>

      <P>A Leas Chinn Comhairle, I think the insinuations made by the mover of the amendment reflect not only on the members of the other side of the House but also on those at this side of the House.  I believe this amendment is altogether insincere. There are some people in this House to whom this payment&mdash;whether you call it an allowance or a salary&mdash;is of very small account.

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would give way for a moment, to allow me to state that in all I said there was no insinuation.  There was no desire to have any covert implication read into my words in any conceivable way.  I said plainly and straightly everything I had in my mind, and I do not desire to reflect on any individual in this House in any way&mdash;good, bad or indifferent.  I want the Deputy to know that there is no insinuation, and I should be glad if he would draw his deductions from what I said, and permit <Col N="1927" /> me to contradict them.  There was no hidden meaning in my statement.</P>

      <P>It may be without shadow of foundation, but I am entitled to my opinion and I am entitled to express it.  I accept the Deputy's assertion.  As I said, there are many persons in this House to whom that payment is of very small account. There are others to whom it means very much, and there are some here who, by accepting it and by coming here, lose by interference with their business or private profession a sum perhaps more than twice the amount involved.  In introducing this amendment the proposer said that we were to be equated in a sense with the Civil Service.  I think that is altogether wrong.  Civil servants are an educated body of persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>They are men who have had specialised training for the position they have.  There is no educational or physical standard of fitness required for a Deputy.  It is possible for a man to be a member of this House who may be semi-illiterate, and who would not be worth 5/- a week in any commercial occupation in the world.  That is the fact.  Even to join the Civic Guard it is necessary to have a high standard of physical and intellectual fitness.  I think in fixing this allowance some regard was paid to the low standard of personality that might possible enter this House.  I am sure that there are many persons here in this House who are not worth £360 a year to the State.  It is not proper to <Col N="1928" /> look on this amount as a salary.  It is stated to be an allowance.  If the proposer of this amendment had put it in a form which would take it out of this ambiguous category&mdash;whether it is an allowance or a salary&mdash;I would be very pleased to support it.  In other words, if a man were to be compensated for the time lost in his business, for the actual time he spends in this House, and for his travelling expenses to and from this House, it should be in another form.  But there is no doubt that at present it is by some regarded as a salary, and by some even as their sole means of living.  In that connection it has helped to rear up in this State a very low peculiar form of professional politician.  I would have been very glad to support the amendment if put in another form because I believe that this £360 a year is a lure to membership of this House.  If it had been eliminated I believe we would have had a better class of man coming forward to serve the country here. That, of course, is a matter of opinion.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general principles of the Bill before us the Minister was very apologetic for its introduction.  In fact, he nearly wept over the necessity that has arisen for paring down the salaries of some of the highly placed civil servants.  When the Minister and his Party came into power last year they promised the country an immediate reduction of £2,000,000 in taxation without making any inroads whatever on the public services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a public fact.  I have a Fianna Fáil poster here that was issued to the public and I will read it for the Minister if he likes.  At any rate, we are all familiar with that poster.  The country was told that £2,000,000 a year were going to be saved in taxation, and that without any sacrifice whatever in the public services or in the cost of administration.  Immediately the present Government came into office, not only was there no attempt whatever made to show the country how this economy in administration was going to come about but <Col N="1929" /> we were immediately in the new Budget taxed to a further extent, over and above what we had been already paying, to the tune of £4,000,000 a year. It is quite possible that this year there will be a further increase in taxation. All this time, it is freely admitted that taxation has reached a breaking point in this country.  It has now gone to a point where it is beyond the capacity of the people to pay.  We see this all through the country where it is impossible to collect the local rates.  We see it in the general depression of trade. In the financial year that ended in March, 1932, the trade of this country was £86,000,000.  In the year ending March, 1933, it was £64,000,000, a drop of £22,000,000 in the turnover of the trade of the country.  More than £8,000,000 of that was accounted for by the foolish economic war which was not brought about by England because, as the President admitted, we fired the first shot.  It is at this time, when the Minister sees that the capacity of the people to bear less and less taxation is becoming very evident, he grasps at this straw to save this one-quarter of a million of money, a comparatively miserable sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking in relation to the extravagance of the Minister and of his policy of trying to save £250,000 by taking it out of the pockets of the true and tried servants of this State, while launching into extravagances in other directions where more than that sum could be saved.  Mention was made to-day that, while the Minister was trying to save this money by taking it out of the pockets of civil servants, there had been a remarkable increase in the personnel of some departments.  In the Vote for the Revenue Commissioners, there is an increase in salaries alone of £20,000.  I can only attribute that increase to the pitch-forking of men into the Customs &mdash;men who, I am informed, did not pass in through the ordinary avenue of a Civil Service examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing in the Schedule to the Bill that I strongly object to, and that is the proposed interference <Col N="1930" /> with the salaries of the Civic Guards. The ordinary Civic Guard has not a salary or wage anything like that which an ordinary semi-skilled man is paid.  Yet to become a Civic Guard he has to pass a very stiff examination. He has to be a man of more than ordinary education, and in the moral sphere must be above suspicion. His salary is going to be cut and, comparatively speaking, cut in a very drastic way.  I protest against the reductions in Civic Guard pay.  The Civic Guard is not confined to a 44 hour week about which we had all the trouble last night or to a 48 hour week.  He is supposed to be on duty night and day as he may be required. His duties and responsibilities are increasing every day.  Practically every Bill that is passed through this House means an addition to his work.  The Traffic Bill that we discussed last week throws additional responsibilities on him for the safety of the public. I have not studied the Bill very carefully in so far as it affects the Army, and therefore, I do not propose to say anything on that aspect of it. As to the national teachers, they are coming out best of all so far as the proposed cuts are concerned.  The reason alleged for that, is that they are great friends of Fianna Fáil.  I do not know whether that is so or not.  In certain parts of the country which I know well they are not, but in other parts I am told that they did wonderful election work for Fianna Fáil.  I have been told too, that in many schools one of the first things that lisping children are taught is &ldquo;Up Dev.&rdquo;  That may be the reason why, comparatively speaking the national teachers are not being so severely cut as other civil servants. I think they would have done just as well if they had agreed to the reduction which was come to between themselves and Cumann na nGaedheal Government had it been put into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>This whole thing is a weak grasping at a straw on the part of the Minister to save himself from <Col N="1931" /> the financial chaos in which his policy has plunged him.  The meanest and most contemptible thing of all in connection with the Bill is to be found in Part VI of the Schedule.  I refer to the proposed reduction of the capitation grant to Industrial Schools.  This whole Bill is mean and miserable, but I think this proposal is the meanest thing of all; this attempt of the Minister to try and save himself from the consequences of his own financial folly by cutting down the grants for the most unfortunate and weakest section in the community, the children and the orphans in the industrial schools of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be very brief, and with great respect to Deputy Dillon I do not propose really to discuss his amendment at all, because I think it raises questions that are quite unimportant compared with the general principles raised by the Bill.  Taking the Bill itself, if the principle were simply that stated by the Minister, namely, the desirability for economy, I should not be rising to protest against the Bill, but I think, even from that angle the question in the Bill is much more than that.  It is a question whether the economy that is necessary should be carried out in the kind of way suggested in the Bill.  From that angle I find myself very much nearer to the point of view of Deputy Norton, namely, that the economy to be effected in the way suggested is much more like additional taxation of a certain section of the people than a real economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I do not rise, really to discuss the matter from that point of view.  I may leave that to others. Neither do I rise to discuss it from the point of view, very important as that point of view is, of why such economies are necessary at all.  That is a big question, and many others have pointed out that it is due, as I believe it is due, to very official economic policy. What I do want to discuss is the Bill from the point of view of what change it envisages in our Parliamentary methods.  I envisage it from that angle in a most serious way.  It seems to me to be, on the part of the Minister, <Col N="1932" /> a cynical recognition and admission of the fact that our Government&mdash;democratic Government by Parliament&mdash;is becoming from day to day more and more a simple stamping of the acts of the Cabinet by the Dáil, acting merely as a registering authority.  If it were not for that, I do not think we should be discussing a Bill of such vital importance as this Bill at a late session on a Friday afternoon.</P>

      <P>The attitude seems to be that they must get the final vote of the Dáil on any particular matter, but that no matter what is said by the Dáil they must get that vote in the way they propose.  That is the only reason we are doing it, evidently, and we are only wasting time in discussing the matter before a comparatively small House.  But there is much more than that in it.  When I look through this Bill I see much more in it.  We see it in the section to which Deputy Rice has drawn attention to-day.  The Minister's say is to be final.  The Minister is to decide.  Further on through the Bill you will see such principles as these&mdash;that whatever is decided by statute or otherwise the Minister can revoke, annul or repeal and that he can act as he thinks proper &mdash;he alone!  The Minister can consult with whomever he thinks right, be they outside bodies or other Ministers.  It is the Minister that is to be the final dictator in all these matters.  He is to have the final say as to what local authorities he will consult with, and he alone.  I see, outstanding in this Bill, simply an incarnation of dictatorial government.  It shines in it from first to last.  We are dispensing with the functions of the Dáil beyond merely registering powers.  We are dispensing with democratic government. We are electing a junta in charge of the State which is to be final and practically dictatorial in its methods. I think that we have brought out in this Bill in a very clear, vital and important way, the goal to which our democratic government is rapidly tending.  For that reason, and for that reason alone, I shall oppose this <Col N="1933" /> Bill and protest against it as strongly as I possibly can.</P>

I consider, and I think it will be agreed, that I am not making any profit out of it.  Before 1927, when the Fianna Fáil Deputies came in here, they advocated a reduction of the £360.  According to them then it was altogether too much.  We were supposed to be living on the fat of the land.  Is there one of these Deputies now who is prepared to vote for a reduction of the £360?  Is there one of them who has made any money out of the £360 per annum for the last five years?  I put it to any member of the Government Benches that those of them who have done their duty here in this House&mdash;and I admit that most of them have done their duty&mdash;when they receive their constituents here in Dublin, that amount would not cover their expenses in any one year.

This is not the first time it was suggested that the allowances for Deputies and Senators should be reduced.  It was suggested by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party as far back as 1923.  I hope that what happened previously will not happen to Deputy Dillon, as at an election three months after the suggestion was made, that the allowances to Deputies should be reduced, the proposer when he went to his constituency was defeated and was never since heard of in public life.  If Deputy Dillon and Deputy MacDermot, who I think is more behind the amendment than Deputy Dillon, think they are going to fool the farmers into thinking that the economic circumstances will be affected in any way by a reduction in the allowances made to members of either House they are very foolish.  No farmer, labourer or shopkeeper in Donegal would believe for one moment that Deputy Dillon was sincere when he proposed to cut his own allowance. Of course Deputy MacDermot does not want to reduce the allowances, he wants them abolished.</P>

      <P>Shall I put it in another way?  Deputy MacDermot <Col N="1936" /> wants his own allowance abolished. Deputy MacDermot made a great show &mdash;I do not know if it was through himself or through some other channel &mdash;in the Press, that he was not going to accept the £30 per month.  I want to say deliberately that that is a good exhibition of snobbery.  Either this State can or cannot afford to pay allowances to those who are doing the work of the State.  It does not matter which side of the House Deputies are on.  I class as snobbery of the worst type the action of a Deputy who comes in here and says he is not prepared to accept the allowance fixed by Statute, and with the consent of all Parties, to meet the ordinary expenses that are incurred in carrying on the work of the country.  I go further and say that if that were carried into effect it would mean that representation in this House would be confined to men of independent means.  If that is Deputy MacDermot's policy, or if he were speaking for himself in having it carried into effect, it would mean that representation would be confined absolutely to people of independent means.  There would then not be real and proper representation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like intruding on the time of the House on a personal matter, but when the question is put to me, I must answer it.  I told my constituents a year ago when I came back after living for a good many years abroad, and when I was an unknown personality, that in order to prove that I had not come into Irish politics to make money out of them, and to show that I had a real interest in the country, I would not take any allowance.  That was the sole reason.  There was no question of snobbery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had not been away in foreign countries so many years, and if he had been in political life in this country for the last ten years, there would be no necessity for him to prove to his constituents that he could not make any money out of £360 a year.  I join to this extent with Deputy Thrift in saying that I think it is a pity this footling amendment was introduced to cut across a very important Bill.  In my opinion this is one of the most important Bills we have had for a number of years.  There are sections in it which are going to create great hardship.  These sections will, in my opinion, bring about a position both in national and local public services which will not be good for this country. I want to say, and I am sure it will be agreed to by most Deputies, that the saving which will be made in actual cash is a very small thing in the national finances.  I am afraid the Bill is going to reduce the standard of ability that we will have in national and local services.  I wonder how the new C.E.C. of the I.N.T.O. will look upon this Bill.  The I.N.T.O. drove out of office a couple of years ago the then Executive because they were supposed to have been intimidated into accepting a cut much less than the cut proposed in the Bill.  They put into office an Executive sworn to resist any cut, no matter how small.  I hope that we shall hear much more than we have <Col N="1938" /> heard so far from the C.E.C. of the I.N.T.O.  I notice that there is one section put in apparently as an afterthought, and in brackets&mdash;I do not know if the Minister for Education is responsible for it&mdash;by which the secondary teachers are excluded.  I am glad of that.  Up to a couple of years ago the secondary teachers were very badly paid.  I think they are not overpaid yet by any means.  Why are they excluded?  I would like the Minister for Education to give the reasons for reducing the primary teachers and excluding the secondary teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to get information on that point.  There are many other points upon which one could touch, such as cutting the pay of the Civic Guards and of the Army.  There is one section in the Bill and we do not know whether it is going to lead to a cut in the salaries of the employees of local authorities or not.  Personally, I think that under the section as now framed, only the salaries of employees or officials of agricultural committees and vocational committees can be cut. I am sure the Department will make quite clear very soon what their intentions are.  Deputy Tom Kelly has gone from the House and I am rather sorry.  The Deputy dwelt for a long time on the democratic programme of the first Dáil.  He told us the reason he came into the House, and the reason he was voting with the present Government was that they had attempted to carry out the democratic programme of the first Dáil, so far as it affected the workers of the country.  I would be the very last to question the absolute sincerity of Deputy Tom Kelly, but I question whether he is wise in the statement he made.  One of the articles in the democratic programme of the first Dáil was that the State should be responsible for the maintenance and the feeding of workers and their children and should see that no child in this State went hungry.  Deputy Tom <Col N="1939" /> Kelly said that President de Valera was giving effect to the democratic programme of the first Dáil.  How? After 12 months of Government by those on the opposite benches there are over 40,000 persons, according to their own figures, more on outdoor relief to-day than there were before they came into office.  Is that giving effect to the democratic programme of the first Dáil?</P>
      <P>On the 26th of June last a motion was passed in this House&mdash;I want to remind my late colleagues in the Labour Party of this&mdash;and accepted by the Government that it was the responsibility of the State to provide either work or maintenance for the unemployed in this country.  What steps have been taken since then to give effect to that resolution?  None whatever, and because no steps have been taken the responsibility was thrown over on the local authorities. The Government accepted the motion but they did not give effect to it and because of their failure to give effect to it, as Deputy Curran can state, in the South Riding of Tipperary this year for outdoor relief alone there is an increase of 2/3 in the £1 plus an increase of 1/4 owing to the reduction in the agricultural grant, making a total increase of 3/7 in the £1.  Is that giving effect to the democratic programme of the first Dáil?  As I say, I am absolutely satisfied that Deputy Tom Kelly, perhaps more than any other member of the House, would like to see full and absolute effect given to that programme. I am absolutely convinced of his sincerity in the matter, but I do respectfully suggest to him that the policy pursued by the present Government during the last 12 months, far from making it possible to put the democratic programme of the first Dáil into operation, has made it absolutely impossible for the present Government, and will make it very hard for any Government that succeeds them to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word or two in connection with the point raised by Deputy Morrissey, <Col N="1940" /> and I intend to be very brief.  He more or less misrepresented the attitude of the Centre Party to this Bill and the amendment put forward by Deputy Dillon.  He has misrepresented our attitude and said that there has been a division in this Party, and that it must have been a close one.  I say there has been no division in the Party.  We are absolutely unanimous in our attitude to the Bill.  The amendment has not emanated from either Deputy Dillon or Deputy MacDermot, but it represents the desire of farmers, who are in such a condition at the present time and for a number of years past, that they cannot understand how the country can carry on if the scale of salaries paid to public officials is to be continued.  As a matter of fact farmers have absolutely no income at present.  They are running their business at a loss.  I think the time is certainly coming when drastic reductions must be made in all salaries, reductions even more drastic than are proposed for the present year. There will have to be very drastic reductions during the continuance of the present economic war.  The principle of equality of sacrifice should be accepted and the farmers, who have been described as the soldiers in the front line trenches, should not be expected to bear all the sacrifices.  Otherwise this war cannot be regarded as a war carried on by other countries would be regarded. It would be a war confined to one particular class in the country. I am entirely in favour of the principles of the Bill, but as Deputy MacDermot said we want to be in a moral position to support it.  We are in the position at present of a Party in a glass house, who are beginning to throw stones.  That is what the Fianna Fáil Party decided to do, to start throwing stones in a glass house. They might at least have given the Centre Party a chance to get out. As regards the Labour Party they, like Cumann na nGaedheal, do not want to get out and they do not want the stones to be thrown.  They pretend to have great sympathy for poor men who are unemployed; yet <Col N="1941" /> they believe it would be much better to spend money in paying salaries from £400 to £1,000 and perhaps up to £1,500 without any cuts and to leave thousands of the unemployed living on a few shillings a week.  Small as are the cuts that are being made, they should have a great effect on unemployment down the country.  I, as a Deputy representing small farmers in Co. Cavan, can tell the Dáil that the average farmer in Co. Cavan, if he got 50/-, £2 or even £1 per week would leave his little farm and be very glad to get the money.  I do not want to delay the House further than to put these facts before it and to clear up a misunderstanding that seems to exist amongst the members of the Labour Party, with regard to the attitude of the Centre Party towards this Bill.  It is absolutely necessary that cuts should be made and, on the other hand, it is necessary, if we are to be in a moral position to impose these cuts, that we can say we are not asking anybody to do what we are not prepared to do ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of that necessity, I am all the more vigorously opposed to the fundamentally immoral principles enshrined in this Bill.  I do not propose to make any comment on the amendment proposed by Deputy Dillon except to say that I am in full agreement with what Deputy Morrissey has said.  It was unfair for a Deputy in Deputy Dillon's position to put Deputies into the position before the country of appearing to defend their own £360 a year.  That is a separate matter that could be debated separately&mdash;as to whether £360 a year is a proper allowance for public representatives not only for the work they <Col N="1942" /> do in this House but for the heavy demands made upon their charitable inclinations and the other demands from the public which they have to meet out of their meagre stipends.  I do not know whether Deputy MacDermot or Deputy Dillon makes any profit out of their £360 a year.  If they do, they have not much company amongst the Deputies of this House.  Every Deputy knows the demands made upon him by his constituents and by others all over the country in respect of donations to charitable purposes and subscriptions to different objects.  When he has discharged these, when he has paid his own election expenses and the expenses of going around his constituency looking after the interests of his constituents, I should like to know whether he has a profit out of the £360 a year paid to him.  How does Deputy Dillon or anybody who supports his view expect to get people to come here and give their time and labour to the work of the Dáil if they do not, at least, get some indemnity against the heavy demands made upon them?  I am against the principle enshrined in this Bill for three reasons.  I am against it because this Bill is politics and not economics.  I am against it because the principle is immoral and unjust.  I am against it because of the effect it will have on the purity and efficiency of the public service.  I say that this Bill was introduced not for the purpose of saving money or for the purpose of enabling the Minister for Finance to balance his Budget in difficult times, but for the purpose of pretending to the people in the country, whom he has duped by his political advertisements extending over six or seven years, that he has fulfilled his promise of economies in public administration. He has introduced this Bill for the purpose of pretending to those dupes that he has fulfilled his promise and the title of this Bill instead of being the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill, should be the Public Services (Pretended Economies) Bill.  As a result of this Bill, there will be little, if any, effective economy in the administration of this State.  I am sure that previous speakers have pointed out that there <Col N="1943" /> are a multitude of ways in which far better economies could be effected and far greater sums saved than can be saved at the expense of civic guards, army officers and civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the very outset, I want to say that I, personally, have been, as long as I have been connected with the Government of this country, against this principle of cuts in salaries of civic guards, teachers or anybody else. I say that the principle of cuts enshrined in this Bill is an immoral and an unjust principle.  I am willing to admit that the Government with which I was associated for ten years made mistakes in effecting cuts in old age pensions and the salaries of civic guards and national teachers.  I make a present of that point to anybody who wishes to make political capital out of it.  It was a profound error to cut the pay of the guards, and I rejoice to say that the last Government came to a definite decision that they would not cut the pay of civil servants. They made inquiries among civil servants at that time as to whether they would voluntarily submit to a temporary cut in their salaries.  The reply was such as you would expect from a body of men who have given such service to the people of this country and to the building up of this State.  They were prepared, they said, if there was a state of national emergency, to make their contribution, provided every other section in the State made a similar contribution.  They were prepared, as the last speaker said, to accept the principle of equality of sacrifice for all.  The cuts that were proposed&mdash;if they were proposed&mdash;at that time were proposed in entirely different circumstances from those of the present time.  They were proposed at a time when income tax was only 3/6 in the £.  These cuts are made when income tax is 5/- in the £. Deputies in the Centre Party pay no income tax, and Ministers pay no income tax.  The Centre Party is in favour of the principle enshrined in this Bill.  They pay no income tax and Ministers pay no income tax.  If the Government were really alive to their duty in connection with economy <Col N="1944" /> in public administration, they could save any paltry sum which they expect to save at the expense of efficient and loyal public servants by holding a tighter hand on the purse strings and not be indulging in profligate finance and expenditure for nothing but political purposes and political victimisation.</P>
    <P>I take the position of the Department with which I am myself most familiar, the Attorney-General's Department. It would be invidious for me to select individuals for the purpose of showing the hardships that will accrue as a result of the political manoeuvre enshrined in this Bill.  There were a Parliamentary draftsman and four assistant draftsmen when the Government with which I was associated left office.  There were no more efficient servants of the State and no more efficient draftsmen connected with any Parliament in the world.  The Government propose to cut the salaries of the Parliamentary draftsman and his assistants.  At the same time, they have brought in an additional Parliamentary draftsman, and the salary of that additional Parliamentary draftsman would, I think, equate the amount they will save by the cuts they propose to make in the other salaries. There was no necessity to bring that additional draftsman into the Attorney - General's Department.  They bring that man in without necessity, and, at the same time, they propose to cut the salaries of men who have worked harder than any Deputy in the Centre Party or any other Party in this House has ever worked in his life, or ever will work.  I feel that it is a definite injustice to those men, with whom I have been associated for so many years, that their salaries should be cut.  I am prevented from selecting individuals, but the Parliamentary draftsman has been mentioned so often in this House and in the Seanad for his efficiency that I may be permitted to say this: in the year 1922 he offered his long and wide experience in business and in law to the State and came into the service of the State.  He worked for twelve solid months without knowing what salary <Col N="1945" /> he was going to get, or whether he was going to get any salary.  I do say this, that, while I am against the principle of cuts in any direction, whether for guards, for national teachers, for civil servants or for army officers, I am also against the principle of cuts for labourers, because I think that this whole principle of cuts is eating into the economic life of this country and causing strife that should never be permitted to take place.  The principle of cutting salaries or wages is nothing but taking the line of least resistance. It is easy to cut people's salaries, and it is easy to cut people's wages, because it enables the people who do that sort of thing to dodge the real issue and to avoid facing up to the facts and finding the real way in which economies can be effected, not at the expense of individuals whose lives are ordered and regulated for years on the basis that a certain salary would be given to them or that a certain wage would come in each week.</P>
    <P>So far as civil servants are concerned, I think this Bill is a more profound injustice than to any other section which it is intended to hit by the Bill.  They came into the Service on the basis that they would have a smaller salary than they could earn outside.  They came in on the basis of security of tenure and security from interference with their salaries and it takes a civil servant many long and weary years to reach any sort of position in which he can even get married or maintain himself in a proper situation in life.  Every penny of the civil servant's salary is mortgaged and regulated on the basis that it is going to continue over a period of years without interference.  Numbers of them have bought their houses and mortgaged their salaries to pay for those houses on the principle of payment by instalments and they now find their whole family economy uprooted by this Bill, brought in by this Ministry for political purposes and to enable them to dodge the real issue of economy in public administration. These private individuals, who had regulated and ordered their family economy on the basis that their salaries were going to continue for <Col N="1946" /> a long period of years, with every penny regulated by their wives on the basis that the salaries would continue indefinitely, will find themselves in a position in which, in many cases, they will not be able to pay for their houses or keep up their policies of insurance on which their wives and families depend in the event of their death.</P>
    <P>This is the policy that is sponsored by the big farmers in the Centre Party and, for political purposes, by the members of the Fianna Fáil Ministry.  I have mentioned one so-called economy in the Department with which I was associated&mdash;the addition of an unnecessary draftsman. I want to mention another so-called economy.  Army Officers' salaries are to be reduced.  What was the necessity for the comic opera performance of busbies on St. Patrick's Day and the banquet or reception, or whatever it was, in St. Patrick's Hall on St. Patrick's Day?  The amount of money that was put into those busbies and that comic opera uniform for the Army and the amount of money spent on lobster sandwiches in St. Patrick's Hall would probably go very far to save the amount of money that will be saved by cutting junior Army officers' pay under the proposals contained in this Bill?</P>
    <P>We are told that Ministers' salaries are reduced, and we find that they are down to £1,000, so-called.  They said and undertook in advertisements and political propaganda that Ministers' salaries would be reduced to £1,000.  What are they in fact?  They are £1,000 free of income tax, and it matters not to those Ministers whether income tax is £1 in the £1 or a penny in the £1.  They can go on increasing other people's income tax and cutting other people's salaries but they give themselves £1,000 free of tax, and, in addition, give themselves a free motor car for the use of themselves and their families, free petrol and a free driver.  The man who holds the position that I held as Attorney-General has these perquisites in addition to £1,500 a year, free of tax, and liberty to get as much money as he can by private practice. He has what I never had even when <Col N="1947" /> I was supposed to be protected&mdash;a free motor car, a free driver and free petrol.</P>
    <P>Where is the economy?  Is it not all a sham and hypocrisy, as Deputy Morrissey has said?  What I regard as my greatest achievement as Attorney-General was when I was enabled to come to an agreement with Deputy Norton and others representing the Civil Service on an agreed Bill on the dispute that arose out of the Wigg-Cochrane question.  Mr. Blythe, who was then Minister for Finance, announced to this House that he was glad that agreement had been come to in order that civil servants might feel secure in the service of this State and, if civil servants are to be in a position in which they are to have what is now called a temporary Act brought in to cut their salaries this year, they can have no feeling of security that next year this Government, or any Government that may succeed them, whatever it is, may not double the cuts in another temporary Bill next year. There is brought into these proposals that element of uncertainty which is the predominant note in every branch of Fianna Fáil policy.  We have uncertainty in every department of life in this country at the present moment as a result of Fianna Fáil Party policy&mdash;uncertainty in the country and uncertainty in lives and liberty and property&mdash;and this Bill enshrines again the dominant principle of the Fianna Fáil Ministry&mdash; to produce political and economic uncertainty.</P>
    <P>What will the effect of these proposals be on the efficiency and loyalty of the servants of the State?  I have no doubt, from my knowledge of these men, that they will be as loyal to that Government opposite, and, perhaps, even more loyal, than they were to the Government presided over by ex-President Cosgrave.  Whatever happens I have no doubt that, although they take almost their means of livelihood away from them, they will continue still loyal in their services to the State because they will, I am sure, from my knowledge of them, put <Col N="1948" /> their interests in the State above their own private interests and their own feelings against the Party who has taken the bread out of their mouths. But what will its effect on their efficiency be?  They are only human, and they can be efficient and can do a day's work&mdash;a better day's work than any Minister on the Front Bench opposite does or is capable of doing&mdash; within the strict letter of their regulations, but anybody who has associated with these men during the last ten years knows that time is no consideration to them, hard work is no consideration to them, and even their pay was very little consideration to them.  They gave the best that was in them for the service of this country during ten years, and they were not into their office at 9.30 a.m. and away at 5 p.m., with the usual lunch interval, which could be expanded by a quarter of an hour washing their hands before and subsequently.</P>
    <P>They gave unstinted effort and the best they had in them, and we have, I am glad to say, in the service of this State the best brains in any of the islands that were formerly known as the British Isles.  The sooner the farmers realise that these men are working for them the better.  If you take the Civil Service of this State and examine it, it will be found that a large percentage of that Civil Service is rendered necessary by the demands of the farmers, and if the farmers would cease their unceasing demands there would be more opportunity for economy.  The Land Commission, the Department of Agriculture and the rest&mdash;they are all there for the farmers, and this proposal put forward by the Centre Party is merely the result of envy and, perhaps, of greed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon was so anxious that such a description should be used, and so wished it said that he thought it was said.  He acted to-day as he has in many other of the unctuous things that he has done in this House which shows that having thought things out for himself he thinks everybody is going to say the same thing as he thinks.  He will get out of that habit in time just as the ex-Attorney-General will get out of many of the habits and customs peculiar to him now.  Deputy Costello talked about Ministers now getting huge salaries of £1,000 a year.</P>

      <P>But he did not complain that members of the late Government were drawing £1,700 a year, and he did not complain that the President of the late Government drew £2,500 a year.  But he wants to make capital out of the fact that our Ministers, having considerably reduced their salaries, have not made further reduction by paying income-tax.  As I said, the Deputy's argument does not surprise me.  I have only one regret as regards Deputy Costello's career when he was Attorney-General, and that is that his Government took the advice he gave them in regard to the land annuities and refused the advice he gave them with regard to salaries reductions and old age pensions allowances. He is entitled to speak on a Bill of this kind, because he told us candidly that when he was Attorney-General to the late Government he opposed reductions of any kind either in old age pensions or in salaries. Therefore, he is the first man on the benches opposite who has a right to speak on this motion.  He has been consistent throughout the years. Again, I regret that the late Government did not accept his advice with the same foolhardiness that they did on the question of the land annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Minister for Finance, in introducing this measure, <Col N="1951" /> did not go further than he has done.  I am prepared to say here&mdash;and Deputies opposite can make what capital they like out of it&mdash;that I hope this is only the thin end of the wedge in making reductions in certain people's salaries. I have more respect for members of the Civil Service than Deputies opposite, because I did not set out to make political capital out of the Civil Service position, as Deputies opposite have done.  Therefore, I hold that I have more genuine respect for the Civil Service than the Deputies opposite who prate and prattle about it. But I hold that while this country is in a crisis, as it is, it is necessary that certain official people in this State, who are guaranteed their future, not like people who do not know what to-morrow will bring them, should bear some of the burden of this crisis.  We are assured by the Minister that as far as certain salaries are concerned, the lower grades particularly, this is only a temporary measure, and I trust that when this crisis is got over certain reductions that had to be made in the lower grades will be discontinued. I have no doubt about the country getting over this crisis.  I am at one with the Leader of the Opposition who, speaking at the Ard-Chomhairle of Cumann na nGaedheal, held the view that the country will wear down this crisis.  And I hope when the crisis is worn down the lower grades of pay will be advanced again to their former figure.</P>
    <P>One other remark, and that is with regard to the salaries of teachers.  I regret that the Minister, before he made further reductions in their incomes, did not go first to the higher Civil Service salaries and reduce their salaries by an amount equivalent to the amount the teachers were reduced by the Cumanna na nGaedheal Government. Then if further reduction were necessary the whole service would suffer an all-round reduction.  Since things have happened as they have and a reduction is necessary, I hope this Bill will be extended to employees of local councils if necessary.  They have fixity of tenure and a guarantee for the future, and in times of crisis they, <Col N="1952" /> too, should suffer some reduction.  I am quite sure that the efficiency of the Civil Service will not be impaired in the least, that they will respond to this call and give as good a return in their work and service as they have given heretofore.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello talked about the foolishness of the Government expenditure on certain St. Patrick's Day celebrations. The Deputy, when he mentions that, would appear to have a very short memory.  He should realise that this Government will be a very long time in office and will be carrying out celebrations on St. Patrick's Day for a considerable number of years before they spend as much as Deputy Cosgrave did when he was President on garden parties.  Both functions are not to be compared at all.  Except in so far as Deputy Costello is concerned, all the opposition to this Bill is simply a smoke-screen.  I am convinced that, with the exception of the Labour Party, three members of the Centre Party, and four members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, if Deputies were of the belief that their opposition to this measure would defeat the Government and force them to go to the country they would abstain from voting.  It is quite all right to make speeches and to vote when Deputies know there will be no direct consequence to themselves.  It is all right for them to create a certain sort of atmosphere for political purposes when they know very well that the Government is going to succeed with this measure.  Members of Cumann na nGaedheal and the Centre Party know they are quite safe in voting and they create all the political propaganda that they can.  In those circumstances we cannot take as serious their attitude in this matter.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister, when he sets out to economise, does not touch the lower grades of the Civil Service or the citizens to whom Deputy Cosgrave used to go when he wanted to effect economies.  I am glad the Minister is not interfering with old age pensioners or with certain members of the Gárda Síochána.  I think it is right that the slicing of salaries should begin at the top.  What would be the position <Col N="1953" /> if Cumann na nGaedheal were in office? The ex-Minister for Agriculture, during and prior to the last election, said that Cumann na nGaedheal were going to go out for a very clear-cut system of economy by reducing salaries at the top, in the middle and at the bottom. I dare say they, too, would be forced to reduce salaries.  I wonder if they were in power where they would start to reduce.  I expect they would go, as they did before, to the old age pensioners. I expect they would interfere with public services and also appropriate money that would otherwise be voted for social services.</P>
    <P>We have now before us a policy the very opposite of the Cumann na nGaedheal policy and I commend it very strongly to the House.  I express the hope that so far as the incomes of certain people in this country are concerned it is only the starting point and that we will have later on an advance from this position.  Let us hope that when the Budget comes up for discussion we will have a definite reduction in certain very highly paid offices.</P>

      <P>If I answer the last speaker it is not out of any particular respect for him.  Let me emphasise that whoever was a guest at my house was a guest at my own expense, and not at the expense of the State.  It could be inferred from the Deputy's statement that my guests were there at State expense, but that was not so. Let me add that there was a greater percentage of Irish Irelanders than there would be in the company of the Deputy or of anybody belonging to the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is quite apparent from what we have just heard from the Deputy that he has not read this Bill. In consequence of that I would like to point out that the protest I made this morning has more substance now.  It is obvious from the last few remarks the Deputy made that he has not read the Bill at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first consideration is the amendment. I was disposed, on reading the amendment the first time, to support it. I then examined it in all its implications, and also the standing of the two Deputies proposing it.  To my mind they are not the best judges of the <Col N="1954" /> means of the ordinary Deputy of this House, nor are they the best judges of the expenses or other commitments which fall to a Deputy here.  From the information I have had, not alone during the last few years, but in the beginning, when this proposal was taken up, as to how unfair it would be to Deputies to cut the allowances that they are being given, I am not supporting the amendment.  I firmly believe, notwithstanding the fact that we have heard it was a unanimous decision of the Party, that those members of the Party who have longer experience than Deputies Dillon or MacDermot will admit that the allowances are just reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are reasonable, then judge them on that basis.  I take a different line on this Bill from that taken by Deputy MacDermot.  There is, to my mind, for a person like Deputy Dillon or Deputy MacDermot, a case for the proposal they have made&mdash;I will admit that&mdash;but although I am opposed to the measure and to the whole proceeding in connection with it, I cannot support the amendment.  The Minister told us to-day that he had set up a Committee to deal with this matter and had got three reports. If my recollection is correct, the reports differed.  He wound up by saying that the Committee did not take into consideration the Government's need.  I inferred from that that this independent committee, examining the question in all its bearings, brought in a report which would not satisfy the Minister in respect of the amount of money that was going to be saved and the allocations, in consequence, are being made solely by the Government. I am quite sure it is one of a great many drafts that they had before them of one sort or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rice neglected the opportunity of directing attention to the fact that when the Leader of the Government was speaking in Rathmines in 1932, before the general election&mdash;he was then in the position of being Leader of the Opposition&mdash;he practically admitted that persons in receipt of £300 or £400 a year were not to be <Col N="1955" /> called upon to make a contribution by way of a reduction of their salaries. What is the situation?  The Minister told us he was going to save £250,000 a year by reductions in salaries.  It was not done during the year.  There was no question of this Bill.  The Committee apparently had reported or had not reported, but no decision was taken.  A general election was fought and the people throughout the country were not impressed with the Minister's statement that they were going to save £250,000 a year by reductions in salaries.  The civil servants, the guards, the army and various other people concerned, each and every one of them could have drawn no other conclusion from the circumstances that no Bill had been introduced and that no cuts had been imposed, than that the policy of the Government had been departed from in that connection.  We were not told that there was any departure from the statement made by the President.</P>
    <P>I find in the publication which was circulated by the Government to the Press that there is mention there of a salary of even £350 a year.  This statement points to a super-deduction of £7 and a super-deduction, plus loss in bonus on 1st January last, of £23 5/-. That is the first point I have to make. When the second general election came the President gave no information whatever that it was the intention of the Government to make reductions on salaries of £300 to £400.  There was no intimation given by the Government that the salaries of the Guards were to be cut and as well as I remember there was no intimation given that the salaries of the teachers were to be cut.  There had been some talk about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  I said that I knew the position and I was prepared to say this, that for 12 months no interference would be made until we had seen what the actual situation was.  On February 4th, 1932, Deputy de Valera, as he then was, said: &ldquo;The President of the Executive Council had a salary of £2,500 a year and Ministers £1,700 each.  These salaries would have to come down by half.  A salary of £1,000 should be sufficient for any Minister to meet his expenses and rear his family.  He was, however, against the cutting down of the smaller Civil Service salaries by reason of the fact that these moneys were being usefully spent in the community, whilst the larger salaries were being largely spent on luxuries.&rdquo;  That is very fine. The President has one of the larger ones now himself.  I wonder is he following out the example?  We had one Vote here, one Estimate here before us yesterday or the day before. It was an Estimate for the Army Vote, and the salary that is down for the Minister for Defence is £1,000.  The estimated income tax liability in respect of this £1,000 was £150.  The only conclusion that I will draw from that is that the salary of the Minister is free from income tax.  I presume I may be entitled to draw that conclusion having regard to the way it is set out.  The very hasty calculation that I have made would show that the actual salary which would produce £150 to a person in the position of the Minister for Defence is £1,300 odd, £1,323.  When we were told that a salary of £1,000 a year was enough for a Minister the income tax was at 3/6 in the £.  We were not told then that they were to be free of income tax, and I am not by any means to be taken as arguing in favour of reduction in Ministerial salaries.  I believe that if a <Col N="1957" /> Minister serves the State well the State ought to be rich enough to afford him a sufficient salary.  £1,323 per annum is the salary of the Minister for Defence as far as I can make out what the real salary now is.</P>

There is the further deduction which an unmarried person is entitled to.  There is £100 at the half rate.  That totals £595 off the £1,323. That would leave £728.  There is one-sixth off the first £450 or something of that sort and a deduction of 10 per cent. on the remainder.  The balance is at 5/-.

Why I am mentioning that figure is this:&mdash;I am taking up the position of a civil servant in receipt of £1,300, and I find that according to the memo issued by the Department of Finance the civil servant has a deduction of £117 per annum off his income.  I say it is bad form and bad administration, and it is not just to deal with civil servants who enter into a contract with the State to interrupt that contract and not to make some disposition with regard to any emoluments that the Ministers are in receipt of themselves.  I do not subscribe to the proposal that the Minister should not be paid a good salary, but I am asking what did the Ministers state, and pointing out what they put before the people, namely, that £1,000 is enough.  There was then no intimation when they said that £1,000 was enough that it was to be free of income tax. I say that no person in this State under statute is entitled to regard his salary as free of income tax.</P>

      <P>The ordinary civil servant in receipt of £1,300 a year previous to the general election this year, and that is after he had received a cut, or perhaps two cuts, was in exactly the same position as the Minister with £1,000 salary free from income tax.  In the one Vote that has been taken by this House there is shown in the form in which it is presented that the civil servant in comparison with the Minister would be paying £117 off that salary.  When the Bill passes into law the Minister for Finance says that he expects to save £280,000 by reason of this measure.  He has already saved £125,000 by reason of the fall in the cost-of-living bonus. Is this £280,000 in addition, and, if so, does it mean a saving of £405,000 as compared with last year?  The Minister has not given us that information.  I do not know whether he has the information.  Then we do not know what is the position with regard to Sections 3, 4 and 5 in this measure.  The most important part of the Bill is to be found in the Schedule, Parts I, II, III and IV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as civil servants are concerned&mdash;although they are last in the list I shall take them first&mdash;one might divide them roughly into three classes. There are the old British civil servants who have a contract of service and whose position is safeguarded to some extent by Article 10 of the Treaty, and subsequent agreements.  There is the second class, the recruited class, who have come into the service during the last ten years and they extend, I suppose, over all grades.  Then there are those who were attracted to the service.  I was responsible for persuading one of them, if I may say so, to come into the Civil Service some years ago.  There is nothing wrong about it.  I invite the Minister to say whether or not the Government made any attempt to attract any person to the service of the State who <Col N="1960" /> might be in the employment of another State.  The first class have certain safeguards.  The second class came in on the honour of the State, of the electorate and the elected representatives of the people, and the Government subsequently elected in the Dáil. The third class is composed of those attracted to the service of the State such as the case mentioned by the ex-Attorney-General, of a man who could have left the service six or seven years ago and earned £800 more a year than he was getting from the State, but whose conception of his responsibility and of his civic duty was such that he would not leave the infant State at that time.  As the ex-Attorney-General said, the marks of the excellence of his work are to be found in the statutes passed by the Oireachtas.  What is the position of those who have been recruited?  There are people of a certain mentality in this and other countries who think that any salary beyond a particular sum should not be paid.  I would hesitate for a long time before recommending the adoption of that policy to any person of experience in administration or business or who knows anything about public matters.  What a State ought to do is to attract to its service the most brilliant intellects, the ablest men, the most capable persons, that can possibly be got and pay them properly.  They would be much cheaper than inferior material however poorly paid.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly missed the point altogether of a statement made by Deputy MacDermot who said that those in the Sinn Féin movement had been ignorant of the fact that this country had been run by the British Government during the two or three years before the Great War at a loss, and that the Home Rule Bill of 1912 was framed on the basis that the revenue derived here was less than the expenditure.  We were not unaware of that fact&mdash;we knew all about it, and a lot more besides.  That economic situation was changed to our advantage during the Great War, and, at one period, I think in 1920, the amount received by the British Government from tax revenue over <Col N="1961" /> expenditure was somewhere in the neighbourhood of £20,000,000.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy MacDermot will persevere in his statement about hordes of officials.  I have already drawn his attention privately to the fact that in the first year of the administration here there was a loss of £1,000,000 on the Post Office.  Last year I think the loss was down to £40,000, and if we had been in office during that period it would have been nil.  Hordes of officials!  We had one Estimate discussed already this week and Deputy MacDermot was in his place, but no attention was drawn to any saving that could be made in that estimate.  It is one thing to make a flowery or rhetorical statement; it is another thing to come down to business and show where economies can be effected.  I am tired listening to the Party over there, who have had to swallow practically all they said when on these benches about extravagance and so on.  They told the people 12 or 18 months ago that £2,000,000 would be saved without interfering in the slightest with the efficiency of the services and they are now sitting late this evening to save £280,000!  They have had over 12 months to do it and they could not make up their minds how it was to be saved.  After trying to persuade a Committee to take them out of the mess the Committee handed back the baby and now they come forward and say that it is absolutely necessary to have this passed this evening.  For what reason?  None of the reasons given would hold water. This is not an estimate.  This Bill is passed already.  All is wanted is the mobilisation of the silent members to make sure that it is law inside a month or two months, or whatever the time is.  The fact of its passing this evening does not count in the least.  We have had no information regarding the hordes of officials and I hope we shall get it.  I should like to learn, notwithstanding the fact that I am getting aged, something about where these economies can be effected.  I am quite sure the Minister would like to know more.</P>

The only Administration that put the democratic programme into practice was the one over which I presided for nine years.  It is one thing to tell the people that a thing is not done; it is another thing to prove that it is not done.  What is the Deputy's position?  Is he a representative of the City of Dublin?  On March 30th, 1933, what did the increase in the cost of relief in Dublin amount to? £489 over the corresponding week of last year, and the democratic programme has been in operation for 12 months!</P>

As to that, I shall only say that the statement published by the secretary of the teachers' organisation this morning throws doubt upon the statement made by the Minister this evening that it was more favourable than what had been agreed to.  Then there is to be a deduction from the sums made available for <Col N="1963" /> universities.  There the same thing applies that I have referred to with regard to public servants.  We want good professors, lecturers and assistant lecturers.  It so happens in the world in which we are moving that talent goes where it gets remunerated in most cases, and if by reason of these deductions universities are not going to get the best material it is not to-day or to-morow or next week or next year that this country will lose by reason of this ridiculous economy.  Any proposals that were made in connection with a reduction in the cost of the public services when I had responsibility for administration were based upon the acceptance by or the agreement of the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It settled that, anyhow. I had a long time there, and I did not take over a machine such as was left to my successors.  I did not get the headlines that were left of efficiency, competency, and general statesmanship, in connection with the public state of affairs of the State.  The high cost of public services at the present moment is a serious consideration. We are told that there is a crisis on.  What do you do when there is a crisis?  Do you save money or do you spend it lavishly?  This Government is responsible for every increased cost put on the people of this country.  We had the Minister admitting this evening that the revenue is falling&mdash;that the incidence of taxation is such that the various impositions are reducing in amount.  I would like to say that there is a limit beyond which if taxation and rates are pushed the result is chaotic. In connection with local administration, I would like to say that the principle regarding local authorities enshrined in the Bill is bad on the face <Col N="1964" /> of it.  What are you doing?  You are proposing to reduce certain salaries, and you are proposing not to give the local authorities the benefit of that. The saving is to come into the Exchequer.  Certain minor cases have been referred to by the Minister, in respect of which, if there be a saving, it will be devoted to the particular service in question, but as far as the local authorities are concerned, whatever saving is effected is going to go into the general Exchequer, and at the same time they are being reduced £448,000 a year in the agricultural grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is presented to us by reason of the fact that an outside jury mobilised by the Minister could not give him what he wanted.  Not having got what he wanted, he puts up to us what the Executive Council decide.  It is unfair; it is unjust; and it is going to shake the confidence of the public servants of this State.  It is possibly going to result in less efficient legislation, and in connection with the whole administration of the State it is going to affect that heart which men should have in their work, and would have in it if the Minister were to take them into his confidence and tell them that the crisis is such that he asks them to give some assistance in solving it.  It is not being done in that way.  It has been botched, one might almost say, from the very beginning.  Nobody has more admiration for the efficiency of the Service than I have.  I have long experience of it.  I know enough about the Service&mdash;and about the ordinary people in the street, in business or elsewhere&mdash;to realise that if you make the position such for them in connection with their income that they cannot put the heart they would like to put into their work the consequence will be a loss of efficiency in the Service, perhaps much more costly than what is involved here.  The Minister would be very well advised to withdraw this measure, and to take those public bodies which are affected here &mdash;all the persons, from one end to the other&mdash;into council.  Some fifteen or sixteen months ago, when a question of this sort arose before, civil servants through their secretary informed the <Col N="1965" /> Secretary to the Ministry or some other official that if a national crisis were in existence...</P>

It may be that the mistrust which will be occasioned by this measure will wipe away a lot of the profit there is in it.  If that happens the situation will certainly not be improved; it will be disimproved.  To my mind if the Ministry were in earnest, honest and sincere in this matter, they would accept the amendment which has been proposed by Deputy MacDermot.  I agree with neither the Bill nor the amendment, and I propose to vote against both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a few remarks with reference to Deputy Dillon's amendment to this Bill. Deputy Dillon calculates a Deputy's work for his constituency by the number of days he attends in this House. Any Deputy who lives in his constituency is all the time, Sunday and Monday, working for that constituency, and his expenses do not cease when he goes back to it.  A Deputy living in Dublin perhaps, or living away from his constituency, may be under less expense, but the general body of Deputies who live in their constituencies have to travel from place to place in those constituencies.  When Deputy Dillon refers to their having 1st class travelling allowances to and from their constituencies he forgets that the least part of their travelling is the travelling they do to and from the Dáil. The heaviest portion of their travelling is up and down within their constituency, the areas of which are very big in many cases.  Deputies are not confined to coming to Dublin during the sitting of the Dáil.  If they do their duty by their constituents they have to be up here in Dublin practically every week visiting various Departments. Neither is their time in Dublin confined to Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  If they want to do any work in the various Departments they find that they have to be here on Monday, or at least early on Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1966" /> I think that this amendment is actuated, no matter what Deputy Dillon says, by a desire to make this House undemocratic, and to have nobody representing the constituents but people like himself, with large incomes outside their Parliamentary allowance.  Perhaps the activities of those opposed to Deputy MacDermot politically are too much for him, and he sees a way of curbing those activities by bringing about a reduction in the Parliamentary allowance.  Deputies who do their duty in dealing with their correspondence often find a bill averaging 5/- a day for postage alone.  Six days out of seven the cost of postage alone reaches 5/- per day, out of their Parliamentary allowance of 19/8 per day.  I would not speak on this motion or on this Bill were it not for the mean references made by the ex-Attorney-General, in his speech, to the present Ministry and to the national celebration on St. Patrick's Day.  It comes very well from the ex-Attorney-General who, with the other Ministers of the late Cabinet, had all the facilities of free transport, free petrol and a free driver, to put up such allegations against the present Government.</P>

      <P>I will not get away from the point.  Deputy Costello stated this evening, in his mean fashion, that the cars used by the Ministers in carrying on their duties as Ministers of State were also being used by their families.  I could make an equally mean insinuation and, perhaps, would have more proof for it than Deputy Costello has for his.  I can state and prove that an ex-Minister uses the army car at his disposal for conveying his children to and from school every day of the week since we became a Government.</P>

That does not come very well from the ex-Attorney-General when we remember that when their dead colleague was buried they made the State put up the cost of the wreaths that went on his grave, and made the State pay for the lunch they had after the funeral in the Gresham Hotel.  It comes well from such a Deputy to make little of the attempt to raise the dignity and the prestige of this nation by honouring the national holiday with a banquet in St. Patrick's Hall, as well as his talk about the lobster salad and all the other mean talk that we heard from him.</P>

      <P>I hope when the principles of this Bill are being put into operation that the Minister will see <Col N="1968" /> that they also apply to the inflated salaries paid to certain local and municipal officials up and down the country. If an amendment to the Bill is necessary to do that, I hope the Minister will see that it is introduced.  The cost of living in the country is not as high as in Dublin, and I trust the Minister will see if the suggestion I have made cannot be included in this Bill.

      <P>As representing the people of Kerry, I welcome this measure, particularly in so far as it relates to the local authorities.  If there is not power under the Bill to deal with highly superannuated officials, I hope the Minister will amend it in that direction and make it more drastic than it is.  As Deputies are aware, the amalgamation scheme that was carried out was one of the greatest curses ever inflicted on the country so far as local authorities are concerned. In almost all cases it led to a duplication of services.  There are many glaring instances of that in the County Kerry, of officials drawing salaries at the present time under local authorities who are entitled under the amalgamation scheme to superannuation allowances as high as £700 and £800 per annum.  There has been too much overlapping, so much of it indeed that very drastic action is called for so far as the local authorities are concerned.  The secretary of the principal local body in County Kerry has admitted that he is in receipt of £1,450 per annum.  That includes salary and emoluments.  I hold that this measure is merely a gesture in so far as economies are concerned, and that the real drastic reductions must take place later.  We welcome it so far as it goes, but power should be taken to deal with salaries paid by local bodies.  As regards the £1,000 salaries, I think the Bill should be more drastic than it is.  In the case of the lower ranks I think the grades of allowances are very fair, but the reductions in the case of people with £1,000 a year should be greater than what is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Dillon's amendment I would like the Deputy to <Col N="1969" /> know that I and other members of this House worked for years on local bodies and were not worried about salaries or allowances.  We did that work free, and we are still prepared to work for the people without any remuneration with the exception of a subsistence allowance.  It was simply camouflage on the part of Deputy Dillon to bring in this amendment and it will be taken as such by the people throughout the country.  The people know quite well that many of us are prepared to work for them and that we are not out for this allowance.  They know that we are prepared to carry on as we did in the past&mdash;that the working Deputies of this House are prepared to do their utmost for the people they represent. I think Deputy Dillon when bringing forward his amendment must have had in mind the old-time politicians, who went down the country, made glorious promises to the people, and then returned to live in Dublin.  We are not of that type.  I welcome the Bill, but as I have said I hope it is only a gesture as to what the Government propose to do in making drastic reductions in salaries.</P>

      <P>This measure is a national calamity from one point of view.  It is a national necessity from another point of view.  I am afraid that the Centre Party, who attempt to represent the farming community of this country in this amendment, will find that they do not represent them&mdash; that they do not represent them even to the percentage extent that their numbers as Deputies represent the electorate of the country.  Eye-wash of this kind will not deceive anybody. I was sorry that Deputy Dillon put his name to this amendment for a number of reasons.  I was sorry because he is an educated man of 21 years of age and upwards and that he is James Dillon, the son of John Dillon, and the grandson of John Blake Dillon, that he should put his name to a proposal of this kind that, in the words of Deputy Morrissey, is pure hypocrisy.  It is pure hypocrisy from my point of view. I do not accuse the Deputy of using it in a hypocritical way, but it appears to me to be nothing else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; well, I hope it will be appreciated.  One thing which Deputy MacDermot said I want to contradict now.  As far as I could observe, he made a reference to the effect that people&mdash;Deputies&mdash;he looked around the House when he said it&mdash; sneered at a reference to the old Irish Parliamentary Party.  I did not see anybody sneering at any reference to the old Irish Parliamentary Party, and I think that it should go on record that that statement of his was not true.  It certainly was not true as far as I could observe.  Whether we differ with the policy of the old Irish Parliamentary Party or not, I do not believe that there is a single Deputy in this House that does not recognise the signal services which, under different conditions from the conditions under which we live now, that Party gave to this country.</P>
      <P>Another matter about which Deputies opposite grew very eloquent&mdash;almost hysterical&mdash;was the reference made by Deputy Costello to the saving that might be effected if busbies on the gallant hussars were not used at the sumptuous banquet which the Army, in all its glitter, dominated on St. Patrick's Day.  We were asked by Deputies why should it not be done. We here agree that it should be done, we have no objection; but I would ask the House to remember the hypocrisy of that Party over there who would not co-operate even to the extent of walking in the funeral procession of the greatest patriot of our time, the greatest Fenian of our time, whose remains had been sent over here from America to be buried in Glasnevin&mdash;the late John Devoy.  The Fianna Fáil Party refused to march in that funeral, and a Deputy opposite was in the room in the City Hall on the night that three representatives of Fianna Fáil marched out when they asked the Executive Council whether the National Army were taking part, and were informed that it was.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can take up the matter later.  The question was put <Col N="1971" /> as to whether the National Army was going to participate in the funeral procession, and the Secretary of the Executive Council said that he was empowered to state that it was, that John Devoy's remains were entitled to the honour of a public funeral, and that no funeral could be public here if the State did not co-operate in it, and the Army did not also co-operate.  &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the three representatives of Fianna Fáil, &ldquo;if the National Army is going to co-operate in this funeral, we cannot co-operate.&rdquo;  One of those representatives was a Senator, drawing a salary from the Free State.  Another had been a Deputy Speaker of this House for five years and drew £1,000 a year.  The other was a Senator in receipt of a pension from the British Army, who had been decorated on the field of battle for cutting the throats of the Boer farmers.  Deputy Rice can contradict me now if I am wrong.</P>

      <P>Very well, sir, I will not pursue the matter further.  The proposal in this Bill has become inevitable from the policy adopted by the Government and by the Labour Party.  It is their economic policy that is responsible &mdash;and I want it to be clearly understood what I mean by economic policy; I do not mean the policy that the people opposite tried to put over on the people as the beginning and ending of their entire policy, the economic policy of Arthur Griffith.  That policy has no <Col N="1972" /> opposition on this side.  The policy to which I refer is the policy of the Government to deprive this country of its markets.  That is the only policy, because the real economic policy of Arthur Griffith, a real national protective policy, is impossible unless you have a market for your surplus goods. None of the Ministers will face up to that position.  That war was declared last year by President de Valera.  I say President de Valera, advisedly, because President de Valera is the Government. He is the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for everything else down the line, and the Minister for Finance opposite knows that very well and I know it too, and the Minister for Finance knows how I know it.</P>

      <P>As to the Official Secrets Act, they came as badly out of my Official Secrets Act as out of the one in Green Street.  These reductions as I say, are the inevitable consequence of the reduction in national income, represented in our trade returns, of £8,000,000 for a half year and the position we are up against now.  Apologists over there need not say that this is only temporary.  Everything is done now with the appearance and the genuineness of permanency.  The annuities have been taken out of the Suspense Account, or at least there is a book-keeping entry to the effect that they have been taken out&mdash;whether there was anything there to be taken out or not I do not know; the Minister knows that better than I do&mdash;but, as I say, as a book-keeping transaction they have been taken out.  War to the knife has been declared.  Agriculture was described picturesquely to-day as being in the front line trenches for the last year.  The farmers cannot remain forever in the front line trenches and this trouble with England has got to be settled or pass this Bill, and Deputies opposite can rest assured that this is only the thin end of the wedge. The civil servants and the teachers and all the other public officials mentioned in this Bill will be very lucky if there is anything to pay <Col N="1973" /> them in six months' time if this economic war is not settled.</P>
      <P>We were told by a Deputy to-day that the previous Government cut the roots of the tree and that the tree was withering when the present Government came into office.  We know who cut the roots of the tree, and we know who tried to stop the tree from being planted.  It was not the people that the Minister for Finance hopes some day to see standing on the broken arch of Mallow Bridge, not to sketch the ruins of St. Paul's, but to sketch in the pages of Irish history, the men who set up this State in spite of him and his colleagues.  If the civil war had not been fought we would have millions of money now.  That was what rotted the root of the national tree.  What do we find in the so-called economic war and in the Minister's proposals?  They are co-related financially.  As Minister for Finance he should know.  Some of his colleagues told us about them on political platforms, of course, where they were all playing football the one way.  They do not attempt to tell us here.  He told us of the money he is going to get from the printing machine in the future.  He should know that times of stress are not the times to contract currency but the times to increase it. I refer him to the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Lords and the House of Commons of 1832.  He is going to restrict currency in times of stress.  How is he going to restrict it? By reducing the wages and the salaries of State officials.  In his comic turn a few days ago Deputy Hugo Flinn told us that the policy of his Government was to make this a self-supporting State.  If this is to be a self-supporting State it must provide a market for itself within itself.  What are the potentialities of a market within a State?  The purchasing power of the workers within the State.  This Bill proposes to cut by varying percentages the purchasing power of the people. They are only State officials, to start with.  Remember that this means every wage earner and every employer ultimately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consider the position of thousands of thrifty civil servants in Dublin and <Col N="1974" /> around it, who, in the last ten years have bought houses on the hire purchase system.  They have a fixed social scale and an ambition for themselves and their families commensurate with their remuneration, a remuneration that was guaranteed to them under Government contract.  These civil servants have insured their lives.  Some of them bought their houses through insurance companies and have to meet very high charges at the present time. Has the Minister considered what this might mean to them and what case in equity they might be able to put up? If they find themselves on reduced salaries unable to meet their obligations, and if they go to the Minister, to the banks or to the insurance companies saying &ldquo;Our incomes have been cut down, even though we were under Government contract to get these incomes, and we want our contracts with you cut down,&rdquo; what will be the Minister's position?  Perhaps he would refer the matter to the Farmers' Association of agricultural experts that works under the wing of the Fianna Fáil Party, but that contains no farmers.  That Association always asks for the repudiation of bank debts.  Perhaps it might become a semi-Government institution to deal with those house purchasers whose salaries will be reduced under the Bill and who will not be able to meet their obligations.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendment it is a cheap way of getting publicity.  It is cheap, political propaganda and nothing else.  There are certain Deputies&mdash;I must use the plural although it would be the singular up to a few days ago&mdash;going around the country telling the farmers that salaries must be reduced.  That is going to be the acid test.  Supposing you abolish the £360 a year&mdash;call it what you like&mdash; or part of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will assume for the sake of my argument that the lot goes. Each Deputy represents a population of 20,000, which means 4d. per head to his constituents.  If a Deputy goes to his constituents and gives them 4d. a head he would not enrich them.  If a <Col N="1975" /> Deputy was not worth 4d. per head well he is not fit to be here and it is a poor valuation he is putting on himself. If a Deputy represents half that number, 10,000 electors, it would only mean 8d. per head.  If constituents through the country are told that if this allowance is withdrawn from Deputies it will mean that each elector will gain 8d. in the year, will the electors be satisfied?  Of course not.  It is the service that a man gives his constituents and his ability and his knowledge to understand their peculiar requirements that count.</P>

      <P>As far as I understand your leader, he is going to vote for the Bill.  I am not.  If he is going to vote for the Bill he must have some reason at the back of his head why civil servants should be cut.  I cannot understand the mentality of some people.  I can speak in this matter as a farmer, as an ex-civil servant, as a businessman, and as a manufacturer.  I deplore the reduction of salaries of public servants. It means a lowering of the standard of living.  You cannot stop; it will run down the line.  Every grade will be reduced; the purchasing power of the community will be reduced, and it will have a cumulative effect.  It will increase in momentum as it goes along.  Before the year is out salaries will have to be revised again, all through one cause, and one cause only. That cause is the economic war that was precipitated by the Government opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members on the Front Bench are very careful in what they say about the causes of the economic war, but the back benchers come along and say in effect: &ldquo;No surrender.  We were attacked.&rdquo;  They were not attacked. They say that the late Government paid the annuities to England.  They <Col N="1976" /> all stand round the annuities, but what about the claim amounting to £400,000,000 that was put up to Mr. Thomas the last time this Government was in touch with the British Government? In that, and this comes home to the Minister for Finance, is a particular claim that we were entitled to the profits on the note issue from the signing of the Treaty onwards.  The Minister ought to know, if he does not know, that we had then a note issue of about £20,000,000 making five per cent. for the British Government.  It made that on a reduced currency running down to about £17,000,000 up to 1929. Whose fault was it?  Was it the fault of the British Government?  No, it was the fault of the people who set out to lay this country in ruins and who made it impossible for any Minister for Finance to establish a national currency and to save that money from going to the British Treasury.  Every Treasury note that was in circulation here made that much of a free grant to the British Treasury.  That was ruling here until 1929, and this country was losing about £1,000,000 per year on the profits of the note issue.  Now that the Fianna Fáil Party have been responsible for England having control of our note issue up to 1929, and the British Treasury having profits on that note issue amounting, roughly, to about £1,000,000 per year, the Fianna Fáil Party come along and make a claim on the British Government that they must be refunded the profits on the note issue.</P>

      <P>We have this as an alternative to a settlement of the economic war.  How can a dispute be settled between two individuals or two nations if one party demands that the other must pay for losses for which that party is not responsible, but for which the party claiming is responsible? The Party that is the Government here to-day is responsible for certain losses.  Our Government is claiming from the British Government compensation for losses for which the Fianna Fáil Party is directly responsible. We are told here that because we refuse to join in such a nonsensical claim as that, we are playing England's game.  We must reduce the salaries of our public servants, we must shake up the whole fabric of the State, we must reduce the standard of living, simply because Fianna Fáil wants to save their faces.  They knew the Ultimate Financial Settlement was in existence in 1927 but yet they allowed a vote to be taken in this House without declaring their policy on it.  The President knows he was asked to declare his policy on it and he refused.  He did nothing until this House had committed itself to the vote.  That is true, and I was the member of the Party who asked him to declare his policy on it.</P>

      <P>The dispute between the two countries has deprived us of our markets, has reduced national income by eight millions in six months, and will reduce it by another eight millions <Col N="1978" /> during the remaining six months. While the national income has been so cut down, we cannot pay our public servants the scale of salaries they were formerly paid.  While I clearly see that position, my attitude and my vote will be given for a policy that we should stop the economic war rather than reduce the standard of living of this country.  We could settle it on the lines of mutual confidence.  We have got either to settle it or to reduce our standard of living.  That is sticking out. It is not the British Government that started it, but the members of the Front Bench opposite.  It is not the Party that built up the Treaty and the National Army, that has been so highly complimented by back benchers on the Government side who started it.  It is not those who supported the Treaty that are playing England's game, but those people who tried to break the State from outside, and who are now trying to break it from inside.  It is time this breaking of the State was stopped, and that we who want to work for our country should be allowed to work for it and build up the State as it should be built under a friendly native Government and not be eternally squabbling over nothing.  We have got very important work in our own country but we will not be let do it by our own Government.  We are not playing England's game.  If we dare to criticise our Government they say that we are playing England's game.  What game were they playing when they were out in arms burning and looting?</P>

      <P>The national debt incurred by the civil war constitutes a large portion of the overhead charges of the nation to-day.  With all deference <Col N="1979" /> to your ruling, a Chinn Comhairle, we cannot get away from the obligations incurred through the civil war, though I do not want to labour that point.  I want to refute the allegation of this new patriotism, that the people who built up the Treaty are playing England's game, and that the people now working the Treaty, who did all they could to smash it, are the patriots.  It is time that this mock patriotism was put aside.  It is time that the mask was pulled off and the country saw who was playing England's game and who is playing England's game.  The civil servants may thank the people who played England's game and who are playing England's game for this cut.  I wonder will so many of them shout &ldquo;Up de Valera&rdquo; now.  I have made clear the attitude that I propose to adopt on this Bill.  I recognise that there is no alternative to this Bill, or even a more drastic Bill, but a settlement of the so-called economic war.  It is time the Government did something for a settlement. We here stand for a revision of the Ultimate Financial Settlement.</P>

      <P>I shall not go back to that any more.  As regards the proposal to reduce the allowance of members of the Oireachtas, it is easy for a Deputy who lodges round the corner in the Shelbourne Hotel, and who can spend his time going round the country in a sumptuous motor car to support a proposal of that kind.  He is not in the front-line trenches of agriculture, industry or commerce, and, if this country were smashed to-morrow, he could take his hand-bag and go off safely to Paris.  It is easy for Deputies of that type to talk as they did, but those Deputies cannot speak for farmers or for the Agricultural League for which they pretend to speak, because they only came into that and captured it by stealth.  Well the Deputy knows that.  Well he knows that when he approached the organising committee of that organisation <Col N="1980" /> to be made president of the convention, he was told he was not a farmer and that he had lived for almost fifty years without realising that there was a country called Ireland and that farmers were not going to be represented by him.  He knows that the next man selected by the organising committee was bought over by a caucus meeting held in Fitzwilliam Square by the Deputy and others.</P>

      <P>They are not insinuations; they are statements of fact.  I am not going to test the patience of the Ceann Comhairle by putting down the relevant documents the Deputy in question circulated in order to get there.  But I could do that.  The present proposal is one which, at that convention, Deputy MacDermot opposed.  It is time that all this hypocrisy was brushed aside.  It is time that all this playing to the gallery by Deputy MacDermot and Company, as regards the reduction of the allowance, was ended.  It will not wash. What the farmers want done by the Centre Party, the Fianna Fáil Party, the Cumann nGaedheal Party and every other Party is something to improve their condition.  They do not grudge, any more than any other section of the community, compensation either by way of allowance or otherwise to Deputies who come here to work in their interests and in the interest of the nation.  They will not be caught by bird-lime in this way. They have been pulled a long way but their eyes are opened now.  I am satisfied conscientiously that I am doing the proper thing in voting against this Bill and against the amendment. Deputy MacDermot should be more sparing in his criticism when he tries to insinuate that Deputies are here for the salaries.  Whatever differences there may be amongst Parties in this <Col N="1981" /> House, there are men in the two big parties facing each other here who have spent bullets in their bodies as a result of fighting for their country. When they went out to fight, they never thought that they would be rewarded for doing so.  If the people who won us this freedom are prepared to work for the country for which they made sacrifices in their youth, why should they not be remunerated now or why should they not get their out-of-pocket expenses for coming here in their own time and working for their country?  Their constituents will be the judges whether they are doing the work in the interest of public representation or not.  It is exceedingly bad taste on the part of Deputy MacDermot, who spent his manhood working and fighting for other countries, to come here and castigate men who fought for their country and who worked for their country without fee or reward.  Now, they only ask out-of-pocket expenses when they come here to the Dáil.  They are making nothing out of it, and never will make anything out of it.  I have no hesitation in voting against the Bill and against the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GearoidOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle enshrined in this Bill is that the salaries of persons in the service of the State should, for one year, be reduced. That would seem to be a very simple matter if we did not take it in conjunction with the fact that in this country and in every other country the political Party in charge of the Government changes from year to year or from decade to decade, as the case may be.  I am sure that everybody will agree that there is nothing so important to any State as the existence in that state of a reliable Civil Service, military service and police force, with the other service which it is suggested in this case should be cut, the education service.  There is a feeling&mdash;I say this as representing the County Dublin and the townships where the majority of the blows of the axe are likely to fall&mdash;that an attack is being made generally on the services whether it be the Civil Service, the Army, the Guards or the education services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1982" /> I do not want to refer to any irrelevant matters, but people have this feeling, even in the Civil Service, that, as a result of the change of Government, there has been withdrawn from this State service that feeling of security and that feeling that they have behind them the support of the Executive Council which they always felt and on which they could always rely.  As yon know, sir, and as every Deputy knows, the civil servant and the member of the Army or the police forces of the State is in a very different position from that of the ordinary citizen.  The Guards are not allowed to vote, although, personally, I believe that is wrong.  The Civil Service and all these other services were not asked whether, if an economic or uneconomic war were started with another country, they were prepared to dole out to the extent of a quarter of a million pounds to meet the cost of the war. The civil servant cannot engage in other occupations.  He cannot do the many things which persons in ordinary civil life can do.  As a result, possibly, of his training and his experience, he proceeds to set out early in life to live in an ordered, regular fashion.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have referred here to the number of commitments that the civil servants undertook in the nature of purchase of houses, insurance and so on, but possibly one of the most important matters, namely, the education of his children, was not referred to.  I think that it is a very serious matter for the civil servant to be faced to-morrow morning with the information that, having planned his budget for the year, he will receive from £50 to £150 less for the next year.  That may be all right for the Minister for Finance who is dealing with national finances and really does not care whether or not his Budget will balance at the end of the year, but the civil servant is in a very different position because creditors and bank managers have an extraordinary habit of insisting on a civil servant paying his debts.  It is very likely true that no body of persons gets less credit, or, <Col N="1983" /> perhaps, I should say, shorter credit, than civil servants, members of the Army, the Guards, and school teachers, all because they are State servants and &ldquo;why should they not be made pay?&rdquo; That should be considered. It is a very important item in this matter when, suddenly, without consultation or agreement, this attack is made on the income of these servants of the State.</P>
    <P>As I said before, very likely in no other country in the world is it so important that there should be a loyal, satisfied Civil Service, military service, police force and educational body than in this country where we are inclined to go so much to the Left or to the Right in the matter of political thought.  The people however Left or Right or red or green they think, should, at least, be unanimous in one matter&mdash;that they would have and should have a really satisfied Civil Service, military service, police force and educational body.  The most serious objection to this Bill is the attack on these four important services in this most serious way.  I take it that the most serious way in which anybody now could be attacked is financially, because, when we want to declare war on England, we do not throw up flags and fire shots, but we declare an economic war.  An economic war has been declared on these four services which have been, and still are, the pillars and foundation of the State, but, in the Bill itself, there is a principle enshrined of a most objectionable character. Each member of these four services is a servant of the State and it would be well if Deputies, electors, farmers and others would, sometimes, realise that there is a difference between servants and slaves.  They are servants of the State, but the State has no right to make them slaves.  If any individual enters into a contract of service, either as an employer or an employee, that person has got the right, under the Constitution and under the laws of this country, to have the contract examined, enforced or qualified by the courts of the land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1984" /> What happens in this Bill?  Section 8 says:</P>
    <P>Every doubt, question, and dispute which shall arise as to whether a person is or is not a person to whom this Part of this Act applies, or as to the amount of the salary for the purposes of this Part of this Act of any person or the amount of the deduction to be made under this Part of this Act from any such salary shall be determined by the Minister whose determination thereof shall be final.</P>
    <P>As I said, the civil servants, members of the Army and the Guards and the teachers are servants of the State. Let us cut their salaries, if you like, but let us not insist on making them slaves of the State.  Why should not the civil servant, the Army officer, corporal, sergeant or other rank, the Guard or the teacher have the right against his employer, namely, the State, which every other employee in this country has&mdash;the right to go to the courts of the land to have determined his claim against his employer? I submit that there never was a more drastic section introduced into any Bill brought before this House.  It makes these officials&mdash;the Civil Service, Army, Guards and teachers&mdash;not servants of the State but slaves of the State.  It is likely a continuance of the policy which has shown itself in other ways but, as I said, I desire to keep from irrelevancies.  I would like, however, to protest, as strongly and as loudly as I can, against that particular section and even the removal of that particular section will not alter the Bill.</P>
    <P>To deal a little further with the section, it sets out that every case of doubt is to be decided by the Minister. The Minister says that the salary of Mr. X, a civil servant, is to be cut by £25.  Mr. X thinks that it should be only £10 and who decides?&mdash;the Minister.  The same set of officials who advise the Minister that the amount of the cut should be so much will again advise the Minister, and the ordinary rights of the citizen, as between employer and employee, are entirely removed from these members <Col N="1985" /> of the State services.  They are being transformed from servants to slaves, not of the State but of Ministers.  If there is any objection or doubt the Minister decides, and his decision and determination, whatever it may be, shall be final.  The desirability that there should be satisfactory servants of the State and that these servants should bend their backs bravely to their jobs is very necessary.  Any possibility of the servants of the State bravely bending their backs to their work is removed by a Bill like this. One would think that a Government composed of a Party that said for years that there were disloyal servants in the State, fighting England's battle, would take a big step to dislodge that theory instead of adding fuel to the flame of discontent which they allege already existed.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters that might be mentioned.  I only refer to general principles and general reasons why this Bill should not be supported. The teachers are a body of people, in this country, who render a very great service to the nation.  I agree that they are a body well paid&mdash;the present Government said they were too well paid.  Some speaker said that an agreement was come to with the previous Government for the acceptance of a reduction, during the period of economic depression.  But what has happened in this instance? The present Government brings in this Bill.  There is to be no separate discussion. Agreement between responsible officials of the Unions and the Government Departments is to come to an end.  A tyranny has taken the place of government.  Servants of the State are to be slaves of the Ministry, in order that an economic war may be waged.  I am not discussing the merits or the demerits, the rights or the wrongs of that economic war.  All I am asking is what is to be the end of all this.  There is to be a saving of a quarter of a million. I ask the Minister seriously to consider the advisability of forcing this Bill.  It will in the end mean no saving.  It will bring discontent to the Civil Service, to the Army, to the Guards, to the teachers, and to their <Col N="1986" /> homes in the cities and the villages throughout the country, and in the end it will not mean a saving of even a quarter of a million.  Especially unfortunate is the actual fact in the Schedule that the Guards are to be cut half-a-crown a week.  It is very little satisfaction to the Guards, and very poor consolation to me, to be able to say that when the election promises were being made by the Party opposite I told them they would be cut.  I said &ldquo;Never mind the promises that are being made&rdquo; but of course, it is little satisfaction now to be able to say to them &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches and, especially those who sit for the County Dublin, what explanation they will give for the promises they made that no Guard whose pay would be from £2 10s. to £2 15s. per week would be reduced by 2/6.  I am glad to see Deputy Breathnach here.  I should like to know what he will say, not to the Guards and the teachers, but to the workers in North Dublin, when these workers are faced by their employers with this consideration: &ldquo;The Government consider it right to reduce the Guards by 2/6 or 5/- a week, and we propose to reduce your wages also.&rdquo; A headline is set to employers for a reduction of wages, a lowering of the standard of living, and not only that but in the outlook of civil servants, and the provision that they might have been able to make for their children.  It is a pressing downwards. Instead of what we were promised, not only a few months ago, but fifteen months ago, that all would be rosy we are now being asked to consider reductions of 8 per cent. plus 4, plus 8½, plus 9, plus 12 per cent., plus 17½, and so on, going on through all these miserable figures, when in reality we were promised something a little short of the Garden of Eden.</P>

It seems to me clearly to indicate a frame of mind which if developed in this country would prove very dangerous.  As the mover of this amendment is a second lieutenant in the Centre Party there <Col N="1987" /> may be some explanation from his point of view and that I assume would fairly well indicate the point of view of his Party or at least that of his leader.  Last year, we had the grand example of the leader of the Farmers' Party showing his generosity by refusing to accept his allowance as a T.D.  That was a generous gift, and one would have thought that it would have been followed by others of his Party.  Apparently his Party to-day are not with him in his notions that this allowance should not be accepted.  Last year, after the leader of the Party gave the example that he did, I did not hear of any of his followers taking any step in that direction.  To-day his entire Party is behind him for a substantial cut.  If we work this to its logical conclusion we can see a very sinister motive in it. We see that a man who last year disposed of his entire allowance might calculate that a situation might arise that made the prospective leadership available only for those who, like himself, could make those gifts voluntarily without any crisis arising. That displays to me a type of imperialistic outlook that is certainly not in keeping with the traditions of this country.  I do not think his gesture will appeal to many of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general trend of opposition to the Bill shows that not alone the Centre Party but, in conjunction with them, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, are completely out of touch with the people.  They have laboured here the question of the necessity for this cut, and they have endeavoured to make political capital out of the fact that the cut is the result of the economic war in which the country is engaged.  They seek to add to the discontented amongst the farming and business community, the civil servants and other servants in the State who are called upon to accept a temporary reduction in their salaries.  Of course, if it were not a consistent policy on the part of the Opposition, and if the country were not already well aware of the attitude all this might be regarded as a very dangerous thing, <Col N="1988" /> but because we have had experience of these tactics for at least twelve months we are not at all astonished.</P>
    <P>Speaking a short time ago, Deputy Belton attributed the necessity for the Bill to the civil war.  Was the claim made that it was the civil war that was responsible for the reduction in teachers' salaries some years ago, and also for the reduction in the pay of the Civic Guards a few years back?  Was the civil war responsible for the reduction in the case of old age pensions six or seven years ago?  Reductions took place for several years back; it was found necessary in the economy of the State to make those reductions. Why is the whole responsibility for these proposed reductions now attributed to the civil war?  Deputies who speak in that strain are not seriously tackling the proposition.  I suggest they are completely out of touch with the people down the country.  I represent a country constituency, and I know perfectly well that the farmers and business people are in complete sympathy with this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no person interfered with by this measure who cannot reasonably afford to make a sacrifice in a time of crisis.  There is no person affected by the proposed reductions whose children will go hungry.  But that is not true of the conditions existing in the case of many families in the country where a salary of £300 represents a condition of opulence that it is very rare to find.  This measure is needed in order to cater for the wants of poor people in the towns and villages throughout the country.  We are making provision for them in the only way in which provision can be made&mdash; by taking it from those who can afford to give without inconvenience to themselves. We are endeavouring under this measure to meet the requirements of many thousands of needy people in the country.</P>
    <P>That is the proposal that the Opposition are opposing here to-night.  They have wasted practically all the day appealing for a class of the community whom they endeavour to hold up as men so sordid that they can only think during every moment of their working hours of the amount of salaries coming <Col N="1989" /> to them.  They suggest that civil servants will become indifferent if this cut is put into operation.  Is that not tantamount to saying that every civil servant has little or no interest in the State, has no human sympathies and only thinks of the amount of salary that he gets?  If that is really the outlook of the civil servants you cannot have from them that generous type of service that can only come when men work not entirely for the consideration of a reward in money but because of an interest in the service they are giving to the community. I suggest that that does not truly depict the Civil Service.  It is wrong to make that charge against civil servants. I know a good many of them, and I am quite satisfied they are good, conscientious people.  Many of them to whom I have spoken have indicated their willingness in this crisis to make this sacrifice, and more if necessary. I repudiate the charge that our Civil Service is made up of men and women who have no souls, no sympathies, and no national outlook.</P>
    <P>All this talk we have heard to-day is mere camouflage.  It is an endeavour to dishearten the people in their struggle.  Almost every Deputy who has spoken has suggested that the solution for all this is to end the economic war.  Of course, this economic war could be ended at any moment if we desired to put up our hands and say to England &ldquo;We are prepared to accept your terms.&rdquo;  We have no mandate for that.  We have a mandate to fight this war to a finish, and we are going to fight it out.  There are people in this country to-day who are shouting: &ldquo;We cannot stand the strain of this economic pressure.  End the war.&rdquo; The people responsible for that are the people who are actually responsible for the existence of the economic war.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a ridiculous one. It is not inspired by anything that one could conceive to be national or honest. It is insincere.  It is without backing. I am very glad to find that the amount of support of a sincere sort behind it is limited to probably a few men in Deputy MacDermot's Party.  Even Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies, hard <Col N="1990" /> cases that they are&mdash;hardened in many respects&mdash;are not so shamefaced and are not such hypocrites as that they would even sponsor the motion.  The Bill is a good Bill, and it is framed in the interests of the people who are most deserving of support in this State.  I am sure the Deputies who support it will receive from the country the reward of people satisfied with work well done.</P>

      <P>This matter has been debated at some length to-day and my contribution to this debate will not be made at any great length.  But I do not wish on this Bill, which I consider to be a Bill of some importance, to content myself with merely a silent vote.  I was very glad to hear a good deal of the speech of Deputy Ben Maguire, who has just sat down.  I was very glad to hear a great deal of what was contained in that speech.  I was very glad to hear the clear and frank admission on his part that the people of this country were suffering, and suffering at the present moment.  I was very glad to hear an admission on his part that in country districts there is very great poverty.  I was glad to hear that because I heard the Minister for Agriculture in this House urging the very opposite and taking the very opposite stand.  I do sincerely hope that Deputy B. Maguire will not cease his efforts with his speech in this House but that he will go to the Executive Council and that he will press upon them the condition to which the small working farmer in this country has already been reduced and the still worse prospect that there is in front of him. I hope that the Deputy will keep hammering at the door of the Executive Council chamber until he manages to get his voice heard by that heretofore deaf body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I turn to the actual proposal made by Deputy Dillon.  The proposal is that there should be a deduction in the allowances made to the members of this House just as there is a taking away from the salaries of other persons.  That appears to me to be a completely logical attitude to take up. I could not, for instance, say with Deputy Maguire: &ldquo;Let everybody else <Col N="1991" /> when there is this economic war going on, when this country is called upon to suffer, let everybody else suffer except the members of the Dáil and Seanad.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would not take up that attitude at all, and if I were going to support this Bill, as most certainly I am not, I would also support Deputy Dillon's motion.  I cannot understand the strange sort of logic which animates the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil when they will vote for the Bill brought in by the Minister for Finance and at the same time vote against Deputy Dillon's motion.  I cannot see their logic.  I would like to hear it explained and I would like to know what the difference is.  If a fulltime officer of the Gárda Síochána whose pay amounts to £360 a year has got to have a reduction in his pay, I do not follow in the slightest the logic which would say that the part-time Deputy in the Dáil is not to have any reduction.  If logic governs&mdash;but of course it does not govern&mdash;those who direct the minds of the Executive Council I do not see how they could have any hesitation in accepting Deputy Dillon's motion.  But unfortunately logic, like a great number of other things, has been flung to the winds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to the Bill itself.  I am going to oppose this Bill, and I am going to oppose the amendment, put forward by Deputy Dillon.  I do not see that the present time, and in the present circumstances bad as the condition of affairs is, you are going to help this condition of affairs by this Bill.  You are going to do positive harm.  There are times, of course, when economy in the shape of reductions may be justified&mdash;always undesirable as it may be, there are times when economy may be justified. If you come to the conclusion that your country is taxed as highly as it can be taxed; and if you are making real economies everywhere, undoubtedly you can then impose reductions in order to avoid imposing new taxation. If that can be done by the cutting <Col N="1992" /> down of salaries, by all means that is right.  But when you are absolutely careless as to whether you have reached the peak point of taxation that the country can bear, it is quite a different thing when you are willing in one year to fling upon the shoulders of the country an extra burden of taxation, when you are willing to collect money and waste it in the fashion it is being wasted now by a spendthrift administration in all directions, that administration has no right to be economical in one direction and in one direction only&mdash;that direction being at the expense of the servants of the State, admirable servants of the State I would add. You can spend in every direction you like.  You do not care how much you increase this tax, that tax and the other tax.  You are regardless of money.  You fling the money which is the State's money, to the wind, you waste it and then you come along and say &ldquo;Oh, yes, we will put on another £4,000,000 or £6,000,000 extra taxation on the country.  That does not matter the slightest bit.&rdquo;  The Government then comes along, and not in any genuine spirit of economy, but simply as a mere political move they say &ldquo;we can be wasteful spendthrifts in every direction but one, and that is, where the money is very well invested and well paid out and from which we get a very admirable return at the present moment.&rdquo;  The State is getting no better return for the money it is spending than it is getting from the money which it is paying to the Civil Service, to the officers and men of the National Army, and, above all things, in my humble judgment, from the money that it pays to the officers and Guards of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I would like very much to know if the representative body of the Gárda Síochána have been consulted about this Bill?  They are entitled to be consulted.  They have a right to be heard before the Executive Council. They have a legal right to have their representations brought before the Executive Council and considered before any alteration in their pay or allowances is made.  I would like very much to know if they have been <Col N="1993" /> asked what their views are; and if the representations made in consequence of their asking&mdash;if there has been such asking&mdash;have been considered? I would like to know what these representations are.  I would like to know if the legal right of the Gárda Síochána to have their representative body consulted before any alteration is made in their rate of pay has been carried out in this case?</P>
    <P>I think this is the worst possible time in which you should attack the pay of the Gárda Síochána.  They have a very difficult task and their task is not being made more easy from day to day.  They are a perfectly magnificent, loyal body, magnificently loyal to the State.  The ex-Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan, paid them the highest tribute for the way in which they saw the General Election conducted.  And, this now is the time in which you come to them and say &ldquo;We are to make these reductions, we will appoint any number of new persons; we will have these new offices, these new posts, and we will fill them up with highly paid persons; we do not care how many new posts we create and how many new jobs we give away; we can be as wasteful and spendthrift in that direction as we like, but you men, tried and trusted men, are men to whom we can say &lsquo;you must bear a reduction&rsquo;.&rdquo;  I do not intend to go through this measure section by section.  It has been very carefully analysed already.  It has been pointed out again and again that it gives the most dictatorial powers to the Minister for Finance, that it makes him an autocrat and that questions that should be decided by an impartial tribunal are going to be partially decided by one person interested in the matter.  I ask the House to reject the Bill as being a thoroughly bad, unsound measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesIvanMcGuire" hpid="Mr. J.I. McGuire Mr. J.I. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.I. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this Bill and the amendment to the Bill.  My reasons for opposing both the Bill and the amendment are similar. My reason for opposing the amendment is, however, slightly dissimilar in one respect from my reason for opposing the Bill.  The amendment comes from <Col N="1994" /> the Centre Party and for that reason, on looking at it for the first time, I was inclined to suspect the soundness of the proposition which that amendment contained. As a matter of fact I suspect that this amendment has nothing whatever to do with economy.  The amendment comes in reality I suppose from two Deputies of the Centre Party who would, I am inclined to think, not alone forgo £360 a year for attending in this House, but who would gladly pay £1,000 to come here and take up this political hobby of speech-making in the House, because it is in that light, I think, that the business of the House is looked upon by the Deputies in the Centre Party to whom I have referred. It is nothing more than a pastime to these Deputies.  A pittance of £360 a year is nothing to the plutocratic front ranks of the Centre Party.  My reason for opposing the Bill is, in general, that I am opposed to cuts in any branch of life in this State.  Cuts in general should on principle be opposed.  In this case there is no doubt whatever that the cuts are necessary.  The condition of this country has been brought so low by the policy of the Government that the cuts are absolutely necessary. The Exchequer is empty and the Government is looking around exploring every source from which revenue can be derived.  But that seems to me to be no reason why I, at least, should lend my support to the Government in putting through this Bill.  In other words, why should any Deputy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party register a vote which would help the Government to get out of a difficulty into which they walked with their eyes wide open?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle which underlies the Bill, we are told by the Minister for Finance, is the principle of economy. There would have been no necessity for this particular type of economy if the Executive Council had not lost a trade which was worth £30,000,000 a year to this country.  If that trade were at present operating in this country as it should be operating, if it were operating 100 per cent., this Bill would never have come before the House.  For that reason, I refuse by my vote to do anything which would help to take the present Government <Col N="1995" /> out of a quandary into which they walked with their eyes wide open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The task of the Minister for Finance in any country is not a pleasant one at present.  At no time, in fact, is the task of the Minister for Finance a pleasant one.  And yet, listening to some Deputies to-day, one would imagine that the Minister for Finance had gone out with his heart in his work, striving to lower the standard of living everywhere throughout the country.  I had hoped for once&mdash;and during the time it was possible for me to be in the House my hope was not realised&mdash;that there would be some attempt made in dealing with this Bill to analyse the general position and to show how, other than by a measure of this sort, we could at present equalise the burden we must all admit is pressing heavily upon the producing part of this community, and upon the community as a whole. Deputy Norton spoke about wage-slashing. I was in the House during a part of his speech, at any rate, and I do not think the Deputy made good that charge that there was wage-slashing. I heard from the other side of the House that we were running away from our election pledges and promises.  Anybody who looks at the Bill will see that it is scrupulously constructed with the idea of trying, as far as it is at all possible, to carry out those pledges in the same spirit as we have attempted to carry out every other pledge that we gave to the people before the elections.  A statement which I made at Rathmines&mdash; I am not quite certain whether I made it in reply to a question asked in the hall, but I think I did&mdash;was to the effect that the general policy of our Party, if we were returned to power would not be to seek economies on the lines on which our predecessors had sought them, namely, by a reduction in the social services, cutting the old age pensioners, and then seeking substantial sums by cutting the lower grades of the Civil Service.  I said that if we were returned to power our policy would be to seek reductions in the ranks that could best afford to stand these reductions.  I spoke of the <Col N="1996" /> higher salaries and, when asked to mention a figure, said that to my mind salaries below £300 or £400 were such that every penny of them was needed, and every penny of them was spent in the support of families, and in the purchase of the necessaries of life.  If anybody cares to look through the Bill and study it, he will find that we have kept to that promise.  No civil servant whose salary is under £300 has been touched by our cut, and I think that most of you will admit that £300 now has a greater purchasing capacity than it had when I made that promise.  I have kept within the letter of the promise, and I have kept within the spirit of it.  The Executive Council has kept within the spirit of it as far as they possibly could, taking into account all the facts of the situation.  The scheme therefore running through the Bill is that civil servants' salaries of £300 and under are not to suffer any cut, because, as the Minister for Finance has pointed out, there was an automatic cut which operated from the beginning of this year.  That cut resulted in an automatic reduction of those salaries.  I think every Deputy here will admit that in cases of this sort we have to deal equitably with all branches of the public service.  If a civil servant under £300 can show that he has suffered an automatic cut, due to the bonus system, since 1st January&mdash; and a civil servant whose salary is over £300 has that added to the proposed existing cut&mdash;and that he has suffered since 1st January of the present year as compared with his previous remuneration a cut of £70 or £80, he will undoubtedly feel that other public servants should, if they are to be dealt with on the same basis as himself, suffer a similar cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a proposed cut in the Guards.  We tried to discriminate, and not impose any cut on the married Guard.  The reason for this in the case of the Guards was that there was a definite understanding that if the cost of living figure fell below a certain margin the rates that were being paid at the time were not to be regarded as fixed.  We felt that it would be unfair if the cuts that were being imposed in fact on the Civil Service were not similarly imposed on the other <Col N="1997" /> branches of the public service.  In the case of the teachers&mdash;it is not necessary for me to deal with it in full&mdash; there is another factor which operates. The Minister for Finance may postpone dealing with it until we come to deal with the particular schedule in the Bill.  The truth is that we spent a very considerable time in trying to work out conscientiously the policy of not cutting the lower salaries, and of imposing an equal reduction in all the services.  When you come to examine the scheme in detail on the Committee Stage of the Bill you will be able to see how closely that has been worked out.  The Minister for Finance to-day gave you certain figures and certain stages in the scale, pointing out how it worked.  I think it is an unfair charge to say with respect to the cuts proposed in this Bill that we have ignored our election promises.  Deputy Norton says that this is not the way to deal with the economic situation. It is surely not suggested that this Bill is proposed as a Bill to deal with the economic situation as a whole?  The only way in which it touches the general economic situation is this, that there has been a reduction already of purchasing power in the community; it is a question not of reducing it further, but of equalising the burden of that reduction.  We are here imposing on the servants of the State certain reductions, because we believe that&mdash;when we compare the position of the primary producer to-day with his position some years ago&mdash;the reduction which the servants of the State will suffer in their salaries does not at all put them in a relatively worse position in relation to the primary producer than they were in some years ago.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by Deputies on the opposite benches&mdash;a most unfair suggestion&mdash;that this Bill has been prompted by some sort of animus against the servants of the State. There is no truth whatever in that suggestion.  It is suggested that there is uneasiness and insecurity in the ranks of the public servants.  I think that&mdash;in a year at the beginning of which there was perhaps a greater change than you could point to in any democratic assembly; a greater <Col N="1998" /> change, when you have regard to all the circumstances, than you would possibly be able to point to in history &mdash;the servants of the State have been dealt with fairly by the present Government.  One of the Deputies went out of his way to drag in a case which has been in the courts recently. What was the Executive Council to do?  Was the Government to stand by and see State files and secret documents handed out, even if it was for the purpose of writing a book?  What right had any State servant to give out secret documents?  Were we to sit idly by and allow it to be thought in the service that State servants could deal in that manner with confidential documents?  There were two matters concerned.  On the one hand there was a breach of Statute; that was tried in the courts.  There was also a question of breach of regulations; that is a matter of discipline.  Our attitude towards the Civil Service has been one of full recognition of their worth, but we are determined that there will be discipline.  No servant who does his work honourably and loyally has anything to fear from this Executive Council, but we are not going to stand for indiscipline anywhere. If that is to be taken as indicative of any unfair attitude towards the Civil Service I want to know what is the proper attitude.  There would have been those cuts in salaries&mdash;and on a very different system, I contend&mdash; if the previous Government were in office.  The amount that is coming into the Treasury is no insignificant amount, and we hold that that sum is coming into the Treasury in the best way, and from the section which at the moment can best bear it.  I have had experience during a year now of the work that is done by the higher servants of the State.  I know how devoted they are to their work, and what long hours they spend at it, but I do want to say that if they do hard work and spend long hours at it, so also do the members of the Executive Council.  I think it is most unfair to suggest that what Ministers do is lock up their offices at 5 o'clock, go away with easy minds, and leave all the business and all the worry to the permanent officials.  There is no truth what <Col N="1999" /> ever in that, and the members on the opposite benches know there is no truth in it.  The ultimate responsibility for decisions, and the ultimate responsibility for seeing that the work is done in his Department, rests with the Minister, and whilst it is true that he alone&mdash;any more than any man at the head of any organisation&mdash;could not do that work unless he had loyal and faithful assistants, it is, at the same time, true that it is not the assistants who do all the work.</P>
    <P>It is the Ministers who have the final responsibility.  They cannot divest themselves of it.  Our experience has been that Ministers are certainly loyally and faithfully helped, and that every assistance which it is reasonable to expect from the permanent officials with whom they come in contact is given to them.  I think it was Deputy Mulcahy who suggested that it was only the Minister for Finance who would be hard-hearted enough to stand up here and defend this Bill: that other members of the Executive Council had such experience of the chief civil servants who are working with them that they would not have the heart, so to speak, to stand up here and propose cuts in the salaries of those individual servants. I think it is true to say that the Minister for Finance is served as loyally in his Department as any other Minister and it can be no harder on any of us to propose a cut in the salaries of these officials whose work we know than it is on the Minister himself. I can say more, that the Minister for Finance has been the stoutest defender, when these matters were discussed in detail, of the branches of the service that he is legally the head of. Therefore, I think it is most unfair to suggest that his attitude towards the Civil Service is different from that of any other member of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>As I said this morning, I do not think there is much in the general principle if we keep really to the Bill and do not wander off to the civil war or to the present economic war.  If we were to take these debates up <Col N="2000" /> again we could spend a considerable time at them.  If we wanted to we could point out that while people talk of the loss the community is suffering at the present time, these same people did not talk of the loss to the country when it was paying out millions per annum, paid too by this same community. When the members on the opposite benches talk about cuts imposed they did not hesitate to impose more drastic cuts on a section of the community which was less able to afford it than the section which we are now proposing to cut.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment, I think I can understand why it was proposed&mdash;from the point of view of putting the members of this House, if you like, in a moral position to impose cuts on others by accepting cuts themselves. Most of us, I think, will appreciate that there is something in that point of view.  I do, at any rate.  But when we come down and deal with it as a practical proposition we must remember that this matter has been dealt with in this House on several occasions already, when it was pointed out that this was the smallest sum&mdash;in fact that it was inadequate&mdash;which could be fixed.  From such examination as I have made myself of the allowance, I think that better public service could be rendered by the Deputies if they had an increased allowance.  If we were dealing with anything like normal conditions I would say that the allowance, considering the work that is expected from a Deputy, was not sufficient to enable him to do that work properly.  I think it was the Lord Mayor of Dublin who interjected a remark the point of which should be obvious.  He asked about the two homes that Deputies who come up from the country have to keep, and of the double expense. There is also a question of principle: that it should be possible for a Deputy to come here, to give up whatever business he has and to devote his whole time to his public work.  It is not fair to say that a Deputy should be paid only for the time he is actually sitting here in the House.</P>

      <P>That is not right, because if he is to do his work it means a good deal more than attending here when the Dáil is sitting.  To be fair and to get good service you must make a sum available which will enable the representative of any section of the community to give his whole time&mdash;if he is to do it well&mdash;to the work to be done here.  I think this allowance was fixed on, first of all, by a Joint Committee in 1922.  Later, in 1923, there was a further examination of it, and again in 1927.  In 1930, when Deputy Thrift made a proposal for the reduction of the allowance to Senators, there was a further examination. Reports were submitted to the House on the results of these examinations. After the most thorough examination it was found that the sum which was made available in allowances for the Deputies and Senators was not unreasonable at any rate, and any suggestion that was made for a reduction was rejected.  That being so, why should the Government take upon itself, having had recent decisions on the matter, to reduce these allowances which all of us, from experience, believe are certainly not excessive but rather inadequate?</P>

      <P>With regard to reductions in the Oireachtas, I have always taken the point of view that the best way to get economies in the Oireachtas was to reduce the numbers to a reasonable amount. When in Opposition I suggested that about 120 members would give adequate representation in the Dáil.  I saw there was no chance of a reduction in the other direction and suggested, therefore, that the reduction should be by numbers.  In the case of the Seanad our view again is that if a representative of the people is to do his work and be available at all times, you cannot fix his remuneration by the length of time he is occupied in the Seanad.  I am not going to pretend that the Senators do as much work as the members of the Dáil, not for one moment.  Again, there is a minimum amount which would enable a representative <Col N="2002" /> of the people to give up his work, if necessary, and to devote himself to representing and working for the public interest.  There is a certain minimum sum, and I for one would hesitate to cut that below the figure which I believe to be needful in the case of Deputies.  I would hesitate to cut it down for anybody unless we were going by that fact to be prepared to see the representation fall into the hands of people who, out of their own private means, could take on the task of public representation.</P>

    <P>With regard to the Seanad I have always held that, if we did have a second House here, we could reduce the number practically to one-half the number of the present House. During the elections, I indicated that it was our intention to abolish the Seanad as at present constituted.  The question of whether or not we should have a second Chamber at all, to my mind, rests on this: whether a suitable second Chamber can be devised, a second Chamber that will have really valuable functions.  I have an open mind on that matter myself.  I have sought for solutions in various directions, and I have to confess that up to the present time I have not been able to get any form of second House that would warrant its being there, and warrant the expense that would be involved.  If, however, we are able, within the course of a year or so, to devise a Constitution for a second Legislative Chamber which would warrant our proposing it instead of the present one, then, we may, instead of bringing in a Bill to abolish completely the second House, propose to bring in a Bill to establish such a second House with a constitution of the character which I have indicated, namely, which would give it some really useful functions.  That being the position with regard to the Seanad, and it being our intention anyhow to bring in a Bill very soon to avoid the filling of about 20 vacancies which are due to come about, I think, next year or so&mdash;with that in mind, and also with the idea that there was a certain minimum limit beyond which we could not go, we felt we would not be justified in bringing in either the members of <Col N="2003" /> the Dáil or members of the Seanad under this Bill.  However, I think the attitude of the Executive Council can be stated to be this&mdash;that if private members here in the Dáil bring forward a resolution or an amendment, when this Bill comes for the reduction of these amounts, we, as a Government, anyhow, will not oppose it.  We will leave it here open to the private members to bring forward if they wish to put themselves in the position of which Deputy MacDermot speaks, that is, in the position of not appearing to cut others without suffering a cut themselves.  We are prepared to consider such a proposal.  We have no closed mind, at any rate, with regard to such a proposal.  Personally, if it were an open vote, I would oppose it on the grounds I have indicated. But, for one, I can understand the attitude of mind which, possibly, could reasonably prompt such a proposal.</P>
    <P>As I have said then, with regard to this Bill as a whole, we feel that the Exchequer needs this sum of money. We cannot have our social services; we cannot expand in the directions in which we need to expand unless we have money.  We must economise where we can in order to expand.  We are engaged deliberately in a process of expansion in certain directions, and we know that we cannot expand in these directions without employing further servants of the State.  But we are anxious to see that no servant of the State will get a greater salary than the community can afford.  We are anxious to see a certain levelling or equalising of the burdens if you wish. This money is necessary.  The Minister for Finance finds it necessary.  It has to come from somewhere.  We are not going to save by restricting our social services.  We cannot produce it that way.  The question of increasing the burdens on the taxpayer is one on which everybody, who knows the effect that would have on further production and further employment, must hesitate. I put it to those Deputies who are inclined to disagree with this policy that, if they were in our position and had the task which the <Col N="2004" /> Minister for Finance has at the moment and had to find the money, the way we propose to find it is a better way than any that has been put forward in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Executive Council need excuse itself in regard to this Bill.  I have said that it is not intended to depress wages and I do not think that it will have that effect. It is not intended to depress the standard of living all round.  It is intended to try to equalise the burdens which every section of the community must be prepared to bear if we are to deal properly with the present situation.  If I would not be going too far, perhaps, outside the proper scope of a speech on this occasion, I should like to say that the present situation is a really serious one.  It is recognised as being serious in other countries.  It is particularly serious in our country from the point of view that so much of our production is from agriculture.  We have unemployed in the streets.  We have a duty to those unemployed.  We have got to try to perform that duty by getting work for them.</P>
    <P>I had a letter a short time ago from a friend who is a professional man and who was in receipt of a fixed salary of about £900 a year.  He complained of the income-tax.  He said that he was trying to rear a fairly large family, that he was now of a fairly matured or advanced age&mdash;50 or 60 years of age or over&mdash;that he could not afford a motor car, that he was not able to take any holidays.  The only way he took any recreation was by working in his garden.  He went on to say that in the past he had supported our Party but that he was doubtful, seeing the burden which was imposed on him by income-tax, if he could support us any longer.</P>
    <P>I replied telling him that we were very sorry we had to tax earned incomes, that we were very sorry he could not have more out of life, more of the enjoyments, and more holidays than he appeared to be able to have.  I told him also that there were people in the streets who have not got their daily bread.  What about them?  There are people whose homes are cheerless, who have not got fires.  There are families living in single rooms for <Col N="2005" /> which they are paying exorbitant rents, and in which the ordinary decencies of life cannot be observed. I also said to him: &ldquo;Do you not think their cases much harder than yours, and that the Government is justified in taking from you something which is not absolutely essential for you, but which is absolutely essential for them?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the policy behind the whole of our administration.  It is a difficult task.  We have never made light of it.  We believe that we are making headway with that policy.  We believe that there would be a substantial reduction of unemployment to-day, if we had circumstances such as there were in the past, when the unemployment difficulty was relieved by emigration. Remember that we have now every year to provide for some 20,000 or 30,000 young people who are coming into employment.  We relieve unemployment, so to speak, at one end of the scale, and make headway with it, but the problem is increased at the other end.  Any reasonable Deputy who takes the position as a whole, if he wants to be fair, must put himself in the position of the Executive Council and of the Minister for Finance, who has got to make ends meet, and who has to consider where the necessary moneys which he deems absolutely necessary for certain services can be got, by imposing the least possible hardship.  That is the spirit in which this measure is conceived.  The idea is to get the necessary moneys from a section of the community with the least possible hardship.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies on this side have been just as generous in their praise of the work being done by public servants as Deputies on the opposite side.  It is a fact which civil servants themselves must recognise, that the purchasing power of their salaries is greater to-day than it was some years ago, and that they can afford at the present time, better than other sections of the community, to bear this part of the burden.  No matter what may be said by others, I believe that there was a very proper idea behind the Deputy's amendment.  At least, I think we ought to try to look for the <Col N="2006" /> best interpretation of what we find. Just as there was in my opinion a proper idea behind that, namely, that we should not be imposing upon others cuts that we do not impose upon ourselves, so I think that public servants who are paid by the producing part of the community ought not to be unwilling to bear a part of the burden which, willy nilly, the producing portion of the community are forced to bear in present conditions.  The cuts are for one year only.  The intention of the Minister was to show that we did not, in principle, regard the sums paid as in themselves extravagant, but that in present conditions, and in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, it was the duty of a section to bear that part.  If we want to succeed and improve the standard of the community as a whole, we must be prepared to bear this burden.  If we are to solve unemployment and other social problems we must be prepared to bear even greater burdens than these.  If we do not, then we are going to have the position that certain sections of the community are to be, so to speak, outlawed; that they are not going to be allowed to exercise the God-given right to live.  I hold that they have a right to live.  I think it is necessary for the community as a whole to bear such a burden as will enable these people to be given the opportunity of living.</P>
    <P>It is a big question.  There is a big question of organisation behind it.  I am not one of those who believe that it can be done by some sudden change in monetary policy.  To my mind, there is a big question of organisation. You want the will on the part of the community as a whole, the part of the community that have to share with those who have not; in other words, to share the burden in order that those who have not may be enabled to live.  In the first place, you want that will.  After you have got that will then, in the second place, you want organisation of the community, so that the exchange of services between one section and another may be effected.  It is fundamentally a question of organisation, and the attitude on the part of those who have <Col N="2007" /> in the community to part with a share of what is theirs, in order that those who have not may be enabled to live. Without these two things, I do not think there is any way of solving the problem.  In this instance we are asking the public servants to do their part, just as when we tax income we ask the people to do their part.  We are asking the public servants to do their part now.  I, for one, believe they will.  I believe that all the efforts that have been made on the opposite benches to urge them into unrest will be in vain.  I do not think the higher members of the Civil Service have not the intelligence to realise that Bills like this are necessary, and that the sacrifices they are asked to bear are the type of sacrifices that every other section of the community will be compelled to bear if we are really going to solve this problem of unemployment. At any rate, we intend to do our best.  We are prepared to be judged, even by this measure, in the direction in which we are going.  We deny, as has been suggested, that this is a retrograde measure.  We deny that we are departing from the path we have laid out for ourselves, or that we indicated to the electors we would take.  We hold that this Bill is strictly in consonance with the whole idea, and the whole philosophy behind our policy, and it it as such that I support the Minister for Finance in asking the House to accept it.</P>

      <P>This House is at the moment discussing an amendment in the name of Deputy Dillon in relation to the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill, 1933:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill, 1933, until provision is included therein for the reduction of allowances payable to Deputies and Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak on that amendment under the disadvantage of not having heard what case was made for it by the mover. I want to state here, irrespective of what case was made about it in this House, that when I first saw it I placed it in mind in the envelope of statements <Col N="2008" /> made by Deputy MacDermot, and more recently by Deputy Dillon, throughout the country.  It may be that these statements have not been fully given, but as given they conveyed to me this idea, that one of these Deputies always, and the second Deputy more recently, held the opinion that the salaries or allowances paid to members of the House are more than adequate for the services rendered.  May I say this with all respect to the Deputies, that if that were the idea coming from both, but more particularly from Deputy MacDermot, it would have to be criticised as not being merely snobbery but the height of vulgarity, because be it for good or ill, Deputy MacDermot has certainly appeared before this country as a man in the enjoyment of certain wealth.  I have got to stress that, because if such an amendment as this, to reduce the salaries of Deputies, had come from a person who was notably the other way, then I think the same odium would not attach to that particular amendment.  It may be that is a wrong interpretation of this amendment. I hope it is.</P>
    <P>Secondly, if the amendment means&mdash; I have been trying to discover for myself what it does mean &mdash; that although these two Deputies do not believe that the salaries paid to members are more than adequate for the duties they fulfil, nevertheless they think that they should be cut and that after these cuts are made, the cuts in the salaries of members of the Civil Service should follow, then I am totally in disagreement and will oppose the amendment as I oppose the Bill. It may mean that the Deputy had these things in mind, or that he felt that before people in this House could talk with a clear conscience about cuts for others they would have to arrange for cuts for Deputies.  There is something to be said for that.  There is no doubt, as standing on the Order Paper, the amendment is subject to either of the misconceptions to which I have referred, and at any rate, it does convey conditional assent to the cutting of salaries on the case made here to-day.</P>
    <P>What is the case made here to-day? Before I leave that, because of the <Col N="2009" /> misconceptions that may arise in regard to the amendment, because of the fact that I do not want to approve of what has been said in regard to cuts of salaries at all, even if the third explanation be correct.</P>

      <P>As reported.  We have got to take what is reported.  The President said to-night with regard to this measure that the Bill has been scrupulously drawn to carry out the promises made with regard to public service.  I want to found anything I have got to say on that, that the Bill has been scrupulously drawn with regard to the promises made.  What is it really?  The old cliché is the best to describe it, the butchering of the public services to make a Roman holiday.  It is distinctly that.  There was the old Roman idea of bread and the games.  The modern equivalent is seized upon by the acute political mind of the President&mdash;free milk and a round with England.  But who is suffering from the round with England?  At any rate, the Romans had that saving grace, that the games were the subject of edification to the mob and lulled them over their disappointment.  At the moment the arena is packed with people who are suffering, who have been thrown to the lions, and the President displays very much the same amazement when even people in the front line trenches turn to him and <Col N="2010" /> complain, as the Emperor Nero might have shown if the people intended for the lions complained that they could not sleep because of the roaring of the lions nearby in the arena.  This is butchering the public services for political purposes.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Scrupulously upholding all our promises,&rdquo; says the President.  I am going again to recount some of these. The President to-night went over a lot of ground and there is hardly a point he touched upon that I did not find in some cutting of a newspaper, containing a speech of some member of his Party, as if they foresaw all the excuses that might be made on an occasion like this and had previously countered them.  Emigration was dealt with.  Deputy Boland, now a Minister, was going to reduce the Army and the Civic Guard to such a point that while they could be given other means of employment, money was to be saved and the tide of emigration was to be stopped.  Yet that is one of the excuses the President makes to-night.  Apparently his Minister has succeeded in stopping the tide of emigration.  I wonder is that the case, that he has got to deal with these large numbers now in this country?  Let us take these promises as being meant in the old days.  I do not think it is fair or proper for the political future of this country that these promises should be cynically thrown aside and laughed at now.  Very distinct promises were made and there are some of the promises which would help Deputy Dillon's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One personal point has been introduced here to-night.  I am glad it was introduced to get the matter cleared up.  It is in relation to members of the late Executive Council and the present Government and the difference between the emoluments that both groups enjoy.  There seems to be a certain amount of passion aroused by a statement of literal truth, that certain accommodation in the way of motor cars now provided is provided distinctly as a perquisite of office, when previously it was not.  Why be angry when that is said?  There was considerable anger in the House to-night when that was said.  I personally <Col N="2011" /> never had a motor car supplied to me at the public expense until after the murder of Kevin O'Higgins and it was then forced on me.  I objected that I thought I was in no danger and that I did not require this car.  It seemed to me to be judicrous that when I went round the country in my own motor car I should be followed at the public expense by the guard that was put on me.  I pointed that out but those who were responsible for the preservation of order in the country insisted and so the guard came on. May I say that since I have left office I have been subjected to an in-and-out treatment that I do not think capable of explanation?  The same guard was left with me for some period and then I was asked did I think it should be removed, as if I were responsible or had the information to make the decision and then it was removed.  Then I had a policeman put to guard me.  A fortnight later I had two policemen put to guard me and about three weeks later I had a third policeman put on.  A little later I was asked never to travel in my own car or the car of anybody else unless I took two of these people with me.  Then, round about the time of the dissolution, I was given a car again.  I think it was a police car for the first two or three days and then I was given a military car and the old military guard.  About a week after the election was over I was returned again to my lonely policeman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I have seen recently of the people in charge of that branch of the Service, I should not rely too much upon their judgment as to whether that change is necessary or is a proper one to make. But let us face the fact that in the old days&mdash;between 1923 and 1924, which was the period of my first experience of Government&mdash;and up to the murder of Kevin O'Higgins, there was no car as a perquisite of office.  It was never <Col N="2012" /> so regarded.  It is now so regarded and if it is an addition to the salaries which the Ministers thought fit to grant themselves, I do not regard it as too much to give them.  But I do not think it should be camouflaged.  The President has said, with regard to the Civil Service salaries, that the purchasing power of the civil servant is now greater than it used to be.  And he is scrupulously honest with regard to his promises.  What was the promise with regard to those who were to be at the head of the State?  A thousand pounds a year salary.  There was no question of freedom from income tax, but let that pass.  How about that £1,000 and its purchasing power in the days when it was talked of as the highest salary of which those at the head of the State were worthy.  Has it increased? Deputy Dillon has his point there. Has the £360 which members get as an allowance increased in purchasing power?  If the argument of increased purchasing power is applicable to the civil servant, why is it not applicable to all the members of this House, whether members of the Government or not?</P>

Deputy Lemass, as he was then, speaking at Dundalk, in 1927, said: &ldquo;No person in the State would receive more than £1,000 a year.&rdquo;  Have the Government recently given salaries of more than £1,000 a year?  He said: &ldquo;They might give that £1,000 to the President, if he would take it, on account of the dignity of his office.&rdquo;  Why the change?  The President said in 1926&mdash;and this is a point for Deputy Dillon, again: &ldquo;£300 should be sufficient for a public representative.  That amount would enable him to bring up his children in Dublin in a proper manner.&rdquo;  That meant what £300 of purchasing power amounted to in 1926.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said that we would not need to reduce our salaries; economies were to be possible in other ways.  &ldquo;Substantial economies are possible.&rdquo;  This was a serious promise set out in a manifesto&mdash;&ldquo;Fianna Fáil is satisfied that substantial economies are possible without reducing social services, inflicting hardship on any class of Government servants or impairing in the slightest degree the efficiency of the administrative machine.&rdquo;  There followed then the famous comment&mdash;or, at least, the comment I hope I have made famous by repetition&mdash;that having examined with precise care the Estimates, they were convinced that a saving of not less than two million pounds was possible.  Does the President think that anybody reading that sentence when it was placarded around the country in 1932 would have thought that the phrase about substantial economies being possible without inflicting hardship on any class of Government servants meant this Bill? Is there a quibble&mdash;that, of course, the civil servants and the other people mentioned can suffer these cuts without incurring hardship?  Would the President have written in those days, if he had been asked to be quite honest and frank in the matter, &ldquo;Fianna Fáil is satisfied we can impose cuts of the type mentioned here and they will not inflict hardship on the services mentioned.&rdquo;  He might have wanted to do that, but his propagandists would not have allowed him in those days.  That was the promise and it is not to be laughed at.  That is one of the considerations on account of which the Government holds office.  We were to be brought into a promised land where wasteful administration was to be cut off.  A great deal was made of the &ldquo;wasteful administration.&rdquo; It was all summed up in that statement that not less than two million a year could be saved.  That other phrase I alluded to was put in because the President knew well that his campaign of a previous period about salaries was going to lead to the conclusion in certain minds that cuts were intended, cuts in the Civil Service and in the services of the local <Col N="2014" /> authorities.  The phrase I mentioned was put in to prevent that idea spreading and it succeeded.  There were specific means pointed out for economies.  At Galway, the President said that &ldquo;the police forces in the country, which cost one and a half million pounds, could be decreased by one-half.&rdquo;  It costs at this moment £1,600,000 and this is the second year of the administration.  At that time, it could be reduced by one-half.  That was part of the way people were fooled.  Deputy Cooney was even more precise.  He said that &ldquo;their administrative programme included a saving of two million pounds on the Army.&rdquo; I do not think that the Army cost that amount in those days, but let that pass. &ldquo;The £500,000 saving on the Civic Guard, with other savings that could be effected on overpaid Departments, would be put into productive industries. They came to the conclusion that they could solve the unemployment problem in 12 months.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It was 12 at that time.  The &ldquo;ante&rdquo; was raised later and they had to reduce it. Speaking at Rathmines, in May, 1932, the President said that they were not going to start on the lower salaries.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With regard to the salaries between £300 and £400 I hold that those in receipt of them are getting nothing excessive.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then, we have this leading article in the <i>Independent</i> of May 28th.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The immunity was promised not merely to the lower grades, but to the middle grades of the Civil Service.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We do not,&rdquo; said the President, &ldquo;propose to seek economies by restricting the social services or cutting the salaries of the middle or lower grades of the Civil Service.&rdquo;  Yet, we are told to-night that this Bill is scrupulously drawn with regard to these promises.  There are other things that we were promised&mdash;increases in the social services.  There was going to be a revision of the unemployment and national health insurance schemes so that the full benefits would go to <Col N="2015" /> those insured&mdash;the workers&mdash;but they are now cast aside in favour of cuts.</P>
    <P>The President has paid a tribute to-night to these civil servants whose salaries he proposes to cut, amongst others.  He pays that tribute to them in a peculiar way.  &ldquo;They are certainly hard working,&rdquo; and, then, as if anybody had commented on it in any serious way, he adds: &ldquo;So do the Executive Council,&rdquo; and, then, we are told that the Executive Council do not lock up at six o'clock and go away with easy minds and come back at a certain hour in the morning.  &ldquo;The Ministers have the final responsibility&rdquo;&mdash;that was the case in our time.  It was definitely the case in our time.  The President well knows that members of his Front Bench and of his back benches went about the country declaiming that Ministers were living on the fat of the land and not working. Now, the situation is changed. They work, while he admits the Civil Service do also.  Then he says: &ldquo;This is only for a year.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance has emphasised that the cuts proposed are only for a year in respect of salaries earned and paid in the coming financial year, but he did not say that, if the financial position did not improve, it would not be imperative to deal with these salaries in another year.  The President, at the end thinks that &ldquo;despite the attempts made&rdquo;&mdash;I suppose from these quarters&mdash;&ldquo;to cause discontent, the Civil Service will do their part,&rdquo; the Minister for Finance, in introducing this Bill, to-day, said that the proposal to reduce salaries had been referred to in the Budget statement last year.  How? There was going to be an endeavour to get, by agreement during the year, certain cuts.  Then, he said that he found this year it had not been possible to get that agreement, and hence these cuts were being imposed, and the President is optimistic that the Civil Service are going to bear these cuts with equanimity.  His Finance Minister told him last year that he would try to get agreement about these cuts and confesses this year that he failed to get them.</P>
    <P>What was the President's optimism <Col N="2016" /> based upon?  They felt that the Civil Service would realise that their salaries could not continue when the country was in an impoverished state, and I think that was a good analysis of the Civil Service mind.  We certainly felt in our time that it was being borne in on the Civil Service that, if a certain depression went on, they could not continue at a particular rate.  I wonder why has the change occurred?  Surely it is the same change of feeling that is in most people of the country who are suffering&mdash;that they do not believe that the suffering is necessary; that they are not convinced of the justice of the treatment that is being meted out to them and that they can see no hope, that after these imposed sacrifices have been made, there is any better prospect a year, three years or five years hence than there is now.</P>
    <P>Civil servants are like most other people in this community.  They do not deny what the President, in one of his attempts to cloud the position to-night, referred to as &ldquo;the God-given right of the people of this country to live.&rdquo;  Civil servants, in the main, spring from the small farming community in this country and they know as well as the President what the economic situation of that class of the community is and they know what they are suffering at the moment.  Most of them have, near and around, in their family circle or their circle of relations, people who sometimes feel that the God-given right to live is being denied to them, and they are as easily able to be touched by that phrase as anybody else, but they are not going to be touched by that phrase as used by the President because they feel that whatever was the God-given right to live in this country, it has been somewhat jeopardised by the policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The economic war is not an issue,&rdquo; the President said, to-night.  It is at the root of this Bill.  We are going to save how much?  Last year, it was said to be £250,000 and this year, because the scope has been somewhat widened, it is said to bring in a maximum of £280,000.  It has been pointed out that that is only the equivalent of the loss <Col N="2017" /> of one week from the present economic war.  Rate, with as much importance as can possibly be given to it, the world-wide depression and add to it the 20 per cent., 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. the folly with England has caused us, and you will get from that 20 per cent., 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. more than the £280,000 that this slaughtering of the public services is going to get you. I had thought that we were faced with a very bright prospect once the Government came into power and got their economic policy on foot.  I have alluded to what the then Deputy Boland had said in relation to emigration. Does the President not remember Deputy Lemass's, as he then was, forecast of what was going to follow from their economic policy?  There would not be enough idle hands in the country to do all the work that was to be done.  We would have to call back some of those emigrating; not merely would we stop the tide from flowing out, but we would have to call back some of those who had gone out.  The President, not to be outdone by that statement, responded with a statement that the country could support seventeen millions of people.</P>
    <P>We have had a year of this policy in regard to unemployment.  The President, on one occasion, stung by a certain comparison that was made with the unemployment that was elsewhere, said that it was forgotten by the people, who, as he said, made propagandist use of depression in other countries, that this country had in its hands a remedy against unemployment that no other country had, and we presume the remedy has been found and that we are getting the full benefits of it.  We have this declaration&mdash;it is ludicrous to bring it into a debate of a serious nature&mdash;but it was promised; it was dangled before the eyes of the people and it was what misled certain people.  It was part of the consideration for holding office:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Protection of industries means more money in Ireland.  Money in Ireland means more employment. Employment means more buyers. Buyers mean more buying of Irish goods.  Buying Irish goods means <Col N="2018" /> more money in Ireland.  More and more and more money&mdash;why should it ever stop?</P>
    <P>We have had a year of that rolling around of money in this country, and we have had the full benefit of the retention in this country of the moneys that used to go to England, and we have had our protection policy going, and we have had bounties for the main agricultural industry and, at the end of it all, we hoist the white flag&mdash;cuts.</P>
    <P>Cuts!  And over what a range do the cuts extend!  Everybody has got to feel what sacrifice means, but I think most people would agree to the sacrifice if they could see what was the end of the sacrifice.  If there were people who were being denied the God-given right to live, and who are now being denied in increasing numbers that God-given right to live, surely common honesty demands that instead of continuing the impoverishment and spreading it more widely, there should be a halt to get the plan exposed which is in operation, but which nobody seems to know anything about &mdash;the plan which is guiding the fortunes of this country, the plan which is going to give us happiness some years ahead.  If that could be proved, and if it could be shown that after some years of sacrifice there was a prospect of better times, this country would do willingly what people like the Russians are being forced to do under stern necessity and compulsion.</P>
    <P>The reason why there is aggravation over these cuts and over the suffering that is being caused is because nobody believes that there is a principle at the back of the whole thing; nobody believes that there is any thought-out, deliberate plan; nobody believes that anybody has thought out what the old economy was and what the new economy is to be, what the steps for the change-over are, how long they are likely to take and what the new situation afterwards will be.  It seems somewhat ludicrous to be introducing these things into a debate of this sort, but they were paraded to the people. There was something of the old idea of the fortunes told at the country fairs.  Fortunes were told for everybody. <Col N="2019" /> These things are about as good as the prophecies that were made around these fairs.  We did get these prophecies.  We were told about all the unemployed who were to be gathered into employment, all the emigrants who were to be called back to get work in this country, all the taxes and all the rates that were to be lowered and the better security for everybody.  There was a precise promise that whatever economy was decided on it would not be such as would either reduce social services or inflict any hardships on any class of Government servants.</P>
    <P>I took it from the Minister for Finance's speech to-day that the two million promised saving has been definitely abandoned, but I want him to say that.  He finds himself in the dilemma that he must either increase his revenue, and he says that is only possible by increasing taxation, or else he must reduce expenditure.  He said that preliminary estimates of revenue which were being prepared indicated that they might anticipate a substantial decline of revenue, but on the other hand there would not be such a decline in expenditure.  That comes from the man who had promised two millions of a decline.  And then he gives as an excuse that such a decline in expenditure could only have been secured at the cost of social services. It could be achieved, he said, by reducing social services.  What is the correct position?  Are we going to have a definite confession that former declarations were all nonsense, a complete sham and humbug?</P>
    <P>We are told now that the Minister, after being a year in office, is convinced that a decline in expenditure could only be secured at the cost of social services.  He designed the policy of the Government to secure economies in that way.  Then he found himself in this fearful dilemma.  If revenue was going to decline and if expenditure could not be reduced he had only the choice of two ways in which the deficiency might be met&mdash;by additional taxation or by reducing the expenditure in the remuneration of public servants.  Everybody else knew, except <Col N="2020" /> the people who deluded themselves into writing that and the fools who believed it when it was written, that you could not get a £2,000,000 reduction in expenditure.  We must not forget the promise that they would not reduce social services or inflict hardships on any class of Government servants.</P>
    <P>We have got the truth in a halting way now.  The Minister for Finance makes a certain statement by reason of an office which he holds by false pretences. If he said previously that the saving could only be got by reducing social services would be have been able to stand the criticisms that such a statement would have evoked?  Was it his policy to reduce the social services and, if not, will he indicate where the £2,000,000 saving was to come from? That was no mere promise held out, because we have it definitely that Fianna Fáil had examined with minute care the Estimates of supply services for the current year and they were convinced that a saving of many hundreds could be made, not including such items as a sum of £1,152,000 paid in respect of R.I.C. pensions, and other similar payments not required by the Treaty.  Then there was the final flourish: &ldquo;The burden of taxation could be lightened by not less than £2,000,000 per year.&rdquo;  After a minute examination and after a still more minute examination, we are now told by the Minister for Finance, who was probably behind the advertisement and got office on the foot of it, that he is in the dilemma that he must reduce social services if he is going to get any decline in expenditure, and his only alternative is £280,000 through these widespread cuts on public services of different types.</P>
    <P>The President bases the justice of the reduction on this&mdash;he compares the position of the civil servant with the position of the primary producer. Will he take the sum that is to be saved, will be take whatever the world depression is and its effect on this country, will be take the extra amount of loss caused by reason of the trouble with England and say to the civil servants: &ldquo;We could have refrained from saving £280,000 in this way if it were not for the trouble with England; <Col N="2021" /> even an economic depression would not have made it necessary; but the economic depression, plus that other folly, has made this necessary, and then put it to the civil servants clearly and bluntly that they have got to pay because he has called a certain tune, called it, as he admitted in this House, with the knowledge that there is going to be trouble over it, and continues to call it with no statement to this House that is of any assurance to it that he thinks the trouble is going to end satisfactorily for this country?</P>
    <P>We just have a statement from the Minister for Finance, a warning that, although the cuts amounting to £280,000 are phrased to be for this year only, there has got to be the definite apprehension that these salaries may fall to be dealt with next year if the situation does not improve.  The President has an easy way out of his dilemma with regard to Deputy Dillon's amendment.  If a Private Deputy's Bill is sent down to cut the salaries of some of those who want salaries cut&mdash;and I hope it would have the backing of some one person from the Fianna Fáil Benches &mdash;he will allow a free vote on it.  He will vote against it himself.  I suggest a better way.  Let us take some critical division in this House, say on the Budget, and have agreement before that division is taken that anybody who votes in a particular lobby for the imposition of taxation on this community is taken as agreeing to a 5 per cent. cut in his salary.  That will be something of a free vote.  I wonder how the back bench opposite would face up to it.</P>

      <P>Neither will the Private Deputy's Bill that the President talked about.  Why did he talk about it?  It is just for the same reason.  Deputy Kelly would not <Col N="2022" /> welcome such a Bill, certainly.  The Minister has told us with regard to the small item in this measure that the savings are not going to fall into the general Exchequer.  In the case of the Agricultural Credit Corporation the savings are going to go towards the building up of a reserve for contingencies.  Would the President say how much is to be saved by the cuts imposed on the officials of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and is it going to be a significant amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the principle will not build up much of a saving for contingencies.  In the case of the Electricity Supply Board it might be desirable that the deductions, in so far as it can be done, should be passed on to the general body of consumers. What deductions are we to get in the case of our bills by this saving?  Is that a significant sum?  Will the savings made in the salary cuts upon the officials of the Electricity Supply Board equate the extraordinary expenditure which they have been forced to incur by reason of the tariff on British coal alone?  We were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that coal of equally good quality could be got elsewhere.  We have two sets of evidence against the assumption of Ministers.  The railway companies have told us that they tried one type of foreign coal and that, as it was useless, they abandoned it.  I presume they abandoned it with the concurrence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The chairman of the company said that as a result of using that foreign coal some of their locomotives had to be laid up for repairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he was misinformed if he said anything contrary to the Minister's policy.  But this thing the chairman of the company said&mdash;that the Government proposed to grant allowances to them and that they could import a certain amount of their coal duty free.  In the last couple of days we had a meeting of the Alliance and Dublin Gas Consumers' <Col N="2023" /> Company.  I presume they, too, were misinformed by their expert.  They have also stated that they did not find that the substituted coal which they had been using was of any great value for their purposes.</P>
      <P>Can we get at any stage what expense the E.S.B. had to incur by reason of this tax on coal?  Have they also been allowed to import a certain amount of coal duty free?  It is absurd to talk about sacrifices made by the Agricultural Credit Corporation officials being passed on in order to build up a reserve for contingencies. It is equally absurd to say that the cuts on the Electricity Supply Board's officials will be passed on to the general body of consumers.  I doubt if these cuts will even enable them to balance their books as they were being balanced and enable them to keep to the old rates of charge.  The extra expense they had to incur in the last year will certainly drive them to increase their charges, if they do not see some hope of that situation being mended in a favourable manner.  At any rate, this was the Government that was to get us reductions in taxation; lower rates and more security, employment for everybody and the calling back of emigrants to take up the work that had to be done here.  At the end of a year of that Government we find ourselves in the position that in order to enable the Minister for Finance to balance his Budget, we have got to get, as well as other things, this £280,000 from the persons here indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President based himself, in the end, on the primary producer.  We have got a fairly good test recently of the condition to which the primary producer has been brought; and that despite the optimistic phrases that we so often hear from the Front Bench that agriculture is all right.  Agriculture is all right according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who said it was never better, notwithstanding any evidence to the contrary. His unemployment figures are going down, so he tells us, though they appear to be going up.  We have this admission, made in this House under <Col N="2024" /> very severe cross-examination, that there are certain rates of wages admitted to have been paid on certain schemes in this country.  These rates, we are told are equated to the agricultural labourer's wage.  The agricultural labourer's wage in Cavan is 21/- for a six-day week.  That was the official answer given; these were the wages paid on Government schemes in Cavan.  I wonder would this rate work out at 4½d. or 5d. an hour.  We had a further statement made in reference to that admission with regard to the road wages paid in Cavan; we have this statement made by the man who was asked would he stand over them.  The Parliamentary Secretary said here that if anybody went down to the County Cavan and tried to take from the men in receipt of it that 21/- for a six-day week that they would tear him limb from limb. That is the condition to which this country has been reduced.  We are told, of course, that that is the same as the rate paid in President Cosgrave's time.  I deny that to start with.  But at that time we were told, and it was the theme of every crossroads orator, that these rates of wages were scandalous and that the people were refusing them.  Now we are told that 21/- for a six-day week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is so acceptable and that the people are in such a state that if one went down to Cavan and tried to take it from them, he would be torn apart limb from limb.  In these conditions it is almost impossible not to agree to a cut in the Civil Service salaries.  What has brought us to that? What is the main point of Deputy Dillon's amendment?  It is outrageously hypothetical for the people who have brought the country to that state to ask others to make sacrifices when they themselves did not make the sacrifices that they previously promised, and when they will not accept cuts in whatever they are receiving at the present time.  That is the point of the amendment, and so far as it goes in that direction it is good.  But the amendment is not a proper one in the face of this measure.  It is absurd to <Col N="2025" /> be tinkering with it, and saying that this Bill should not be passed until provision is made to include therein a reduction of the allowances payable to Deputies and Senators.  It should be until this whole situation has been examined and explained to the people; until they will have some clear knowledge where they are going; until they can have it demonstrated to them that eventually there will be prosperity, and demonstration does not mean mere declaration.  But until some reason like that is given to us, then we have to say that, although the country has been reduced to a terrific state of impoverishment, we do not think it is necessary that it should stay there, and that it is a proper thing to have further impoverishment by reducing the salaries of those people indicated in the Bill.  For that reason I, personally, am not going to accept either the amendment or the proposals in the Bill, and will resist any such measure until I am told what are the reasons for hoping eventually that we are going to be in a better position, or, alternatively, that that reason has been demonstrated to the people who are now going to be cut, and that they have agreed to it. I will take their word second-hand, but I am not going to take the word of the people who have brought the country to the position in which we now find it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the Deputy, in so far as I could understand it, is that he wants to get a reduction of taxation without reducing expenditure. He and his associates have been, from time to time, in this House and outside it, during the past six months, pressing the urgency of a reduction in the tax burden of the community.  He thinks, apparently, that there are some means by which it is possible to reduce taxation without reducing expenditure. He is bringing to the consideration of the problem of the nation's finances exactly the same attitude he brought to bear upon other problems that faced him when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He wanted to get certain things done, but he did not want the job of doing them.  It is <Col N="2026" /> because he and his associates for ten years faced up to their responsibilities in that way that this Government came into office to find the country with a declining population, declining agricultural production, declining industrial production, stripped of resources, stripped of wealth-producing capacity; in the position that, if a check had not been called to the continuous decline, recovery in our day might have been made entirely impossible.  The Deputy is taking his responsibilities in opposition as lightly as he took his responsibilities in government.  If he knows any way in which to reduce taxation without reducing expenditure, why does he not tell us about it?  He did not speak about that.  If he is opposed to a reduction of expenditure we must assume he is content to allow taxation to remain at its present level.  We are aiming to reduce taxation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy to-night as on other nights has been making play about an undertaking given on behalf of Fianna Fáil that taxation would be reduced. Let me look at the book of Estimates this year and compare it with the Estimates last year.  Let him go through the Estimates and pick out of them the increased sums that are being made available for social services of one kind or another, and compare the figure that is left with the figure of expenditure on corresponding services in any one of the ten years the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were in office, and he will find that we have reached very close to the £2,000,000 we were talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the amount of £2,000,000 has not been reflected in a reduction of taxation, it is due entirely to the fact that increased provision has been made for social services of one kind or another.  That does not represent a charge on the community. It represents a certain transfer of <Col N="2027" /> wealth from one class to another.  It does not in any way increase the burden on the nation as a whole, even though it may increase the burden on individuals.  There are several ways, of course, in which economies can be achieved.  From time to time, between 1923 and 1931, the Cumann na nGaedheal conception of the right way to achieve economies was made plain.  When the Minister for Finance of that Government was faced with budgetary difficulties, faced with the obligation of reducing expenditure, so as to permit of a reduction in taxation, we know the type of economies he thought of.  The Deputy spoke about a promise given, or a proposal suggested that the rates of contribution to persons entitled to benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts should be increased.  He reduced them.</P>

      <P>I have for the moment. I want to speak about the old age pensioners.  There was an economy achieved at their expense.  It was always towards people of that class that the Cumann na nGaedheal Minister for Finance turned whenever his budgetary difficulties necessitated a reduction of expenditure of some kind.  No doubt if this Bill was a proposal to reduce further the amounts payable to old age pensioners, to reduce further some social service which is operating now to alleviate hardship in parts of the country, it would have the enthusiastic approval of Deputies opposite, including the recent convert to that Party, Deputy Morrissey, who has, I notice, left the House.  There is one fact I want Deputies opposite to bear in mind and that is that the remuneration of every class in the community has been reduced and it did not require an Act of the Legislature to reduce them.  None of us likes to contemplate reducing the remuneration of any person or class of people, but we have to bear in mind that it would be unfair that any one class should be protected when every other class must suffer. Yesterday and to-day I have been in consultation with those who speak for the railwaymen of this State.  It did not require any Act of the Legislature to achieve a reduction in remuneration for them.  The farmers, who constitute one-half of the community, have had their remuneration reduced below the pre-war level, and it did not require the introduction of one of those green papers and a prolonged debate in this House to effect it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course the Deputy had to insinuate that special circumstances exist in this country due entirely to the ill-conceived policy of the present Government.  He conveniently forgot that the circumstances are nowise different elsewhere.  Is this the only Legislature in the world in which national economy has been introduced in the past 12 months?  Is there some peculiar reason why measures considered justifiable and necessary in almost every other civilised country in the world should not be introduced <Col N="2029" /> here or should be regarded as particularly obnoxious pieces of ill-advised Government policy when introduced here?  The circumstances that exist here amongst the agricultural community and amongst other classes of people are paralleled elsewhere.  They are due to causes which are worldwide; causes no doubt capable of remedy, but not yet remedied.  It is because we contemplate being able, in our own way and in the near future, to take measures which will to some extent repair the damage done in this country by those world causes, and that by action abroad the world causes themselves may be removed or at any rate lessened in their effect, that this Bill operates for one year. We contemplate, at the end of that period, an improvement in our conditions which will obviate the necessity for reducing not merely the remuneration of civil servants, but, in part, the remuneration of railway workers and of every other class of worker.  The Deputy chose to talk sarcastically about the consequences of the economic policy of this Government. We have been in office 12 months, and I am prepared to put side by side, in relation to any industrial activity, the record of the last 12 months with the record of the previous ten years.  The Deputy quoted from an advertisement in which it was stated that the economic policy which we are now operating would tend to reduce unemployment, would be capable of providing employment for all those in the country who are seeking it, and might, in fact, operate to bring back and employ here those who, during the past ten years, were forced to emigrate and find abroad the livelihood they could not find at home.  The Deputy asked a number of sarcastic questions.  I do not know if he seriously meant them, but I intend to answer them.  They are coming back from America.  In last year, for the first time in half a century, we had a net immigration into this country.  That situation came more rapidly than we anticipated, and came because of causes abroad as well as causes at home, but it is the fact.</P>

      <P>And the cuts are going away as soon as that situation can be reflected in the public revenues.  We have been in office for one year, and for a large part of that time we have been trying to put right the situation that we found on taking office&mdash;trying to repair some of the damage done by our predecessors.  I say that in 12 months we have done more to increase industrial equipment, to increase employment, and to increase the production of wealth in this country than our predecessors contemplated doing, much less achieved, in their ten years. There is more money in Ireland, more money circulating, and the traders will tell you that business is good.  A number of the leading traders stated in the Press that the Christmas trade of three months ago was the best they had for three years.</P>

      <P>Manufacturers are busier than ever they were.  We have made progress in the development of industrial equipment much more rapidly than I contemplated.  Take any industry you care to name.  Take the flour-milling industry.  Twelve months ago that industry was faced with extinction.  A short time before that, in an attempt to ward off extinction, it had to enter into an arrangement which conceded to the importers one half of the whole market.  A few days ago the flour millers came to my Department to make representations that there was a considerable danger of this country being over-milled, that the productive capacity was in excess of its requirements, and requesting that new entrants into the flour-milling industry should be restricted in consequence.  We have doubled production and doubled employment in the boot and shoe industry.  In the woollen industry there is not a factory in the country which has not substantially increased its production; some of them have multiplied it by three times.  I was down in Cork recently <Col N="2032" /> and one woollen manufacturer came to me and said: &ldquo;You recollect my telling you last October that I was doubling my plant.  I have doubled it again since.&rdquo;  In the hosiery industry employment has been more than doubled, and the rate of progress is so rapid that we contemplate its being doubled again before next December.</P>

      <P>In every industrial activity, as I have said, there has been that increase, and when that increase is reflected in the public revenues we will be able to avoid measures of this kind, and to give the benefit of the increased yield which existing taxes will produce in the form of reduced taxation.  Deputies know quite well that the revenues earned by traders and industrialists in this year will not be reflected in the public revenues until next year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not understand those figures.  It has been one of the finest of our achievements that we have succeeded in releasing this country from its thraldom in connection with foreign trade.  We do not export goods simply for the pleasure of giving them away; we export them to pay for the ones we import.  We have released ourselves from the necessity of importing the bulk of our requirements.  We have succeeded in getting produced here at home the whole range of manufactured goods which for ten years previously were bought abroad.  We have succeeded in giving employment to Irishmen in Ireland where formerly the employment was given to Englishmen in England, to Germans in Germany&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And all that has been achieved despite the abnormal circumstances of last year, despite world causes, and despite the economic war. <Col N="2033" /> The Deputies opposite should be slow to talk about those matters.  Some months ago they talked frequently, as Deputy McGilligan talked here to-night, about tricking the people.  They told us that we had taken office under false pretences, and were operating in office a policy different to that which we placed before the electors. They talked about the will of the people; we gave them the opportunity of deciding.  That is not two months ago.  We gave them a general election with all the advantages on their side. Every political advantage that any party manager could ever dream about they had and, nevertheless, the country repudiated them.  It endorsed the policy that we have been putting into operation for 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The country had 12 months' experience of that policy in operation.  They had experience of it probably in its worst aspect, because the fruits of it had not yet been reaped. When we came into office we had to clear the debris left by the previous administration before we could begin to put our policy into operation.  That policy may have caused hardship in particular quarters, and yet in spite of that and the fact that the fruits of our policy had not yet been reaped, we gave in these conditions to the Deputies opposite the opportunity they pretended to want: of standing before the electors of the country and making their case.  When they got the opportunity they were told in no undecisive manner what the country thought about them and what it thought about us.  The policy that is enshrined in this Bill was endorsed by the people of the country.  If there is an economic war in progress, then this Government was given a mandate to take whatever steps were necessary to secure victory in that war.  If this Bill is one of the measures, as Deputy McGilligan alleged, then it is one that has the full endorsement of the majority of our people.  We contemplate a speedy improvement in conditions.  An improvement is taking place every day under our eyes.  There has been a <Col N="2034" /> drop in the unemployment figures since last January.  New industrial undertakings are reported every other day in the Press.  An increase in tillage is taking place this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputy examine the causes for the increase in the amount expended on home assistance. It is due to the fact that increased provision is being made for the unfortunate people who are obliged to have recourse to that means of subsistence. Let the Deputy go back over the whole period the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office, take the number of people in receipt of home assistance each year, and note the percentage rate of increase until 1931. That will give him some idea of the problem that we were left to deal with. The Minister for Agriculture, speaking the other day about the agricultural position, said, in relation to that industry, that he found the country stripped of its wealth.  Deputies opposite asked why the cattle exports had gone down.  He told them the reason&mdash;because the number of cattle available for export had gone down.</P>

I say that there was no diminution in the cattle stocks of the country worth talking about on the 1st June in those years, and neither the Minister for Agriculture nor the Minister for Industry and Commerce can quote a single figure to show that there was a diminution in the cattle stocks of the country in 1931 as against the preceding years.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of numbers now&mdash;the number of cattle available.  In every sphere of agricultural production there was the same decline during the ten years that the Party opposite were in power.  The position in which we found ourselves when we came into office was that not merely had the wealth available in the country been decreased by the misgovernment of the Party opposite for ten years, but that the wealth producing capacity of the country had been definitely impaired.  We have been repairing that position.  Our anticipations in that respect have been exceeded, despite the economic war and the abnormal world conditions that prevail.  At the rate of progress that is now being made we can contemplate a complete recovery in a very short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are still many problems to be dealt with, many that require careful examination and very decisive action. No matter what methods are adopted for dealing with them, there is one that must be tried and that is to keep as low as possible the tax burden on the country.  It is because that is necessary that this Bill is now before the Dáil.  This Bill does not in fact impose any real hardship.  There are many people in the country who have had to suffer much more substantial reductions in their remuneration than is proposed for any class of public servants under this Bill.  We hope that these people as well as civil servants will benefit by any improvement that may result from the Government's policy in the next ten months or a year.  If the Deputies opposite vote against this Bill and against the proposal to effect economies in the way proposed under it, then let them at least stop talking about a reduction of taxation, about the plight of the agricultural community and about the various measures that they would like to see adopted if they did not involve an increased cost to the public.  A vote against the Bill, and against the achievement of economies in that way on the part of the Deputies opposite will stultify everything they have been saying during the past six months through the country.  I expect them <Col N="2037" /> to vote against it, but at least let them do it avowedly because this Bill is a measure introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Let them admit candidly that that is the only reason they are opposing it.  It is, I think, a pity that ex-Deputy Blythe is not available to-night to tell us exactly what economic excesses he was contemplating before the people got the opportunity of putting him where he now is.</P>
