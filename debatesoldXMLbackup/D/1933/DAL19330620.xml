      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken) for Minister for Lands and Fisheries</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would appear to be under a misapprehension as to the circumstances to which he refers.  The facts are as follows:&mdash;It is proposed to migrate the occupier of the late John Deignan's holding on the townland of Laghtavarry on the Gibbons Estate, County Mayo, to a new holding on the Knox Gilden Estate, County Mayo. The holding on the Gibbons Estate has not yet been surrendered to the Land Commission, but the proposed migrant has let the lands to the <Col N="701" /> tenants of small holdings adjoining. The completion of the exchange was delayed owing to a question of the provision of turbary, but this has now been arranged and it is expected that the exchange will be effected at an early date and the approved scheme for the surrendered holding will then be put into operation.  The Land Commission have not collected any grazing rents in respect of the holding to be surrendered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the practice usually on these estates to give the people coming in as smallholders work on the improvement of the estate.  The reason that there are not more than 15 men, at the moment, is that the weather is too dry for such work and as soon as the weather is suitable more will be put on.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne desires to raise, on the motion for the adjournment, the subject matter of his question.  It seems to me that matters so raised should be particular grievances or matters of administration, and that the procedure of the Standing Orders did not contemplate that questions of general policy or matters requiring legislation should be debated on the adjournment.  They would more properly be raised by way of substantive motion.  The kernel of the Deputy's question is in the last two lines, in which the Minister is asked if he will take steps to amend the law. That is a matter requiring legislation, and it seems to me that it should be dealt with by way of motion in the House.

      <P>2.  In sub-section (3), line 25, after the word &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; to insert the words and brackets &ldquo;(save as is otherwise provided by this section)&rdquo; and at the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Income tax shall be charged on lands occupied wholly or mainly for husbandry at half whichever of the following amounts is the lesser, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the poor rate valuation:</P>
      <P>(b)  the judicial rent;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> (c)  the annual interest or payment to the Land Commission in lieu of rent or</P>
    <P>(d)  the original land purchase annuity.</P>
    <P>I am moving these two amendments standing in my name for various reasons.  The first and principal reason is that at the moment, and for a long time, there has been no profit from the occupation of farm lands.  The collection and issue of assessment notices to farmers is a hardship.  It entails considerable work on the part of the officials of the Department and considerable worry to the individuals to whom they are issued.  I doubt, in fact, whether the amount realised in the way of income tax from even the few farmers who are able to pay it would recoup the Minister for the amount of labour expended on it. Apart from this, before the Great War, farmers were assessed for income tax purposes at a third of the valuation by the British.  It was increased during the war to the full valuation at which it still stands.  So that the farmer is paying it, where he does pay it, at three times the valuation before the war.  The circumstances of the present time might be compared with those before the war in order to show the unfavourable position of the farmers as compared with their position before the war.  A justification for income tax, even on the old scale, could hardly be sustained, but income tax founded on a valuation three times exceeding the pre-war amount even the Minister himself cannot justify.  There is another point: the farmers, when they purchased their land, took over a liability which they never conceived they might take.  Previous to that the landlord paid the income tax under Schedule A. Since the farmer has reaped the benefits of the Land Purchase Acts he has got to bear a share of this burden under Schedule A.  On the whole, the farmer is assessed altogether beyond his means to bear the tax.  It is an unjust tax at this moment, especially as everybody knows that the farmers are making nothing.  It is unjust even <Col N="708" /> if we take no account of the economic war.  Even if things were normal as they were in 1931, and as they will be, I hope, in 1934, it is unjust to impose a tax on the full valuation where hitherto it was imposed only on one-third of the valuation.  I alluded to the hardships the farmers have in defending income tax cases.  A few nights ago in this House I tried to raise the point, and was ruled out of order, that by the assessment to income tax and the defence of income tax cases farmers are worried almost to breaking point.  Several farmers, to my knowledge, were even told by the officials of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;and I hope the Labour Party, of which I see a representative in the House, will take note of this&mdash;that they were employing too much labour.  We were told from all sides of this House that the middle sized and large farmers neglect to employ labour.  Where farmers did employ labour at good wages it was pointed out by the men who were trying to collect this tax that they were employing too much labour at too great a wage, and that women at a wage of 5/-, 6/-, or 7/- a week should be employed in lieu.  This all comes of the collection of this tax. The Minister himself knows that the farmer is making no profit.  The Revenue Commissioners know it.  In the attempt to manufacture a false profit, a profit which is not there, they are trying to almost terrorise the farmer into submitting to the tax and giving up his defence against it.  I myself know a few farmers, who, after endless efforts to evade the tax or rather to prove that they were not liable, eventually paid some little thing rather than be put to the further burden of defending it.  I do not think it is necessary to make a long speech in defence of my amendments.  They ought to have the support of every Deputy in this House.  Nobody, I think, will dare to assert that our conditions at this moment are any better than they were in 1914, if as good.  Even if they were a little better there would be no justification for an assessment for income tax purposes at three times the amount it was in 1913 or 1914.  I think that the Minister, in <Col N="709" /> all justice to the section of the community which is the most important to the Minister and to everybody else, ought to accept these amendments, and relieve the farmers from a burden which cannot be justified by the Minister or anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of assessment for income tax in this country is the actual income derived from pursuance of an occupation or from the possession of property.  In the case of the farmer he has a privilege which is not enjoyed by any other section of the income tax paying community, that of electing the schedules under which he will be charged.  He can either be charged for income tax mainly under Schedule A, and in the case of a tenant purchaser mainly under Schedule B and partly under Schedule A, or he can elect to be charged under Schedule D, on the actual basis of his profits and income derived from his business of farming.  If charged under Schedules A and B the basis of assessment is an empirical one.  It may be some one or other of five things:&mdash;(a) The Poor Law valuation of his holding; (b) the judicial rent fixed by the Land (Ireland) Acts; (c) the annual interest in lieu of rent payable to the Irish Land Commission; (d) the purchase annuity payable under the Land Purchase Acts, and (e) payment in lieu of rent; whichever of these five is the lowest and is applicable to his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will consider, first of all, the case of the farmer who does not elect to be assessed under Schedule D.  He may not elect to be assessed under Schedule D because in actual fact he keeps accounts, and we must assume if he does keep accounts and does not elect to be assessed under Schedule D that the actual income which he derives from farming would be much greater than what is taken as the notional basis of his assessment under Schedule B.  We will take the case of a person who does not elect to be assessed under Schedule D.  We will consider what is a typical case.  We are talking now not of those who own lands as a sort of side-line to their business.  We are not talking of people who own lands for personal enjoyment. <Col N="710" /> We are talking of people who own land and whose sole occupation and sole source of livelihood is their business as farmers.  We will take what would be a typical case in that connection.  We will take a large farm of good land, a farm say of over 250 acres, the Poor Law valuation of which is on the land £224 5s. 0d. and on the holdings £8, making a total Poor Law valuation of £232 5s. 0d.  In the particular case I have in mind the purchase annuity under the Land Acts amounts to £194 15s. 0d., of which £12 15s. 0d. is for sinking fund and £182 for interest. This farmer, not having elected to be assessed under Schedule D is assessed under Schedules A and B as follows:&mdash; Under Schedule A the Poor Law valuation of the farm, £232 is first taken, and from that there is deducted an allowance for repairs&mdash;on the land one-eighth of the Poor Law valuation and on the buildings one-sixth of the Poor Law valuation.  There is then deducted the interest portion of the annuity paid to the Land Commission, amounting to £182.  The total allowances made against the assessment under Schedule A amount to £211, leaving a net assessment under Schedule A of £20 18/-.  The Schedule B assessment is based on the total amount of the annuity, £194 15s. 0d., and the total assessment made on this farmer under Schedules A and B is £215 13s. 0d.  That is the total assessment.  This farmer, having a farm of over 250 acres, the valuation of which is £232&mdash;and there are only 65 such farmers in the State&mdash;does not pay a penny piece of income tax if he happens to be a married man.  He goes quite clear, that is, if he is mainly a farmer and only a farmer.  What is the justification for the amendment which has been put down by Deputy Bennett?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say how many farmers are brought in as a result of the increased valuation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no farmers brought in as a result of the increased valuation.  There are people who do pay income tax on land in regard to Schedules A and B; but they are people who carry on some other business, or they are people who have some other source of income.  They are, <Col N="711" /> possibly, people who might derive very considerable income from investments or from business as shopkeepers or butchers or publicans or something else in the village.  They are assessed on the full amount of the income, and justifiably assessed on it.  Of course it may be held that suppose this man is a single man, then, because his allowance would be much less than if he were a married man, he might fall for assessment.  The point would then arise: is this man making more money out of the farm than £215 a year, or is he making less?  If he is making less, he has his remedy.  He can say: &ldquo;I will not elect to be assessed under Schedules A and B; I will be assessed under Schedule D on the actual income which I derive from the farm.&rdquo; In view of that, is that man aggrieved in any way?</P>
      <P>In order to save him trouble and inconvenience some people will say that this man, who owns a farm of over 250 acres, the Poor Law valuation of which is in excess of £230, should not be put to the trouble of keeping accounts.  But we put the shopkeeper in the village, who has the same income, to the trouble of keeping accounts and, similarly, we put every other taxpayer in the State who wants a remission of duty to the trouble of proving that, in fact, his actual income has been less than what the inspector of taxes thought it was, less than what he had been assessed for.  Why should we give this person, one of the select class of 65 people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has already accepted my proposition that we should deal with farmers and farmers only.  We are not going to deal with the man who has a conglomerate income derived from his business as a shopkeeper, his investments in War Loan and his profits on the land.  We are dealing with the farmer, not with the case of the gombeen man.  Is Deputy Bennett urging here that, in addition to all the other privileges and perquisites which the gombeen man enjoys, he should also be free of income <Col N="712" /> tax?  Is the Deputy anxious to adopt that attitude?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows very well that that is not my attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to show that so far as real farmers are concerned&mdash;those who are farmers&mdash; solely and not publicaus-cum-farmers&mdash; they need not pay a penny piece more than they are justly bound to pay in the way of income tax under the law as it stands.  I have already stated that if this notional basis of assessment is not acceptable to the farmer, he has his remedy.  He can be assessed under Schedule D and he can satisfy the inspector as to his income; he can satisfy the inspector that the salary which he derives from his business as a farmer is less than that on which he would be assessed under Schedules A and B.  If he satisfies the inspector, then he gets a consequent and appropriate remission.  As regards the class of farmer who would come within this category, who would be covered by this amendment, I do not think there is any justification for giving him any more exceptional treatment than he now enjoys.  He has a privilege which is not enjoyed by any other income tax payer.  He can elect to be assessed under one or other of these schedules and, once we have given him that privilege and given him the right to show that in actual fact his income is less than might be assumed under Schedule A and B, we have done everything we possibly can for him.  I do not think there can be any justification for giving him a further remission on the ground that he does not keep accounts.  A man who owns a farm of over 250 acres and valued at more than £230 who does not keep accounts should not be in the farming industry at all, because he cannot be a competent farmer.</P>

As I have said, the Minister was not born in the country and, therefore, <Col N="714" /> he may not realise the significance of the words he has used.  They do not sit lightly on a Minister of State.  Such a term as he has used is opprobrious and abusive and it ought to be used very sparingly and with great care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that he is making a great concession. Surely he is aware that it is purely a statutory matter and that it has been in operation for quite a number of years.  When he says that the Government is making a special concession he might bear that fact in mind. The Minister mentioned the figure of £8 in relation to the valuation on buildings.  On a 250 acre farm the buildings bear absolutely no relation to the size of the holding.  I have seen a building little better than a labourer's cottage and it had an annual valuation of £7.  It contained three rooms and a scullery.  It is no crime for a person to have another means of income besides a farm.  What would be the sum in question?  Suppose, for a moment, a man has £100 a year.  Let us say the assessment is for £200.  The assessment is a little out of proportion to what the Minister indicated.  All persons are not married.  This may be the case of a widow that Deputy Bennett has in mind.  A farm of 250 acres during the last 12 months, as far as I have learned from any person having knowledge of the subject, or of operating such a farm, has not been a prosperous concern during that period. Deputy Bennett did me the honour last week of consulting me about this matter, and he showed me the communication that had been received from the income tax people in connection with this particular case.  Three persons were employed on this farm at 25/-, 26/- and 27/- per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has an objection to make in connection with how it arises, I shall listen to him, but he must stand up and make his case on a point of order to the Ceann Comhairle.  I presume he is fit to do <Col N="715" /> that.  Wages of 25/-, 26/- and 27/- were paid in this particular case.  It was stated in the course of the communication which came from the official in question that female labour could be employed at from 5/- to 7/- a week. People are told that they must keep accounts.  Here is a case where accounts were kept and in which, the figures having been put down, objection was taken to the wages paid during the year.  That is what is objected to.  There is no particular objection to keeping accounts.  There is objection to having an alteration in the running of the place in order to meet objections urged by the inspector of taxes, or whoever it is that has the matter in hands.  Is the Minister standing for that&mdash;that wages of 25/- 26/- and 27/- per week are too much to be paid on one of these farms and that female labour should be employed at from 5/- to 7/- a week, because that is the real point at issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the real point at issue, according to Deputy Cosgrave, in this debate is whether I stand for one rate of wages or another. Deputy Bennett, on a previous occasion, indicated that he was very perturbed about the situation and I understand that Deputy Cosgrave is also considerably moved by it.  It is rather an extraordinary thing that neither of them has submitted to me, for submission to the Revenue Comissioners, this hypothetical letter.  We have heard about the letter.  We have not had the date of it; we do not know the circumstances in which it was written, and, in short, I know nothing about it.  Deputy Bennett raised this matter I think about a week ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Bennett thinks there is any point in the administration of the Revenue Commissioners to which my attention could be drawn, I do not object to Deputy Bennett, or any Deputy, asking to see me or sending me a letter putting the facts before me&mdash;that is if he wants them redressed.  Of course, if he wants to make a sort of cheap debating point <Col N="716" /> in the House, if it is not out of a desire to protect the farmer that he raises this matter but merely to score a petty point, as he thinks, against the Government I can understand his attitude. That is not my attitude.  He has not sent me this communication or given me a single fact which would enable me to identify it.  It is quite possible that the inspector might have acted wrongly.  On the other hand, the inspector may have seen wages put down and ascribed to members, possibly, of the farmer's family, members who might be at school or engaged in some other occupation.  It is his duty if he thinks that expenses are debited against the income of the farm which are not properly chargeable, to take the matter up with the person concerned. I have had no opportunity of ascertaining for myself whether that is so or not, and Deputy Bennett, who is so much concerned, and Deputy Cosgrave, who, as Leader of the Party, I presume accepts Party responsibility for raising the matter here, have not brought the facts before my notice.  We have heard them bandied across the House, not because the Deputies feel that the farmer has any grievance to be redressed, but merely because they want to score petty points against the Government.</P>

I have not seen that letter, but I have seen another letter, which I am prepared to bring to the Minister in order to let him see that it is worded in a similar strain.  It amounts to this.  The books of a farmer whom I know are meticulously and scrupulously kept and they are audited by a Dublin chartered accountant.  Yet, when the figures were submitted, a letter came from the Income Tax Department in that particular district stating that they did not accept the figures presented to them; that they thought the wages paid to the labourers on the farm were excessive.  That is quite a different case from the one mentioned by Deputy Bennett and Deputy Cosgrave.  I would not have intervened were it not for the way in which the Minister replied.  Otherwise I would have taken up the matter in the proper way, outside the House if necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in replying to the amendment, cited a case of his own, as if nobody was concerned except the man with 200, 300 or 400 acres of land.  I am not concerned with such men.  The Minister, in order to run away from the <Col N="718" /> merits of the amendment, cited a case of which he said there were only 65 in existence.  If there were only 65 such cases in existence I would not have put down the amendment.  This amendment affects many more cases than the Minister mentioned, and he knows that.  The Minister knows that if the assessment for income tax purposes was, as it was during the British régime before the war, one-third of the valuation, instead of the full valuation, there are many farmers who are now assessed who would not be assessed. The Minister knows very well that if he accepted even the second amendment, and reduced it to one-half, that many farmers now paying income tax would not be assessed.  The Minister went to great pains to throw, I may say, dirt on the industrious farmer who, in previous years perhaps, put together a few pounds.  There are very few farmers who did it.  There are a few farmers who managed in the last 20 or 30 years to make a few pounds and who were not able to buy an extra bit of land, and put their little sum of money into some investment. Because of that little investment, the Minister described such a man as a &ldquo;gombeen&rdquo; man, because he had £100 or £200 in shares.  The point is, he has got the shares and has, perhaps, £3, £4, £5 or £6 coming to him as interest.  Income tax was assessed on the shares.  You are now getting him into grips with the Revenue Commissioners on land, where he was never dealt with before.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon is not an ordinary farmer.  The point is that if the British accepted the standard of one-third of the valuation, now, when the Minister states that there is very little income, what harm is there in accepting the amendment?  In a few months we are going to have the annuities reduced to half.  I suppose the Minister agrees with and will stand by it.  Certain people in this country will not get the benefit of the reduction.</P>

      <P>Possibly there is the man to whom the Minister refers, in whom I am not very much interested, the man who did not purchase at all. But there is a much more important section of the community.  There are industrious people throughout the country who bought out the annuities and who now hold in fee simple, having redeemed.  In six or eight months' time the annuities will be reduced by half in the case of farmers to whom the coming Land Act will apply.  There is every case for acceptance of the second amendment by the Minister. No case has been made for collecting income tax on land at all.  Income from land is non-existent and it is only waste of officials' time to try to get this tax.  It must cost a huge sum to assess farmers when eventually nothing is got.  The Minister admitted to Deputy Good that there was practically nothing got.</P>

      <P>I think both Deputy Dillon and Deputy MacDermot are looking at this question very much from their own points of view, and no doubt they are going on the point that the keeping of accounts is no great trouble.  After all, Deputy Dillon is a trained business man, and I am sure he has a trained accountant who keeps his farming accounts different from his other accounts.  Deputy MacDermot says there is no difficulty about showing a loss.  No doubt there is no difficulty in doing so if accounts are kept, but anyone who knows the country knows that 99 per cent. of the farmers keep no regular accounts.  In consequence they have to fall back upon the value of their land, or to produce accounts which are really shots at their expenditure.  Of course, men will know how they dealt with large items, such as the purchase or the sale of cattle, but as to general items of farming they keep no accounts.  That is the reason why a considerable number of farmers will rely upon assessments under Schedules A and B.  The Minister's statement that he has no sympathy with persons who have money outside farming does not surprise me.  These men lived in the good and profitable years of the Great War <Col N="721" /> when they made money which they did not spend.  What crime is that?  Have these people committed an appalling crime?  These men were thrifty.  The Minister says he has no sympathy with them, that they are gombeen men for having saved money.  Take the case of a butcher in a town.  He will want some agricultural land to carry on his business, and if the House is going to have what the Minister styled an empirical method of arriving at the amount he should pay, surely the authorities should, as far as possible, approximate to the truth.  It is admitted that it is necessary to do so. It is admitted under Schedule D that the ordinary farmer cannot deal with these matters.  Schedule D is a comparatively recent introduction.  If a man is assessed under Schedules A or B, surely an endeavour should be made to get as near to the truth as possible. It is a wrong thing for the State, or for the Revenue Commissioners, to endeavour to obtain from any citizen, a sum greater than that citizen really owes to the State.  If the amendment is not accepted, to keep on the basis of valuation which was satisfactory, four or five years ago, it follows, since farming conditions have gone down, that a basis which is unsatisfactory and unfair to farmers should not be imposed.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to indulge in cross talk he will get more than he bargains for.  I have sufficient respect for the Chair not to follow the Deputy's example.  What I am dealing with now is the percentage of farmers who are liable for income tax and who do not keep accounts.  I think the vast majority of farmers who may be liable for income tax can, with the assistance of their banks, keep pretty reliable accounts, and do keep them.  Where the suggestion was made that they should be chargeable for income tax under Schedules A and B ordinarily, if they had accounts of a rough and ready kind, they could show the Revenue Commissioners they were not liable.  What is the Minister's reply to Deputy Bennett's plea, that prior to the war Great Britain levied income tax on the basis of one-third of the poor law valuation, which was purely a war measure, and that basis was then increased to the entire poor law valuation?  Why should that be maintained now?  Why should not Deputy Bennett's suggestion of one-half poor law valuation be adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Dillon was really leaving out one of the primary considerations in this matter.  How many farmers are in fact liable under any schedule for income tax&mdash; how many farmers <i>qua</i> farmers are liable?  Under Schedule B we collected between £70,000 and £80,000 and Deputy Bennett jumped up and said from 65 farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it quite clear that people other than farmers pure and simple were paying it.  Under Schedule B people with public-houses and people who kept village stores were paying under Schedule B. I pointed out that there was a sum of £70,000 involved, but that that £70,000 did not come from those who carried <Col N="723" /> on the business of farming only.  It came from people who had all sorts of incomes as well as incomes derived from land.  We know that people of that class with incomes derived from sources other than land are endowed with more education than Deputy Bennett has credited the farmers with. They keep accounts, and they keep their accounts well, and there is no reason why, if an assessment was unjust, they should not state so.  The fact is that leaving out of consideration altogether the illiterate farmers whom Deputy Bennett wants us to believe represent the farmers of the country, and dealing with those cleverer people who keep a business and who, in addition to running their private business, also manage a farm and who for the purpose of their private business are able to keep accounts, and do so to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, these people if they had any grievance at all under Schedule B, surely would have no difficulty in presenting to the Revenue Commissioners, as Deputy Dillon has done, an account.  They would have no difficulty in showing an inspector of taxes that in actual fact the assessment under Schedule B was in excess of what it should be and that, therefore, they should be assessed under Schedule D.  These people are not suffering any injustice and cannot be suffering any grievance.  They have three options.  They can be assessed on their actual profits of last year, on the profits of the current year, or on the statutory basis of Schedule B, so in no ways is their position prejudiced or are they unfairly treated.  They have to keep accounts for the ordinary purposes of their own business.  Why not keep accounts for the purposes of their business as farmers as well, and why, if they feel that their assessment under Schedule B is unjust&mdash;and that can be the only justification for this amendment under Schedule B that it is unjust&mdash;why not produce these accounts to the inspector of taxes and convince him that they should not be assessed under Schedule B, but under Schedule D at a lower rate.  They have full opportunity of doing that; they are a class of income-tax payers in the <Col N="724" /> State who have that right, and in view of the fact that they have that right, I do not think there is any justification for this amendment.  I think the increase of assessment took place in 1915.  In 1910 and 1913 the basis of one-third of the poor law valuation, which stood for years, was felt to be, in the changed circumstances, an unjust assessment.</P>

      <P>Unjust to the general body of the taxpayers of the community, unjust to the great majority of the people who sent Deputy Bennett here, and unjust to the great mass of the farmers who do not pay income tax, but who contribute largely through indirect taxation to carry on the government of the country.  On that point I make this case.  There is possibly not 1 per cent. of people who own land in this country who pay income tax under Schedule B.  I do not think there is as many as 4,000 people assessed under Schedule B in respect of land, or could scarcely be at the full rate.  Therefore it is not that small, select class who are possibly injured by the existing law, but it is the great mass of non-tax paying farmers who would be hit if assessment under Schedule B did not bear some fair proportion to the profits that might be made out of land and the income out of land that could be assessed under Schedule B.  That is why the basis was changed in 1915. The fact that it was changed during the war, and that the change was considered necessary before the war, no more compels us to revert to the pre-war position than the fact that the income tax before the war was only 9d. or 1/- whereas to-day, everyone, not merely in this country, but in Great Britain, and everywhere else have become accustomed to an income tax at a much higher rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister argued in his last speech that what was just for the farmers before the war in <Col N="725" /> assessment of valuation is not just now.  There was no public case made before the war that one-third valuation was unjust.  There has been a cutting down in the ideas of income since the war, but there is no suggestion that we are at a stage now, except in the Minister's mind, that the valuation made before the war should be increased now.  I do not think that that could exist anywhere except in the Minister's imagination.  I asked the Minister why such huge masses of people have been billed for income tax.  Will the Minister tell us how many people with £100 or £200, who own farms, are assessed for income tax because they own these little sums and have them in investments.  I could name many people who by hook or by crook have secured these small amounts, sometimes perhaps sent to <Col N="726" /> them from America by relatives, and have perhaps £200 invested, and who are now brought into income tax by the Revenue Commissioners.  It would not hurt the Minister to accept this amendment and he certainly has made no case for rejecting it.  There is some concealed purpose behind the Minister's refusal and this concealed purpose he will not admit to the House.  The Revenue Commissioners are getting more out of this than they pretend and if they were not the Minister would accept this amendment. If the Minister does not accept it, I am afraid I will have to press the matter to a Division.</P>

      <P>On this section I think the House will appreciate what the Minister has done to help those who are called in this section &ldquo;double residents,&rdquo; but I would remind the Minister that in levelling down income tax and surtax he is not dealing with the only difficulty and only grievance from which these people suffer.  May I remind the Minister that one outstanding grievance with them is that, in the assessment for income tax in the Free State, holders of War Loan are assessed on 5 per cent.  As the Minister knows, the assessment is made on the previous year.  In the previous year they receive for the greater portion of the year 5 per cent., but they are paying income tax on the current year when they are only receiving 3½ per cent. and, according to the Free State Estimate, they have to pay on 5 per cent.  The Minister knows, and it is scarcely necessary for me to remind him, that there is a special provision in Great Britain whereby holders of War Loan are assessed only on the 3½ per cent. which they received.  I ask the Minister, in view of the palpable injustice of such an assessment, to see if he could not alone ease the burden to holders of War Loan in Great Britain, but that he might very reasonably extend a similar concession to holders of War Loan in the Saorstát.</P>

In any event I still cannot appreciate how any grievance arises in the way Deputy Good suggests because I gather that these people are assessed on the basis of last year's income and last year, or at least the greater portion of the year, they did enjoy War Loan at the rate of 5 per cent.</P>

      <P>The income-tax authorities on the other side insert a special provision in their claim.  I need not read it for the Minister as I am quite sure he is aware of it.  Recognising the seriousness of the grievance they insert a special clause dealing with this particular point.  All I ask is that the Minister should consider extending a similar privilege to income-tax payers in this State.  If it is done on the other side, surely it is just to do it on this side.  That is all I ask.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with that the usual tornado of tariffs is being blown up by this Bill but there is one tariff rather more unreasonable than the others.  The House will remember where, in the Finance Bill last year, there was a provision imposing a tariff on packages coming into this country.  The object of that tariff, we were told by the Government, was to promote the business of packing commodities in the country.  Accordingly, some of us who were foolish enough to believe that there would be some degree of consistency in the Department of Industry and Commerce, got apparatus for packing merchandise in this country.  One of the principal and most effective packages are containers made by a firm which trades under the name of Mono Ltd. in England. There is a certain apparatus required for closing the containers.  In this Finance Act there is a tariff of 33? per cent., put upon the containers. Having first, under the Finance Act, 1932, put a tariff on packed goods, under the Finance Act, 1933, there is a provision to prevent packages coming in.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is happily only temporarily absent.  We look forward to seeing him return to his place with all his usual verve at an early date, but <Col N="730" /> I think it would require his ingenuity to explain the inconsistency of that proceeding.  I can assure the Minister for Finance that although licencing powers have been taken, and I believe are being used temporarily, unless he makes up his mind to permanently exclude from the operation of this tariff certain forms of containers he is going to cut right across the packing business in Ireland, because there is a particular kind of package, such as the Mono people make, which depends for its existence on a world trade.  It is like Jameson's label; it is shipped to all parts of the world.  It is quite unthinkable that a product of that kind should be produced in Ireland. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that a very careful examination should be made of the whole question of containers, to ascertain what are the particular types that ought to be excluded from the operation of this tariff, and what particular types of container may properly be made liable to the 33? per cent.  I think there might be something to be said for tin cans.  I believe there is somebody out on the canal making tin cans, but I imagine the Minister will find that there are quite a lot of containers which are not producible in this country, and that the lack of them will cut right across the policy of packing goods in this country.</P>

      <P>I understand that in fact practically every class of cardboard container is at present being produced in sufficient quantities in this country, with the exception of the cylindrical container, which I presume Deputy Dillon has referred to, and the ordinary cigarette carton.  I do not anticipate that there will be any difficulty in producing the cigarette carton, and I do feel that the feasibility of producing cylindrical containers is a matter of which some further investigation should be made.  I understand that the Minister is quite prepared to consider applications for import under licence until he is satisfied that the people here are in a position to produce at least as serviceable an article as is being produced elsewhere.  I do not know whether Deputy Dillon has approached that class of people who <Col N="731" /> had, on foot of last year's Budget, equipped themselves to undertake packing in this country.  I do not know whether or not they have approached the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the matter, but I suggest that they should get in touch immediately with the Acting Minister and take the question up with him.  I do know that it is not the intention of the Minister to in any way overthrow what was done as a consequence of last year's Budget.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact at first the people who brought this matter under my attention were refused a hearing.  I went myself to the Department of Industry and Commerce and was received there with the courtesy which is habitual to that Department.  The case was considered in a very fair and courteous way, and a provisional arrangement was made to afford an opportunity for those people to get in those containers for a period of two months.  This is not only a cylindrical container but a container made of impermeable material.  All I suggest is that if investigation were made it might be possible to exclude containers made from that kind of wax carbon from the operation of the tariff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On that section I am sorry there are no members of the Labour Party present.  I drew the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce before to the effect of his policy in imposing prohibitive duties on coats, wraps, costumes, or dresses made wholly or mainly from woven tissues for women.  I will not say that is an economic proposition, but it is possible to produce women's clothes in this country.  There is a trend in every city such as Dublin, Cork or Limerick for a very low cheap grade of women's outside wear. Heretofore that was imported from the industrial centres of England, where it was produced on an enormous scale, based on the demand that exists for it <Col N="732" /> in the great industrial cities of England. The poor must have that kind of clothing.  In the old days young women of straitened circumstances both in town and country wore a costume which consisted of a shawl, a blouse and a skirt.  In many parts of the West of Ireland where I live they still wear them, and look very well in them.  They look very much better than they do in the shoddy coats, but the demand has grown up in this country for shoddy coats, and they are going to get them.  How are they going to get them?  An attempt is being made in Dublin at the present time to supply the demand for that class of stuff by labour employed under appalling conditions, for the simple reason that you cannot pay labour anything approximate to a decent wage to produce that grade of goods, unless you do it on a basis of mass production, which is not possible in this country. If you are in a position to cut out 150 coats at a stroke, on one cloth and one pattern, as the Manchester or Leeds manufacturer would, the thing could be done, and even under those circumstances I believe the conditions of labour are very bad.  They are trying to do it here, and if my information be correct&mdash;and I have made careful inquiries into it&mdash;the conditions of labour are indescribable.  I put it to the Minister on previous occasions that if he wants to carry out his general policy as regards ready-made clothes, and at the same time avoid that evil, he should say that these duties should be applied to any women's outside garments which at Dublin port are invoiced at a price in excess of 15/-, or some such figure.  That would let in free the very low grade garments which give nothing but the worst possible type of employment, and it would give adequate protection to the better class garment which is being produced by the manufacturers in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal justification for this section is that at the present moment we are supplying, approximately, only 50 per cent. of the country's requirements of this class of article.  We are still importing over £300,000 worth of goods which, in the <Col N="733" /> opinion of the Government, should be made at home.  It may be that in making them we shall have to sacrifice something in regard to cut and general appearance; but, I think, if that sacrifice has to be made at all it will be only a temporary sacrifice.  The fact that the market for all classes of women's outer wear is of such an extent as I have indicated, £300,000, would indicate its importance.  We must bear in mind that the greater part of this market must necessarily be for the cheaper kinds of clothing.  It does seem to me that the possibility of establishing the industry here, even on the basis of mass production, which Deputy Dillon seems to think essential, is not by any means negligible.  For that reason I cannot see how we could accept a proposition that articles, the invoice value of which at any port in the Saorstat is less than 15/-, should be excluded from the scope of the Bill. It is in the manufacture of articles of that description that the greatest amount of employment is going to be given.  Such articles constitute by far the greater part of our imports.  It seems to me that that is the widest market, and it is there that we will ultimately find the greatest amount of employment.  I may be wrong, but that is the principle upon which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Government generally, have proceeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the cost of these articles, it has to be remembered that a great deal of their cheapness depends on the fact that they are manufactured very largely of the cheaper class of cloth, shoddy.  I do not say that shoddy has not its uses, both ornamental and economic, but I think that in the long run neither we as a community nor the wearers of clothing will be at all injured if a better type of material is substituted for that which at present constitutes the fabric out of which these clothes were made.  It may be that when the substitution is made the cost of the garment will not be considerably increased.  I understand that the cost of the material is not a big factor in relation to the cost of the garment.  A very large part of the cost is made up of the overhead charges <Col N="734" /> arising out of the selling.  The fact that there is much easier access to possible customers here may tend considerably to reduce the price.  For all these reasons I think it would not be possible to accede to the Deputy's request.</P>
    <P>When we have tried out the thing and if what the Deputy says is likely to occur does, in fact, occur, then the matter will be reconsidered.  The general policy that we have adopted since the Government came into office in relation to new industries is that we must try to get them established. That policy may involve a certain amount of hardship and possibly a certain amount of inconvenience for the various interests concerned, but we have to try to get those industries established first of all and when we see how they work out in practice then we can modify our tariff policy, if necessary, in the way which seems most desirable.  In view of the large market and the general policy which we feel inclined to pursue in regard to these matters, I do not think it would be possible to consider the suggestion that the Deputy has put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not here discussing the general question of tariffs, but I think that it is right to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that it is in circumstances such as these that he misses the Tariff Commission.  The Minister cannot possibly know the technical side of this trade as I who am engaged in it know it, or as any other person who is engaged in it knows it.  Let me say that there are three broad divisions in this trade, the low grade, the middle grade and the upper grade.  I should think that in Ireland the bulk of the trade is done in the middle grade, albeit in the lower end of the middle grade.  I should imagine the bulk of the trade is done in women's coatings.  The Minister says that it may be a better cloth will be introduced into these coats.  The danger is that prices may rise unless the Government come in and regulate every phase of the industry, thus necessitating the employment of inspectors by hundreds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> Where there is a demand you are going to get a supply.  There is a demand for costumes all over the country.  The cheapest cloth you can get in this country at the present moment, suitable for a lady's coat, will work out about 3/6 or 3/9 a yard. If you allow three yards of that it will cost 10/6.  Then you have trimmings. What are you going to leave for the worker for making the coat and what are you going to allow by way of a profit for the manufacturer?  I am thinking of the class of work that is being created and the conditions of labour which these men must impose on their operatives.  If the Minister had the Tariff Commission to advise him they would point out these difficulties. I believe any Deputy who represents the City of Dublin must know there are women working under conditions which are wholly indefensible, producing that kind of stuff. The only effective way to put an end to that is to let the low grade article come in free of duty.  If it is allowed to come in it is not going to compete with other classes of stuff.  The woman who wears the middle or top grade coat would not be seen dead in a ditch in the cheap article.  There is not the slightest danger of that woman turning to it.  You can differentiate quite effectively.  I will ask the Minister to consider that aspect of the matter and invite the Department of Industry and Commerce to make inquiries.</P>

If, in fact, a cheaper quality of cloth were used than that, a large part of his case would disappear, because the margin which would exist for the payment of wages and all the other manufacturing costs would be considerably increased.  I just want to assure Deputy Dillon that 3/- per yard is an excessive price altogether for the cloth.  It has not cost, in fact, anything like that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this amendment and this section there are a number of amendments down at the end.  I think there are six amendments from amendment 18 to amendment 23.  We shall come to these later.  This amendment is to extend for another four years the situation that existed up to this year.  The Minister has not fully explained the whole policy which he and his Department intend to pursue with regard to the development of tobacco growing in this country.  This section is somewhat complicated and it has certain implications which have not, I think, been made clear to the House by the Minister during the various stages which have preceded the present one in connection with this Bill.  I think it is seven years since the last Committee of this House sat to investigate the development of tobacco growing.  Since then there have been many changes both in mentality and in the actual situation. That Committee, as far as I remember, recommended what amounted to a form of protection for home-grown tobacco to the extent of 3/6 in the pound. That suggestion was turned down by the Government of the time because <Col N="738" /> the Government had to be very careful about the revenue.  Now we know from the Minister that the revenue is buoyant and such considerations no longer apply.  Certainly, the whole situation is different from what it was then.  The policy which the Government seems to be pursuing is one which is extremely erratic.  In the first place, the Minister suddenly removed all duty on Irish-grown tobacco and then put it back again to a limited degree.  I think the degree of duty which the Minister is going to charge will be just sufficient to defeat the purpose which, I presume, he had in mind when he removed the duty last year.</P>
    <P>The main reason why it is desirable to extend the period of last year's exemption is that experimentation in tobacco growing is a matter which takes a very considerable time.  It has been the experience of all other countries that many years had to elapse before the farmers in these countries tried out the seeds and the different methods to discover what was best for the particular area and the climate and soil of that particular country.  This piece-meal legislation by the Minister is not calculated to make it possible to develop any serious experimentation.  Previous experiments in this country were largely failures due to the interference of the Government and its failure to stick to one particular course.  The Minister is pursuing the same practice in changing from year to year.  The object of the amendment is to endeavour to give some guarantee of permanence to those endeavouring to grow tobacco in order that they may have a chance to find the best method of developing it in this country.  We shall come to the taxes which are being imposed in the Schedule later on.  I do not think the Minister, however, would be doing very much wrong to his buoyant revenue if he were to accept the amendment.  Otherwise, I do not think that the experimentation which is going on is likely to come to permanent and satisfactory results.  Other Deputies in other parts of the country naturally had experience or heard of the experience <Col N="739" /> of farmers endeavouring to develop this crop.  I think they will agree that this constant changing in the policy of the Government is not likely to result in any satisfactory development in this direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is unacceptable.  The Government is anxious to foster the cultivation of tobacco in this country, but it is anxious to foster it with some regard to the requirements of the revenue. Last year out of the customs and excise duty on tobacco the Exchequer secured over 3½ million pounds.  One cannot easily tamper with a source of income of that magnitude without having very serious repercussions upon the general financial condition of the State as a whole, and without having very serious repercussions upon the general social services as a whole.  It had been represented to us that the tobacco-growing industry here was not going to be revived unless we again aroused the interest of those formerly engaged in the industry.  In order to do that, we offered them a particularly large inducement.  We said we would remove the tax altogether from Irish-grown tobacco.  I am happy to say that that experiment was very successful, much more successful than we ever anticipated, because while we had contemplated that there would be a certain number of experienced growers who would engage again in growing tobacco, we found last year that a considerable number of people were immediately interested and that this year an increasing number was interested, so that at least 800 acres would be put down this year.  We do not propose to collect a penny piece of tax from the growers in respect of that tobacco.  It will probably cost us a very considerable sum next year when the duty will properly fall for collection upon it.  In order that the experiment may be kept within some bounds, and that the loss to the revenue may be such as the revenue could properly sustain, without having that loss reflected by a restriction of other services which the people are <Col N="740" /> asking for, we have had to warn the people that next year tobacco growing will have to bear duty at the rates which are set forth in the Schedule; at 6/8 for certain classes and 5/6 for other classes.  That will still leave the people engaged in the industry a very considerable margin.  We hope, with the protection which is afforded them, that next year people will engage in the business more as a business and less as a sort of proposition; that only people who go into the business seriously and who think they are going to make a success of tobacco growing, will engage in it.  Those who are interested in it have had a wonderful opportunity this year. They will be able to dispose of their crop at good prices.  The problem of finances, so far as they are concerned, will have been solved, and they will have had, even if they had no previous experience, an opportunity this year of finding that out for themselves, under the fairest possible conditions.</P>
      <P>It would not be correct to allow the Dáil to believe that those who engaged in tobacco growing this year are novices.  As a matter of fact, most of these people now growing the crop have had previous experience so it is not necessary for them to indulge in the preliminary operations to which a Deputy referred.  They all tried their hands before, under conditions similar to these which they demanded from the Committee which was set up by the Dáil to report on tobacco growing, conditions which were denied to them by the Party to which Deputy Esmonde belongs.  We are now giving them a chance at some considerable cost to the revenue.  We have got on so well that we are anxious that tobacco should be grown in this country, if it is at all possible to grow it, but, at the same time, that the revenue will not suffer and that social and other Government services will not suffer.</P>

      <P>On this section, which deals with the excise duty on moneylenders, no attention has been paid to a suggestion that I made at an earlier stage, that there should be a differentiation between Irish-speaking and non-Irish speaking moneylenders. We have heard to-day that one Moneylenders Bill has been withdrawn and that another is to take its place.  I hope Deputy Dillon's sinister suggestion is not justified, and that we shall not see that the new Bill leaves out the Irish-speaking clause.  It appears to me that the moneylending class is a particularly suitable one for an experiment with regard to the Irish language. In the case of teachers, civil servants or lawyers, they have to have an extensive education in order to arrive at proper efficiency in their professions, and the learning of the Irish language is a considerable addition to their burden.  In the case of moneylenders, no such severe course of instruction and apprenticeship is necessary, as is the case with the other classes I have mentioned.  Moreover, if the efficiency of moneylenders was to be restricted by their being called upon to tackle the extra burden of learning the Irish language, possibly the public would not appreciably suffer.  In fact the public might be better pleased if they were less efficient.  Then, again, the moneylending class as a class are in the main drawn from a race which has special talent for learning languages, so the task would therefore be all the easier for them.  Part of the idea of a revival of Irish as a spoken language is a revival of interest in Gaelic civilisation, reviving qualities specially associated with Gaelic civilisation.</P>

      <P>(1)  There shall be allowed in respect of beer brewed in Saorstát Eireann on or after the 5th day of August, 1933, the following rebate from the excise duty now payable in respect thereof, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the case of beer brewed by a brewer for sale for every 32 gallons of beer of whatever original gravity charged with duty and delivered from the brewery, a rebate of one pound, or where the duty now payable in respect of 32 gallons of any beer so charged and delivered is less than two pounds four shillings, a rebate equal to the amount by which that duty exceeds the sum of one pound four shillings; and so in proportion for any less quantity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The excise drawback now payable on the exportation of any beer or on the deposit thereof in a warehouse for exportation from Saorstát Eireann as merchandise or <Col N="743" /> for ships' stores shall unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that no rebate has been allowed in respect of that beer under this section be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the rebate allowable under this section in respect thereof.</P>
    <P>(3)  This section shall be deemed to have had effect as from the 5th day of August, 1933.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Revenue Commissioners may make such regulations as they consider necessary for the purpose of carrying this section into effect, and in particular for the purpose of facilitating and controlling the calculation of the amount of the rebate to be allowed under this section and with respect to the method of computing the quantity of the beer in respect of which rebate is to be allowed.</P>
    <P>I may say that I am moving this amendment with a certain degree of optimism, because of a letter which was addressed to the Minister for Finance in April last, in which he was stated to have expressed extreme sympathy upon this matter, at least on the position of the licensed trade and the taxation placed upon it.  The letter indicated that the Minister had received a deputation a year before, presumably very soon after the Minister's Government took office in 1932.  It stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We were pleased with your reception of us, and we felt we had come to a Minister who was impressed by the justice and strength of our case, and we had hoped for some remission of duty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They did not get the remission then. But they are still hopeful, and, accordingly I have some optimism in moving the amendment, having regard to the fact that the Minister was so sympathetic in his attitude more than a year ago.  The amendment deals with what is technically called beer, but which in this country means substantially porter or stout.  I am proposing the amendment in the form in which it was in previous years. The proposal is: that there should <Col N="744" /> be remission of duty which would enable the pint of porter and stout to be sold to the consumer 1d. cheaper.</P>
    <P>The arguments in favour of that course hardly need restatement. Porter and stout are, in this country, what may be described as the national beverage.  They are the poor man's drink.  I hope nobody in the House will be impressed by the views of a certain section of the temperance movement who would argue that any reduction in these duties would mean increased consumption and, therefore, an increase in drunkenness.  As we know, there is no temperance problem really in this country at the present moment.  When I say that I refer to the mass of the people.  There are in this country, as there are in every country, a number of individuals who, no doubt, whatever the price of drink may be, will exceed the limit, but, as a national problem, I suggest that drunkenness has really ceased to exist. That is a state of affairs which has come about, not really as a result of increased taxation but it has come about, as I said, speaking in this House on a similar motion some time ago, through a change in the habits of the people, through the growth and development of their self respect.</P>
    <P>The increased duties on drink came about as a result of the world war. But those of us who are old enough to remember the conditions, in this country, know there was an enormous change in the habits of the people, an enormous decrease in the consumption of drink between 1900 and 1914.  That movement towards temperance has gone on since that time.  It may have been stimulated, possibly, by an increase in price, but I do not think that that is a necessary inference, because the growth in temperance that preceded 1914 was so great that we can assume that even if there had not been a great increase in price, in subsequent years the movement towards temperance would have gone on growing, and would grow in the way it actually did grow.  I think it shows confusion from the point of view of some of the extreme advocates of temperance, to speak of the reduction of duties on beer, at all events, as <Col N="745" /> tending towards intemperance, because beer and stout are the poor man's drink in this country.  It is a recognised fact by physicians and eminent authorities on the subject that this particular drink has particular advantages as a food.</P>
    <P>In 1925 when the Intoxicating Liquor Commission sat here the Government brought over a witness who was recognised as probably the greatest living authority on temperance Dr. Shadwell.  He had acted as adviser to the British Government during the period they controlled drink during the Great War.  He has written a number of books upon the subject.  He wrote one book entitled &ldquo;Drink and Temperance Legislation,&rdquo; and another book entitled &ldquo;Drink 1914-1922&mdash;Lessons under Control.&rdquo; He gave evidence in 1925 before the Liquor Commission and his evidence was that a pint of porter or stout had very considerable food value.  He was asked by one member of the Commission as to whether it was his opinion that a quay labourer would put in better work if he got his dinner of bread, butter and cheese with a pint of stout than otherwise. He expressed the opinion that our beer or stout was a highly valuable article of food.  I base my observations upon that argument when dealing here with what is known as the poor man's drink and which is, what one might almost call, an essential part of the poor man's food.  The quay labourer's dinner very often in Dublin is bread, butter and cheese and a pint of stout.  Porter or stout is, as I say, an almost essential food to the workman.  In every country, so far as we know, the national beverage, or drink, is encouraged to a certain extent.  In France, Italy and Spain the poor people are able to get, at extremely moderate prices, the native drinks.  That is to say, a kind of wine which is part of their food, as porter and stout are part of the food of the poor people here.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that the remission asked for here would mean too serious a loss to the revenue.  I think when you are dealing with what is practically an essential article for the <Col N="746" /> poor people, the consideration of some loss, if it does occur, in the revenue should be a secondary matter. I am not impressed in the least by the arguments of the advocates of temperance who will, no doubt, say that in this country to compensate for a loss of revenue you must contemplate an increase in consumption.  I do not think that, having regard to the temperate habits of our people, some increased consumption in porter or stout would mean, in any sense, a national evil or a national disadvantage. You can raise a tax to such a point as to make it uneconomic.  I suggest that has been done here.  It was done long before the present Government took up office.  It was done during the war and as a war measure, but it was found, as was found in connection with a great many other commodities, that raising taxation to an unreasonable height meant loss in revenue.  I do not think our people would be any the worse even if there was an increase in the consumption of this particular article &mdash;porter or stout.  I do not think the revenue would be any worse off if by reduced taxation consumption was increased.  Possibly some people forget the enormous increase in this particular item of taxation in recent years.  The duty on porter or stout&mdash; I prefer to use these expressions because the word beer is in a sense misleading to us here&mdash;has been increased to 13 times what it used to be.  It was increased by successive stages and by repeated stages from 7/9 per barrel to £5 per barrel.</P>
    <P>The result is, of course, that this article which is an article which the poor and the working people demand has imposed on it a luxury tax.  That tax of course was paid during the years of considerable prosperity.  I think the Minister will pay some attention to the point I am making now as regards the effect of excessive taxation.  If he looks at the figures of the Revenue Commissioners and examines the revenue from beer in the year 1921 and then looks at the figures for 1932 he will see the point of my remarks.  In 1924 the tax received from beer was £3,640,416 <Col N="747" /> In 1932 the amount received in tax from beer was £2,761,611. That is a fall of more than 50 per cent. in the receipts from that source of revenue.  I do not think that it can be suggested that in the year 1924 there was any excessive drinking amongst at all events the working classes, the people who consume beer and stout.  I do not think that any person in this House can suggest that there was any excessive consumption of beer and stout in that year.  But obviously if the amount of consumption in those years was moderate and reasonable, then the people have been deprived of more than half of the amount of beer and stout that they were able to drink in those years. They have been deprived of it by excessive taxation.  The fall goes steadily on from year to year.  The fall from 1931 to 1932 was somewhere about £500,000.  I gave the figures already as regards the revenue in 1932&mdash;£2,716,611.  In 1931 the revenue was £3,216,000.</P>
    <P>At the present rate of a fall this revenue is fast disappearing.  I suggest that the reason why it is disappearing is because of the excessive taxation imposed on it, combined with the diminished spending power amongst the people.  That leads to another aspect of this question&mdash;that in destroying this industry you are destroying employment throughout the country.  I know, and I can appreciate the difficulties of the Government who have to raise revenue.  I can appreciate their hesitation in reducing what appears at the moment to be a certain source of revenue.  But I would like to emphasise this point that this revenue, having regard to these figures with which the Minister is familiar, shows a steady and rapid decline.  This revenue is fast a disappearing asset and with the disappearance of that asset there is something else that also disappears, and that is employment for a very considerable number of our people.  That disappears also. I think that one rather deplorable result of this enormously increased taxation of beer and stout was the <Col N="748" /> closing down of a number of smaller concerns throughout the State.  Heavy taxation, while it is a burden on every brewery, is necessarily a greatly increased burden on the smaller concern that is struggling to keep going against greater competition.</P>
    <P>However, the fact remains that a large number of the smaller breweries throughout the State have been closed down.  The result of that has been a considerable decrease in employment, and that decrease in employment has been progressive.  So far as one can judge from the fall in revenue that is going on at the present time, it will happen that very soon the smaller concerns must disappear and with them a great deal of the employment amongst our people.  There are Deputies here who have much more knowledge of business than I have. There are Deputies here who have a knowledge of the auctioneering business. Auctioneering firms know that on their books are numbers of concerns engaged in the licensed trade. Their books are full of such concerns and these concerns are offered for sale. They know also that the value of licensed property in this country has fallen to little more than a quarter of what it was some years ago.  I suggest that that is a result of this excessive taxation.  I gave the figures down to 1932 and I find then on looking at the summary of estimates and the details of the estimated receipts from excise in 1932-33 and from 1933 to 1934 that the following figures stand out.  The excise in 1932 to 1933 was estimated at £5,443,000.  The excise receipts for 1933-34 were estimated at £5,020,000.  There is a fall following an enormous drop in the previous year there.  There is a fall in revenue from excise duty in that one year of £423,000.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take up the attitude that we ought to encourage people to drink in order to produce revenue, but I do take up this attitude that the working man at any rate, who is just as much entitled to drink a pint of beer as to drink a cup of tea, ought to have that beer offered to him at a reasonable price.  That beer is the product of this country.  It is not a <Col N="749" /> harmful drink.  On the contrary I could quote many eminent authorities to show that it is a beneficial drink. This tax while it is maintained at its present level is a tax on one of the requirements of the poor.  I therefore urge on the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter.  I ask him to reconsider, if possible, his attitude of a year ago and to give it consideration different to what he has given it previously.  I ask him to give serious consideration to the acceptance of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I will show how the Deputy's sympathy goes.  Ever since 1922 down to 1931 Deputy Rice's Party was here.  How much did they reduce the tax on beer?  Where did they show their sympathy with the working people then?  In what way?  How much was the price of the pint reduced from 1922 up to the time the Cumann na nGaedheal Party left here?  But in that time the price of barley fell.  From the time the Cumann na nGaedhael Party came into office until they left it in 1932 the price of barley fell from 52/- a barrel to 14/6 a barrel.  The price of barley in 1922 was 52/-.  The duty on beer and spirits was the same at that time as it is now.  The price of the pint was the same then as now. What did the brewer do with the 37/6 a barrel that he robbed from the Irish farmer?  Who got it?  We hear all this sympathy with the brewer.  Is there any sympathy for the unfortunate producer, <Col N="750" /> for the man who employs labour on his land, who tills his land and produces barley and then has to sell it under the cost of production to gentlemen who have fat dividends every year after paying the duty?  I raised this matter here repeatedly in this House and I would expect those who come in here with a case like this to have at least the decency to put up some argument to refute what I then said and what I say now, namely, that the brewer has got 37/6 which he robbed from the Irish farmer and has not reduced the price of his beer or spirits by one farthing in consequence.  That is the case.  It amounts to 37/6 a barrel.  I would be in a fairly generous mood if I saw those whom I represent, the ordinary working farmers of this country, gaining some benefit, but I object to seeing a case brought in here for profiteers.  We are told about the reduction in the consumption of beer. Why not?  If a farmer finds that he gets 37/6 a barrel less now than he got in 1920 or in 1921, 1919 or 1922, he has less money to spend on pints and his labourers have less money to spend.  If he finds that he only gets 14/6 a barrel for his barley now instead of the 52/- he used to get, and that in the public house the price of the pint is the same as it was at first, I do not blame him for being rather tight about spending money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to see the Irish breweries carrying on, because, after all, a certain number of them do buy Irish barley even though the gentleman in Dublin, who buys foreign barley, fixes the price.  But let the brewers come along first and say that they will increase the price of the barley to 30/- a barrel, which will leave the farmer some little profit over the cost of production.  Let them come along and say that first.  That will leave 22/- to spare over what the brewer paid for barley in 1922 and I think he got fairly good dividends in 1922.  Let him reduce the price of stout also and then say to the Government: &ldquo;Well, we have done our part.  We have reduced the price of the stout and we have given the farmer a margin of profit on his barley.&rdquo; If they do that I will back <Col N="751" /> them, and they will find supporters in all quarters of this House.  Let them guarantee to the farmer that they will give him back something at least of what they have robbed from him.  I cannot help calling a spade a spade and I hold that the individual who reduces the price of an article, used in the production of his commodity, by two-thirds and still charges the same price for his commodity&mdash;I cannot call him anything else but a thief.  But if they come along now and say that they will pay to the farmer at least the cost of production, 30/- a barrel, and that they will buy all his barley and will not buy any foreign barley while he has Irish barley for sale, I will back them.  Let them also reduce the price to the consumer and then come along to the Government and say: &ldquo;We have reduced the price of the pint by so much; we have provided a decent price for the farmers' barley and we want a reduction in the duty,&rdquo; and I will back them.  But let them not come along with their pockets bulging with loot&mdash;I cannot call it anything else.  We know what happens down in Cork.  When you go in with your barley to the brewer he says: &ldquo;I must wait until Guinness fixes the price.  Come back in about a month and I will tell you the price when Guinness fixes it.&rdquo; Every Deputy knows that.  Every farmer Deputy here knows it and I would like to hear some of those farmer Deputies, who come from barley producing constituencies, stand up here and make a case&mdash;they have grounds enough to make it&mdash;and raise a small voice for those who produce the barley, the farmer and the farm labourer, and who get whatever the brewers like to pay for the barley. The brewer that reduced the price of barley from 52/- to 14/6 a barrel can get those advocates to say that these poor people, the brewers, are selling very little now and to please take off the duty and give them more loot.</P>
    <P>There was never a more nonsensical case brought into the Dáil than this. I would not mind if this was the first time that I put forward these arguments, <Col N="752" /> but I have put them forward on several occasions.  I put them forward three months ago and, four or five years ago, when some Deputies were making a similar plea, I put forward the same argument and the brewers have not answered the case yet.</P>

The fellows who were able to make an enormous profit from 1922 when they paid 52/ a barrel for barley, who are now buying it for 14/6 a barrel and are still charging the same price for the pint!  I am glad that this Bill is in Committee.  I would like to hear the arguments of Deputy Morrissey or any other Deputy on that particular case.  Deputy Morrissey comes from a barley-producing constituency and I should like to hear whether the Tipperary farmer is satisfied to get 14/6 a barrel for his barley and still pay the same price for a pint.  I am anxious to hear from Deputy Morrissey.</P>

      <P>I do not know which is the more refreshing, two or three pints of Guinness or a speech from Deputy Corry.  I know&mdash;although I have not drunk very much stout in my time, but I have drunk other classes of liquor&mdash;that whilst a few pints of stout might make one inclined, if it is of the value with which it is credited, to swallow some of the statements made by Deputy Corry, I am afraid that in our sober senses some of us who have had to listen to similar speeches from the Deputy are inclined to recollect those former speeches of his. <Col N="753" /> Of course I should say, sir, at the outset that Deputy Rice, the proposer of the amendment, never from the beginning to the end of his speech said anything about the brewers, and, so far as this amendment is concerned, if it is carried it will confer no benefit whatever on either the brewers or the retailers of drink directly.  As a matter of fact&mdash;I want Deputies of the House to get this into their minds&mdash;if this amendment is carried or accepted by the Government it will lead to a reduction of 1d. per pint in porter and stout in this country, and in order to give that 1d. per pint reduction the retailers of beer and stout in this country would have to lose so much per barrel.  Deputy Corry raises his eyebrows at that, but if Deputy Corry will consult the Minister for Finance or those who know something about the revenue from this duty they will tell him that what I state is a fact.  The Deputy speaks about barley at 52/- per barrel in 1921-2, and 14/6 per barrel last season.  Does the Deputy remember contradicting me here at the end of last year, and saying that 16/6 was being paid for barley?  He has now dropped to 14/6.  Does the Deputy remember that?  Does the Deputy remember my challenging him as to where he could get 16/6 for barley and that I would supply 50,000 tons of it?</P>

      <P>I am entitled to make my own case, and I can say with all respect that I promise the House to make it at least as clear and intelligible as the Deputy made his.  If the Deputy contends that barley should to-day be 52/- per barrel we are equally entitled to contend that the same thing should apply to all other products of the farm. Surely the last way to secure for the farmer an economic price for his barley is to keep up the present high level of taxation, or to increase it?  The Deputy of course likes to run amok now and again.  We know quite well that he does not take himself seriously, as nobody in the House takes him seriously, nor do I think anybody in the country takes him seriously.  I will admit that this House would be worse even than it is if we had not a speech from Deputy Corry.  I think the Deputy, like a certain figure that performs in other parts of the country, has his uses, but he should have some regard for facts and some regard for the truth.  He knows quite well, if he knows anything at all about this amendment that it is aimed at securing a reduction of 1d. per pint on the beer, stout and porter drunk throughout this country, and drunk mainly by the farmers and by the labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make this further point; there is a big difference between a man who takes a pint or even two, three or four pints of stout, and the man who goes and gets drunk.  The number of people in this country who, either from desire or from the fact that they can afford it, get drunk now is very few.  That is admitted.  Deputy Corry knows or ought to know that this, as Deputy Rice said, is an industry which is fading away.  This is an industry that has been cut down by 50 per cent. within the last ten years. The Deputy ought to know that the employment given in this industry <Col N="755" /> both directly and indirectly is very great.  The Deputy knows that, if this industry is to be slowly strangled by taxation which it cannot bear, the one and only cash crop which our farmers in certain counties have to-day will disappear.  The Deputy referred to the fact that part of the constituency which I represent is a barley one.  Of course it is, and I live in the heart of it.  I, perhaps, know more about barley than Deputy Corry does.  I am doubtful if the Deputy grows much barley.  I know more about it not merely from the point of growing it but I can tell the Deputy that I gave four and a half years working at it, and converting it from barley into malt.  The Deputy gets up here and talks in his usual loose fashion. Unfortunately the people of the country, who do not know him as well as the members of this House, might be inclined to place some weight on the words which he utters here.  He talks about Guinness fixing the price. Of course they do, unfortunately, but why does Guinness fix the price? Because Guinness buys 90 per cent. of the barley that is sold to brewers in this country.  That, if you like, is unfortunate I agree, but we have to face the fact.  So long as Guinness is in the position that he buys 90 per cent. at least of the barley produced and sold for brewing purposes in this country, while he holds that monopoly he will fix the price, and nothing Deputy Corry can say or do will alter it.  I want to ask the Deputy another point.  He told us in the course of his speech that this is not the first occasion he has spoken about the barley growers and the brewers.</P>

      <P>If that is so, if the tariff which the Deputy was demanding when in Opposition is actually imposed now, then I take it Messrs. Guinness have ceased to have a monopoly and to have the power to fix prices.  We must remember that when the Deputy, in Opposition, put forward his claim for a tariff on barley the reason he gave was that he was anxious to smash Guinness's monopoly.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  I think I have demonstrated that Deputy Corry, like many members of his Party, find themselves in a rather uneasy position with regard to this amendment.  I dare say the Deputy does not contribute much to the revenue in so far as this part of the Finance Bill is concerned I only wish he did.  Perhaps if he did contribute something he would not be so keenly opposed to this amendment as he now pretends to be.</P>

      <P>Those proposing the amendment?  Not at all.  We are quite prepared to admit that under this Government we feel it is our duty to contribute as much as we can to the national revenue and so save the country from going bankrupt.  Some of us are straining our purse strings in order to help the Minister for Finance to carry on although we are opposed to his policy.  If the Minister for Finance were to depend on the members of his own Party, or on a lot of the members of this Party, the income from the beer duty would not alone have fallen by 50 per cent., but would have disappeared altogether.  Fortunately the general run of the people in the country have much more sense than most of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In so far as it is possible to induce the Minister by force of verbiage to consider this amendment carefully, I submit we have put up a very good case. Far from weakening our case, I think Deputy Corry's contribution has strengthened it very much.  Usually Deputy Corry's statements may be <Col N="757" /> taken with a grain of salt.  Hearing him to-day one could easily recognise that at heart he was in favour of the amendment, but circumstances forced him to oppose it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">

      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  It is not wise to kill an old industry unless those who kill it have a new one to put in its place.  The brewing industry is a very old one in this country.  It has given a very large amount of employment.  The Minister for Finance, when he was replying to Deputy Rice, made the shortest speech on record as far as this House is concerned. He has a very worthy substitute in Deputy Corry, who seems to be the man behind the scenes whenever the Government want mud to be flung during the course of a debate.  Deputy Corry has seen fit to throw mud at the brewers.  That is very cute on the part of Deputy Corry.  He confined his remarks entirely to brewers.  I suspect the reason that prompted Deputy Corry to be so severe on the brewers was that they are few in number and possess very few votes.  On the other hand, the Licensed Grocers and Vintners' Association has a big membership and the members are numerous in Deputy Corry's constituency. He made a gallant but unsuccessful attempt to make a case more or less in favour of the licensed grocers and vintners and the farmers, and he reserved all his wrath for the brewers.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Morrissey pointed out, this amendment has not been introduced at the instigation of the brewers.  The amendment has for its primary object the saving of a very great industry.  For that reason it deserves very serious consideration.  I represent a county which, though the smallest in the Free State, has always gone in for the growing of barley on a very large scale.  Every one connected with barley growing knows it is about the best cash crop a farmer can grow.  It is essential that this industry should be preserved not alone for the farmers in Louth but also for the farmers in counties like Wexford, Carlow, Leix and Offaly, and part of Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When amendments of this nature <Col N="758" /> are introduced I do not think it is fair that Deputy Corry should draw the old red herring across the path.  He asked what did Cumann na nGaedheal do for this industry while they were in office.  It is time to drop that type of argument.  The Government must face the situation as it appears at the moment.  It is not a question of what Cumann na nGaedheal did not do; it is a question of what this Government is prepared to do.  Deputy Rice has spoken about the employment given not alone in the breweries where they manufacture porter, beer and stout, but also in trades ancillary to the brewing business.  There are large numbers so employed throughout the Free State.  There are, for instance, shop assistants, storemen and hundreds of others employed in the distribution of the products of the breweries.  I think the time has arrived when the Government should give serious consideration to this very important industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry pointed out that the brewers are pocketing the difference between the price paid for barley in 1922 and the price paid to-day.  The Deputy forgets that his own Government in last year's Budget gave a slight remission to the brewers.  I admit that that must be put to their credit.  It is very strange, in view of that fact, to hear the Deputy saying that the brewers are pocketing this money.  It might seem strange that this Government should give a remission in last year's Budget for the purpose of helping the brewers, but I think the Minister saw the difficulties that beset the brewing industry when he gave that slight remission.  I will not prolong this debate any further. I merely want to say that I am supporting this amendment, but if I do so that does not necessarily imply that I am in favour of any increase in so far as the consumption of drink is concerned.  I believe in the use and not in the abuse of drink.  These products are typical national products in this country. I do not support this amendment in order that there may be any increase in the consumption of drink.  I must say, however, that I very seldom met a man who took a <Col N="759" /> bottle of stout who ever did much harm.  There are a great many people in this country who boast of their temperance principles who may not have as clean a record as the man who takes a bottle of stout.  I do not think that it is right or proper to level charges against the trade unless they can be proved.  The members of the Licensed Grocers and Vintners' Association, and those associated with them, have taken a very important part in the national and industrial life of the country and, in my opinion, are deserving of some consideration on the part of the Government.  Their lot in life has, I think, been worsened more than any other section of the community. The capital invested in the business, which represents their life savings, has been reduced almost to a minimum, and, as has been stated by Deputy Rice, the value of licensed premises at present is very low.  For that, and many other reasons, the House, irrespective of Party politics, should give very favourable consideration to this amendment which has as its object the preservation of a very old industry in this State.</P>

      <P>I beg to support the amendment.  I do not quite understand Deputy Corry's attitude on this matter when he put up a counter hare to the amendment.  What has the price given for barley by the brewers to the farmers to do with this amendment? Nothing at all.  This is a purely revenue matter and has nothing to do with the price given to the farmers by the brewers.  It certainly speaks very badly for the aggressiveness of Deputy Corry if he has to take that price from Messrs.  Guinness for his barley, If he is as aggressive a man in Cork as he is here, why does he take it?  The price of barley has nothing to do with this.  This is a tax put on to fight a war.  It is not contended by anybody that we are under any obligation with regard to war debts.  Hence, there is no moral justification for keeping the tax at its present level, admitting that some tax is necessary for revenue purposes.</P>

I am not concerned as to whether it would be half a million or a million pounds.  I support this amendment for another reason&mdash;on the ground of the public well-being.  In the constituency I represent it is a notorious fact that owing to the high duty on spirits and beer it is impossible to suppress the making of illicit spirits.  This terrible traffic in the making of poteen proceeds there in spite of the greatest activity on the part of the Guards.  I have seen no less than 14 Guards in one small area in one day, but they never caught anybody.  Yet there are hundreds of gallons of illicit spirits being made in that district.  Within the last year in one area in my constituency two men have lost their lives by this horrible practice.  The whole countryside is degraded and debauched by it.  School children have been known to drink it.  They have been found drunk from it.  They had it in a bowl and were drunk from it.</P>

If there is any amendment on this Paper that should be accepted, it is this one. The House should remember that this £5 per barrel is a war tax imposed to pay for the European War.  Nobody can contend that that applies now.  In the second place, in the areas which have been habitually making illicit spirits, this tax has accentuated the practice and the Guards are unable to put it down.  For that reason I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>My old friend and colleague, Deputy McMenamin, I am afraid, is sometimes a little carried away by the tide of his eloquence.  I should like to rebut the suggestion that Donegal is a raging bedlam with poteen.  There are, as in most other counties in Ireland, a few somewhat enterprising persons who rig up the worm from time to time and produce a little illicit spirits, but I do not think Donegal is very much worse in respect of the practice than any other county. I have no doubt that I shall have the cordial support of Deputy McMenamin in that contention.  We have our faults in Donegal; we are fond of taking a chance; but we are no worse in the matter of poteen than many another county.  Deputy McMenamin went on to say that he did not care whether this cost £1,000,000 or £500,000.  To my mind, that is the whole snag.  I must say I expected Deputy Morrissey and Deputy McMenamin to deal more fully with that aspect of the question because, after all, desirable as this arrangement might be, one has to be practical.  Is it practical in existing circumstances to ask the Minister for Finance to forgo £500,000 in the present financial year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Deputy's point, but I expected that Deputy Morrissey, whose name is down to this amendment with that of Deputy Rice, when he rose would have counteracted that suggestion.  I have no doubt the figures are at present lying before the Deputy and that he would have gladly made them available to Deputy Morrissey. I take it the Minister was speaking authoritatively when he mentioned half a million.  I do not think this is a practical proposition. I do not think it is possible to ask the Minister to relinquish so much revenue in the present year.  Deputy Rice spoke of the fact that the unfair taxation on beer has resulted in a very large number of licensed houses going on the market, and selling at a breaking up price.  That is quite true.  Of course the truth is that there are too many licensed houses, and that it <Col N="762" /> would be for the good of trade as a whole, if some equitable scheme could be devised whereby the numbers could be materially reduced.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry spoke trenchantly, as he usually does, on the subject of barley.  It occurred to me when the Deputy was speaking, that, perhaps, one of the most effective ways to increase the price of barley would be to increase the demand for barley, and that if, within reasonable limits, the demand for stout could be increased, it would greatly strengthen the position of barley growers.  The trouble at present is that Messrs.  Guinness and other brewers can get as much barley as they want in Ireland.  Probably there is always a surplus. Where you have a surplus the tendency is for prices to fall.  Barley growers would probably get better prices if there was a better demand for stout.  That would certainly help the situation.  In principle I like this amendment, and for a reason that was not advanced by Deputy Rice or by Deputy Bennett.  I believe it would be greatly to the advantage of the people if everything that could be done were done to make them a beer drinking people rather than a spirit-drinking people.  The number of persons who become chronic drunkards from consuming beer is infinitesimal. In nearly every case where a man has ruined himself or his family through drink, it will be found that he has done it with whiskey and spirits. It is very seldom you find a hopeless drunkard who consumes nothing but beer.  My experience is that the beer drinker does not run at all the same risk of becoming dipsomaniac as the spirit drinker.  I think there were too much spirits consumed in this country in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not the slightest hesitation in saying in public that I would be no party to a reduction in the duty on spirits.  I think the last penny ought to be got out of spirits and I would trust the Civic Guards to get the poteen evil under control.  While the price of spirits should be at the high level at which it has been, it would be a good thing if something practical could be done towards addressing ourselves to the task of getting the price <Col N="763" /> of beer reduced and brought more readily within reach of the ordinary working people.  It is a nutritious drink and in 99 cases out of 100 is harmless.  It is unlike spirits, the nutritive value of which is low, and almost as dangerous as drugs when consumed as medicine.  I could not conscientiously vote for an amendment of this kind for that one reason.  I do not think I could honestly go to the Minister and say drop half a million on the reduction of this duty.  I think the Minister and any Government should address themselves to the task of bringing the price of beer down, and shaping their entire policy towards the licensed trade as one to keep whiskey dear and beer cheap.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this debate will be extremely brief, but I think it desirable, nevertheless, that the point of view of this Party should be explained.  I am concerned in this matter not from the point of view of the brewer or the licensed trader, but for the people who consume intoxicating liquor.  Rightly or wrongly, for good or evil, it is part of the habits of our people to consume beer and stout.  In many of our industries, particularly in our heavy industries, the nutriment value of beer and stout enables many under-paid working men to perform tasks which require considerable physical effort.  I believe that beer and stout are consumed in rural areas at agricultural work, not in excessive quantities, and I believe they help in the performance of tedious and physically difficult tasks. Similarly &ldquo;the docker's pint&rdquo; as it is known is something that means considerable assistance to men requiring the physical prowess necessary for their tasks.  Therefore, whether the State or whether the legislature likes it or not, we are faced with the position that a very large section of our people consume stout and porter.  I do not think there is anything wrong in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one danger to the licensed trade is that there is always the possibility that in an infinitesimal number of cases the use of alcoholic liquor may <Col N="764" /> be abused.  You cannot legislate for border-line cases of that kind.  No legislation that this House could devise could cover cases of the kind, short of the absolute abolition of intoxicating liquor.  If ever legislation contemplated that, the experience of the American people should be remembered.  We saw recently where that nation went &ldquo;wet&rdquo; again, because of the demoralisation produced by the abolition of intoxicating liquor.  I do not think it is desirable for the State to contemplate the abolition of intoxicating liquor.</P>
    <P>The consumption of intoxicating liquor in the form of beer is good for the physique of our people.  I think it is a beverage which they have taken to, and which helps them in many cases in their daily tasks.  From that I go on to ask myself: what is the purpose of heavily taxing beer and stout?  As Deputy McMenamin stated, this tax was imposed during the war atmosphere at a time when there was a considerable inflation and artificial prosperity.  The tax has remained substantially the same since that period of inflation and artificial prosperity.  Taking the standpoint that many of the working people take intoxicating liquor in the form of beer and stout, which nobody has any right to deprive them of, when it is taken in reasonable moderation, I ask whether it is right and fair to legislate by a method of taxation so that liquor will be available for the person who has sufficient money to buy it, but not available for the person who has not sufficient money to do so?  The consumption of these liquors represented a certain proportion of the domestic expenditure of ordinary workers.  That was in the period of inflation and artificial prosperity. Their expenditure on intoxicating liquors represents a certain sum of money in their domestic budget, but it is a very much greater fraction now than the fraction which entered into their budget at the time the tax was imposed.</P>
    <P>In a period when wages are falling, it seems to me not unreasonable that a person whose taste and avocation is <Col N="765" /> such as to encourage him to drink beer or stout in moderation, that he is reasonably entitled to submit to the legislature a claim for some reduction in the cost of refreshment which, in many cases, he is often compelled to take in substitution of food, and which is an aid to him in his physical tasks. That is the standpoint from which I view the matter.  I am not concerned with the viewpoint of the brewers' profit or the licensed traders' output. I am concerned from one standard only, namely, the working class people whose wages are so low as to make it impossible for them to partake in reasonable moderation of beer and spirits.  If they are entitled to take beer and spirits, as it seems to me they are, just as those better endowed with this world's goods are entitled to do so, I see no reason whatever for the legislature imposing such taxation on beer and stout as to make it prohibitive for workers to obtain reasonable quantities of that liquor, while, at the same time, greater taxation does not debar wealthy persons from having as much as they need and, perhaps, on occasions, much more than they need.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Norton I do not intend to occupy the time of the House at any great length, and my speech will be all the shorter owing to the fact that Deputy Norton has forestalled a good many of the things that I would like to have said.  Now, in the first place, we have got to look at this country as it is in its present position.  It is a fact that the workmen in this State do drink stout.  That is the ordinary drink they take.  It is good to face that fact readily.  I do not think that the most rabid temperance reformer would, at present, contend, or would have contended for some years past, that there had been an excessive consumption of stout by the working classes in this State.  If that be the case, and if the real wages of the workmen are falling then I do not see any argument which can be put forward against the acceptance of this amendment by the Minister.  Deputy Dillon appeared to me to argue against the amendment, but he did so in such a fashion that until the very close of his speech I certainly was of the opinion that he was in favour of it.  The ground that Deputy Dillon put forward for voting against this amendment appeared to me to be the sort of ground which, under normal conditions, would not be the class of argument which would appeal to any person with the intellectual abilities which Deputy Dillon possesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take Deputy Dillon's attitude. It is this.  &ldquo;I would support this on every ground, as most desirable, but the Minister for Finance says that it would cost half a million and that is final.&rdquo;  In other words now we have it that Deputy Dillon must cease, and already has ceased to think and must sit down <Col N="767" /> in admiration of the Minister for Finance and say: &ldquo;We have this or that on the <i>ipse dixit</i> of the Minister for Finance.  Rome has spoken and Deputy Dillon must remain completely silent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was very brief, if not curt, in his reply. He did not really deal with the problem at all.  He came out with a statement: &ldquo;This will cost £500,000.&rdquo; I question that the acceptance of this amendment would cost the State £500,000 or anything at all. It is sometimes well to look about and to see what has happened in other countries.  Look at what happened recently in England.  When the beer tax was put so high that it was impossible for people in England to purchase beer, the revenue, instead of increasing, diminished, as any ordinary person who ever studied the first principles of political economy would have concluded would happen.  If you get a tax that is too high upon any article, or if it is at that particular position, and you increase it, then instead of increasing your revenue it simply decreases it.  That is the A.B.C. of public finance which I would have thought anyone, and particularly Deputy Dillon, would have mastered. Exactly the same thing that has happened in England happened here.  It is quite true this year there has been no increase in the taxation upon stout and porter.  But there has been a steady lessening of the purchasing power of the community and this tax has now become a tax much heavier than the commodity can bear.  In consequence if the tax remains as it is, at the present moment, the drop in revenue next year will be enormous, and that will be because consumption has dropped owing to the fact that people have not got the money now to buy.  That seems to me also to be the A.B.C. of this matter.  No one will contend that the State and the individuals in the State are as rich now as they were two years ago.  But supposing that you cut down the tax and <Col N="768" /> that where the people paid 8d. before they will pay 7d. for the future, it is quite on the cards that the consumption will remain as large next year as it is this year and that there will be no loss or, at the most, very trivial loss in revenue.  If consumption goes down, as it may go down to between one-quarter or one-eighth of what it was last year, there will be a very desperate fall in revenue.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not in the slightest way told us upon what basis he has estimated this loss of £500,000 a year. Let me look at this from another point of view.  We have heard a great deal about the workingman and the loss to him of his pint of stout and his inability to pay for it.  I am not going to repeat those arguments.  They have already been put before the House but I am looking at it from another point of view.  Take the ordinary man who is not a workingman in the usually accepted term.  Take the ordinary clerk or somebody of that kind with a very small income.  That man was accustomed for very many years to have the little luxury of a bottle of stout every day for his dinner and I do not think that anybody ought to grudge him that.  Now, when his income is tumbling down and everything else is going up in price he has got, possibly, to cut off that bottle of stout.  That would be a very real hardship on him.  If he were to get his bottle of stout at 7d instead of paying for it, as he is, 8d. it would be possible for him to have that small indulgence which nobody would grudge him.</P>

That reduction actually would do no harm to the morale of his case, because more revenue would actually come if this tax were reduced.  I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  I would impress upon Deputy Dillon also to think again and to think better than he did a few minutes ago.</P>

      <P>Possibly the final decision upon this amendment must be deferred until the Minister for Finance gives us a little more detail as to how he arrives at his figure of £500,000.  But I certainly cannot feel that this is a year in which we could afford to risk losing any such sum as £500,000.  When I hear the Cumann na nGaedheal Party so strongly defending the principle of this amendment I cannot help wondering why they did not make a reduction when they were in office themselves and when the risk of the loss of revenue could have been taken much more reasonably than it could be taken at the present moment.  I also cannot help wondering why the Cumann na nGaedheal Party did not offer some suggestion as to an alternative source of revenue.  They oppose economies on the one hand, and they oppose taxation on the other.</P>

They are taking the risk now of wiping out an income of £500,000 in the Revenue at a time when everybody has to bear a sacrifice.

      <P>I have not much to say on this amendment; but it is rather amusing to see the stand the Cumann na nGaedheal Party are taking on it. They say that the country could well afford to pay that £500,000 now, but on their showing it could much better afford to make the reduction a year or two ago.  Why did they not make that reduction then?  At the moment they are playing politics.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was the Minister for Justice here two years ago and if such an amendment were introduced at that time he would brush it aside with a wave of his hand.  When in office they always got a member of their own Party&mdash;or at least a member of their own Party got up&mdash;to introduce an amendment and after making the necessary propagandist speeches the amendment was withdrawn.</P>

I think if the amendment suggested by the Opposition Party were accepted by the Minister he would not have one penny piece left in the Budget now for social services of any kind in the country. That would be the position if all the amendments suggested by the Opposition were accepted.  I suggest that it is unfair to delay the time of the House here for no reason than for propagandist purposes.

      <P>At that time, we had Cumann na nGaedheal advocates standing up here saying he could not and asking for a reduction.  They were making speeches then for propagandist purposes.  This amendment is nothing else but propaganda.  It was taken up by Deputy Rice to play up to a certain section of the community.  If an alternative method could be shown as to where the £500,000 necessary could be got, I would not mind reducing the price of the pint of stout, but in the absence of any other suggestion it is plain that the Minister has to find the money to balance his Budget, and it is better to take it out of this source. Deputies opposite told us that this was a warlike method.  It was a war tax during the time Deputy Cosgrave was in office.  It was kept up long after the war was over.  The claim made <Col N="772" /> now could have been put up every day just as much as to-day.  But very little recognition was then given by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government to the arguments that were made to-day by Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies.  In the absence of any other means of finding the money to balance the Budget the money must be got in this way and it is better to get it in this way than to tax the absolute necessities of life, and that is what would have to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will speak again because if he leaves this debate with the contribution made already I must say that he would be treating the House with scant courtesy. The Minister has suggested that if this amendment were accepted there would be a fall in revenue receipts of £500,000.  I think it is usual for the Minister for Finance in dealing with a matter of this kind to give some reasons and figures to justify the arguments he puts forward.  The Minister has done nothing of the kind here.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about the danger of a loss of half a million in the revenue of this year.  I pointed out that on the present scale of taxation and, as I suggested, owing to the present excessive scale of taxation, there was a loss in the last year for which we have the figures of half a million.  The estimated loss for the present year on excise is £423,000. I do not think that the main consideration before this House ought to be, as I have said already, the fact that there will be a certain loss of revenue and I am not intimidated by the views of those people who say that the loss in revenue would be accompanied by an increased consumption because I do not think that any national evil would be brought about by an increased consumption in beer or stout.  The people who want to drink to excess will do it whatever the price may be.  If you introduce not merely taxation to crush this industry but prohibition, as was tried in America, the people who want to drink to excess will continue to do so and they will drink in spite of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> The way this subject has been treated by the Fianna Fáil Party is rather extraordinary but quite comprehensible.  Deputy Corry gets up and indulges in a diatribe about the brewers.  Not one word was said by me, in introducing this amendment, about the brewers, and no benefit could possibly be derived by the brewers through the passage of this amendment.  Some advantage might be got by the farmers, whom Deputy Corry says he is so anxious to serve.  We had the usual exhibition from the Centre Party of a sympathetic speech coupled with an intimation that the vote is not to follow the sympathy.  Deputy MacDermot, who is the leader of that Party, resents that I said last week that that was the usual attitude of the Centre Party, but we have had another illustration of it to-day. Deputy Dillon has made a most sympathetic speech but is going to vote against it, and, as I suggested last week, we will have again the performance put on the records of this House of people making sympathetic speeches but voting in the opposite direction so that the people who do not like the speech can read the vote and those who do not like the vote can read the speech.  I do not think that is the proper attitude to be indulged in by representatives in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cleary spoke on the subject of why the late Government did not reduce these duties.  I thought I answered that argument in introducing this amendment when I said that one great argument in favour of this amendment was the reduced purchasing power of the people.  At the time when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in power the people were able to pay those prices.  At least, they were far better able to pay them than they are now.  It is no argument against this amendment being carried to-day to say that this reform in taxation was not introduced four or five years ago.  The people are not able to pay now in the way that they were able to pay four or five years ago, or, to bring it down to a closer date, that they were able to pay <Col N="774" /> up to the month of February, 1932.  It is certainly a somewhat extraordinary attitude for the Centre Party to take up to oppose this amendment, because it is an amendment in favour, mainly, of the people who returned the Centre Party to this House.</P>

      <P>The estimate which I gave to the House as my principal reason&mdash;a reason which I think is unanswerable&mdash;for rejecting this amendment has been challenged. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that even if the consumption remained as large as last year there would be no loss.  I hope I am not doing the Deputy any injustice.  I think I heard him correctly.  I think that is what he did say, that even if the consumption remained as large as last year there would be no loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make myself clear.  That is not the effect of what I said.  The Minister is taking one sentence out of a paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did gather that the Deputy was arguing that there would be no loss and that the figure of £500,000 which I submitted to the House was an incorrect one and was without any foundation.  The quantity of beer consumed in the Twenty-Six Counties last year was over 660,000 barrels of 32 gallons.  This amendment deals with barrels of 32 gallons, and the approximate effect of it is to reduce the duty paid per barrel by £1. 660,000 multiplied by one gives £660,000, which would be the loss to the Exchequer if the consumption were <Col N="775" /> maintained at the same level as last year.  On the other hand, it is probable, or possible, that there might be a slight increase in consumption.  I should like to safeguard myself and say that it is possible, but I do not believe it is probable.  It is possible because the decline in the consumption of beer and spirits has not been due so much to a change in the economic conditions of the people but rather to a change in the tastes of the people.  A new generation has been growing up since the war, a generation who, at the outset of their careers, found that the purchase of alcoholic drinks cost much more than they were prepared to pay. In addition they have a greater variety of occupations and amusements; the picture houses, motor cars, buses and a great many other things that were not available to preceding generations are now available to the present generation. If we take these things into consideration, it is very probable that there would be no significant increase in the quantity of been and spirits consumed in this country if we reduced the duty by £1 a barrel.  But, for the purpose of argument, let us assume that there was an increase of, say, ten per cent. in consumption, the net loss to the Exchequer as a consequence of accepting this amendment would be, I repeat, not less than half a million, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney shakes his head.  I suppose he is still of the same opinion notwithstanding the facts which cannot be contradicted and which will be available to the Deputy inside six months when the figures are available.  He still shakes his head and is firm in the belief that no loss will arise to the revenue if we accept this amendment.  The only basis on which he could found that would be that the increase in consumption would be so large as to wipe out the loss. The yield last year was something like £2,450,000.  Deduct from that the amount of £1 a barrel in the reduction of beer duty which, as I pointed out, would amount to £660,000 and we are left with a net yield, on the basis of present consumption, with £1,790,000. We have got to make that up to the former figure of £2,450,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> In order to do that, the consumption of beer and stout and porter in this State would have to increase by 37 per cent.  I do not think any person with any business experience is going to say that if you reduce the price of a commodity by, I think, something like 14 per cent. you are going to get an increase of 37 per cent. in consumption&mdash;not if the population remains sober.  Therefore, I again say that if the Deputy will examine the position as I have stated it to him he will have to admit that there will be a very significant loss, and I am putting that loss at £500,000.  The question is if the House is going to vote for this amendment, and the Revenue is going to lose £500,000, what are we going to do to redress the balance?  Are we going to curtail any single one of our present services?  This is a dilemma out of which there is no escape.  On the one hand we have at the present moment the things we do for the people; on the other hand there is the money we have to get in order that those things should be done. If we decide that we are going to drop £500,000 of that money, collected in a certain way, we have either got to reduce certain of the social services, we have to economise in education, we have to economise in the police, we have to economise in the old age pensions, we have to economise in some activity of the Government, or else we have to find £500,000 in some other way.  Deputy Norton has adopted the attitude of Pilate in this matter.  He says: &ldquo;I do not care for £500,000.  I am going to vote for this amendment, which is going to cost the Exchequer that sum, but after I have done that I have no further responsibility.  The Minister for Finance is a financial wizard.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance or any other person in this House cannot find £500,000 out of nothing.  It has to come from somewhere, out of some pocket in this State.  It has either to come out of the taxpayers' pockets in the form of increased taxation or in the form of increased duty on tea or some other necessary of life, or it has got to come out of the pockets of <Col N="777" /> the old age pensioners, of the school teachers, of the Gárda Síochána and of every one of the public servants, whom the Deputies on the other side were so vocal in defending last year; and the saving we would have to make then would not be of the order of £280,000, but £500,000 or possibly more.</P>

      <P>They have either to vote to maintain our present revenue, and to maintain our present social services with it, or if they vote to reduce our present revenue then that vote is a vote for the reduction of the present social services and nothing else.  It is not sufficient for a Deputy, merely in order that he might catch a little passing popularity, to get up and say that he believes the poor man's pint should be reduced if he is going to make the Exchequer bear the cost of the reduction&mdash;if, in fact, the increase in the cost of beer and the increase in the cost of spirits is entirely due to the present duties which those commodities bear.  I do not know whether Deputy Norton or any of the other Deputies in the House have considered what the pre-war position was in regard to beer and spirits.  Pre-war whiskey was retarled at 4d. a glass and of that 4d. duty represented 2d.  The duty on whiskey now amounts to 10¼d., but the price of whiskey has gone up to 1/8. Surely there is a margin there for reduction if reduction is necessary or if reduction is desirable.

      <P>There was a question that I wanted to put to Deputy Norton, if he were here, or to members of the Labour Party, who when protectionist measures were submitted to the Dáil were urging the Government to take measures to deal with profiteering. Now they come along here and say that the price of the pint must be reduced by 1d., and must be reduced as I have already pointed out, at the expense of the State, which inevitably means either at the expense of the taxpayer, <Col N="779" /> direct or indirect, or else at the expense of those who are in the employment of the State or enjoying some benefits or advantages in the form of social services.  If this reduction is essential, even to meet the point of view which Deputy Norton purported to express, the point of view of the poor man, they do not for a moment consider whether that reduction might not be made at the expense of some other person, or some other party or some other interest, rather than at the expense of the State.  That comes from a Party which is concerned to stop profiteering, when it would seem to me that, on the figures at any rate which I have put to the Dáil, there is a prima facie case for asking whether the people who are taking this 4d. a pint now out of the trade are justified in taking so much at all.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  I do not think it is necessary to give any lengthy explanation of it.  The purpose of it is to reduce the period by which the Seanad can hold up a measure once it has passed the Dáil.  As Deputies are aware, the Constitution at the present time provides that when a Bill, having passed the Dáil, is sent to the Seanad, and the Seanad does not pass it&mdash; either neglects to take action upon it or insists upon amendments to which the Dáil cannot agree&mdash;a period of 18 months must elapse before the Dáil has any remedy; that is, unless a dissolution <Col N="780" /> should intervene.  When the period of 18 months from the date on which the Bill is first sent to the Seanad has passed, the Dáil may, by resolution, send the Bill back and, if the Seanad does not then pass it, the Dáil by another resolution can pass the Bill into law.  That means that a period of 20 months may have to elapse before the will of the elected representatives of the people can be made effective.  Now, 20 months is a considerable period in the life of a single administration.  I think we can say that the average life of a single parliament is not likely to be more than four years.  I fancy that is putting the average rather high.  Therefore, you have 20 months out of a period of four years in which the expressed will of the people may be obstructed by a body not immediately responsible to the people.  That body has a longer period of office than the Dáil and the members of it may deliberately set themselves out to negative the expressed desire of the people.</P>
      <P>We have had an instance of that ourselves. We had the Oath Bill which was before our people for a long period.  Nobody could say that the desire of the people to get rid of that Oath was simply a transient whim.  It represented a definite, well-ascertained state of public opinion.  A Government, in the election of which that was one of the primary issues, had just been elected, yet this Second Assembly deliberately refused to agree to the passage of that Bill after it had been passed here and submitted, so to speak, to a referendum of the people. As I have said, 20 months is a considerable period in what we may regard as the normal life of a parliament and in these days, when it is important that measures that deal with matters immediately and urgently affecting the welfare of the people should find expression as quickly as may be in appropriate legislation, it is unfair that a Second House, constituted as our Second Chamber is, should be in a position to flout the people's will and prevent measures which are deemed necessary by those who are directly responsible to the people from being made law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> The history of this particular clause is somewhat interesting.  I have seen the original drafts of the Constitution as presented by the Committees that were working on it at the time the Constitution was being framed.  There were three drafts.  A period of 180 days occurred in two of them and in the third a period of four months was mentioned.  The intention was that there would be one preliminary month in which the Bill presented to the Seanad was to be discussed, and then a delaying period of three months.  In the Constitution, as passed by the Dáil, a period of 270 days was allowed, but that was in conjunction with a referendum.  The referendum was taken away.  It was taken away by an Executive that realised that the referendum was not likely to be used. The Second House, which was largely nominated by that Executive, had uniformly, until the time the present Administration took office, assisted that Executive and assisted it even when there was every reason to believe that the Executive did not have the support of the majority of the people.  It was friendly to that Executive.</P>
    <P>That Executive, looking to the future, and seeing the possibility that they would no longer command a majority here, made up its mind that it was going to strengthen the delaying and obstructing powers of the Second House.  It brought in a Bill here which took away the power of referring to the people legislation which the Second House did not agree to&mdash;a power which, as I have said, was never likely to be used, and, in fact, never was used.  It took away a power the Seanad did not propose to use and gave in its place a really effective weapon, a weapon that it foresaw could be used if a new Administration more amenable to public opinion took its place.  They changed this period of 270 days into a period of 18 months, with an added period of two months.  At the time that Bill was proposed, and in the Committee which, previous to the introduction of the Bill, considered the advisability of certain constitutional changes, on behalf of our organisation, and expressing my own views, I <Col N="782" /> opposed the lengthening of the time for which the Seanad could obstruct.  In the Dáil I proposed that the period should be reduced to four months. This Bill provides for a period of three months, during which time the Seanad can discuss a Bill, make whatever recommendations it chooses, and point out the defects in any proposed legislation so that if it is advisable to revise opinions they can be revised; but after that period of three months, if the Dáil is desirous of getting the legislation through, it will pass a resolution, and the Bill will go back again to the Seanad.  If the Seanad, within the further period of two months, does not pass the measure, then it can be deemed to be law by a resolution of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is a period then of five months in this Bill and, in my opinion, and in the opinion of the Executive Council, that is sufficiently long to enable the Seanad as a revising Chamber to do its work effectively.  If greater powers of delay are given to the Seanad, it seems to us that it is no longer a revising but a controlling Chamber.  I do not think that anybody here wishes that a Second Chamber, constituted as our Chamber is, should have powers of control.  There is another feature in our Constitution which makes inappropriate the argument that we usually find about Second Chambers.  The suggestion is that they are necessary in order to prevent sudden changes of public opinion doing permanent damage; that it gives time for public opinion to cool down and prevents violent changes.  In our case, we have a system of proportional representation which in itself prevents violent change; and with a system of proportional representation, such as we have, it is quite unnecessary, in fact it is positively wrong, to give the Second Chamber powers of lengthy delay.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy MacDermot has an amendment down to this motion. It has not been formally moved, but, I take it, it will be before the House, and I might just anticipate it as it is on the Order Paper.  The suggestion is that the Dáil should refuse to give a Second <Col N="783" /> Reading to this Bill until the final proposals of the Government with regard to the Seanad are made known.  Our attitude towards the Seanad, as at present constituted, is, I think, well known.  My own view is that it serves no really useful purpose; that there is a waste of public money in maintaining it.  There is a sum of £28,000 in the estimates directly for it.  As for incidentals, I did not get a closer calculation in connection with this Bill, but I remember that formerly, as a result of a calculation which I had carefully made at the time, the cost of the Seanad was given as between £30,000 and £40,000.  I think it was nearer to £40,000 at that time than £30,000.  I think that is quite true.  I think that the cost of the present Seanad is such that we must have a much more valuable body from the point of view of its constitution than we have at present; a body that will have differentiated functions; a body that will not be a mere reflection of this House, as the present Assembly is bound to be.</P>
    <P>I think that the Seanad, as at present constituted, is not worth the money; that it has no really useful function, and does not, in fact, perform any really useful function&mdash;any function which could not as well be performed by a Committee of this House, or something of that sort.  So that, as far as the Executive Council is concerned, we intend to bring in proposals to end the present Seanad, at any rate.  The question that has caused delay is whether we should substitute another form of Second Chamber for it.  I confess that there have been considerable difficulties.  I have myself, from time to time, given the matter a certain amount of thought, but I have found considerable difficulty in getting a constitution for a Second Chamber that would really make it worth while.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the powers of a Second Chamber ought to be those that would compel reexamination, prevent sudden action by the Dáil, hasty action; action, let us say, overnight, if such could happen. It would mean a certain revision of opinion, a revising Chamber.  But it <Col N="784" /> would be very much more valuable, of course, if we could have a Chamber with differentiated functions.  I think it is absurd to have a mere reflex, as I have said, of this Chamber.  I do not think it is going to have any really useful function at all.  I can imagine types of Seanad that would have a useful function.  To make a constitution for them, and to get them properly elected is the difficulty.  I can imagine a Seanad, for instance, in which the members would represent vocational groups.  The difficulty there would be to get the constitution of these groups and a mode of election which would give us a Seanad of reasonable dimensions.  By reasonable dimensions I mean a Seanad that would not consist of more than, say, 35 members, which, I think, would be sufficiently large for our purpose.  I give that just to indicate the lines along which I have been thinking&mdash;about 35 or 40 members, if we were to have a Second House.  I have no difficulty in coming to a conclusion myself as regards a Seanad, that if we cannot get a Seanad which is completely different in its constitution, so different that it could not be at all said to be a reflex of this House, it would hardly be worth having.</P>
    <P>There is a Senate besides the type of vocational Senate I have indicated, a Senate that would consist of experts of one kind or another.  There have been Senates in the past composed of those who had immediate experience in public administration. Again, we have the difficulty there of the election of such a Senate.  I must confess that at present, if we were compelled to take action quickly, if we were compelled to bring in a Bill within a very short period, the type of Bill we would have to bring in would be simply a Bill for the abolition of the Seanad, without any alternative; that is, to have, instead of the present two-Chamber system, a single Chamber. We then get immediately into the question of constitutional theory. There is no doubt that there are differences of opinion as to whether two Chambers are necessary or not, and whether they are valuable or not. Again, as far as I am concerned at any rate, that would depend on <Col N="785" /> what type the Second Chamber is.  I am not at all impressed by some of the arguments put forward by those who write on constitutional matters in advocating a Second Chamber.  I think they largely apply to a period that is gone, and to conditions which are very different from our conditions. I can well understand a Second Chamber, for instance, where there is a federal system.  The direct representation of States, as apart from peoples, can be effected in that manner.  It is helpful in giving to the States represented the feeling that they are units with equal rights, no matter how they may differ in size, in wealth, and in other ways.  In a unitary State conditions are quite different.  I do not think there is anything gained in these States by a Second Chamber unless, as I have several times indicated, that Second Chamber has a character all its own.  The position, therefore, is that, without wishing finally to pronounce on the question of a Second Chamber, we are coming here to prevent the Chamber that exists from interfering with the expressed will of the people.  That is our attitude.  I hope it will commend itself to the members of the Dáil, and I hope that the Deputy who proposes to delay will realise that delaying action in this matter might possibly mean rushing another question, on which it would be just as well more time were taken and the immediate position remedied.  I promise that we will not allow the matter to be delayed unduly and that the present position will be met adequately by this proposal.  I also think that this proposal has the support of the people of the country as a whole.  We made it quite clear at the last election that the Seanad as at present constituted would not remain if our will was to be effective.  That is our view, and I have expressed it here, and I have expressed it in public.  It was the wish of the people at the last election.  They did not hold any views contrary to ours in this matter. I accordingly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the words <Col N="786" />&ldquo;the Dáil declines to give a second reading to this Bill pending disclosure of the Government's final proposals regarding the future of the Seanad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The last part of the President's speech, with a great deal of which incidentally I agree, made it plain that the Government have not got a considered policy in this matter; that what they are now presenting us with is but a bit of piecemeal legislation.  I do not think I should be unfair if I described this Bill as a piece of Party politics.  If we were going to remould the Constitution so far as the Seanad was concerned in the proper spirit I think we should go about it by having a Committee appointed representative of the Parties in this House and in the other House and that we should try to arrive at a solution in the most dispassionate manner that we could possibly do.  What is happening here now is that a Bill is being introduced for the purpose of brushing a noisome insect out of the Government's path which it does not like to see there.  But what they are doing really bears no relation to their ultimate views as to what the Constitution of this country ought to be with regard to a Second Chamber. Moreover, this Bill does not appear to me to bear any relation to the policy announced by the President at the time of the General Election in respect to the Seanad.  I understood that policy was that either the Seanad should be abolished or that its personnel should be improved; as the President put it just now that a Second Chamber should be created which was not a mere reflex of the Dáil but something essentially sui generis in its character, and that policy amongst other things was advocated on the ground of the expense of the present Seanad, an expense which was to be got rid of either by abolishing the Seanad, or by reducing the numbers.  This Bill does not reduce the expense of the Seanad by one penny piece; it does not abolish the Seanad.  On the contrary, by weakening the Seanad, <Col N="787" /> by putting it in the position that it cannot serve as a serious obstacle to the Government's designs, you will remove perhaps one of the chief dangers to the continued existence of the Seanad, and make it so weak that it is hardly worth anyone's while abolishing it.  Certainly it is not going to improve the personnel of the Seanad but to degrade it by reducing its powers and to make it a less interesting body for a man of ability to belong to.</P>
    <P>I have been looking over a debate that took place in the Seanad in February, 1928, when the representative of the Labour Party, Senator O'Farrell, moved that a Committee be appointed to examine into the method of election to the Seanad, and I find that the only Fianna Fáil Senator who I think made a speech, Senator Colonel Moore, went so far as to say: &ldquo;I do not think anybody would agree that the powers of the Seanad should be diminished.&rdquo; Senator O'Farrell of the Labour Party made some remarks which I should like to take the liberty of reading to the House.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it is desirable, necessary and proper that the House itself should be taken into consultation before such legislation takes definite shape.  The wisdom, apart from the constitutional propriety of such a course, should be obvious to any statesman.  I am not going to waste time by making a complaint.  The Seanad itself has important duties and responsibilities in this respect. It is one of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, created by the Saorstát Constitution, and it is its obvious duty to be exceedingly vigilant in regard to any attempt contrary to the letter and spirit of the Constitution to weaken the position of the Chamber actually or relatively, or to take away from it rights, powers and responsibilities conferred by that Constitution.  We are the custodians of all that Constitution has conferred on the Seanad, whether by way of power or responsibility, and we shall be rightly held accountable by the nation for the manner in which we <Col N="788" /> discharge and preserve these Constitutional powers and responsibilities. In every human institution there will be found odd individuals who are prepared, perhaps, to impair or surrender its birthright if thereby they can ensure for themselves permanent membership of that institution. It is against any move of that kind that those who wish to preserve this as a dignified, useful national body will have to guard.  Whatever our individual views may be as to the necessity for a Second Chamber, I think we would all agree that if there is to be a Second Chamber at all it should not be a mere make-believe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I make these two preliminary objections to the Bill (1) that it is not generated in the right atmosphere; that it is really a measure of Party politics; and (2) that it is not in accord with the policy indicated by the Government at the time of the General Election when they promised either to abolish the Seanad or to improve it. On the contrary, they are doing something to degrade it.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a few remarks about the powers of a Second Chamber and the personnel of a Second Chamber. It will not be maintained that the powers of our present Second Chamber are unusually large.  I hold that they are on the low side.  We know that there are certain countries, including the Republics of France and America, where the Seanad's powers are enormously greater than they are here.  Here their powers are not unusual, and, it seems to me, that a very strong case should be made out before we embark upon reducing them below what they are at present.  It certainly is not worth while to have the Second Chamber merely for the purpose of making drafting amendments and doing the sort of work which could be very well done by some further development or extension of our Committee system.  It is not worth having a Second Chamber at all unless it interferes with major matters and matters of principle.  The President suggested that there had been some developments in recent years <Col N="789" /> which had removed some of the needs for having a Second Chamber.  He mentioned, in our own case, Proportional Representation as one.  Is it true that Proportional Representation has abolished the danger of violent change?  It is quite true that Proportional Representation results in smaller majorities than otherwise might be the case.  But so long as that majority is held pledge-bound, and so long as we have a system prevailing of the members of big Parties signing a pledge to vote with their Party, can it be said that Proportional Representation is a guarantee against violent change, and that the case for a Second Chamber has disappeared?  It seems to me that a system of pledge-bound Parties is an argument that ought to be taken into account in considering whether we should have a Second Chamber or not.</P>
    <P>There has been a change in recent years in all countries which, to my mind, has tended more in favour of a Second Chamber than against it, and that change is the appalling habit of public extravagance which grew up everywhere during the war and as an aftermath of the war.  At the time when the principle &ldquo;no taxation without representation&rdquo; made its first appearance, unrepresentative bodies were thought to be a danger to the taxpayer. The unrepresentative body was feared as likely to impose burdens on the taxpayer. Now it is the representative bodies that are ruthless in imposing taxation.  One would now think it probable that non-representative bodies if they had the power would do something to check extravagance and to reduce taxation.  We have in this State an extraordinary situation.  We have seen that while the Seanad is absolutely impotent to reduce expenditure it is able to nip in the bud any efforts of the Government to establish economy.  The Seanad can throw out the Economies Bill but it is not able to do anything to keep taxation down to a reasonable figure. I suggest that when we come to apply our minds to the sort of Second Chamber we want to have, serious consideration should be given to the question whether it ought not to be a body that has more power in regard to <Col N="790" /> finance than our Second Chamber has and, also, whether the method of selecting the personnel ought not to be affected by that consideration.</P>
    <P>As regards the personnel of the Seanad I quite agree with the President that the present system is unsatisfactory. The Seanad is bound to become, as years go on, a mere reflex of the Dáil by the method of election now introduced.  I must say I think it was a mistake to introduce that method of election.  I think the former method, even though it did not work well, was preferable to the present method, and I think steps could be taken that would make it work better. The present method is not a method that promises at all to make the Seanad a satisfactory body.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell alluded to the present methods in the same speech. He said: &ldquo;By restricting the electorate in the manner suggested by certain proposals which have got a good deal of publicity, I can see a grave danger of the Seanad becoming a sort of convalescent home for retired businessmen.&rdquo; And he went on to describe those men as people able to subscribe liberally to the Party funds.  I think nowadays no one can subscribe liberally to Party funds, but the danger is rather of its becoming a kind of convalescent home for people who might have been charges on the Party funds.  At any rate the present method of election is not one likely to produce a body which as regards its character and opinions is other than a mere reflex of the Dáil, and if you reduce the powers of the Seanad as proposed in this Bill you make it less attractive for men of ability and render it even more unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>With regard to the expense of the Seanad, I throw out the suggestion that perhaps it might be reduced by making payment depend upon attendance rather than fixing an annual salary and expecting that necessarily the Seanad is to provide a year's income for each of its members.  It seems to me that such a scale of fees might be established as might be thought reasonable which would be paid to those attending the meetings of the Seanad.  I should like to see the <Col N="791" /> Seanad a non-professional body&mdash;non-professional in the sense that people in it would not be whole-time politicians. I should like to see it having a certain distinction from the more popular assembly&mdash;the Dáil&mdash;in which most of us have practically got to be whole-time politicians because our duties demand it of us.</P>
    <P>I have little more to add to what I have already said.  I want to make this point: if I had to choose between the abolition of the Seanad outright and this present Bill I would much more readily support a Bill to abolish the Seanad outright than a Bill to degrade it as this Bill proposes to do.  But before you abolish the Seanad outright you have to consider that on the whole the political experience of mankind seems to tell in favour of a Second Chamber.  I think in Europe only Spain, Bulgaria and Turkey are single Chamber countries.  You have to bear in mind the considerations I have mentioned in regard to finance and whether it would not be an extremely good thing to have a Second Chamber that would act as a sort of watchdog on the public purse.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have stated I move the amendment standing on the Paper in my name, and I oppose the present Bill as one likely to make our Constitution, if it were adopted, worse instead of better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this Bill.  It seems to me that the President, having for many years made his twenty-four-hours'-a-day attempt to bring this State and people into contempt is in no way failing at the moment to continue that work.  This is a proposal, based so far as I can make out from what he says, on his objection to what he calls the attempt of the Seanad to oppose the will of the people.  What the President is proposing is that, at whatever periods at which we have a general election here, whatever Party gets a majority can in the most radical and most revolutionary way proceed to make any alterations that suit their whim at the moment without any check even in the way of delay.  Deputy MacDermot referred to the fact that <Col N="792" /> most countries have a Second Chamber as a result of cumulative political wisdom but we are going to be in the position in this country not merely of effectively having no Second Chamber, but having the most demagogic condition of any State I ever heard of.  In most countries the fundamental law, the Constitution, cannot be changed by ordinary legislative action.  When we brought in the Constitution at first, certain difficulties were made with regard to changing it but a period was arranged during which changes could be made.  When we had been governing for some time it became apparent that, in 1922, when the Constitution was being drawn up, no body of men could conceivably have adverted to every possible difficulty that might arise in the future and no body of men could foresee how any clause of the Constitution might actually be a great handicap to the country, so that we arranged, and the position is now, that as an ordinary act of legislation, the fundamental law of this country can be changed.  So far we have had a certain protection in that in an election held&mdash;and the President knows as well as I do that the people certainly do not in voting take the trouble to think around elaborate theories of government&mdash;the people voted for a certain body of men, but now a body of men can come in and change the fundamental law at their whim.  As Deputy MacDermot has asked, what does this talk of proportional representation amount to?  In 1922 and in 1923 and in June and September, 1927, the people of this country voted for Cumann na nGaedheal.  In 1931, they voted for Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1933 also.  The President has proposed that this proportional representation system is a sufficient protection to the people.  It is nothing of the sort.  The President's Party has a majority of one over the other Parties here and he comes here and tries to suggest to us that the <Col N="793" /> people, having given the matter considerable thought, solemnly voted for his Party in order to abolish the Seanad.  I am not going to deny that you might very easily get the people to propose the abolition of the Seanad, because it is too much to expect the people of this country or any other country, when they are preoccupied with their affairs of daily life, and more interested in those aspects of politics that more clearly and obviously affect their daily lives, to give very serious consideration to the methods and forms of government.  That is a subject on which every demagogue can go out and get the support of the people, but when the President comes along and talks about the will of the people expressed in the election, I can equally say that, in 1922, in 1923 and in 1927, twice, the people, for that matter, voted strongly in favour of retaining the Seanad and voted more strongly than they did against it in the last election.  But the President proposes that, every time the whim of the people changes, the whole radical government of this country, the fundamental law and every law, can be changed at the whim of any Government put into power and he knows perfectly well, because he has done it himself, that a party can go out to the people and make any sort of wild promises and get elected and then come in here and cynically throw those promises on one side and the Government is going to have absolute power and no hindrance.  The President's proposal is, in effect, to set up a dictatorship. Deputy MacDermot speaks against this Bill and I speak on it, but what does it matter?  The President has his votes there and the Government is as absolute a Government as exists in any country in Europe.  In fact, I will say that it is more absolute than exists in any country in Europe, because I do not know of any country in which, by the mere operation of a small majority, the fundamental law of the country can be changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Cumann na <Col N="794" /> nGaedheal changed it often and I agree also that it is necessary, over a period of years, that it should be possible, and it should not be made impossible, to change the fundamental law because that law was drawn up at a time when one had not had years of experience to see the sort of thing that might turn up.  Cumann na nGaedheal was elected in 1927 and, when it made a proposal, it had to go before a Seanad that had been elected, some in 1922 and some in 1925 and some, possibly, at some other time.  It meant&mdash;at least, there was the safeguard&mdash;that we had not merely to go out to the country and get a sort of catch majority and then come in and proceed radically to change things. There was, at least, the safeguard that there was a body which could prevent that action being taken and which was representative of the people, either directly or indirectly, not of that moment when the election was held, but of a previous period, and it certainly is more possible and more probable that ideas or proposals that have had the support of the people over a period of years are more likely to be sound than the proposals that are put forward in one hectic election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President seemed to me&mdash;I do not want to misrepresent him in any way&mdash;to be suggesting that the actual powers of delay that were given to the Seanad in the Constitution were forced upon this country.  I do not want to misrepresent the President. He talked about having looked up the original drafts of the Constitution and that, in two of them, there was a proposal for a delay of 180 days and, in a third, a period of four months.  He then said that, when it passed through the Dáil, the period was made 270 days.  I should like to know if the President wishes to convey that that power of delay given to the Seanad was forced on this country from outside?  If not, I do not see what is the point in mentioning that that was the period given.  The President knows perfectly well that, in the early days of the Treaty, just shortly after the Treaty was signed, Mr. Griffith received a letter from Mr. Lloyd George pointing out to him that the <Col N="795" /> analogy drawn between this country and Canada in its Dominion status did not imply, in any way, that a second chamber should be formed in the same way as the Canadian, nor, indeed, that there should necessarily be any second chamber.  The proposal to have a second chamber was our wish as being calculated to promote the best interests of the Irish people and, to the best of my memory, that is the only consideration there was in it.</P>
    <P>The President's speech seemed to me to end up with a threat.  He said, in effect: &ldquo;If there is an attempt to hold up this Bill, we will rush through an ill-considered Bill to do away with the Seanad.&rdquo;  That is a threat to everybody that, if they do not want rushed through an ill-considered measure, they had better climb down to the threat of the President against holding up the will of the people.  The President points to the Oath Bill.  We know that the powers of the Seanad in finance are very limited.  Last year, the President and his Party were elected for a term not exceeding five years.  They brought in a Bill for the abolition of the Oath.  The President has described that as a definite, well ascertained and final will of the people.  It was just as definite, well ascertained and final that the people willed that the Oath should be there in previous elections.  There is as much ground for saying the one as for saying the other but it is necessary now that we should pass this Bill, otherwise the President will rush through an ill-considered measure. What is the urgency about it?  He pointed out how the Seanad held up the Oath Bill.  The Government was elected in February of last year and could stay in power for five years.  The Seanad, at most, could have held up the Oath Bill for 20 months. What thwarting of the will of the people would that amount to?  If the President had not chosen to dissolve the Dáil last January, the Oath would have gone before there was another General Election.  Seeing that the people, by their votes over a <Col N="796" /> period of ten years, had maintained that Oath, is there any suggestion that there was going to be any national disaster, that it was necessary to curtail the powers of the Seanad&mdash; because they used their powers to hold up a measure for 18 months? In fact it made no difference whatever if the President had not himself chosen to dissolve the Dáil last January when the people had only apparently decided that they wanted the Oath removed in 1930 though they had kept it there from 1922 onwards. When the President talks about what the people want and about the will of the people, I am not in the least impressed.  I remember that in 1925 there was a Seanad election under the old system.  The whole country was one constituency.  The election was held under the proportional representation system, a system taking democracy to such a ridiculously extreme point that the people were not interested in it.  The result was that less than 20 per cent. of the people voted.</P>

      <P>The President at that time through his organisation, issued a statement in France; he issued a statement to the Turkish Government as well as a statement in America telling the people in those countries that the fact that less than 20 per cent. of the people voted meant that 80 per cent. of the people were expressing their will not to have a Free State, and not to recognise the elected Government in this country.  That was his interpretation then of an election, but he turns around now and tells us that the people have voted for the abolition of the Seanad.  Not one man in a hundred in this country cares twopence whether the Seanad exists or whether it does not exist.  The people have not troubled to think about it.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy deny it?  Bills are brought in here every other week.  Has there been any passionate demand on the part of the people to have those Bills brought in? Does one man in twelve give the least consideration to them?  The Executive responsible for running this country, conscious of various interests and of the various good things that can be done or the bad things that can be prevented, takes action.  It brings in legislation for the well-being of the people, but the majority of the people do not give a thought to the matters that these Bills deal with.  Every Deputy, I do not care in what part of the House he sits, knows that as well as I do.  This talk, that every fellow down in Midleton is running about telling Deputy Corry that he had solemnly considered various proposals before the Government had thought of introducing them, is simply the greatest nonsense.</P>
      <P>The President talked about the Seanad having assisted an Executive when it had reason to believe that the Executive did not represent the will of the people.  How does the President know?  The Seanad, just like the Government, like Deputies in the Dáil, is bound to use whatever powers it has in the way that it thinks will most make for the well-being of the people. The President knows perfectly well that if I went around the country and said I wanted to have the law changed so that old age pensions would be £2 10/- a week, beginning at the age of 35, I would get a vast majority in favour of such a proposal.  The President would not turn around and say in resisting the proposal: &ldquo;I am standing against the known will of the people.&rdquo;  He would say that he was elected last January and intended to stay in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come back again to the point that I made at the beginning of my speech.  In some countries you have a monarch who has certain powers, generally very limited.  In an earlier stage the Dominions had a Governor-General who had powers of delay and various other powers.  We <Col N="798" /> eliminated all power of the Governor-General. That is now gone.  But the President has gone further.  He has tried to eliminate the Governor-General completely out of public life and to take whatever precedence belongs by the Constitution to the Governor-General to himself.  The Governor General does not exist.  We can change the fundamental law by the mere act of a Fianna Fáil majority. We are now going to do away with the power of delay by the Seanad.  The Seanad has not had at any time the power to change things detrimentally to the people.  All that the Seanad can do at most is to delay what the Government considers to be a beneficial measure.  We are now going to have the position in this country in which the Executive Council, with its majority behind it, is going to have all power completely uncontrolled. Everyone likes to think that governors-general and kings are completely useless.  As a matter of fact it might well be that the Governor-General should act and should use power, and that in using it he would be acting as the protector of the people.</P>
    <P>The history of the world and of Parliamentary government shows that certain things are necessary to protect the people against an Executive. Does anybody deny it?  We are now going to be in this position, that next month this Government can bring in a Bill and say that there is to be no General Election for the next 25 years. The Seanad can delay the Bill for three months.  The President said that actually it can delay it for five months.  But there is no power to protect the people against an Executive which was elected last February and has now got all power in its hands, even power to extend its own life.  It has power to abolish all the restraints put on it by the Constitution. The Governor-General does not function at all.  The Seanad is going to be a mere derisory Seanad, and you are going to have the most complete autocracy that exists even in countries where the Fascist system obtains.</P>
    <P>The President said it was unfair that a Second Chamber should be in a <Col N="799" /> position to flout the will of the people. Presumably, the Seanad, elected in various ways as it was, represented the will of the people at a given stage. The President and his Party represent it at another moment.  The most the Seanad can do is to delay, so that if the Government should during that time change its mind no harm will be done. That is the most it can do.  It cannot bring in any new legislation.  The President, of course, took occasion to say that the Referendum was abolished because the Executive of the time was looking forward to a period when the Seanad would not see eye to eye with it.  The Referendum was abolished because it was obviously a purely crank system which was opposed to all ideas of good, sound and responsible government.  The President says that if the Seanad has a longer period than that which he proposes to give it it then becomes a controlling chamber. He knows perfectly well that the Seanad, unless it were changed radically, could not be a controlling chamber.  He knows perfectly well that the Government is the controlling force here.  Under the powers given to it all that it can do is to delay.  It does not control.</P>
    <P>The President brought in a reference to the cost of the Seanad.  He might just as well bring in a reference to the cost of the Dáil.  When the election took place Fianna Fáil had a majority. We met here and elected President de Valera as President and appointed his Government.  What was the need for the Dáil after that?  We come here, Deputy MacDermot gets up and wastes time, and I get up and waste time, but it does not make any difference.  The Executive does exactly what suits it. You might just as well say there was a waste of money on the Dáil.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would learn to articulate properly or if he would even speak Irish, I might occasionally be able to answer him, but when he does not seem to take the trouble to articulate in English properly, I think the best thing he <Col N="800" /> could do would be to keep his mouth shut.  What was the point of bringing in the cost of the Seanad into this debate?  The President is proposing that the Seanad, even with its further curtailed powers, shall cost exactly the same as heretofore.  Bringing in the question of the cost of the Seanad to my mind had no other purpose than to appeal to the prejudices of certain people.  The President did not propose to save money.  He is only saying to the people: &ldquo;Here is an opportunity of hitting these people in the Seanad,&rdquo; but they are still going to cost the same amount of money.  Deputy MacDermot said that under the present system the Seanad is bound to be a reflex of the Dáil.  It will be nothing of the sort.</P>

      <P>That I cannot say. Last February the people of the country were unfortunately misled into voting for Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil, while in power, will increase the number of its representatives in the Seanad, but at a later stage it is to be hoped that there will be some change in the Government of this country so that the Seanad will not be a reflex of the Dáil. That means that as the majority in the Dáil changes from time to time, as far as I can deduce from the situation, the Seanad will never be exactly a reflex of the Dáil.  It will be a reflex of the Dáil taken over a fair period instead of taken at the moment of election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is not a bit of good talking to the majority in this House and to point out what we have done.  We have declared in this House that the Government of the Irish Free State is not entitled to receive allegiance from the people of the country.  In every other country the people are bound to give allegiance to the Government, but here we are to have nothing of the sort.  The State created by the Irish people is too contemptible to ask for allegiance.  We have declared that the moral law that applies to every other people is not to apply here. Now we say that we are to be in a <Col N="801" /> constant state of revolution as the whims of the people change.  It is no use pretending that a change amongst the people is due only to careful and long thought; it is nothing of the sort. A certain situation arises, a world crisis of one kind or another, and some people feel the pinch.  Somebody comes along and says that miraculous things can be done and the people say: &ldquo;We will give them a chance of carrying them out.&rdquo;  When this Bill is passed, the Executive here will be as powerful as any Czar ever was in Russia.  In monarchies, the King is able to act for the purpose of protecting the people against the Executive.  In other countries there are Senates or second Houses which are required to give their consent before a measure is passed affecting the lives of the people, but here next week or next month, after the Bill is passed, the Government can bring in a Bill to take away all power from the people.  With Deputy MacDermot, and possibly with the Labour Party, we shall make speeches and go into the lobby to vote against it, but the hack followers of the Government will go and vote for it, and the people of this country can be deprived of the last vestige of freedom.  There is not very much trace of freedom left since Fianna Fáil came into power and there will be no means whatever left to the people once the Second Chamber has gone, gone effectively as the President proposes, to protect the people against an unscrupulous Executive. For the sake of argument, but only for the sake of argument, we shall pretend that the present Executive is not unscrupulous, but what guarantee have you that the present Government will not have to give way to an unscrupulous Government?</P>

      <P>It may be, but five years is a very short time in the life of a nation.  This Government is rushing through one thing after another because apparently they feel that their time of office is going to be short. <Col N="802" /> They want to do as much of what they call good, but what all intelligent people of the country would call harm, during their term of office.  The President could have got up here on this Bill and made a case for an uncontrolled Executive, made a case for a country existing with full powers and changing every law according to the whim of any Government that may be elected from time to time, but it does seem to me that what the President should have done, and what all right minded people should do, is to see how this country can be protected against revolutionary changes just to suit the whim of various Governments that come in.  It was necessary for us in the circumstances to abolish whatever vestige of power remained in the hands of the Governor-General.  It was necessary to protect this country against possible interference and to give the Dáil power to change the Constitution but the President knows if he has given any thought to the matter that you must have a condition which will protect the people of the country from revolutionary change every time an Executive likes to have an election.  I stand firmly against the Bill.  The President made no case for the Bill.  The only case he made was: &ldquo;If you do not take this you will get something worse.&rdquo;  That is the sort of thing we have learned to get from him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald has spoken as if with the disappearance of that august body, the Seanad, all the rights and privileges and indeed the whole people's charter, would <i>ipso facto</i> disappear.  I am one of those people who are opposed to second chambers.  I am one of these people who believe that a single chamber elected, on adult suffrage, is the proper kind of chamber to rule the destinies of the people in any country which claims to be a democratic country.  It is because I believe in single chambers, it is because I still have faith in the judgement of the plain people, I am personally prepared to support this Bill.  This Party will support the Bill but for myself I support it in the hope <Col N="803" /> that there will be ultimately in this country one Legislature and that Legislature elected on the votes of the adult population of the country. Deputy McDermott quoted Senator O'Farrell's views on the Seanad, expressed, I think, in 1928.  Deputy MacDermot might have been a little more historical and have quoted the debates in the Constituent Assembly.</P>
      <P>There he would have seen that the first elected Labour Party to this House, when Article 12 was being inserted in the Constitution, definitely opposed and voted against the insertion of that Article in the Constitution. The speech of the Leader of the Labour Party then made it perfectly clear that so far as the Labour Party was concerned it stood for a Single-Chamber Legislature and not for the creation of a Seanad which, having regard to its method of election, having regard to its actions over a period of ten years, is not in a sense necessary to the preservation of the democratic rights of the people.</P>
      <P>A good deal of Deputy Fitzgerald's speech interested me.  He talked of this Bill as being a move towards the establishment of a dictatorship in the country.  I do not regard the Bill as such and I would warn the people who imagine that things can be done better and more effectively under and by means of a dictatorship, to take a lesson from what is happening to-day all over Europe.  If dictatorships were good things the whole of Europe would be prosperous to-day.  If there is anybody in this House, or outside this House, who imagines that dictatorships would cure the social ills of the people, they should take a lesson from what is happening throughout various countries in Europe to-day.  The suggestion that doing away with the Seanad or a Second Chamber, is a move towards dictatorship is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the late Government wanted to preserve the rights of the people they would have left in the Constitution, the Initiative and the Referendum.  These two things in the Constitution tended to the preservation of the rights of the people against a reactionary Executive, but the Cumann na nGaedheal <Col N="804" /> Government, with the strongly implanted mentality of the dictator, destroyed both the Initiative and the Referendum.  Then Deputy Fitzgerald comes along to-day to regret that there is not now or that there will not be, if the Seanad should be ultimately abolished, any safeguard for the plain people against an arbitrary Executive Council.  So far as I am concerned, I would prefer to be without safeguards against the decisions of an Executive Council if the only safeguard that Deputy Fitzgerald has to give me is the Seanad as constituted to-day.</P>
    <P>We come now to consider the whole purpose of the powers of a Second Chamber.  What is the purpose of a Second Chamber?  What are the uses of a Second Chamber?  In every country in the world, with the growth of democratic thought, with the insistence by the plain people of a greater control over matters that affect their lives and destinies, there has been set up on behalf of the possessing classes in their Second Chamber every possible bulwark against the advance of democracy.  Second Chambers were not invented to improve the health and lives of the working people.  Second Chambers were not established for the purpose of giving expression to the views of the working classes.  The Second Chamber was established in this country for the same reason as in every other country, namely as a steady bulwark against democracy in the country in which the Chamber was created.</P>
    <P>What case, I ask myself, can be made for the retention of the Seanad, much less for curbing its powers in this country?  We saw here a couple of years ago the Cumann na nGaedheal Government treating this House just as a rubber stamp, a registering machine for its ill-considered and ill-conceived views.  This House was treated in a most disgraceful manner in respect of its own powers when a time table was produced for this House and it was told to pass the Constitution (Amendment) Act in a very limited period, in a limited period which ought to have shocked every sense of democracy and parliamentary decency there might have been left in the Executive <Col N="805" /> Council of the day.  The Seanad, with no mandate from the people, supported the Constitution (Amendment) Bill introduced by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government without any mandate from the people and they passed it in such a disgracefully hasty manner that whatever claims they had then to be a bulwark or check on the Executive Council against the mad-dog policy of the Executive Council disappeared. These pretensions were surely torn from its face when it passed the Constitution (Amendment) Act on a Saturday evening, quite a unique thing for the Seanad.  It passed that Act after a speech which ought to have disgraced democracy in that House, if there is very much democracy left in it.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am supporting this Bill, and the Labour Party will support it.  As far as expressing my own personal views, I want to say I share a good deal of the viewpoint of Deputy MacDermot.  I would personally be quite satisfied with a single Chamber in this State.  In that respect, I am just expressing the view of the Labour Party when it first came into this House.  I can see no advantage in having a Second Chamber in this country.  I can see less advantage in giving to that Second Chamber, as at present elected, the power of holding up legislation at the beck and call of the minority Party in this House; and I can see no case whatever for giving into the hands of the Seanad, as at present constituted, any power for acting, or pretending to act, as a bulwark against the popularly elected Government.</P>
    <P>Experience of the Seanad for the past ten years has shown that it is just a registering machine for the Government in power.  Being out of date, it is functioning to-day for the last Government that was in power. But if the Seanad is only going to be a registering machine for the Government in power we ought to have only one registering machine, and not two. We ought to have no use in our Constitutional legislative life for out-of-date machinery such as the Seanad is to-day.  There is, perhaps, a case to be made for ensuring that Bills which pass this House actually fulfil <Col N="806" /> the purpose which this House believes they will fulfil when the House is passing these Bills.  There is no case for the retention of the Seanad, either in its present form or as at present elected.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to support at any time in this House, or elsewhere, any proposal which means the limiting of the power of a useless Second Chamber, a Second Chamber originally conceived as a check on democratic thought, and an Assembly which is being used to-day to thwart and defy the will of the Executive Council, whatever their political views may be, but an Executive Council elected by the free votes of the adult population of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to discover that I am more conservative than a large majority, perhaps, in the House.  It is a fault that I am aware of for many years, that in certain fundamental matters I am, perhaps, more conservative than the average. With regard to this Bill, I discover now that if I were to come here to abolish the present Seanad we would have a larger majority of support than for the proposal to limit its delaying powers to an effective period of five months.  I want to say that the suggestion that this Bill is intended to degrade the Seanad is unjustifiable.  No matter what Second Chamber we have, if we decide on having a Second Chamber, no matter what its constitution, I think there can be only one controlling body.  There must be no doubt whatever about it that these powers to obstruct or limit the decisions come to by the majority of the immediately elected representatives of the people will have to be carefully restricted.</P>
      <P>I introduced this Bill with the feeling that we were not doing something piecemeal, but that we were actually giving a period of delay to the existing Seanad such as we might give to any Second Chamber if we decided on replacing the existing Chamber by another.  I think that the period which we propose to give is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall answer Deputy Fitzgerald <Col N="807" /> as to why I referred to the original drafts.  It was not to suggest anything such as he thought.  It was to show that a body, consisting of three separate committees, which was approaching the question of a Constitution in the detached frame of mind in which Deputy MacDermot suggested matters of this kind should be approached, having been asked to consider Constitutions and forms of government and to come to a calm decision as to our form of government, did not propose a longer period than the period we are proposing here.  I think that, in itself, is proof that this proposal of ours is not brought in purely a biassed frame of mind for the purposes of facilitating this particular Executive, but that it is brought in, having considered carefully&mdash;as I can say the Government has considered&mdash;what would be the reasonable period of delay which should be given to the Second Chamber.  I ask the House to think of that and to weigh its value, that we had three committees set up originally as committees of experts, that had no immediate political axe to grind, that were given this task of considering what should be the Constitution&mdash;under certain limitations, I will admit&mdash;of the State here, and that these committees suggested a period which is, practically, the period provided for here in this Bill.</P>
    <P>When we were first in opposition the period was substantially the period that is proposed in this Bill. Again, I would say, that even if we were proposing to establish a Second Chamber of a type that would be worth having, which would be different in function and personnel from this Chamber, I certainly would not propose to give that Chamber a power of delay greater than the period suggested here.</P>
    <P>I think that there can be only one master and that the master, as long as we have a democratic form of Government, must be the House directly elected by the people.  I think it is better that there should not be any clash between rival authorities. I think it is dangerous to have such a <Col N="808" /> clash and I think, further, that rigid Constitutions are a danger; they have always proved a danger.  If the people desire a certain change&mdash;if they feel it necessary for their well-being in changed circumstances&mdash;why should they be debarred from giving effect to their will by something that was designed in a previous period under conditions which were, probably, substantially different from the conditions that obtain now?  That is how you get revolution.  There is no better way of avoiding revolution or change by violence than by having it possible at all times for the people to get their will made effective through their representatives in Parliament.  It is vain and foolish to think that you can devise a system which will obstruct that and not create dangerous conditions. I think, therefore, it is well that we should have here, not a cast-iron Constitution, but a flexible Constitution. The only difficulties we have had with it were cases where it was not flexible enough and where there were parts of it imposed from without&mdash; parts that were not immediately and directly capable of being changed by the people who were affected and by the people who have to live under these laws.  A great complaint that has been made against this Constitution from the beginning is just that.</P>
    <P>I differ completely and absolutely from the view that has been taken and expressed here by Deputy Fitzgerald. I think it is a short-sighted and narrow view and that, if there is to be democracy at all and if we are to have a democratic form of Government at all, then we will have ultimately, as Deputy Norton has said, to trust the people and let the people realise that they have responsibilities, that if they do elect a Government to office they have to put up with that Government for the defined period of four or five years, that the more care they exercise in choosing the Government the better it will be for them, and that they should take their responsibilities in elections as a very serious matter indeed.</P>
    <P>I do not think that you can get any safeguard in cast-iron Constitutions <Col N="809" /> that will be as valuable as the habit of mind in people of realising that when an Executive is put into office it has considerable control over their lives during the period it is in power.  I do not think there is any substitute for that, and I think there is no substitute whatever in having Second Chambers that represent an opinion which is not the immediate present opinion of the people, but a bygone opinion.  Deputy Fitzgerald suggests that there is nothing important about the will of the people because the people will differently in different periods.  It is the present will always that is important because the present will is formed in the circumstances of the moment.  The previous will also was formed in its particular circumstances, but there is no use in suggesting that, because the people in a previous period and in different circumstances willed a certain thing and to-day, in different circumstances, will something different &mdash;assuming that is true&mdash;the people are whimsical.  It is simply that the people at each particular moment are the judges of what is best for them.  That is, they constitute themselves and feel that they are judges.  They may be unwise and not be able to look sufficiently forward, but it is foolish to hope, I think, that you can ever get a form of Government which will be able to look any great distance ahead and provide for the people over and beyond what the people ordinarily would be able to provide for themselves.  That raises quite a different conception of Government. I know it is wise and proper, that it is the duty of an Executive to attempt to do that, and that it is the duty of the representatives of the people, as a whole, to do that.  I take it that the people elected to this House are quite capable of doing that.  They understand the immediate conditions and they are more sensitive to public opinion than would be the House that is not immediately and directly in touch with the people.  They have the two things that are advisable: an immediate knowledge of the present wants and a sensitiveness to the present wants and, I hope, also sufficient character to realise that it is their duty to look ahead and, whilst <Col N="810" /> being sensitive and responsive to the immediate needs, to try to see that these needs are satisfied in the best possible way and in a way that will not merely be of present but also of future and lasting benefit.</P>
    <P>Just as it would be wrong to take away from the people their responsibility at election time, the responsibility for their own Government for a period of five years, so also I think it is wrong to in any way take from the immediately elected representatives of the people the responsibility of considering every measure that comes before them in the light of the present needs of the people, and of course, having also in mind the general benefit and future well-being of the people. That being my attitude, and the attitude of the Government, we are quite consistent here in introducing this measure, because even if there was to be a second House we would not propose to give them longer delaying powers.  What we are postponding is a final decision on the question as to whether we are to dispense with the Second Chamber altogether.  I admit a certain hankering after a type of Assembly where the economic side would get, perhaps, more attention than it can get here in this House.  I have frankly admitted the difficulties I have found in trying to devise a Constitution for such a change.  I have not finally despaired of it.  If at this moment I had to make a decision as to what was to be done with the Second Chamber, I would have to say, as Deputy Norton said, that I see no use at present in the existing one, and that I have not one definitely in mind which could replace it.  That is the position.  I have not despaired of being able to devise a Constitution which would give us a Second House completely differentiated from this, with smaller numbers, which would be a consultative body, a body that would not have powers of obstruction, that would have powers of making proposals and suggestions, and whose advice would always be there for the Executive Council and for the Dáil.  To any such Assembly I cannot imagine myself, for one, and I cannot imagine the Executive Council agreeing to give <Col N="811" /> powers of delay longer than this period. I have, therefore, no hesitation whatever in this matter.  It is not a question of introducing one sort of measure and then thinking that the whole thing might be scrapped.</P>
    <P>I might also, perhaps, add that I do believe our Constitution is not at the present time in anything like the form it will finally be in.  I think it is bound to change, and that a time may come, not very far from now, when it would be advisable to have in a wider way consideration of this so-called fundamental law.  That being so, I do not feel that there is any desperate need for hurry.  The only need for hurry brings me to another point, and that is the expense.  Again I mention the question of expense quite honestly, because I had a feeling that there was a certain need for speed, that if we are spending between £30,000 and £40,000 on something which we admit is useless, we are hardly fair to the taxpayer.  That is the only need for hurry which I see in the whole situation. I do feel that there is certain genuine criticism about our delay in that point, and I am myself so to speak, <Col N="812" /> our own critic.  I criticise our delay from that one point, and I admit it is a point from which we can be genuinely attacked.  It can be said &ldquo;there is need for hurry, because there is an institution which you admit is of no value; it is in existence and it is costing you a sum at the rate of £30,000 to £40,000 a year at a time when it is admitted by everybody that economies are necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are a number of points that have been in argument with respect to Second Houses in general, which have been mentioned, and which, I think, might very effectively be answered; I have dealt only with the main ones. I hope I have convinced the House that this is not conceived in any petty Party spirit.  It is not introduced for the purpose of degrading any institution, or anything of that sort. It is definitely considered as, and in fact is a part of a general plan to the extent that, as far as we are concerned, if we did have a Second House the proposals as to its delaying powers would be exactly the same as the proposals that are here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was interrupted I was pointing out that Deputy Norton in the course of his speech declared that it was the intention of himself and his Party to support this amendment.  He based his argument largely on the ground that the present price of beer or porter was excessive, and that consequently the working man was being deprived of something which was necessary for him.  I did not hear the whole of Deputy Norton's speech, but I understand that in dealing with this matter he did not at all discuss the question as to where the responsibility for the charge which he considers excessive should be properly placed.  I pointed out that if this amendment were accepted it would cost the Exchequer not less than £500,000, and I have given very solid and incontrovertible reasons to support that statement.  I think Deputy Norton was aware of them, and that the consequences could not be argued by him or by any other Party in the House.  It we forgo this £500,000 something else will have to be forgone also, unless we are prepared to increase taxation.  I do not think there is any source from which at the present moment we could get £500,000 without imposing an undue hardship on one section or other of the community. Therefore, I suggest to members of the Labour Party who are going to vote for this amendment that they should have clearly in mind what alternative course they propose to pursue, if it were to be adopted by this House. In my view it would mean the defeat of the Government, and a defeat of the Government must inevitably mean curtailment in the social services.  I do not think that the people who have sponsored this amendment would be prepared, if they were called upon to accept responsibility for carrying on the affairs of this country, to say that they were going to impose £500,000 in additional taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet a vote in support of this amendment must inevitably mean a vote to replace the Government by the Cumann na nGaedheal. The members of the Labour Party are quite prepared, as far as I can see, to take that risk, with this certainty staring them in the face that if this Government is displaced, and a Cumann na nGaedheal Government put in its place, Cumann na nGaedheal <Col N="817" /> would refuse to increase taxation, in order to replace the £500,000 lost to the Exchequer by some other form of taxation.  Consequently those who vote for this amendment must vote for it with this certainty, that if the Government were defeated on the issue and were replaced by some other section in this House, inevitable as a result of that replacement, there would be a curtailment in the expenditure on social services of that £500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might first of all stop talking.  That is easier for him than stopping the economic war.  If the economic war were stopped to-morrow there would not accrue to the Exchequer an additional £500,000. The Deputy knows that before this Government came into office and before the economic war started, the position of the Exchequer was such that additional taxation which would bring in a further £3,000,000 had to be imposed in order to enable the Budget to be balanced on the basis of the Exchequer Estimate.</P>

      <P>This amendment, which bears the Deputy's name, would render the Exchequer insolvent unless the Exchequer were prepared to retrench.  The only source of retrenchment would be in the social services. Deputies on the opposite benches, and Deputies in the Labour Party opposed the &ldquo;Cuts&rdquo; Bill, which was to bring about temporary economies in the public services.  Surely they cannot go back now and eat their words. I exclude from that possibly Deputy Morrissey.  He has already succeeded in doing so on many previous occasions.</P>

      <P>Unless Deputies on the opposite benches are prepared to eat their words they could not possibly make good the loss to the Exchequer, except in one of three ways, to increase taxation or carry through the intensive &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; which we proposed to impose on public servants, or else by reducing the social services.  There is no other way out of the dilemma for them, and there is no other way out of the dilemma for the Labour Party.  That is the issue they have to face on the amendment.  There is no use in Deputies getting up and saying that they do not mind about £500,000; that they leave that for the Minister for Finance to deal with.  As I stated the Minister for Finance cannot produce £500,000 out of a hat.  It has to come out of someone's pocket.  That is the issue that has to be faced by every <Col N="819" /> Deputy who votes for the amendment. Deputies sitting on the Labour Benches who propose to vote for this amendment should carefully consider their position, because they claim to have made their concern the position of the poor, the lowly and the oppressed.  They are the Party that clamours for the provision of pensions for widows and orphans, for an increase in old age pensions, and for additional relief for the unemployed. They want some provision made for the maintenance of those who are out of work.  How are we going to meet these things, and, at the same time, take £500,000 out of the Exchequer on a futile, silly, frivolous and inconsiderate motion like this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard facts have to be faced in this matter, and the hard facts in the present situation are that owing to the calls that are justly on the Exchequer we cannot find £500,000 anywhere to replace this money. Therefore, whatever other justification there might be for accepting the amendment, that is one insuperable reason above all others, one indefensible reason for refusing the amendment, seeing that the money cannot be got in any other way.  Within our limits we have done for the Irish brewers' industry more than was done in ten years previously.  We were the first Government to make them any concession whatever.  We granted a concession last year which, I believe, has enabled a considerable number of the smaller breweries to keep open during the past 12 months, breweries which were faced with extinction, but which thanks to the concessions which we gave, and thanks to the greater resources we provided, were enabled to carry on an advertising campaign, and to put many of their products on the map, and on the tables of the Irish people. You will find that a bigger advertising campaign was carried out by the small Irish brewers last year than the years preceding.  It was carried out entirely out of the resources we left them, and the concessions provided in such a moderate way.  These concessions, which in all the circumstances <Col N="820" /> we were able to give them were not like the ill-conditioned concessions now asked for, which would bankrupt the Exchequer or impoverish the poor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheOMahony" hpid="The O'Mahony The O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>The O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make only a few remarks upon the amendment. I feel absolutely confident that if this reduction of 1d. per pint was made it would lead in no way to an increase in intemperance in any shape or form.  If I thought it did, I would not be in favour of it at all.  I find myself absolutely in accord with Deputy Norton upon this amendment. The labouring man would be only getting a very small concession if this amendment were accepted.  The Minister for Finance contends that the amount of money involved cannot otherwise be found.  I was very interested to note that Deputy Dillon would be entirely in favour of this amendment but that he could not see where the money could be found.  If it can be shown where the money can be found, I presume he will vote for this amendment.</P>
      <P>It seems to me obvious where it can be found, although I know the Minister for Finance will not agree, judging from a remark he made when the question of the economic war was introduced into the debate.  To my mind, this economic war is simply a luxury tax for the Fianna Fáil Party. If the economic war was settled, as it could be settled, and as it could have been settled a year ago, we would not require bounties, and these bounties would pay for this tax five times over. Let the Party opposite cut away their politics and they could easily take the 1d. off the pint for the poor people. The Minister for Finance challenges us to say how that money could be found.  I have told him a way it could be found and it is up to him to disprove that it cannot be found that way.</P>

The Minister for Finance entertained us for the last few minutes of his speech <Col N="821" /> telling us all the Fianna Fáil Government had done for the brewers.

      <P>We know the Minister for Finance well; he worked himself into hysterics.  Fortunately for the Minister and the House and for Deputy Corry he is a teetotaler.  I fear to think even of what would happen to the Government, the House and the country, if the Minister were to take a pint of stout.  If in his sober senses he can so far lose himself as he does, where would he stop if he were like most working men and took a pint or two of Guinness.  It might not be good for the Minister and it would not be good for the country if he did.  The Minister in his usual style, when he has <Col N="822" /> no case to make, fell back upon abuse. He talked about Deputy Morrissey's relation to Irish politics.  The Minister would do well to talk less about that and nobody knows that better than some of his colleagues sitting upon his own benches.  Let us hope we will hear no more about that kind of thing.  Men standing here have as much Irish blood in their veins as men sitting on the other side of the House.  There is no necessity for this at all.  We are talking upon an amendment put forward from these benches and we are entitled, notwithstanding the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government are in power, to put forward our amendments and our views, up to the present anyway. The Minister in reply to Deputy Rice's speech introducing this amendment, said: &ldquo;All I have got to say is that it would cost the State £500,000 if this amendment were carried,&rdquo; and then he sat down.  That was his whole contribution&mdash;the State would lose £500,000. Would he tell us how much the State was losing for the last three, four or five years, long before he came into office?  I am glad to see the Minister for Finance has got another Parliamentary Secretary in Deputy Jordan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave the weeping to the Deputy.  He is a very good hand at it, and as a matter of fact, if I wanted to hear a real mournful wail in this House, I should prefer to hear Deputy Tom Kelly to anybody else.  He is very good at what they call keening in the West.  The Deputy should be living in the West although he told us that all belonging to him had been in Dublin for the last hundred years.  To get back to the amendment, the Minister has told us that it would cost £500,000. Would the Minister tell us if it is not a fact that the revenue has been losing more than £500,000 per year for the <Col N="824" /> last three or four years without any reduction whatever and will the Minister tell the House on what his figures are based?  The Minister said that, even allowing for a 10 per cent. increase in consumption, there would still be a loss of £500,000.  I should like to hear from the Minister the reasons for that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, of course, we had the old story, or, I should say, the new story, from the Minister: &ldquo;You cannot have it both ways.  You must either increase taxation or reduce social services; if you reduce taxation, you must reduce social services.  If you reduce this, you must increase the taxes on the necessaries of life for the poor.&rdquo;  I am surprised that Deputy Jordan and Deputy Corish and Deputy Goulding&mdash; I think those are the only Deputies on those benches that I can remember&mdash; would not throw their minds back three or four years.  While listening to the Minister for Finance, I could have closed my eyes and imagined that it was another North of Ireland man was talking in the person of ex-Deputy Blythe.  I could imagine, and I could read from the records, Deputy Blythe saying at that time: &ldquo;If you increase social services, you must increase taxation&rdquo; and, mind you, the people were very much better able to afford it then than now.  Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, thundered forth from these benches: &ldquo;Nonsense.  Taxation can be reduced by at least £2,000,000.&rdquo; The Minister to-night tells us that it is utterly impossible to reduce taxation by even half a million pounds&mdash;one-quarter of the amount they promised &mdash;without increasing taxation on the poor or reducing social services.  I can remember Deputy MacEntee, sitting, so far as I remember, in the bench now occupied by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, thundering forth as he thundered to-night, and being just as sincere then as he was to-night: &ldquo;Nonsense.  This country is overtaxed; this country is taxed to the last penny it can bear&rdquo;&mdash;and that when the amount was £26,000,000.  To-day, when we are asking for £31,000,000 from the taxpayers, the Minister tells us that the country cannot possibly find this £500,000, admitting, for the <Col N="825" /> moment, that the Minister's figure is correct&mdash;which I doubt very much&mdash; without increasing taxation.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister then admit that his statement and the statements of his Party a year and a half ago were absolutely untrue, that they were based purely on their imagination? Does the Minister admit that the statements made by every member of the Party from the President down that, having examined in detail the Estimates, they were satisfied that, without imposing any hardship, or reducing any social service, they could reduce taxation by £2,000,000&mdash;does he admit that that was merely a political catch-cry?  Deputy Cleary told us this afternoon that we should not make political capital out of this. That came well from the other side. If there is any Party in this House, or in this country, that should be the last to talk about political capital or political catch-cries, it should be the present Government, and, in particular, and above all others, the present Minister for Finance.  Whatever limit there may have been to the exaggeration of other members of the Party, even the exaggeration of Deputy Corry, it was outstripped by the present Minister for Finance when he was in opposition and, if I may say so, with all respect, there is very little improvement since the responsibility was thrust upon him, or since he took upon himself the responsibility of Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether he is satisfied that this industry can continue with the present taxation and I am hopeful that the Minister will be able to reply to that question, particularly when he has the assistance of the advice he has been getting during the course of my very short speech.  It is a pity that that advice would not be given to the House; it is a great pity that it should be confined to the Minister.  I am sure that we would all be very glad if the advice were broadcast.  We should all learn very much from it.  I hope, however, that it will have some effect on the Minister, and I can assure the Minister that the sympathy he gave to <Col N="826" /> the deputation which waited upon him last year, in between two elections, will be judged by his attitude towards this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Supporting this amendment, or, to speak more correctly, these two amendments, because I understand that the amendments standing in the names of Deputy Vincent Rice, Deputy Morrissey, and Deputy Gearóid O'Sullivan are being taken in conjunction with mine, I want to say that my amendment differs in some slight regard from their amendment.  I think that mine is somewhat more specific.  It relates to beer of a specific gravity of 10.40, 10.41 and 10.42.  Perhaps, that will require some little explanation.  It is an endeavour to do something for some of the smaller breweries which had to close down as a result of over-taxation and which, incidentally, gave a lot of employment throughout the country&mdash;not the kind of employment that we see given during the last 12 months or so, in what are termed new industries and new factories, but employment which gives reasonably good wages and good conditions to the persons engaged in the brewing industry in this country.  It is well known to many persons that beer of a specific gravity of 10.40 is the beer usually brewed in the smaller breweries in the country and that the beers of a higher specific gravity, that is, from 10.41 to 10.42, are brewed in the main breweries of the country, namely, Messrs.  Murphy of Cork, Messrs.  Beamish of Cork, and Messrs. Guinness of Dublin.  If these amendments are passed they will have a double-barrelled effect.  I am almost convinced it will lead to the reopening of some of our smaller breweries which had to close down as a result of over-taxation. I am not at all convinced that the reduction in taxation, which is sought under these amendments, will affect the revenue to the extent indicated by the Minister in his speech.  Neither do I share his pessimism as regards the things he forecasted if the amendments should pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has expressed grave fears that the Labour Party may vote <Col N="827" /> for these amendments: that if they are passed they will have very serious results on the country, because we will then lose a Fianna Fáil Government, and all that it is supposed to connote in this country.  I am not going to advert to the economic war although I could go on talking about it for half an hour.  Sufficient has already been said on that aspect of the question. The Minister need have no fears that the Labour Party are going to put his Government out of office, because it is on the records of this House that the leader of the Labour Party himself stated, in reply to some interruption. that the Labour Party would support any Government but a Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  That statement should allay any fears the Minister may have that his Government will be put out of office in order to allow of the advent of a Cumann na nGaedheal Party into power once more.  The Minister, apparently, wants to conjure up grave fears in the Opposition by suggesting that if these amendments are passed the result will be that there must be certain economies in the public services.  Now he appears to me to be taking up the attitude of a Minister who says &ldquo;Hit me now with this public economy baby in my arms.&rdquo;  In other words, he is trying to put the Opposition into the position that he can charge them with endeavouring to secure a lessening of the public services if they vote for these amendments.  Now that kind of argument, like many of the arguments used by the Fianna Fáil Party, may be very useful at the cross-roads, but I suggest that it does not, and should not, cut ice in a deliberative assembly such as this is supposed to be.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that from 1924 to 1932 there was a very substantial fall in the revenue from this commodity that we are discussing, something I understand in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000.  I think it was the Minister himself who spoke about the changed habits of our people and pointed to the fact that less drink had been consumed during that period and that less drink was now being consumed.  I would like, if time permitted, to go more <Col N="828" /> closely and perhaps a little more deeply into that aspect of the question. For myself, I believe that it has not been for the good of the country or in the interests of public morality that this reduction should have taken place.</P>
    <P>The Minister perhaps may not be aware of it, though most members of the House are, that a Commission of Inquiry was set up by this House not so long ago to make certain inquiries. It is quite an open secret that the inquiries made revealed a very undesirable state of affairs.  That revelation was coincident with a drop in the amount of money paid for liquor of the kind that we are discussing now, a drop represented by something like £1,000,000.  There might be some excuse for the present taxation on this commodity if we were living in a period of prosperity.  But everybody knows that we are not.  A Government in a neighbouring country, whose people to-day are suffering from very great industrial and economic depression, have had the courage to take some taxation off the barrel of beer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate they had the courage to take it off.  The Minister, in my view, would be doing something that would be of very great benefit to the ordinary working class people of this country if he were to take a penny off the pint of stout or pint of porter.  Now a pint of stout or a pint of porter may appear to some people a luxury, but the average docker, the average navvy, the average man who has to toil for long hours at hard manual labour, will tell you that while he cannot find any virtue in a bottle of lemonade, he finds it in a pint of stout or a pint of porter.  I want to assure Deputies that I would not be a party to the doing of anything that would be likely to lead to an increase in intoxication or in drunkenness. But we all know that even if the price were reduced by 1d. per pint it would not lead to any increase in drunkenness.  It would certainly lead to an increase in consumption, but not consumption to the extent that people would over-indulge and make beasts of themselves.  I think the time <Col N="829" /> for that has passed, and the Minister knows that as well as every other Deputy in the House.  I feel that a very good case has been made for reducing the taxation on beer of the specific gravity mentioned in my amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister, on more than one occasion in this House, has asked to have pointed out to him an alternative source of revenue.  I am one of those who are quite prepared for that kind of question.  Apart from what has been said by other Deputies about putting a stop to the economic war, I think it is only right and proper for me to point out that there is an untapped source of revenue in this country with which I had intended to deal before the last Government went out of office.  I had a motion on the Order Paper which, I think, would have resulted in a very useful discussion, but as there were more pressing matters to be discussed at the time I refrained from moving it.  I intend introducing that motion at a later stage when I shall indicate to the Minister the methods by which I think he could get increased revenue.  You have at the present moment in this country an unestimated number of persons who are deriving a very considerable source of income from ground rents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon says Henry George.  He dealt with the taxation of land values, embracing agricultural areas as well as town areas.  The motion I had on the Order Paper did not deal with that at all.  I suggested that there was an unestimated number of persons, particularly in the large towns and cities of the Saorstát&mdash;the cities of Dublin and Cork and other cities, not to talk of the smaller towns&mdash;including many absentee landlords who are deriving a considerable revenue from ground rents. They not alone derive a considerable revenue from these ground rents but they are a permanent handicap on any kind of commercial enterprise in some of our cities and towns.  I could mention them now, but I do not want to do so.  To mention even the names of <Col N="830" /> some of the towns would suggest who these owners are.  I do not, at the moment know, because as I have said it is unestimated, the amount of revenue that would accrue to the State if ground values were taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no new thing to tax ground values.  It has been done in some other countries.  It has been done in some of the newer countries and in some of the old countries as well.  It has been done in certain municipalities in England where they thought it wise and proper that these persons who were drawing good ground rents, unearned income as a matter of fact, handed down to them for generations as a matter of conquest, should contribute a certain amount to relieve the general load of taxation.  I do not want to go too far back but we know that a good many people speculated in these things.  Without rendering any service to the community, they are drawing out of the country something in the neighbourhood of a couple of millions.  I do not know what the exact sum is.  I put down a question some 12 months ago in order to elucidate the matter and the reply I got was that the Department of Finance had no information as to the amount.  I understand they have made no attempt to get the information. I am not blaming the Department because possibly it is not one of their functions but I do know that some of the information, at any rate, is available through the clerks of the various borough councils and clerks of urban district councils.  That is one source of revenue which, I suggest, the Minister might consider even though he might have to antagonise many vested interests.  I suggest this Government have done things which are quite unconstitutional but in the suggestion I have made we are not asking them to do anything that is unconstitutional.  In the City of Dublin alone you must have hundreds of thousands of pounds going out to all parts of Europe by way of ground rents.  In my view and in the view of very many people who have given the subject any thought whatever, the money obtained from that source <Col N="831" /> would, to a very large extent, make up not alone for what may be lost by way of land annuities but would certainly bring in revenue to the amount of more than the £500,000 that the Minister would lose if this tax were taken off beer.</P>
    <P>I would say this last word to the Minister.  The Minister cannot have that personal contact with the ordinary worker in towns and cities that many of us have.  I am not saying at all that there are not numbers of working people teetotallers.  That is their own business but the average worker takes his pint of stout and in present circumstances he cannot afford to take it on more than one or two evenings in the week.  It is quite common knowledge that for the remainder of the week he is quite disgruntled and disaffected and no matter what Government is in power he uses very lurid and uncomplimentary language about that Government.  The last Government suffered in that way. We were fortunate or unfortunate enough to have a teetotal Minister for Finance in that Government.  On one occasion, I suggested that the then Minister would be all the better if he occasionally took a glass of Paddy Flaherty or a glass of John Jameson.</P>
    <P>I have said that I would not by any act of mine do anything that would lead to inebriety or drunkenness or that would lead to the workingman spending more money on alcoholic liquor than he can afford.  The reduction of that one penny, which would, I understand, enable the brewer to sell to the publican and the publican to sell over the counter a pint of stout for 6d. in one case and perhaps 7d. in the other, would have a very useful effect.  It would even affect the Government of which the Minister is such a prominent member and affect it very favourably.  I would suggest to the Minister that if he is not able to reduce the tax by the amount suggested he would indicate to the House what reduction he is prepared to give. Having heard the various speakers on the Opposition Benches he must be amenable to reason and have some regard for the unfortunate person who <Col N="832" /> is not able to afford more than 6d. for a pint of stout.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance in his speech thought fit to refer to my record in politics.  I think that under the rules of the House I am entitled to reply.  He referred no doubt to the fact that when I was first elected to this House I was elected to an Opposition Party.  When a crisis arose here in which the existence of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was challenged, I had to make up my mind as to how I should vote. He alluded to the fact that I voted in support of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government on that occasion.  I did so for this reason, that 100 per cent. of the people who returned me to this House, were violently opposed to the possibility of a Fianna Fáil Government in this country and I took the view that if the motion were carried, the effective Party in the new Government would be the Fianna Fáil Party. That is what the Minister alluded to. I joined the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and I am proud of the fact that I am a member of it.  On that subject, let me advert to the Minister's record. The Minister at one time was wrongly suspected of having taken part in the Rising of 1916.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Mahony made a perfectly futile suggestion. Deputy Anthony produced, in an emasculated form, a first cousin to the theories of Henry George.  I do not think it expedient to go into a protracted discussion on the merits of that proposal now, but I at least pay him the tribute that his contribution to the debate was constructive.  I listened with care to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and Deputy Morrissey.  Their only argument was to set their judgement on the matter against that of the Revenue Commissioners.  They say that the fall in revenue would not be as great as the Minister anticipates.  I am going to assume that the Minister is well advised in this matter, and that even making allowance for the estimated £60,000 increase, due to increased consumption, I foresee that there still would be a deficit of £500,000 in revenue.  I regard it as utterly irresponsible to advocate voting for something that you know is impossible. Not a single Deputy on those benches has made a really intelligent suggestion <Col N="834" /> as to how this deficit is to be made up.  Deputy Morrissey spoke at considerable length.

      <P>I am not suggesting that Deputy Cosgrave is not in the building. I know he is.  I am not going to cast any reflection on Deputy Cosgrave. What I wish to say is that if Deputy Cosgrave were in his place he could make the most convincing argument by stating that if he were sitting on the opposite benches he would take £1 a barrel off stout.  That is talking business.  We know that ex-Deputy Blythe, when he was Minister for Finance, held that from the revenue point of view this proposal was impracticable.  If it was impracticable when ex-Deputy Blythe was Minister for Finance, is it not ten times more impracticable now, with the present position of the revenue?  Of course Deputy Cosgrave would not give any such undertaking.  He is a responsible man and he could not get up here and say: &ldquo;If I again take responsibility for Government I shall take £1 a barrel off stout.&rdquo;  It is all very well to say that we want such and such a thing done and that it is for the Minister for Finance to discover how it is to be financed.  I want to reduce income tax to 3/6 and I want to reduce the qualifying age for old age pensions to 65. Other Deputies want other concessions, but is it not hypocrisy to get up and start shouting about pensions at 65&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad to observe the strict enforcement of the rule of this <Col N="835" /> House that gross personal reflections will not be allowed.  I should like to advert to something that Deputy Rice said this evening.  Deputy Rice said that it was manifest to him that it was the intention of the Centre Party to vote and speak in such a way that one section would derive gratification from reading their speeches and that another section would extract gratification from their votes.  Did Deputy Rice when he said that mean that we were deliberately betraying our convictions? If he believed that, he is a greater fool than he looks.  If he did not believe it but said it all the same, it is just a cheap slander.  There is nothing easier than to pelt your political opponents with mud.  We believe that Deputy Rice speaks and votes according to his conviction.  We do not hesitate to criticise that conviction. We say it is an imprudent conviction and a foolish conviction. Deputy Rice, however, chooses to take another line.  So far as he and we are concerned, I suggest to him that it would be to his advantage and to ours if that line of attack were abandoned, because it is calculated to beget memories and criticisms that will do no credit to the proceedings of this House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon, having said some distinctly unkind things about the mentality of the proposer and seconder of this amendment, proceeded to object very vigorously because something of a similar nature had been said about himself.  Having pointed out that little inconsistency, I pass away from Deputy Dillon's speech <i>in toto.</i>  I rise to deal with two matters and two matters only.  The first is, perhaps, not a very important matter.  It was raised by Deputy Cleary and it has been often referred to in this House &mdash;that is, &ldquo;what did Cumann na nGaedheal do when they were in office?&rdquo;  That is one of the cheapest and most unconvincing of arguments. It is what the logicians call the <i>tu quoque</i> and it is generally looked upon as a thing that cannot carry the matter in dispute any further. Though that be so, I always like to hear it coming from the Fianna Fáil Benches, because when Fianna Fáil Deputies ask why Cumann na nGaedheal did not do it, it is an admission that Fianna Fáil cannot improve upon anything that Cumann na nGaedheal did.  Though that is a truism that is perfectly obvious, it is very gratifying and pleasing to hear speeches from Deputy Cleary and others in which they inquire: &ldquo;If Cumann na nGaedheal did not do it, why on earth should we do it?&rdquo;  Even the <i>tu quoque</i> does not apply here because, if you take the position when this matter was considered by a Cumann na nGaedheal Minister for Finance, you will find that it was entirely different from the position that exists at present.  Had the Minister for Finance then come along with a proposal that the tax on beer should be increased by £1 per barrel, it <Col N="837" /> would be analogous to the present position.  It would have some relation to the purchasing power of the community. At that time the country was properly governed and the purchasing power of the community was good.</P>
      <P>At present the finances of the country have been so incompetently handled that they have got into an extraordinary state of muddle and I am not surprised that they have got into that state of muddle.  One had only to listen to-night to the Minister for Finance dealing with figures to understand completely why the Minister has succeeded in so entirely mismanaging the finances of the country as he has done.  And then it is because of the Minister's guess only, because of his mere statement, that it would mean a loss of £500,000 to the revenue that Deputy Dillon is convinced.  Deputy Dillon is convinced by that mere statement.  I have already ventured to condemn the Deputy for that to-night.  Again the Deputy refuses to let his mind work and refuses to examine the arguments of the Minister for Finance.  I am greatly amused to see the pedestal upon which Deputy Dillon has placed the Minister for Finance and to see how the Deputy bows down before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the arguments of the Minister for Finance.  To begin with, he takes last year's consumption as his basis and it is from last year's consumption that he bases his entire argument.  It is based on that and on nothing else.  But what really has last year's consumption of beer and spirits to do with the yield of revenue this year?  What we have to consider is what is going to be the consumption of beer during the financial year and how the consumption of beer in the coming financial year is going to be affected by the tax on beer; and whether if that tax is kept on at 8d. there will be a revenue which will exceed by £500,000 the revenue that would be derived from having the tax, say, at 7d. You may make a case from five years ago but it can be only a guess.  A guess, based upon last year's figures, must of necessity be a <Col N="838" /> very inaccurate guess because a guess based on last year's figures is only based on the financial condition of the country when the country was far better off than it is this year.</P>
    <P>I venture to say that if there is a fall in the revenue yield that fall will be nothing like £500,000&mdash;it will be nothing like half of it&mdash;if this amendment is accepted.  There has been a steady drop during the other years. If you consider the general condition of the country now, and if you consider that the entire farming class are short of ready money you may not be altogether wrong if you estimate at three-fourths the drop in consumption during this coming year.  It is upon your estimate of what the drop this year will be that you can base your estimate as to what the real loss to the revenue will be in the coming year. That is a matter on which I think every Deputy in the House who knows the conditions of the country is just as well able to form an opinion as even the Revenue Commissioners themselves &mdash;assuming that that very fallacious argument came from the Revenue Commissioners. That is an assumption of Deputy Dillon's, an assumption with which I do not agree.  The Revenue Commissioners are prone to deal with figures, but dealing entirely with figures they cannot be expected to deal with a financial cataclysm like the one which is coming upon the country at the present moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say just a few words on this amendment and to reply to the Minister for Finance as regards his challenge to the Opposition. He challenged the Opposition to say what means they would adopt to find this half million pounds which will be lost to the Revenue if the amendment were passed.  I must say that is a legitimate question for the Minister for Finance to put to the Opposition.  It is one, I think, that should be answered as far as it is possible to answer it.  I think, personally, I am in a position to answer the Minister's question.  I always held the opinion that the Government's policy was all wrong as far as the provision of employment for the people of this country was concerned. <Col N="839" /> Not only did I express that opinion in this House against the Government's policy but I also expressed it on the occasion of the last General Election.  It was an unpopular view to unfold but yet time has, I think, proved to a great many people in this country, as it will undoubtedly prove to the Minister, that the more he expends on social services and the more he endeavours by taxation or otherwise to cure unemployment, the more unemployment he will create.</P>
      <P>Take the Minister's own words&mdash; where is the money to come from for the provision of work for those who are at the moment unemployed and where is the money to come from for carrying on social services?  I ask the Minister a pertinent question by way of reply and it is: where does he get the money for the carrying on of the social services at present?  Is it not from industry?  Is not the brewing industry one of the chief sources of revenue by which the Minister is able to finance schemes of social service?  Is it not the chief source of revenue for the provision of grants for the unemployed? According to the circular issued by the members of the Licensed Grocers' and Vintners' Association, even in the year 1932, which is the last year for which the figures are available, the revenue derived by way of Excise duties on spirits and beer is well over £5,000,000. That is a very large sum as far as the National Revenue is concerned.  I find that the reduction in revenue derived from spirits between 1924 and 1932 is somewhere in the region of well over £1,000,000.  The reduction as far as beer is concerned is still more remarkable. It is £2,878,805.  If this reduction in revenue continues at the same rate as it has, according to these figures from 1924 to 1932, is it not commonsense to expect that in a few years more there will be absolutely no revenue from the duties on spirits and beer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated when this amendment was first introduced, it is a bad policy to kill old industries.  The Minister should consider that this is an industry that has given very much employment in the past and employment, too, of a <Col N="840" /> very remunerative nature.  The people engaged in that industry, the people who have carried on the industry in fair winds and foul winds in the past 15 or 20 years deserve consideration and recognition.  At least they deserve the same consideration and recognition as the Minister is giving to those people who at the moment are setting up factories behind tariff walls.  That is good policy to a certain extent.  But I ask the Minister does he consider it fair to safeguard industries by the imposition of a 40 or 50 per cent. tariff while leaving other industries that have stood the test of time to go into decay?  That is the position with regard to the beer and whiskey industry at the present time. As has been already stated, there is not a Deputy in this House who is supporting the amendment who is desirous that the consumption of drink shall increase.</P>
    <P>I am in thorough agreement with Deputy Anthony when he states that the workingman, if he wants a pint of stout, is entitled to have it at a price that he can afford to pay, and the price at the moment is prohibitive. Even if there were a decrease that decrease could be diffused all over the two or three million inhabitants of this State without any fear that the Irish people would become addicted to the vice of intemperance. As far as my knowledge and experience go, the people will preserve their dignity.  I would like to see a similar state of affairs obtaining here to that which obtains in certain Scandinavian countries where a person can get a drink in any house, not necessarily a licensed house.  I think the people can be trusted, even with a reduction in the price of beer and stout, not to become necessarily addicted to the vice of intemperance. I do hold, however, that it is no argument to ask where is the money to be found and to place the onus on the Opposition to find that money. I am prepared&mdash;but this is not the proper occasion for it&mdash;to argue this whole question with regard to the relation of the Government with the provision of employment for the people.  I do say that motions were <Col N="841" /> proposed in this House by the Government Party, when they were in Opposition, which meant the saving or spending of sums much larger than the sum proposed to be effected by this amendment.  For instance, there was a motion introduced some few years back in regard to derating, another with regard to the annuities and the question of rates during the continuation of the economic war, which, if passed, would necessarily mean a very large reduction in the revenue.  This is a question of saving a great industry which, as I have said, means a revenue of anything from £5,000,000 to £6,000,000 which is in danger of being lost altogether if the present high taxation continues for a period of years equal to that from 1924 to 1932.  Assuming that the decrease continues at the same extent for a corresponding number of years in the future, it will mean that the Minister then in power, whoever he may be, will have absolutely no revenue from this once great industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this amendment before it is put to the House.  I have never believed in prohibition as a cure for drunkenness, and neither do I believe in extravagant taxation, which practically amounts to prohibition, as an aid to temperance.  I had some experience years ago in a country where there was limited prohibition, where there was optional prohibition in some districts as against others, and it was notorious that in the districts where there was prohibition there was much more drunkenness than in the free or open districts.  As one who does not imbibe stout, I think I can say I have no personal interest in it.  I have no relatives engaged in the trade.  It is to the workers mainly that the question of beer, porter and stout applies&mdash;at least in the various cities.  In the large cities where there are ports, there are men in certain classes of work to whom a drink of stout or some similar drink is practically a necessity.  I am referring to dockers and men engaged in similar work on ships which, as Deputies know, is very difficult work, and in which the men engaged are constantly <Col N="842" /> swallowing huge quantities of filthy dust, and it is practically a necessity for these men to get their pint.  They do not indulge to excess and are not likely, even if the reduction in price were much lower than is proposed in this amendment, to indulge to excess; but a penny in the pint means much to these men and to their families.  As I say, a pint of stout a day is a necessity to such men and a reduction of a penny in the weekly aggregate would mean a good deal to these men and their families. There are other classes of workers also to whom this equally applies.</P>
      <P>As to the great brewing industry itself, the Minister himself knows that it is an industry of which we are all proud and, if we could help the industry, well and good.  I am not interested primarily in the very great firm in this country with its world-wide reputation.  I think it is pretty well able to take care of itself and I do not anticipate any great danger there; but I am interested in the workers, and I am as much interested in temperance as any Deputy in this House.  I do not believe that any reduction in the price of stout, such as this amendment proposes to bring about, will have any effect whatsoever on the temperance cause.  It will not add to the amount people drink or, even if it did add a pint of stout to the quantity some labourers drink, it will not mean that there is any danger of them graduating into drunkards.  Penal measures of any kind never made any man sober. I think it was Deputy Morrissey who referred to the fact that if a man is a drunkard and wants drink, and drink can be got, he will get it.  That is my own experience also.  I have seen men who had not a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; in their pockets who would have their glass by some hook or crook.  Prohibition or heavy taxation is no aid whatever. The drunkard will find his drink and it is for the honest workingman of this State we are appealing in this measure. I see no harm in such a man having his pint of stout or glass of beer and if it can be made a little cheaper for the working man, all the better.  That is the reason I am supporting this amendment.</P>
