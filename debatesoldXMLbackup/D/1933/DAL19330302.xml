    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce in his speech yesterday afternoon furnished the House with a very clear and detailed explanation of the negotiations which were carried on between himself and the trade unions on the one hand and the directors of the railway companies on the other, and the circumstances which led up to the proposal made by the Government for the payment of a subsidy to maintain wages during a particular period.</P>
      <P>The Minister, however, did not give the House any reason why the subsidy was withdrawn in so far as it affected the employees of cross-Border companies. I was glad to hear the Minister say that the Government take full responsibility for the payment of the subsidy.  Personally, I would not be a party to any proposal which would call upon the taxpayers to provide a subsidy for a public company unless the Government which was making such an offer on behalf of the taxpayers was prepared to take some share of control in the company deriving benefit from the subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to object to the payment of any portion of this subsidy to the Great <Col N="212" /> Northern Company or the County Donegal Joint Railway Company.  The Minister gave a fairly full report of the circumstances which led up to the strike now proceeding.  There have been several national railway strikes and partial national railway strikes since 1911.  In the course of those strikes it was customary for the unions representing the different sections of employees in the railway industry to consider separately what course they would take in case any one union decided to take strike action.  On some occasions all the members of particular railway unions went on strike.  On other occasions some of the railway staff and members of railway trade unions did not go on strike.  That applied particularly to the clerical staffs and the stationmasters.  Whenever the clerical staffs and the stationmasters on the Irish railways did not take strike action they were never asked to do any work other than the work on which they were normally engaged.  I remember, on one or two occasions, general managers calling members of the clerical staffs and inviting them to do work other than that on which they were normally engaged.  In all cases the men refused and no action of any kind was taken as a result of their refusal.</P>
    <P>In the case of the existing strike, action of an unprecedented nature has been taken by the management of the Great Northern Railway and by the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee. One or two days after the strike commenced the manager of the County Donegal Railways called upon a certain stationmaster in Donegal to do a signalman's work.  The stationmaster rightly refused to do it and he was instantly dismissed.  A clerk employed at the same station also refused to do the work and he, too, was sent home.  Such action has been unheard of in the case of any railway company where the employees took strike action.  At least that is my own experience, and I do not think that such action is within the knowledge of anyone concerned with railway trade unions.  In or about the same time the management of the Great Northern Railway Company, through the agency <Col N="213" /> of a man who was born in Scotland and worked most of his time in China and who was called here to mismanage the Great Northern Railways, called members of the clerical staff to the traffic manager's office at the headquarters in Belfast.  I may say, in passing, that that is a most unusual thing.  The individuals who were invited to attend were asked to do work other than that upon which they were normally employed.  They were invited to do work for which, as it was described on paper, of which they were physically capable; in other words, they were asked to go out on lorries driven by blacklegs and undertake the work of loading and unloading those lorries.  They refused to do that and they were sent home and told that their services would no longer be required.</P>
    <P>That policy in effect means that this particular company will be in a position to use money for the purpose of forcing people to do work which they were never previously called upon to do.  I take very strong exception to the payment of any money to a railway company that carries on a policy of that kind.  The Great Northern Railway Company and the County Donegal Joint Railways Joint Committee, which is partly owned by the Great Northern Railway, are well known for the niggardly way in which they treat their staff.  The Great Northern Company, in particular, is well known for the small share of employment it gives to Catholics in the Twenty-Six or the Six Counties.  That fact is known to Deputies representing the areas covered by the Great Northern Railway.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter by way of protest against the policy recently initiated by the companies and in the hope that the Minister will make some representations to the directors or officers of the companies concerned.  I am aware that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been, and perhaps still is, in close touch with some of the directors and officials of these companies. I hope he will take an early opportunity to enter an emphatic protest against the policy now being pursued, and that he will see to it that no favour that can be granted by this <Col N="214" /> House in future will be granted to any company that carries on a policy of that kind.  One of the Great Northern directors recently appointed, a very able man, is the ex-secretary of the Department over which the Minister now presides.  He is supposed to hold, and in my hearing has given expression to, very democratic views on many matters.  I invite Deputies, and particularly those who represent constituencies like Donegal and Monaghan, where some of the men who have been victimised are living, to say what they think of the companies responsible for the victimisation.  I understand that within the last twenty-four hours one of the men dismissed from Glenties station in County Donegal has been told by his general manager, in language not very polite, to get out at once from the house he occupied while acting as stationmaster.  I hope the Donegal and Monaghan Deputies will deal with this matter, and I hope that the Fianna Fáil Deputies particularly will impress on the Minister the desirability of giving no further favours to any company responsible for this type of victimisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why the subsidy was withdrawn from companies operating cross-Border services as from January 30th was because the strike commenced on that day and the subsidy was offered with a view to preventing the strike.  The circumstances that occasioned the strike arose, as Deputies are aware, outside the Saorstat.  But the situation was such that it was apparently considered necessary that the strike should extend over the whole systems of the companies concerned on either side of the Border; the stoppage of work was occasioned by the strike, and the period for which the subsidy was given or devoted.  Consequently the subsidy ceased to be payable. On the other matters mentioned by the Deputy, I am quite clear in my mind as to what is the right course for us to take.  I have received complaints similar to those voiced by the Deputy. I also received certain rebutting statements from the Great Northern Railway Company.  I have not had any information as to the position concerning <Col N="215" /> the County Donegal Railways to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      <P>The facts are, however, that the period for which the subsidy is payable terminated on January 30th.  An agreement was made between the railway companies and my Department that they would pay to their workers in the Saorstát the same rate of wages as prevailed prior to the war and that the difference would be made good to them by the State.  It is clear that the railway companies get no pecuniary benefit at all from the subsidy.  The full amount that will be payable to the Great Northern Railway Company and to the other companies has been already expended by them in the form of wages to their employees.</P>
      <P>The incident to which the Deputy refers and of which he complains took place subsequent to the 30th January, the day on which the subsidy terminated. I do not think, in view of these facts, that we would be justified at all in taking action which would be contrary to the agreement entered into between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the railway companies. The majority of the incidents of which the Deputy complains and the only ones on which I believe I will be unable to get positive information took place in the Six Counties.  There had been no such incidents in the Saorstát portions of the Great Northern Railway system.  And as I mentioned I have no information about one or two incidents of that kind which are stated to have taken place in Donegal, but any information available about these will find its way to me.  The circumstances are such that it would be altogether unjustifiable for us in the light of these circumstances to refuse to make payments which we agreed to make.  Consequently I think this money should be made available by the Dáil.  The subsidy is payable to the Great Northern Railway Company where there is no strike and will only then be payable.</P>

      <P>I quite agree; and I have not asked the Minister to break any agreement which he has already honourably entered into, but I think it is not unfair to ask him to assure <Col N="216" /> the House that no legislative favours or favours of any kind will be given by this House to a company that insists upon pursuing a policy of this kind.  I trust the Minister will take the earliest possible opportunity of making representations to the company for the purpose of getting them to withdraw from the position they have taken up.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim bhreise ná raghaidh thar £15,125 chun ioctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1933, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí i dtaobh Arachais Díomhaointis agus Malartán Fostuíochta, maraon le síntiúisi do Chiste an Díomhaointis.</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £15,125 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1933, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Unemployment Insurance and Employment Exchanges, including contributions to the Unemployment Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various increases in the amounts necessary under the various sub-heads to defray the cost of unemployment insurance arising during the course of the year.  In the first place there is an increase of £9,390 in the amount necessary for salaries, wages and allowances.  That increase arises out of the revised system of registration, which necessitated substantial additions to the staffs of branch offices as well as to the staffs at headquarters.  As certain Deputies are no doubt aware, the number of officers in the employment exchanges and in branch employment exchanges is determined by the number on the live register.  That is to say we calculate the amount of work that has to be done.  In view of the increase in <Col N="218" /> the number occasioned by the new system of registration, additional staff had to be secured.  Additional staff was also required in the Claims and Records Office.  We insisted on the practice of giving preference in employment on relief schemes to persons who are not in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit. That fact had a double effect.  Not merely did it mean that persons entitled to draw benefit remained drawing benefit for somewhat longer periods than they otherwise would, but new claims were created in so far as persons entitled to benefit got work which did not take them out of benefit. The registers in that way were increased and increased staff became necessary.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head B there is an incidental increase in travelling and incidental expenses also occasioned by the new work imposed by the new section of Industry and Commerce.  In sub-head D&mdash;telegrams and telephones &mdash;there is an increase of £100 arising out of the same cause.  During the course of the year the income from the Unemployment Fund in the sale of stamps proved to be substantially higher than was estimated at the beginning of the year.  In other words, the amount of insurance employment in the country was increased beyond what was estimated.  As the revenue of the Fund was increased beyond the Estimate, that is, the revenue from the sale of stamps, the State contribution has also to be increased.  The State contribution is equal to three-sevenths of the revenue from the employers' and employees' contribution.</P>
    <P>If Deputies will turn to sub-head J&mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;they will see there also an increase which is due to the same cause.  The State is entitled to take from the Fund one-fifth of its revenue to defray administrative expenses.  As the revenue from the Fund was increased in excess of the Estimate, the amount to be obtained by way of appropriation-in-aid to meet administrative expenses is also increased by £10,000.  There is an increased of £50 in the amount payable to associations in respect of costs of administration of unemployment insurance. <Col N="219" /> That amount, of course, is always an estimate, and the estimate is never strictly correct.  Ordinarily, a supplementary estimate would not be introduced to make good any deficiency, but as a supplementary estimate had to be introduced this year in any case, we are making that provision.</P>
    <P>These are the principal items in the Estimate.  The total additional cost is £25,290, of which £15,000 is represented by an automatic increase in the State contribution to the Fund, against which the appropriations-in-aid are increased by £10,065, leaving £15,225 to be provided.  There are savings on other sub-heads of £100, so that the amount to be voted is £15,125.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that the Minister would have given us more information on this matter, particularly in view of the very drastic changes the present Government has made with regard to unemployment insurance and regarding the work of the employment, or as we might now, I think, correctly call them the unemployment exchanges.  I had hoped that the Minister would try to justify the scheme introduced by his Government last year, whereby many of those most in need of employment could not secure it, and as a result of which the responsibility was placed upon the branch manager of the exchange not only to supply names to employers and particularly county and town surveyors of men available for employment, but actually to select the men to be put into employment.  I think it is agreed by all Parties in the House, and almost all the members of the Minister's own Party who are in touch with actual conditions in the country, that the scheme instituted by the Minister last year is the worst possible scheme.  I am informed that latterly, perhaps as a result of the criticism directed towards this scheme at the end of last year by members of the Minister's own Party, by members from this side of the House, and by members of the Labour Party, a new scheme was evolved.  I am informed the new scheme is that married men are to get one month's work on any <Col N="220" /> particular scheme of employment in a particular area, that at the end of the month they are dismissed and single men, with or without dependents, are then taken on for a fortnight and at the end of the fortnight they are dismissed. So that, in effect, the first scheme introduced by the Minister meant that a number of married men unemployed got employment.  None of the single unemployed, no matter how many dependents they had, got any employment, as the amount of employment available was never sufficient to absorb the total number of married men unemployed.  The new scheme means in effect that the married unemployed will get one month's work out of twelve.</P>

      <P>The Department which surely was supposed to be controlled by the Vice-President and Dr. Ward is called upon to sanction outdoor relief up to the point of an increase of 60 per cent. over what it was two years ago.  That is perhaps the point which is touching Dr. Ward. We know what the Doctor was when he was a member of the Opposition, and if I may say so with all respect, he has not improved very much since he took office.  Perhaps the office which he now occupies in the new Government is not as high as he expected it would be.  Perhaps the Doctor expected that he would be able to interject from the Front Bench rather than from the Second Bench.  I do say that I can speak from experience on this particular matter, and I am doubtful if there is any member on either the Front Bench or the Second Bench of the Labour Party who will contradict me on that.  I challenge any member of the Front or Back Benches of Fianna Fáil, Cumann na nGaedheal or the Labour Party to deny that bad and all as was the administration of unemployment insurance from 1922 to 1932, it is worse to-day.  It is a fact that there are men unemployed continuously, notwithstanding the efforts&mdash;I am prepared to admit that pretty good efforts were made&mdash;with regard to the relief schemes, for the last twelve months who could not get employment under the Minister's new scheme.  I agree as a general principle that married men should get first preference, but I think it will be admitted by all parties that there are in exceptional cases single men who have a greater dependency <Col N="223" /> than some of the married men, and you cannot lay down a hard and fast rule. I think the Minister's new scheme is much worse than the scheme he had last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (An Clár) Mr. Hogan (An Clár)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(An Clár): I had hoped that I would not have an opportunity of referring to the muddle of the labour exchanges on this Vote.  I had hoped that representations which were made not alone by individual members of the Dáil but by individual public men all over the country, and by public bodies, would have produced from the Minister a scheme that would have removed the grave disadvantages and the grave hardships inflicted at the present time through the labour exchanges on the workers of the country.  I say representations not alone by individuals but by public bodies, because to my own knowledge the Clare County Council has three times wired the Minister for Industry and Commerce pointing cut the hardship that is inflicted because of the operations of the labour exchanges in that county.  I am prepared to give the Minister credit for wanting to get a true picture of the unemployment problem when he started the new registration scheme, but that picture is not what it ought to be at the moment.  In endeavouring to get a true picture of the unemployment problem people were allowed to register at the labour exchanges who had no justification whatever for registering, that is to say people registered as unemployed workers who may in some sense be unemployed workers but who have not the same claim upon work out of relief schemes as the working man who has nothing but his daily labour and his daily wage to sustain him.  I know cases in my own county where men with nine or ten cows are working outside the doors of a working man with eight or nine in family and nothing to sustain them &mdash;no land of any kind; nothing but the four walls of his house.  This statement has been substantiated by very definite cases submitted repeatedly to the Department.  I am not making these charges without having submitted very definite and specific cases <Col N="224" /> to the Department, but no action has been taken.  The county surveyor of my county no later than last Monday submitted a very moderate but still very strong statement showing that the officials of his Department were held up time and time again because of the representations made to them by the various public men in the county that the wrong type of men was put on the jobs being done in the counties.  It could not be otherwise.</P>
      <P>Clare is a big county.  You have three employment exchanges operating in it, one in Ennis, which has to operate for the whole district from Killaloe to Ennis, which is about 32 miles, one in Ennistymon and one in Kilrush.  How can a manager of a labour exchange in Kilrush, when a man who lives 15 miles away comes to register, say whether that man is a labouring man or a large farmer?  How can the manager in Ennis, when the county surveyor or the assistant surveyor wants to employ a man, say whether Tom Sullivan or Jack Murphy from Whitegate, which is 32 miles away, is a labouring man or a farmer? We were told a questionnaire was prepared. I pointed out, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us there was a questionnaire prepared, that unless there was a penalty to be imposed that questionnaire was useless.  I have not heard much of the questionnaire lately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told there is a new scheme and that under the new scheme anybody over a pound valuation&mdash;I am speaking from rumour and do not know whether I am correct or not&mdash;is not going to get employment.  What will that lead to?  This is purely hypothesis, but if it is true it will lead to the worker in the labourer's cottage being knocked out of employment and the farmer's son with a valuation of £15 or £20 will be employed instead.  I want to put it to the Minister that this is a serious problem.  The county council and every public man are bombarded with complaints, and I am besieged every week-end with complaints of this kind. The Minister knows this; his Department knows it; the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance knows it.  Surely it is time that some <Col N="225" /> thing should be done to remove the grievance and relieve the hardship.  I spoke last night about the grievance of men working without unemployment insurance stamps.  We are told that is to be considered and a decision taken. I hope that coincident with that and concurrent with it a decision will be taken on this matter, and that on another estimate we will have an opportunity of referring to it.</P>

      <P>Well, I think if money is to be wasted and thrown about in the name of the Fianna Fáil policy there should be some attempt to waste it properly, waste it on the right people and on the most deserving people, and that is not being done.  There is no doubt whatsoever about that.  Speaking for my own county, my experience, <Col N="227" /> to a very great extent, is this, that the necessary qualification for work is to be a member of the Fianna Fáil Party. That is my experience in my own county.  I repeat it again that the necessary qualification for work is to be a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, and the essential disqualification for work is to be a member of the A.C.A.</P>

I am quite serious when I say that I have not the faintest idea of who the gangers are in my area, but I do know this, from my own experience in my own parish, that there is not an impartial administration of these relief grants.  I am quite sure that some Cumann na nGaedheal supporters and Labour supporters are getting in, but on the whole it does seem to me, looking on as an outsider, that the essential qualification for getting work under these schemes at the present time is to be a member of the Fianna Fáil Party. That does seem to be the position. That is a bad state of affairs.  It is corruption of the worst type and it is the first time that that sort of corruption has been introduced.  It is undoubtedly, and Deputies on the opposite benches know it only too well.  I think I could get a good many of the Labour members to admit that.  Our administration was always impartial.</P>

I am elected by the votes of County Galway to express the same points of view which he was allowed to express without any interruption, and what I do say is this, that the real test for employment at the present moment is not whether a man is in want, whether he is married or single, whether he has a family or not, but whether he is useful to the present Government.  That is corruption of the worst type and will only lead to worse corruption.</P>

      <P>These men are not civil servants.  They are appointed as a result of applications made and of certain examinations carried out by officers of the Department.  They are removable without cause at three months notice and with cause without notice.  They have been instructed by me that one order of preference and one order of preference only is to operate in the selection of men for relief works, and it is the enforcement of that order that is causing all the trouble opposite.  For ten years there was another order of preference. Deputies' memories are getting short. I do not blame Deputy Morrissey who is a new recruit to the Party opposite, but some of his colleagues can tell him that for ten years when they had the administration of the exchanges in their hands&mdash;not secretly but openly and above board&mdash;they used these exchanges for the benefit of their adherents.  What was the order of preference then?  The first preference was to ex-members of the National Army who were married.  The second preference was to ex-members of the National Army not married, and it was only when all these had been provided for that the ordinary common or garden civilian got a chance of getting employment on relief works.</P>

      <P>That was their way of doing it.  We abolished that order of preference and that is the cause of all the trouble.  A non-political order of preference was substituted for it.  That order of preference may not be perfect. The fact that we propose to modify it is an indication of that.  It is founded on experience.  Although the principles upon which it was framed were just, in its practical operation it sometimes occasioned harsh treatment.  We are changing it on that account, but definitely it is based upon this principle: that no political influence is going to operate in the selection of men for unemployment relief works or in the distribution of relief money.  One consideration and one consideration only is going to prevail, the absolute <Col N="232" /> and relative need of the persons concerned for relief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have intervened until I rose to conclude the debate were it not for the fact that Deputy Hogan thought fit to make these allegations against these public servants who are not here.  I have not found, I am speaking now entirely from recollection, in the case of any officer of the Department in County Galway, that any complaint of that kind, any complaint that political influence was being brought to bear on these officials and that they were using their positions for the benefit of one political party, was well-founded.  These complaints come quite frequently from supporters of Fianna Fáil.  In fact, so far as my Department is concerned, we get a hundred complaints to the effect that some official is using his position for the benefit of Cumann na nGaedheal to the one that we get of a contrary kind. In view of the fact that all the officials in these exchanges, with few exceptions, were men placed there by our predecessors, it is not unnatural that these complaints should bear that complexion, but I am glad to say that as a result of the investigations made&mdash; every one of them has been investigated down to the hilt&mdash;only very few of them were found to be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And where they were found to be justified the officials concerned were instantly removed.  So far as Galway is concerned, we get fewer complaints about Galway than we do about most other places. Speaking from recollection, I think I am correct in saying that in the case of Galway not a single one of them was found to be justified.  I do not say that mistakes have not been made.  They have been made.  We imposed a considerable amount of additional work upon these exchange managers and branch managers.  At the beginning they had not got at their disposal the <Col N="233" /> staffs to enable them to deal with this additional work.  A man in a branch exchange area that had a normal register of 200 or 300 found, as a result of the new system of registration and the inducement to register, that the register increased to 2,000.  His work had been multiplied by ten.  Naturally, in view of that, it took a considerable period before he could get the office and the staff organised so that the work could be done as efficiently as it was when he had to deal with a register of only 200 or 300.</P>
      <P>In a number of areas the machine is not yet running smoothly under the new system.  Because of that, when a man failed to get relief work that he felt he was entitled to, either because of some discrepancy in the records or some mistake on the part of the branch manager, he immediately wrote to his Deputy and alleged that the reason he did not get the work was because the branch manager was prejudiced against him.  In all such cases, when a complaint reached my Department an inspector went down and examined the register.  He examined all the information at the disposal of the manager as to the dependents and the relative need of the persons on the register.  If it was found that a person had been placed in employment when others more entitled to it were available, then the necessary disciplinary action was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the nature of the complaints that we are getting?  It is just as well to get this cleared up.  One is that the branch managers have not got the machinery at their disposal which will ensure for them accurate information as to the needs of the persons registered. The second is that the system of preference which we are operating is very unfair to single men with dependents or single men without dependents.  These are the two main complaints that we are getting.  As most Deputies will admit&mdash;we propose to alter the instructions to branch managers&mdash;certain difficulties have to be overcome, and the concurrence of the Department of Local Government has to be secured before that can be done.  It is to be understood that the <Col N="234" /> instructions apply only to relief works. As far as the ordinary works of the county councils or other work of a public nature are concerned, the function of the exchanges is merely to supply the names of available workers capable of doing the work.  In the case of these public works where it is essential that full value must be got for the money expended, the first consideration must be the suitability of the worker to do the work and his efficiency&mdash;I mean his willingness to work hard and to get the job well done.</P>
    <P>In the case of relief works another consideration enters in and it should, in my opinion, be the prime consideration&mdash;that is, the need of the applicant for relief.  In his case efficiency to do the work or his physical strength becomes a secondary consideration to his need for relief, because relief works are intended mainly to be a device to case destitution wherever it exists.  In connection with these relief works it is proposed to bring into operation, where feasible, and of course, it is only in certain cases it would be feasible, a rotation system. The rotation system that we have in mind would mean that a man would be placed in employment for a period of a month.  If there were other workers available and seeking employment and for whom there was no work on the scheme for the first month, then they would get the second month's work, and the register would be rotated in that way so that everybody available for work, and entitled to relief work would, so long as the work lasted, get an opportunity of being employed upon it.  So far as single men are concerned, it is proposed to retain for them a definite percentage of the work and also to retain the work amongst them to ensure that they also will, each one of them, have an opportunity of getting some part in it.  The second complaint which has been made, namely, that branch managers and exchange managers are not in a position to get accurate information as to the relative needs of the persons applying for work will, I think, be met by a certain provision which it is intended to bring into <Col N="235" /> operation and which will, in fact, result in the preparation of a separate register, a register of the persons eligible for this relief work, of those people who are, because of their circumstances or otherwise, considered to be eligible for these works.</P>
    <P>On that register will be included only persons who ordinarily depend for their livelihood on working for hire.  We would exclude from it persons who ordinarily are landowners, or are in a position to follow other occupations, and we will try to confine it to persons who are dependent for their livelihood on getting employment, with certain exceptions, because people may follow certain part-time occupations which, however, are totally inadequate to yield them a livelihood, and may have to work in addition to that part-time occupation, when such work offers to them.  When that is brought into operation, I think we will have succeeded in dealing with the two main complaints against the present system and which have resulted from it.  The full details of what we propose to do have not yet been worked out, because of the fact that there are two Departments concerned, but we hope to have them completed in the near future.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing I want to say. I am anxious to have made available to members of the Dáil all possible information on this matter.  I think that the only possible way any Government can administer any scheme that relates to relief works, or that is intended to ensure that hardship would be relieved in particular parts of the country, is by doing so in the fullest possible light of publicity and, unlike Deputy Hogan, I think that is the best politics.  As Deputy Flinn said here yesterday, the best course to follow having regard to political considerations only, is to be as fair as possible and as above board as possible, and that is what we are trying to do, because it gets us votes.  The other matters that were raised were not really relevant to the Vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

One of the great advantages of the Dáil is that you can speak your mind, and I am not going to be prevented from speaking my mind by any of this sort of bluff from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.

      <P>I would expect that. The Minister for Industry and Commerce might disagree, but at least there was this to be said, that there was some general rule, some general regulation, some standard to be applied about which everybody knew and of which everybody could judge. Here, what have you?  You have merely the influence of the local ward heeler of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He is the man to say who is not to be appointed and who is not to be appointed.  That is the present state of affairs in the country with regard to the administration of relief works. The Civil Service have no responsibility whatever for it, and I am sure there is not a decent civil servant in the country who does not object to it and dislike it, but the present situation in the country is that men are employed not because they are poor, not because they deserve work, not because they are married men and <Col N="239" /> have children, but purely on a political test and on no other.  It is well that that should be stated openly here in the Dáil and that the country should know it, and I tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and his colleagues also, that it is not going to last for ever.  That sort of rottenness and corruption cannot last for ever and it will not last for ever, and I believe that the country will ultimately react against it.</P>

In the other case the man <Col N="240" /> is a farmer and never worked for anyone but himself.

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to emphasise the point made by other Deputies with regard to the unfair discrimination that is exercised, because of a rule of the Department to prevent single men with dependents getting work before married men without dependents. Many genuine cases of hardship have been brought to my notice where single men with dependents running into four and five persons have been unable to procure employment on relief schemes because of this unfair discrimination.  I suggest to the Minister that that particular rule should be altered, because so many cases of hardship have arisen under it.  In my view a married man with a wife and no family is not as serious a case as a single man with four or five dependents. Although the Minister's Department was given the facts in a case of genuine hardship in Cork, by the Minister's orders a man was precluded from getting work.  The case I refer to was afterwards treated by the City Manager and the man got work.  That does not get away from the fact that this rule operates in the Minister's Department and causes grave hardship to many single men with dependents.</P>
      <P>I deprecate very much the introduction into this debate of any strictures on the Civil Service.  So far as Cork City is concerned the manager and officials there never discriminate but administer the law according to the Act.  I am aware that up and down the country preference is exercised by managers.  That is not so in Cork City. I must say that in the county preference is exercised in favour of persons who have a certain political bias.</P>

      <P>That should not be the case, unless, as I feel, we are beginning <Col N="241" /> to Americanise all the institutions of our State, and I know where that will end.  Assuming that Deputy Cosgrave's Government comes into power at some future date I suppose he will be justified, according to this code of morals, in &ldquo;sacking the lot.&rdquo;  I merely suggest that it is about time the present Executive Council cried &ldquo;halt&rdquo; to this practice.  Just as violence begets violence, there will be certain reactions, and they will have only one effect, to Americanise all the institutions of the State.  The discussion will have a rather disturbing effect upon many managers of labour exchanges.  I deprecate the introduction of the names of civil servants into the discussion, as it will have a very disturbing effect.  We are after sacking General O'Duffy because he did not please the Fianna Fáil Party. It naturally follows that the position of every manager in the labour exchanges in this State will be in jeopardy if he does not employ at least ten Fianna Fáil followers to one Cumann na nGaedheal supporter in any relief scheme, while supporters of the official Labour Party and the nonofficial Labour Party will have no following.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from the Minister that he has a scheme, and that while other people have had notice of that scheme, and have certain criticisms of it, he is going to stick to that scheme, with, perhaps, some modification with regard to the line of preference.  Do I understand, rightly, that there is a definite scheme, in so far as unemployment relief work is concerned, and employment on the <Col N="242" /> £1,000,000 for road work, and that persons employed&mdash;other than gangers, about whom there is some dispute&mdash; must be taken through the labour exchanges?  At any rate, proceeding on the assumption that that is so, I ask the Minister to give us a chance of seeing his scheme in its purity.</P>
      <P>I take it the scheme is the scheme of the Executive Council and that it stands over it.  A certain preference was indicated by the Minister when he was last dealing with this Estimate for relief work.  If there are to be modifications made, I would ask the Minister to make known as early as possible what these modifications are, and what the new preference is to be, with a view to enabling us to see his scheme in all its purity, and to judge it, apart altogether from misunderstanding or wrong working.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw attention to a matter about which I have already tried to get an explanation from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  If the Minister is standing over his scheme he should see that the officials endeavouring to apply that scheme are not obstructed, and that it is not one of waste paper in certain districts.  I ask him, if he has not already done so&mdash;as he ought to have done&mdash;to look at the discussion that took place on the 30th November last, and to the charge made by the county surveyor in Mayo as regards the way his scheme was working.  We are told that all the people were selected by the labour exchanges.  That is not so. The Minister has a statement over the signature of a most responsible county official that, as far as Mayo is concerned at any rate, his Department is not being allowed to work there or was not being allowed to work in November last.  There, instead of the labour exchange selecting the men for this class of work, the county surveyor states, as quoted in column 491 of the Dáil Debates of 30th November last, that: &ldquo;In a number of cases gangers are putting men to work on receipt of notes from different people not connected with the county council and works committees have been set up in areas to select the men in advance and supply the names to the gangers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> I would ask the Minister, if we cannot get any satisfaction from the Minister for Local Government, does he not consider that he is responsible for the scheme which the Executive Council have asked the labour exchanges to operate?  Will he look into the matter and give us an assurance that his scheme will work in Mayo, until we see what it is really like in operation, because while there have been many complaints in regard to the bad results obtaining from his scheme, they are not at all so bad, to my mind, as compared with the results which this responsible county official reports have arisen from the repudiation of that scheme.  In the same column the Minister will see that the county surveyor reports that &ldquo; in one case a ganger had twelve men employed.  One was a boy about 15 years, working in his father's name, ten were single young men, both of whose parents are alive and land-owners, and not one of them had dependents.  In fact two were working in their brothers' names, not having registered, and there was only one married man.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In another case a ganger had 19 men employed, 13 of whom were single men, and only one had dependents.  Several married men with families, up to ten in number, came along and complained, but were refused work on the job.  So if Deputies from different constituencies have to complain that the scheme as intended by the Minister is working badly, goodness knows it cannot be working as badly as that.  I submit to the Minister that he should deal with these complaints, and see that his scheme is worked in all its purity until we get a chance of judging it.  I should like if the Minister could tell us when he expects to let us have the facts which he is preparing in respect of the unemployment position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce now realises that there was no necessity to work himself into such a passion over an idea that he appears to have in his head about an attack which no member of the House has made.  There was no attack made by any Deputy <Col N="244" /> speaking here on the officials administering the labour exchanges, but there was a definite attack from every quarter of the House in regard to the regulations which he had imposed on these officials in the carrying out of their duty.  The managers of the labour exchanges are carrying out their duties as fairly as it is possible under the regulations that have been made. I think that is the general impression of every Deputy in every Party in the House, but the case that is being made &mdash;and it appears that the Minister is not aware of it&mdash;is that in the employment of men on relief works all over the country Fianna Fáil clubs are assuming responsibility for saying who will or who will not be employed.  The Minister has asked for instances.  I can give him several instances.  I can give him two from the town of Manorhamilton, where a prominent Fianna Fáil leader in that town organised a mob of hooligans to go out and stop work that had been started on a relief scheme two miles outside the town because he was not satisfied with the men who were employed upon it.  That work was stopped and negotiations were going on about it immediately after the elections.  It was stopped during the period of the elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course the Minister is aware that the election was announced so hurriedly, that works had to be started all over the country, and it may not have been possible to make the necessary arrangements to have things done in a regular way in every area.  I can tell him that his local leaders in Leitrim made sure that no supporter of Cumann na nGaedheal was allowed to get one week's work before the election in Leitrim.  In another instance this mob stopped the relief scheme that was going on.  They then marched out next day with a band. They thought that it would be more spectacular and would show people that they were an authority, and they started another relief scheme in another district.  I can give him an instance that happened in the Kileyclogher district, where four poor boys who did not get any earnings in that backward district for perhaps twelve months made application to be employed <Col N="245" /> on the local relief works. Having approached the ganger they went to the local county councillor and the local county councillor told them that the only chance of getting employment on the work was to go round to the Fianna Fáil club, and if the club approved of them he would see that they got work.  That is the way the relief schemes are being operated in Leitrim.</P>
    <P>It appears the Minister is not aware of these facts from the speech he has made.  I hope now that he is aware of them he will take steps to see that there is no party test in giving employment where employment is needed in any district, and that there will be a fair administration of relief work in that part of the country.   The same practices I know prevail in various other parts of the country.  When the Minister had worked himself into a heat&mdash;I do not know whether he was genuine in that heat, he may only have been erecting a smoke-screen to divert an attack that was made on himself on to his officials&mdash;he remarked that I had responsibility for appointing some of the branch managers.  In the case of any appointments I made in the exercise of my discretion, during my administration, I think if he examines the records of the men appointed and their fitness for the position, he will admit that they had the necessary qualifications, and that I always took care to see that so far as possible any of them that were appointed had a record of national service in this country.</P>

      <P>I was a bit mystified when I listened to the Minister's intervention in this debate.  I think the Minister, in a rather heated and bellicose manner, spent some twenty minutes refuting or attempting to refute some alleged charges made by Deputy Hogan, and after the Minister had sat down and Deputy Hogan resumed his statement, I heard the Minister asking the Deputy what were the charges.  It was obvious to me that when the Minister was previously speaking he did not really appreciate or understand what he was speaking about.  After he sat down he announced that to the House by asking Deputy Hogan to tell <Col N="246" /> him what the charges were and what the charges were about.  Having listened to the Minister from the beginning to the end, I heard one statement at the end of his speech which I believe was a thoroughly sincere and honest statement on behalf of the Minister.  The Minister said: &ldquo;We are endeavouring to carry out this work along certain lines because it gets us votes.&rdquo;  I believe that was sincere.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that that was honest and sincere because I believe that the whole policy of the Minister is framed around that particular sentiment: How best to get votes.  I believe that the policy of the Minister is framed, not around what is nationally good or what is nationally sound or even economically sound, but that it is framed on the question of how best to get votes.  I propose to assist the Minister.  I propose to assist him even to the extent of helping him to get votes.  I want to assist the Minister in carrying out this scheme along impartial political lines and I want to re-echo the sentiments already expressed here by other Deputies that the weakness and the corruption of the whole scheme of relief works lies in the ganger.  Gangers are taken on right through the country through Fianna Fáil clubs, and those gangers in turn take on workers only through those Fianna Fáil clubs.  Straight away, I admit to the Minister that at this moment I am not in a position to produce absolute proof of the statements I am making, but I hope to be able to do so within a very short time. I had hoped that I would have been able to produce it by to-day but the hold-up in the country during the last week prevented it.  Had it not been for that hold-up I would have been in a position to produce ample evidence.</P>

      <P>I am stating what the people are saying generally and I have travelled through too many counties and heard too many complaints <Col N="247" /> to think for one moment that all those complaints are lies.  Right down throughout the country we heard complaints in recent months that men are only getting employment out of these relief works if they belong to a particular political club.  I have knowledge that men who did not previously belong to such clubs, when they got a tip in time to join such clubs, found that it was not long before they got employment.  That is a general belief and that report or that story has been told to me too often for me to believe that everybody who tells that story is either politically corrupt or a liar. Generally, throughout the country, these statements are being made.  My position shows any number of allegations to that effect.  The Minister says that he has received hundreds of complaints from Fianna Fáil supporters to the effect that the supporters of that Party are not getting a sufficient amount of that work; but later on, in reply to an interruption, he said that if Fianna Fáil were to get their fair proportion of the relief work the proportion would be ten to one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say that at the time.  It is within the Minister's right, of course, to mend his hand as the debate proceeds.  It is my hope that he will mend his hand a little further and that he will attempt to differentiate by districts in proportion to the amount of work for the various parties in certain districts.  I would be quite prepared to accept the principle that the supporters of the various Parties in this House would get work in proportion to the strength of the respective parties in the particular areas involved, if that is what the Minister is driving at now.  Heretofore, as Deputy Mulcahy said, we knew where we stood with regard to relief work.  Men who had served the State, men who had fought in order to consolidate the State and in order <Col N="248" /> to make it possible for a Ministerial front bench to function over there&mdash; such men were given preference in relief work.  That preference was removed, and I remember that at the time when the regulation was introduced into this House the Minister said that that preference was being removed in order to bring about a situation of absolute equality.  He said that it was being removed in order that people of all parties should get equal right to work or at least an equal place in the queue for work. Since that announcement was made we have experienced anything but equality in getting work.  There is no use in nibbling at words.  We have absolute corruption and victimisation right throughout this State with regard to employment out of relief work.  We have victimisation of the supporters of certain political parties. We have members and ex-members of the army denied work because they belonged to the army.  We have members of another organisation, the Army Comrades' Association&mdash;it does not matter what the aims and objects of that association are at the moment; it was brought into being for really pure and clean and democratic principles&mdash;but we have members of that organisation told to withdraw from it if they want to get work; and we have evidence that if they do withdraw from that association they do get work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; I will submit the whole lot to the Minister.  Inside the code of regulations we have a topsy-turvy position.  Nominally, the married men are supposed to get first preference, and the single men, irrespective of the number of their dependents, have to go to the bottom of the list.  No regard is paid to a man's efficiency as a worker.  No regard is paid to what satisfaction that man gave in his previous job.  No regard is given as to whether that man was a good worker or a bad worker, whether he lost his employment through no fault of his own or through <Col N="249" /> his own fault, whether he was a victim of the closing up of the firm in which he was engaged.  No regard is paid to whether he was a man working for 17 or 18 years continuously without drawing home relief or any other kind of assistance&mdash;since he is a single man, and the last to be out of work, he must go to the bottom of the list, and any rogue or any criminal or any shirker who has always dodged work may come before that man on the list for preference.  I understand that the single men and married men who are longest out of work have got to go to the top of the list, and that single men and those most recently out of work, irrespective of the conditions of their former employment, must go to the bottom of the list.  I think that some encouragement should be given to the good workman.  I think that some consideration should be given to the man who has held down a job through good years and bad years, but who has now lost his job through no fault of his own, and that a certain length of time of satisfactory service in a job should at least equate the fact of his being a married man or a single man.  I think, if we are going to stir up a spirit of work or a spirit of endeavour and of giving satisfaction to employers, that the grading in the line of preference for work should depend on a man's references, and the satisfaction which he, as an individual worker, gave in his previous employment.</P>

      <P>I did not intend intervening in this debate at all but Deputy Hogan made the statement that all the gangers employed on this relief work had to be appointed on the advice of the local Fianna Fáil T.D.  I can speak for the County Waterford.  I was not asked to suggest anybody as a ganger.  I do not know who the men appointed are and no suggestion was made at any time that I should propose anybody for one of those jobs. Dr. O'Higgins states that victimisation has taken place.  I have a letter here which may interest him.  Probably every Deputy has got a letter similar to this but in view of the fact that such strong statements have been made by Deputies on the other side as to victimisation and preference, this letter <Col N="250" /> may be of interest as showing that all the complaint is not on one side.  The letter I have in my hand states: &ldquo;The person in charge of this job is not giving justice&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I shall give you the name all right.  The letter goes on to say: &ldquo;Men that were good means of electing Fianna Fáil are left idle and White Army lads working.  So far as I can see, we are the laughing stock here.&rdquo;  That is the sort of letter that is coming to Deputies on every side of the House.  If members on the Opposition benches bring forward complaints, we can bring them forward too.  That is only one instance from my county.  I have been approached by men again and again who told me that a certain ganger would not appoint them because he happened to be Cumann na nGaedheal in sympathy and they were Fianna Fáil.  These statements should not be taken too seriously.  Very often, the men applying for the job did not happen to be in the category of men who should be employed&mdash;married men or single men with dependents. Perhaps, they were not on the register. Despite that, they state that they are not employed because they are Fianna Fáil or Cumann na nGaedheal, as the case may be.  There is, of course, a certain amount of truth in this, because human nature being what it is, gangers here and there will take up this attitude.  I saw letters sent out before the election by very big, respectable people containing veiled threats of reprisals, if employees voted Fianna Fáil, and if I read them here and did not say where they came from they would be described as &ldquo;shameful.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question as to whether single men should get a preference, I think they should.  Single men are very often in a worse position than many married men.  I know single men with quite a large number of dependents and very often the discrimination works out very unfairly against them. <Col N="251" /> If the Minister could devise any regulation by which single men would get a preference, I should be very glad because it would save me a tremendous amount of worry.  These men come to me and blame me and blame the authorities because the preference is given to others.</P>

      <P>I was rather amazed by the statements made from the Opposition benches last evening and this evening.  I heard a Deputy from Donegal say that in order to be a ganger in Donegal you must belong to the Sinn Fein Party.  I heard a Deputy from Mayo say that in order to be a ganger in Mayo you must be a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I happen to come from County Longford and the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation there does not seem to realise that there has been a change of Government.  The victimisation carried on under the last administration is being continued up to the present. The result of that is that in County Longford there is a strike on the roads, brought about owing to a man who was very active in the last election for Cumann na nGaedheal.  Men who were hungry and applied for work did not get it, while others got constant employment.  The result was a strike.  I went to see the county surveyor to bring about a settlement and was accompanied by the county councillor for the area.  He asked the county surveyor when he visited this place.  He said that his car broke down and he could not go.  &ldquo;Did you not promise me six weeks ago to go?&rdquo; he was asked.  He said, &ldquo;I will take no dictation.  The rules and regulations are in my office and I am going to be bound by them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended the meeting of the county council yesterday week and there was a letter from the parish priest of the area pointing out that a man with fifty acres of land and eight cows and horses got constant employment, while two Free State Army officers with an income of £130 also got work.  If this festering sore is not immediately dealt with, it will lead to trouble that may be hard to settle later.  The county council asked for a <Col N="252" /> sworn inquiry into the matter and when that inquiry is held we will let Cumann na nGaedheal know who is responsible for the victimisation in Longford.  Although at the last election we had a 65 per cent. poll, we do not want to victimise anybody but we ask for fair play and we hope we will get it.</P>

      <P>A lot of the misunderstanding which is evident from some of the speeches made will be removed if we get the facts stated.  So far as minor relief works are concerned, the exchanges have nothing to do with employment.  These works are carried out through the Land Commission, and as they are mainly in the congested districts, in the very nature of the case the employment must be given to persons living in the immediate vicinity of the works.  So far as other relief works are concerned, the selection of persons for employment rests with the labour exchange managers.  So far as all other classes of works&mdash;county council works, road fund and similar works&mdash;are concerned, the selection of the persons is, in the first instance, in the hands of the exchange managers, but as in these works the prime consideration must be the suitability of the person applying, there is very wide power of rejection in the hands of the surveyors and assistant surveyors.  We have had a number of allegations, and I was struck by the fact that as each Deputy rose and made his allegation, he immediately hurried out of the House in case he should be nailed down to his allegation and made justify it. Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Anthony and Deputy Dolan went out, while Deputy Hogan got up there and hoped I would not see him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to get the mind of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party on this matter.  Deputy Hogan has been a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Ministry and Deputy Morrissey is a member of the Party.  But it is clear they have not the same mind in this matter.  Deputy Hogan alleges the instructions published are not being carried out.  Deputy Morrissey alleges that they are being carried out too rigorously.  Deputy O'Higgins takes both lines.  He started with <Col N="254" /> one allegation and ended off with the other; but they both cannot be right.  Either the instructions are ignored, and persons are placed in employment for political reasons, or else they are enforced, and enforced in too rigorous a manner.  Judging by the complaints I have received, I am strongly inclined to the view that the main cause of grievance is that the instructions are too rigorously enforced and too conscientiously observed by the branch managers.  It is because of that that we are proposing to modify the instructions so as to encourage, so far as it is possible to do so, that individual cases of hardship may not arise.  But I want Deputies to realise that it is not their function to come here and make wild allegations and say that everyone knows there is corruption; that a ganger cannot be appointed unless he is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, and that, as soon as he is appointed, he proceeds to select from the members of the local club those to whom he will give employment.  We want the facts.  Deputies should turn their heads from the methods they are adopting.  If they can justify their allegations let them give the names and the dates and the places, and we will undertake to have the fullest investigation made, and to have everybody responsible dismissed, whether they are in the public service or not, in order to prevent them acting in a similar manner in the future.  That is a fair undertaking.  I repeat, that is the way to get the facts and to play fair.  The reason the Party opposite are in opposition now is because they did not play fair.  The way to get public support is to play the game fairly, to eliminate political influence wherever possible in public administration, to give everyone a fair deal and to do everything above board. We are doing that and we are getting more votes.  If Deputies opposite would realise that that is the way to get votes there might be some chance of their coming back.  When I say that we have adopted that line of policy because it gets more votes this is what we mean: a right and fair policy always gets public support. <Col N="255" /> Good administration coincides with good political tactics&mdash;we start off with it-but we would have adopted good government in any case.  I am inviting Deputies Anthony and Dr. O'Higgins, and Dolan and Hogan and all other Deputies who made allegations of political influence to come forward with the details.  Let them give instances that on such and such a date, and at such and such a place, John So-and-So was placed in employment to which he was not entitled and John So-and-So was dismissed for political reasons or some similar allegation.  If that is put down in detail, in writing, we will have it investigated, and that would enable us to make efforts to have such a thing stopped; but if Deputies are afraid to do this they should cease making these general allegations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you will not. Deputies opposite will go on making these allegations but they cannot prove them.  Deputy Dolan started off by saying that every officer of the Department was carrying out his duty as conscientiously and as fairly as possible, and, then, he proceeded to allege that they were not.  He, like Deputy Hogan was trying to have it both ways. Either what he says about the officers of my Department is not true or else his allegations are not true.  If they are not in fact carrying out their instructions fairly and impartially and efficiently, then his allegation of political influence, in placing men in employment where the branch managers have the selection of the men, cannot possibly arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another warning that I give to Deputies, and I think it is wise, because my Department is a sort of clearing house for whole batches of complaints.  Frequently I get a letter from a Labour Deputy, a Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy and an Independent Deputy showing that John Smith complained to him that he was deprived of employment because he was a supporter of his.  It is clear that the complainant sent a letter to each of the <Col N="256" /> three Deputies stating to each separately that he was refused employment because he was a supporter of his Deputies should not believe everybody who writes to them.  I am sure if many of the Deputies opposite got as many votes, as they receive letters of complaint, they would have done much better than they did in the recent elections.  At any rate, I am prepared to produce to the Dáil a file of letters received by me in one week all containing allegations that the system operating, and the men operating it, and everyone associated with it, are tending to give the work to the supporters of the Party opposite and not to the supporters of the Government Party.  Everyone who fails to get work always attributes that failure to some political reason, and never to the fact that the work is not so easy, and that he is not suitable to the work.  As regards suitability I agree with Deputy O'Higgins.  He talks of giving first preference to the man with a good industrial record and other qualifications of that kind.  That is quite sound, in the case of ordinary employment, but it does not apply so far as relief work is concerned.  That kind of work is intended to secure relief of destitution wherever it exists, and obviously employment must go to those most in need of it.  We tried to get a rule of thumb which although it would not apply in every case would apply in most cases.  We give preference, in such work, to those married against those single; those not entitled to unemployment benefit against those who are.  I am quite prepared to admit that any general rule will work harshly in some cases, but the real way to work is to work on sound principles and with modification until, with experience, we will be able to get a system that will operate unfairly only in a very small proportion of cases.  I think these are all the matters that arise to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked me when the analysis of persons upon the register, which I informed him was being prepared, will be available.  I am not in a position to say.  I think the returns are now in, and it is possibly only now a matter of tabulation.  And <Col N="257" /> it is in that connection that difficulty will be experienced.  As to the publication of the analysis I have yet to decide the best course to take because, as Deputy Hogan pointed out, the information obtained by means of questionnaires has sometimes not been accurate.  Consequently, the conclusion is drawn that tables prepared upon the basis of these questionnaires might be inaccurate.  However, we will try to get the best information available for the Dáil, so that Deputies will have a clear appreciation of the position.</P>
    <P>I am afraid most of the matters we are discussing are not at all relevant to the Estimate.  The Estimate provides for certain increases in administration costs, due to an increase in the number on the register of unemployed, that increase being due to the new system of registration that has been introduced.  It also provides for an additional £15,000 in respect of the State grant to the Unemployment Fund, caused by the fact that there are more people in unemployment than we estimated at the beginning of the year.</P>

Perhaps he will go further and say what is the practice adopted if twenty men are sought for in connection with a particular job. Are those men sent to the ganger? How long are they kept on, and how are the next twenty men taken on?</P>

      <P>What we are proposing to do is to prepare a relief register. That register will be prepared, in the first instance, having regard to several considerations such as the period of unemployment, the number of dependents, whether the man is married or unmarried, whether he has other means and considerations of that kind.  Number one on the list will be the person who, in the opinion of the branch manager, is the person most in need of employment in his area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the practice at the moment.  What we are proposing to institute, where it is feasible, is a rotation scheme.  At present if 20 men are required for work&mdash;in some areas we have agreed to a modification&mdash; the 20 men deemed to be most urgently in need of work in accordance with the regulations we have laid down are sent to the person who requires them and they stay there until the work is finished, even though it lasts for several months.</P>

They were selected and put into these positions when the work was much less <Col N="260" /> onerous than it is at the moment.  The new work placed upon them necessitates a considerable knowledge of the regulations and various Acts of the Oireachtas and other things. Although we have been getting the machine to run a lot more smoothly recently, it is not yet perfect and mistakes are still occurring.  Wherever the mistakes are genuine we generally deal with them by sending a headquarters officer to stay in the area for a period until he has the office put into shape.

      <P>I know it, too.  That it what happened in County Roscommon.  Perhaps it is not a bad practice.  I would like to know from the Minister on whose recommendation are gangers appointed.  A ganger has a certain power of discretion.  I have never seen an instance where the exact number of names is sent down; usually there are more sent than are required, and if the ganger has a certain hall-mark and makes a particular recommendation, then that's that. On whose recommendation are the gangers appointed?</P>

      <P>What is the position, in relation to public works, of people with a certain amount of land?  Are they at any time in free competition with <Col N="261" /> people who have no land?  Are they in certain cases preferred to ordinary labourers, notwithstanding that they have land, and that their means are better than those who possess no land? It is alleged very frequently&mdash;I am getting complaints every day in the week&mdash;that men who have property are getting work under public schemes, whereas people who have no property are being deprived of an opportunity of such work.  What is the position of those people who have property?  Are they being encouraged to register?  Is there any limit beyond which they will not be allowed to register, or is the position simply that if a man with land registers for public employment on the ground that his land is unable to support him, it will be within the discretion of the exchange manager to say that the man's means, or lack of means, entitle him to a place in a certain scheme of public work, and that that man might be preferred to people who have no property whatsoever?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said already that one of the complaints for which there is reason is that branch managers and exchange managers have not got at their disposal the machinery which will enable them properly to estimate the need of applicants for work.  In consequence of the absence of that machinery, it has happened that persons who were not as urgently in need of work as others obtained employment.  We are trying to get over that difficulty by the preparation of a special register.  That is as far as relief work is concerned.  There are cases where cart work is concerned in which the man who owns a cart and horse, and others of that kind, get preference over unemployed men.  It is a frequent source of complaint that cart work is given to small farmers, and indeed sometimes to large farmers. But that is a special case, and we may be able to devise means of dealing with it.  So far as ordinary employment goes, my aim is to secure that it would be confined to people who have no other source or adequate source to provide them a livelihood, men who have nothing except what they get from their work.</P>

      <P>There is nothing to stop substantial farmers from registering. Anyone can register for work.  What we are discussing now is placing them on relief work which is quite a different matter.  The labour exchange has another function altogether.  That has been one of our difficulties.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Work done by the aid of the Road Fund is not relief work. I mean work which is ordinarily done on the roads.  In respect of that expenditure the main concern must be to get the best value for the money spent.  As far as relief work is concerned the main consideration, on the other hand, must be to give relief to those who are most in need of it.</P>

      <P>My question has reference to work done out of the Road Fund as well as other work done out of public funds.  Is it in order to ask whether the Minister has made any discrimination as between people who have land and people who have no property?  Is there any instruction to the branch managers with regard to the ordinary work carried out by the county councils through means of the Road Fund?  Is it possible for small farmers to get work where people who have no property whatever and who are living on their labour would be denied employment?</P>

      <P>Yes, people who own land can get work under relief schemes but they are not entitled to that work if there are other people in the area from which the workers can be drawn who are more urgently in need of work. As a matter of fact, in the West of Ireland there are practically no labourers at all in the strict sense of the word.  All the people there own some land, and the work is done by people in occupation of land.</P>

As far as contractors carrying out housing schemes are concerned, the position is that they are required to recruit their labour from the labour exchange.  But they are quite entitled to keep on rejecting people sent them until they get people who suit their requirements. In practice what they do is to get their own men.  A contractor must be entitled to take his employees at his own discretion because he has got to keep his costs within the contract.</P>

      <P>With reference to the discrimination as between landless men and small farmers, I question whether a man who owns land and has a large family is not worse off than a man who has no property at all. Owners of land, especially for the last twelve months, are not able to make a livelihood.  Many of them have to go to Scotland or England to secure work in order to make both ends meet.  As these men cannot live on their land it is necessary, in order to make both ends meet, that they should get work. They cannot get work in England or Scotland, and for them relief work is more necessary than for a man who has no family, is standing alone, and who has no land.  I trust the Minister will bear that fact in mind and I trust the Deputy will bear it in mind when he is discriminating as between these two classes.</P>

      <P>If the Minister finds it feasible to make separate relief lists, would it be his intention that persons registering at labour exchanges would then be advised as to whether they were being placed on the relief lists or that they were not being so placed?  Secondly, as to the question raised by Deputy Moore as to the range of work to be done under the relief schemes:&mdash;There is, first of all, a sum of £800,000 or £900,000 out of the Road Fund, and then there is £1,000,000 in the way of relief and there are the moneys spent under drainage works.  Then as to the road work, this is half maintenance work and half constructional work.  Do I understand that works operated through the road moneys, as distinct from the ordinary annual grants and constructional grants from the Road Fund, will be relief works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of all works financed out of State funds the labour exchange managers will send on the men.  The ordinary road workers will be sent to the work by the branch managers in the order of preference. But if the work is being carried out by <Col N="265" /> the county surveyor he can, in the case of ordinary road work, reject the men as unsuitable and take other men instead.  In the case of relief works, however, that right of rejection is limited.  In the case of relief works the question of suitability becomes a second consideration to the question of means.  The man who is in most need of the work must get it.  Different considerations, however, apply in the case of drainage schemes.  In these cases it is a question of carrying out the work locally, and the work is generally done by the owners of the land on which the drainage operations are being carried out.  For ordinary relief work the names must be submitted by the branch managers of the labour exchanges, according to their instructions.  We sub-divide these works into two classes: ordinary labour or employment and relief.  As far as ordinary labour is concerned there is the right of rejection on the part of the county surveyor or the officers of the local authority.  As far as employment on relief works is concerned there is only a very limited right of objection by the county surveyors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Few measures which have come before this House have been so often introduced as a Road Traffic Bill.  For various causes&mdash;one of which was the dissolution of the Dáil early in 1932 with resultant change in the Administration&mdash;the last Bill did not proceed beyond the Committee Stage and even though it passed through that Stage it was to have been recommitted on Report Stage and the Government amendments brought forward.  On the Second Reading of that Bill I said that in the nature of things it was not a Bill that could be treated in any sense as a Party matter, and that my colleagues had gone through the Bill fairly thoroughly and they were satisfied it was a measure that met the needs of the time to a very considerable extent.  The Bill of course was capable of suitable amendment, as I think everybody concerned appreciated that in a Bill of such magnitude touching so many phases of everyday life there was room for justifiable differences of opinion.  Subject to certain changes which we have made and which I will indicate later we have not made any very substantial alterations. The Bill in its scope is the same as the Bill which was introduced by my predecessor in 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now recapitulate the main provisions of the Bill as now submitted for Second Reading.  Certain matters of a detailed nature have been dealt with somewhat differently, but many of these matters are of the nature of drafting amendments, and others are more suitable for mention on the Committee Stage.  The Bill contains 175 sections, compared with 160 sections in the original Bill.  There are in fact, 16 new sections&mdash;Nos. 9, 12, 17, 19, 47, 53, 68, 69, 80, 133, 135, 150, 164, 166, 167, 168.  One section, 167 in <Col N="267" /> the old Bill providing for fixing of damages by judge instead of jury has been dropped.  The Bill is divided into 11 parts, and contains a schedule repealing five Acts entirely, and specified portions of 11 other Acts.  The present Bill is a codifying measure retaining anything of present day value in the old Acts, and bringing up to date what is regarded as essential as well as introducing much new matter to meet modern traffic necessities.</P>
    <P>I will take the Bill by reference to its sub-divisions.  Part I (Sections 1 to 13) contains the usual definitions, clauses and provisions relating to the general powers of the Minister to make regulations and hold inquiries as well as the procedure relating to the making of by-laws by the Commissioner of the Gárda, where the Minister's consent is required.  Section 8 sets out in greater detail than formerly the procedure to be followed by the Commissioner, and empowers the Minister to confirm a by-law with modification.  Part I also exempts the State from compulsory insurance, but the responsibility of the State is recognised by Section 168, in Part XI of the Bill, and I will deal with that matter when I am on that part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 relate to finance, the former being aimed at a simplification of the financial arrangements provided under the Roads Act, 1930. The fundamental characteristic of the Bill in the matter of finance is that all outgoings in relation to its working. whether incurred by the Department of Local Government and Public Health or any other Department are, subject to determination by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, to be proper charges to be met from the Road Fund and all fines and fees chargeable under the Bill are to accrue to the benefit of that Fund.</P>
    <P>The new clauses in this Part are Nos. 9 and 12.  No. 9 was considered necessary to facilitate proof of by-laws. No. 12 is a saving clause usually included in Acts relating to mechanically-propelled vehicles.  As to Section <Col N="268" /> 13, the Bill aims at the placing of control for its administration under one authority and this section accordingly repeals provisions of enactments giving concurrent jurisdiction to other authorities.</P>
    <P>Part II (Sections 14-20) provides for the classification of mechanically-propelled vehicles according to weight, construction and use under descriptions which in themselves indicate in less technical language than formerly the particular type of vehicle.  Classification is in effect in the nature of definition for the purposes of other Parts of the Bill, e.g., speed limits.  A power to the Minister to vary the classification is proposed, as it is considered desirable to provide for contingencies arising out of modern development.  It will be noted, however, that no order varying the classification can come into force until it has received the approval of each House of the Oireachtas.  This is a variation of the former Bill which contained the usual clause merely requiring the order to be laid on the Tables of the House for a specified period. The new clause requires affirmative sanction.</P>
    <P>This Part also contains provisions for regulating the construction and equipment of mechanically-propelled vehicles, including the conditions under which such vehicles may be used; for the prevention of excessive noise; regulating the number of trailers which may be drawn at any one time; providing for the issue of special permits for exceptional types of vehicles.  Occasionally in the carrying out of important public work it is essential to take an exceptional type of vehicle by road.  The Bill will enable this to be done and provides for the imposition of conditions, e.g., the owners might be required to take the vehicle between certain specified hours, etc., or if they damaged the road they might be required to repair it.  The power to deal with exceptional vehicles is one of the new sections of the Bill.  Another new section is No. 19, relating to the provision of weighbridges.  The existing facilities for the weighing of heavy motor cars and locomotives are inadequate <Col N="269" /> and, as will be seen from Section 16 (4), the person in charge of a vehicle may be required to bring his vehicle to a weighbridge in certain circumstances, it is essential that the existing law in the matter should be strengthened.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that part of the expense of erecting, maintaining and operating a weighbridge is to be deemed to be part of the expense of maintaining the road.  It will, therefore, fall to be aided by grants from the Road Fund where such grants are made for road upkeep.</P>
    <P>Part III (Sections 21 to 45) taken with Part VI (sections 78, 79, 80) deals with the grant of licences to drive motor vehicles, the grant of certificates of fitness and of competency, the endorsement of licences, disqualifications, the driving of motor vehicles by persons who are drunk or otherwise unfit.</P>
    <P>I have thought it well to raise the minimum age for the holding of a driving licence to 16 years of age&mdash;it was 14 in the original Bill, 15 in that Bill as amended in Committee.  It is a matter upon which there will, doubtless, be some difference of opinion, and is eminently one for the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes severe penalties both by fine and imprisonment for driving without a licence or driving while disqualified.  It does not ask for certificates of fitness if the applicant can make a declaration that to his knowledge he is not suffering from any disease or physical or mental disability which would be likely to cause his driving to be a source of danger to the public.  Provision is, however, made for licences to drive invalid vehicles or vehicles specially adapted to meet a physical disability.  In the case of public service vehicles, the drivers of which are acting in a public capacity, certificates of competency will be necessary.</P>
    <P>Different minimum ages are laid down for drivers of</P>
    <P>(a)  motor cycles&mdash;16 years;</P>
    <P>(b)  light motor vehicles&mdash;17 years;</P>
    <P>(c)  heavy motor cars or locomotives not carrying passengers for reward&mdash;18 years;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> (d)  any kind of motor vehicle&mdash;21 years.</P>
    <P>To assist in identification of drivers; holders of licences will be required to sign their names on the licences.</P>
    <P>The law is being considerably strengthened by the provisions (Section 29) relating to the driving of motor vehicles while knowingly suffering from disease or disability rendering driving a source of danger to others and by the provisions (Section 30) as to driving while under the influence of drink.  In the latter case heavy fines or imprisonment or both fine and imprisonment may be imposed with automatic disqualification for twelve months for a first offence and three years for a second or subsequent offence.  The Bill, at the same time, empowers the courts to review the periods of disqualification after certain intervals.  Power is also proposed to be taken to bring suspected cases of physical or mental disability before the courts.</P>
    <P>The Bill also aims at making it more difficult for disqualified persons to obtain licences by requiring circulation to all licensing authorities of the record of disqualification and endorsements; and imposes heavy penalties by fine and imprisonment on disqualified persons applying for or obtaining driving licences during the period of disqualification.</P>
    <P>Part IV (Sections 46-55) is concerned with the important questions of speed limits and the prohibition of careless and dangerous driving.</P>
    <P>No speed limit is proposed in the case of a motor-cycle or for the light motor vehicle unless the latter is drawing another vehicle, when the limit is 25 miles per hour.  For single-deck large public service vehicles fitted with pneumatic tyres, 35 miles per hour is proposed; for double-deck large public service vehicles fitted with pneumatic tyres, 15 miles per hour is proposed; for other large vehicles fitted with pneumatic tyres and not drawing a trailer, 25 miles per hour is proposed; for other large vehicles fitted with pneumatic tyres and drawing a pneumatic tyred trailer, 20 miles per hour is proposed; for other large vehicles fitted with pneumatic tyres <Col N="271" /> and drawing a trailer not wholly fitted with pneumatic tyres, 10 miles per hour is proposed; for heavy vehicles not wholly fitted with pneumatic tyres and not drawing a trailer, 15 miles per hour is proposed; if drawing a trailer, 10 miles per hour is proposed; for locomotives with soft or elastic tyres with or without trailer, 10 miles per hour is proposed; for other locomotives (that is with, say, iron tyres or drawing two trailers), 5 miles per hour is proposed.</P>
    <P>One of the new sections added to the original Bill is No. 47, under which power is proposed to be taken to make orders varying the speed limits laid down by the Bill, but such orders cannot come into force until they shall have received the approval by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  This provision will make the Bill more flexible, while preserving at the same time direct control by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill lays down maximum ordinary speeds there may be places, times, or occasions where and when special speed limits would be necessary, and provision is made accordingly.  Applications for special speed limits are not confined to councils of counties or county boroughs or boroughs of 10,000 population as at present.  The usual penalty clause (Section 49) is provided for contraventions of the speed limits.  Careless driving as distinct from dangerous driving is also dealt with, and particularly severe penalties for the latter offence are proposed.  The Bill has been modified (Section 51 (3)) to the extent that a person charged with dangerous driving may, if not convicted of that offence, be convicted of careless driving.  Careless driving includes driving without reasonable consideration for other persons and vehicles. Many such cases will occur to Deputies.</P>
    <P>The penalty for driving a dangerously defective vehicle has been increased from £10 in the last Bill to £50, as it was felt the former penalty was altogether too low, and the consequences of driving, say, a vehicle without brakes or with brakes out of <Col N="272" /> order might be very serious.  The present law with regard to fire brigade and ambulance motor vehicles is somewhat obscure, and it was considered desirable to provide&mdash;Section 53&mdash;for the grant of exemptions in respect of such vehicles.  In the matter of prosecutions the Bill contains provisions (Section 56) for the giving of warning and reasonable particulars to persons about to be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that Sections 48 (special speed limits), 49 (prohibition of exceeding speed limits), 50 (prohibition of careless driving), 51 (prohibition of dangerous driving) and 55 (evidence and notice of offences) apply in whole or in part to any vehicle, not merely to mechanically propelled vehicles.</P>
    <P>Part V (Sections 56-77) relates to a matter of supreme importance, viz., compulsory insurance.  It is a subject which might very appropriately be dealt with in a separate Bill, and is one of the most important, if not the most important part of the whole Bill. It may also be said to be the most highly technical.  It lays down in short, that no person can lawfully drive a motor vehicle unless adequate provision is made for the payment of damages for injuries to person or property in the case of third parties, caused by negligence in the use of such a vehicle. That provision may be made either by depositing a sum of £15,000 with the Accountant of the Courts of Justice or by getting a policy of insurance or guarantee from a person who has made such a deposit.  I presume most of the members of the House will themselves lay down the £15,000 deposit.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much further to be said at this stage in reference to the detailed provisions of this part of the Bill.  Very many alterations have been made in some of the clauses as originally drafted, and new clauses have been added.  One of the new clauses added is that providing for the limitation in respect of injury to property to a sum of £1,000.  In the case of personal injuries there is no limitation.  The limitation in the case of property was decided upon after consultation with persons immediately concerned with insurance.  The alterations in the other clauses are not of a <Col N="273" /> type suitable for mention at this stage, and will, of course, be specially brought forward on Committee.  Some fears were expressed when provisions relating to compulsory insurance were previously before the House concerning difficulties which people may experience in obtaining insurance, or if obtaining it, being only granted it at exorbitant rates of premium.  I have been assured, however, that the insurance companies operating here are willing to do their best to give effect to the Bill in a reasonable way, and will take certain suitable steps to secure that insurance is not denied to anyone reasonably entitled to it.  This remark also applies to insurance at reasonable rates of premium.</P>
    <P>Part VI (Sections 78-80) has been dealt with in conjunction with Part III.  Section 80, however, is one of the new sections added to the Bill. It removes a difficulty which existed under the previous Bill.  The new section enables unlicensed persons to be tested as to their skill and competency. As the Bill originally stood, a person should first hold a licence before he could be tested.</P>
    <P>Part VII (Sections 81 to 127), Part VIII (Sections 128 to 143), i.e., 63 sections in all, contain full proposals for the regulation and control of public hire vehicles, large or small, or as they are called in the Bill, public service vehicles.  Part VII relates generally to the control and regulation of such vehicles, while Part VIII contains special additional provisions applicable to the small street service vehicle, i.e., motor vehicles standing on the streets for public hire&mdash;in the case of cities taxicabs.</P>
    <P>The scheme of control and regulation is that no person can use a motor vehicle for the purpose of carrying passengers for reward unless such person holds a licence to do so from the Commissioner of the Gárda Siochána.  The licence must relate specifically to that vehicle.  The vehicle must be serviceable, safe and otherwise fit for the accommodation of passengers and must comply with the Minister's regulations as to construction and equipment.  No licence can <Col N="274" /> be issued without prior inspection and examination by a member of the Gárda <i>who, in the Commissioner's opinion, is properly qualified to make such examination and inspection.</i> These words (i.e., those in <i>italics</i>) have been added to the Bill.  Periodical and occasional inspections are also provided for and such inspections will extend to the fittings and equipment of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>The Section (91) dealing with the use of a public service vehicle while it is unserviceable or unsafe for passengers has been strengthened by its extension to cases of dilapidation or lack of cleanliness.  The penalty has been raised from £10 in the original Bill to £20 as the former penalty was felt to be too low.</P>
    <P>Detailed provisions are set out in relation to the grant and refusal of licences, powers of dealing with unserviceable vehicles, grant of drivers and conductors' licences, including provisions for appeals to the Minister generally in cases where the vehicle and to the courts in cases where the character of the applicant is in question.</P>
    <P>The original provision requiring a conductor to be carried on a vehicle having seating accommodation for more than 14 passengers is still maintained but made specifically to apply to cases of over 14 adult passengers.  Normally this would apply to vehicles with sitting accommodation for 20 passengers and upwards as vehicles are usually constructed by reference to the maximum of the taxation scales.  These scales are 7 to 14; 15 to 20; 21 to 26; 27 to 32; over 32.</P>
    <P>Other important portions of Parts VII and VIII are the provisions relating to overcrowding; rush hour traffic; conduct of passengers, drivers and conductors; restriction of omnibuses to approved roads.</P>
    <P>Both Parts (VII and VIII) contain provisions as to the use of the streets by both large and small public service vehicles.</P>
    <P>In all cases where by-laws or regulations affect local areas particularly the original Bill has been amended <Col N="275" /> to provide for prior consultation with the local authority concerned.</P>
    <P>Part IX (Sections 144 to 157) deals with the general control of traffic and includes matters relating to automatic signals and the laying down of white lines, the provision of vehicle stations by local authorities, the provision and control of parking places, the licensing of parking attendants.  Most of this part may be stated to be, speaking generally, intensely modern in its scope, several of the matters dealt with not having been the subject of previous legislation here.</P>
    <P>The power to local authorities to provide vehicle stations is an addition to the original Bill, and meets some suggestions put up with special reference to the City of Dublin.  No doubt it will prove useful elsewhere, and its enactment will avoid the necessity for procceding by Private Bill legislation.</P>
    <P>The power to close roads to mechanically propelled vehicles or to certain classes of such vehicles on the ground of the unsuitability of such roads is contained in the Roads Act, 1920, but it has been considered desirable to provide in the present Bill for the application of such a power to all vehicles whether mechanically propelled vehicles or not.</P>
    <P>Cases arose where county councils asked the Minister for orders in respect of all vehicles, and owing to the absence of statutory authority such applications could not be considered.</P>
    <P>In the new section the penalty has been increased to £20 from £10.</P>
    <P>A new sub-section (No. 6) has been added to Section 155, concerning traffic over bridges, providing for liability for damages to the owner of the bridge.  The penalty in this section has also been increased from £10 to £20.</P>
    <P>Part X (Sections 158 to 162) brings up to date the lighting provisions already in existence, and adds considerably to those provisions.</P>
    <P>At least two white lights will be required on every motor car (at present only one such light is required); the present red rear light will, <Col N="276" /> of course, also be required as well as a white light illuminating the identification plate.</P>
    <P>For non-mechanically propelled vehicles one white light at least in front will be necessary, and where such vehicles carry a load projecting more than six feet to the rear a red light.</P>
    <P>A new sub-section (No. 5) has been added requiring all vehicles, including pedal cyclists, to carry a red reflector visible to a person in the rear of such vehicle.  It is felt that even motor vehicles should, owing to the occasional failure of the red rear lamp ordinarily carried, be fitted with red reflectors so that the lights of overtaking motor vehicles can &ldquo;pick them up.&rdquo;  The fitting is inexpensive and should be helpful in minimising the risk of accidents.</P>
    <P>Provision (159) is also made for regulating the lighting of trailers and vehicles drawing trailers, as well as for additional lamps.  The dazzle problem is not yet apparently solved, but power is proposed to be taken to deal with it.  The question of exemptions is also provided for where vehicles are used for special purposes or in special circumstances.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposals in the original Bill relating to the carrying of lights in connection with the driving of live stock the section has been redrafted so as to permit reflectors to be used instead of lamps.  The new proposals should not cause any hardship and the carrying of reflectors will be a safeguard for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I now come to the concluding Part, viz., Part XI (Sections 163 to 175).  This Part, as its title indicates, deals with miscellaneous traffic items.  It contains valuable provisions by way of new legislation.  One of the principal of these is the acceptance by the State of liability for damages arising out of the negligent driving of State-owned motor vehicles.  Whatever may be said for the system under which the State made payments in respect of injuries caused by State-owned vehicles, I do not think that anyone regarded that system of ex gratia payments as at all satisfactory.  When <Col N="277" /> this matter was previously before the House it was, I think, the general feeling that the position should be looked into and improved.  After the fullest possible consideration we have come to the conclusion that in this matter the State should stand in the same position as any of its citizens. It will not, of course, be necessary for the State to ensure, and I do not think that there will be any second opinion on that point.</P>
    <P>There was much misconception during the last discussion as to the number of State-owned vehicles.  Out of a total of 56,570 vehicles of all classes, licensed in August, 1932, only 410 were the property of the State, as follows:</P>

    <P>In this Part also we deal with the driving of motor vehicles for excessive periods.  The provisions in the Bill under this head are also an addition to the original Bill, and we think it would be far from complete without some such provisions.  On all sides complaint has been made of the excessive hours men are employed to drive, and one must not be surprised if accidents happen in such circumstances.  The provisions of the Bill in this respect are the special concern of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and will be administered by his department. Another new section in this Part of the Bill is No. 164, requiring the attendance of additional persons where two or more trailers are drawn.</P>
    <P>The person who takes a vehicle without authority, commonly referred to as the &ldquo;joy-rider,&rdquo; is also being dealt with, as well as the person who interferes without authority with the mechanism of a motor vehicle.  In the latter case the penalty has been increased from £5 to £20.  Additional provision has also been made with <Col N="278" /> respect to the disposition of a vehicle where a person has been arrested.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for payments to hospitals in respect of treatment to injured persons and for the extension to the real and personal estate of the liability for injury occasioned by the negligent driving of a mechanically propelled vehicle.  The present position under both these heads is somewhat unsatisfactory.  I do not think I need refer specially to the remaining sections in this Part of the Bill.  I have already referred to the Schedule in my opening remarks.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Bill I have dealt with what is in it.  I now want to allude to a section which we have dropped.  I refer to the section in the former Bill which placed the fixing of the amount of damages for negligent driving in the hands of the judge instead of the jury. We think that the original position was not satisfactory and was undesirable. The new provision making the State liable, as if it were a private citizen, places us in the same position as insurance companies.  We are not nervous that juries will award excessive damages, the safeguarding of which was, I think, the prime object of the original proposal.  It is, of course, a matter that no doubt we will hear some arguments about, but at the moment we are not convinced as to the desirability of such a proposal, and we therefore dropped it from the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill will be regarded as comprehensive a measure as has come before the House for some time.  As I said at the beginning it is not a Bill that can be treated as a Party matter. The House has changed considerably in its personnel since the previous measure was introduced.  I think, in fact, there are some sixty-eight new Deputies.  I feel that I can look to all Parties, to Deputies who have been here before and to the new Deputies to make the Bill meet in every way the necessities of modern traffic and above all to safeguard life and limb on the public roads.  I certainly will consider very carefully any amendment or suggestion which will improve the Bill and I accordingly commend it to the House for Second Reading.</P>

      <P>When the 1931 Bill was before the House I think we all had occasion to speak in complimentary terms of the committee that had examined this matter and of the officials, both in the Department of Local Government and in the draftsman's office, who had contributed to the assembly of the Bill.  There was a very open Committee Stage on the Bill, the idea being that arising out of the discussion that took place here the commonsense of the House would be enshrined, as far as possible, in the final measure.  For the Committee Stage something like 118 odd amendments of various kinds were prepared before February of last year.  Of these, I think about 115 were enshrined in the Bill, so that as far as the general discussion that took place in the House is concerned the Bill, on an original good structure, enshrines most of the commonsense of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister has faced up to some of the problems that were discussed in the House at that time and that at the time did not appear to lend themselves to a very ready solution.  There are, in fact, some matters that we shall need to have some experience of before we can say whether there are any difficulties in them or not.  I am glad the Minister has been able to accept the assurance of the insurance companies that there is no need to depart from what was originally intended in the Bill with regard to compulsory insurance&mdash; leaving it entirely to the insurance companies to decide what persons they would insure.  I feel sure, from my discussion with the insurance companies at the time, that in the first place it might be difficult to do anything but what the Bill proposes to do, and in the second place that the insurance companies were very ready and willing to meet the House in helping to carry out the legislation as then drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I am glad that the Minister has been able to assure himself again in that matter.  I feel sure that no difficulties will arise and that there is no need to examine what difficulties may arise.  The Bill is a very comprehensive and a very satisfactory measure generally.  So far as <Col N="280" /> members who were in the House when the 1931 Bill was introduced are concerned, there is very little that can be said on this measure until the Committee Stage is reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That this Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary object of this Bill is to put an end to the discrimination which the enactment of Section 71 of the Local Government Act, 1925, enabled the Government and certain local authorities to enforce in recent years for the purpose of preventing persons holding Republican political opinions securing employment to which they were justly entitled.  It also empowers local authorities to employ it persons who, though fully qualified and properly elected to posts in the gift of certain local authorities, were denied such employment because of an objection to subscribe to the declaration prescribed by the Local Government Act of 1925.  It will enable local authorities to pay to officers in their service remuneration and increments of salary, sanction to the payment of which was denied since 1925 because of the failure of certain officers to subscribe to the declaration or test referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House, and the public, are already aware that the present Government disapprove of political tests and have undertaken to remove them.  The Oath of Allegiance enforced upon members of the Dáil will shortly disappear, and the test exacted from civil servants has been already discontinued. In order to fulfil the Government's undertaking to abolish all political tests, it remains for them to end the test imposed upon officers of local authorities.  As far as I am aware, the only statutory example of penalisation of local officers for political reasons is that provided in Section 71 of the Local Government Act, 1925, which relates to a declaration <Col N="281" /> required to be taken by such officers on appointment, or on obtaining an increase of remuneration.</P>
    <P>We are of opinion that the enforcement of a political test, declaration or oath, will not procure from civil servants or officers of local authorities more loyal or more efficient service. There are obvious and effective measures for dealing with officers who do not perform conscientiously the duties assigned to them.  It is not my intention or desire to provoke a discussion of constitutional issues on this Bill, and I will therefore not enter into the implications of the undertaking we propose to abolish.  I may say, however, that there are good citizens of this country who cannot conscientiously subscribe to that declaration, and we refuse to exclude all such citizens from employment in the public service.</P>
    <P>We simply want to make the official life of this State non-sectional, and to remove the political tests that were designed to perpetuate the divisions and the bitternesses of the past.  This entails the restoration of their rights to all persons identified with the Republican movement in this country since 1919, and the giving to them of opportunities to regain the status of which they were deprived in the past, so as to restore as far as can be done those impartial, non-sectional principles of national government, for which we strove in our fight against British domination.</P>
    <P>I have said &ldquo;as far as can be done&rdquo;: I am well aware of the sacrifices made, the years of unemployment and discouragement, waste (in one sense) of many a man's best years&mdash;for which no Act of Parliament can give any adequate compensation.  But so far as this Government can go, with the cooperation which we expect to receive from the local authorities, towards redressing the wrongs and restoring the rights of victimised persons&mdash;they will go.  That is what this Bill is designed to do in so far as employees of local authorities are concerned.</P>
    <P>The repeal of Section 71 is effected by Section 2 of the Bill.  The repeal will take effect as on and from the 9th March, 1932, with appropriate provisions for the voidance of the <Col N="282" /> operation of the section where the time had begun to run from the 9th February, 1932.  Section 3 of the Bill relates to increases of salary or emoluments which would have become payable to an officer but for the operation of Section 71, and it proposes to give validity to any resolution of the local body awarding such increases of salary which became void by reason of the failure of the officer concerned to subscribe to the declaration.  There are consequential provisions to effect the payment of the total amount of additional salary and emoluments to such officers; provisions to cover cases where officers have been transferred from the service of one local authority to another local authority and the revision of pensions or gratuities, at present payable on the basis of the lower scale of salary.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill relates to the appointment by a local authority of persons formerly removed from or refused office under a local authority. It is proposed to empower local bodies, with the sanction of the Minister, to regard persons so removed or refused office in the past for political reasons as being qualified for appointment to such office or an analogous office under the same or any other local authority whenever a vacancy occurs therein in the future. For the purpose of considering qualifications for the vacancy, any officer formerly employed in Northern Ireland shall be regarded as qualified in connection with analogous vacancies occurring in Saorstát Eireann.  It is proposed to empower the local authority to place any person thus reappointed on the salary scale which, in the opinion of the Minister, he would have reached if he had not suffered any removal from office or had not been refused appointment to an office in the past.</P>
    <P>Section 5 relates to the periods of pensionable service to be taken into account by a local authority for the purpose of computing the superannuation which will be payable to any officer of a local body whose tenure of service had been interrupted for political reasons and who subsequently was re-employed or reinstated in pursuance <Col N="283" /> of the provisions of this Bill in the local service.  For the purpose of calculating the amount of any pension to which such officer may be entitled under the Local Government Law it is proposed that his pensionable service may be reckoned as including the period of broken service where such period begins between the 1st January, 1922, and the 9th March, 1932.  Consequential provisions are made in connection with the liability for superannuation where an officer was employed by more than one local authority.  The expression &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; is defined as including any local authority in Northern Ireland up to the 30th April, 1923.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that where any local authority in the Saorstát employs a person formerly in the service of a local authority in Northern Ireland who was removed therefrom for political reasons, the Minister for Finance may pay from State funds a contribution towards the pension of such person in respect of his period of office in Northern Ireland and his period of broken service.  Cases have come under my notice where a person continued for some short time to act in an office where his legal tenure of service had been voided by the operation of Section 71 of the Act of 1925. Such persons were not paid for this period of <i>de facto</i> service and Section 6 of the Bill proposes to legalise any such payments since made or to be made by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Section 7 relates to the period 1st July, 1922, to 30th April, 1923, during which certain officers and servants of some local authorities were absent from their duties by reason of being imprisoned or interned for political reasons.  It is proposed to enable the local authorities concerned to pay to such persons the whole or part of any remuneration which would have been normally payable to them in respect of such period.</P>

      <P>I rise to oppose this Bill.  The net purpose of it is to remove that declaration of allegiance which is imposed by Article 71 of the Act as it exists at the present time. It not merely goes back to say that anybody who failed to give that declaration of allegiance in the last number of years shall suffer no loss thereby, but it also declares that, hereafter, anybody due for any such office or for such increased emolument shall be absolved from allegiance to this State and the Constitution of this State.  In relation to that other Oath Bill, dealing with the Oath we take on becoming members of this assembly, the unthinking and ignorant people of this country were very easily misled because, owing to the constitutional position of the King here, as defined by our Constitution, being identical in person with the King in Great Britain, it was very easy to appeal to old prejudices and to say that that Oath implied an oath of allegiance to a foreign monarch.  That of course, was a very effective way of rallying the more ignorant people in this country, but the terms of the Oath that is to be done away with now are these:</P>
      <P>I, so-and-so, do solemnly and sincerely declare that I will bear allegiance to the Irish Free State and its Constitution as by law established and that, in the event of my appointment being confirmed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, I will, to the best of my judgment and ability, duly and faithfully perform the duties of the said office and will observe and obey such orders and directions in relation to such office as shall lawfully be given to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> One naturally assumes that the purpose of this Bill is not to make it possible for people to be appointed to these positions who will fail to perform the duties attaching to that office faithfully. Therefore, I presume that the purpose of this Bill is to absolve one section of the community and, logically, all sections of the community, from allegiance to this State and the Constitution. I know that, in 1929, Deputy de Valera, as he was then, and President de Valera as he is now, said:</P>
    <P>We are asked to state clearly what our attitude towards this House is.  I have on more than one occasion said exactly what our attitude was.  I still hold that our right to be regarded as the legitimate Government of this country is faulty, and that this House is faulty.</P>
    <P>When that statement was made, Deputy Cosgrave was President here, and one might have said that one knew that Deputy de Valera had what one might call a legitimatist complex, and that the mere fact that Deputy Cosgrave was President here, to the mind of the present President, would imply that all people of this country were absolved from any allegiance to the State, Constitution or institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>But one did hope when the people of this country had been persuaded to elect Deputy de Valera as President and to form a Government here that that refusal to recognise the authority of the Government and of this House would cease, and that by the mere fact of becoming President he would recognise that the Irish people having elected the Government owed allegiance to that Government as every people in every country and in all ages of history have done.  That duty of allegiance was binding on all the people of this country in conscience irrespective of any Acts this Parliament may pass.  Here we are now bringing in a Bill to absolve the people of this country from the duty of allegiance to this State.  I would like to know is it a fact that we owe no allegiance to this State and, if we owe no allegiance to the State and to the Constitution, do we owe allegiance <Col N="286" /> to any State or to any order of Government?  This seems to me, speaking as an Irish Nationalist, to be one of the most disgraceful propositions ever made.  It is an assertion that we Irish people are some thing lower in the human scale than any other people in any other part of the world.  The Government with its majority and authority has power. They can change the Constitution and can make any laws they think are for the benefit of the country, and, at the same time, the people of this country are not bound to be submissive to these laws, and are not bound to give allegiance to this State instituted here of which the Government has control.</P>
    <P>One might expect me rather to rejoice that such a proposition might be made, and although I have never been what I might call an enthusiast of Fianna Fáilism, I must recognise that to any Act this Government may pass I owe submission; that I owe allegiance to the State and that I owe allegiance to the Constitution as it is and as it may be changed from time to time.  We are told that this Parliament is legislating and declaring that the people of this country owe no allegiance to their own State.  This Government can legislate to that effect a dozen times if it likes.  But it does not alter facts.  You can pass this Bill, but every person will owe allegiance to the State whether they want to or not. That declaration of allegiance is binding on the conscience of everyone. As I said, I know of no more disgraceful thing than for a Government of the Irish people to come here with such a proposal.  While every other people in the world possess a State that State exists for the general well-being, and demands the allegiance and the submission of the people.  In this country we are something inferior. It was often said about us that we were unfit to self-government.  We are now legislating to prove that we are so unfit.  What is behind this?  I know that up to the 14th of March, 1929.  President de Valera recognised no authority in this Parliament, but presumably recognised that some body of people outside, responsible for many <Col N="287" /> dastardly acts, could claim submission from the people.</P>
    <P>During the last few years we had the Fianna Fáil Party denouncing our Party when in power on the grounds that we were what they called a coercionist Party.  We were elected as a Government and recognised that the people owed allegiance.  The vast majority of the people gave that allegiance from the dictates of their consciences, but other people with distorted consciences withheld that allegiance, and when they translated that refusal of allegiance into acts they were duly punished, and the law was amended from time to time so that the way of the evil doer would not be easy in this country.  For that reason we were denounced as a coercionist Government.  I say that this Bill clearly marks this Government as exclusively coercionist.  The Government, recognising that it does not possess authority, and has not the right to claim allegiance in this country, according to the speeches of Ministers and the other Fianna Fáil Deputies, have interpreted the verdict of the last General Election as meaning that this Government, being elected, has the right to demand what in Russia would be called ideological conformity.  Such ideological conformity I absolutely refuse to give.  I do not recognise that the Government has the right to make me pretend what I believe is untrue. This Government and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party have been going round indicating that unless that ideological conformity is given, the material sanctions of this Government will be used against those refusing that conformity.</P>
    <P>What authority has the Government? By being elected in a majority they got control of the army, the police and the various other forces, armed and otherwise.  Consequently they are in a position of power.  If they wish to deal in any way with anyone, or with any section of persons, they have all the machinery for dealing with them effectively in a penal way.  But the Government, by their own declaration, recognise that they have no other authority except the <Col N="288" /> control of the armed forces.  They recognise that the people of this country do not owe it allegiance.  As far as the past is concerned, knowing Fianna Fáil's record, one knew that the first thing they would do would be to try to get money from public funds, and to put that money into the pockets of their followers as quickly and as efficaciously as possible.  One could not entirely approve of that, but it would not be really anything fundamentally and permanently bad. What I think is most objectionable in this is that it declares that for the future the Government recognises that it would be an unwarrantable thing for them to expect a people, or a section of the people of this country, to give allegiance to this State, and to the Constitution and to the institutions of the State.  How any Government could get up and make such a proposal I do not understand, unless they have themselves become befogged in their attempt to befog the people.</P>
    <P>This Government can change the Constitution, and can change the present State into a Republic, can do anything they like, or make any laws they like, but they say that the people here are not to owe allegiance to the State.  If they told us that this is only for a short time, until they made certain changes, one might see the situation in another light.  Here the Government is elected.  We have had victory meetings all over the country. What was the victory?  Was the victory merely because Deputy de Valera and his Party were going to get control of State finances and State forces, and that with the control of these finances it would be able to dispense them amongst its friends and with the control of the State forces be able to punish anyone who objected? Was that the victory that was being celebrated, or was it the victory that, President de Valera and his Party being elected in a majority, would receive from heaven authority to govern in this country, and that having received that authority, automatically and necessarily it would be bound to get from every right-minded man or woman the allegiance that every citizen in every country owes <Col N="289" /> to his State?  I would certainly consider that there would be a very great improvement in this Bill if it said that up to the 9th March, 1932, or the 8th February, 1933, any adverse effect anyone might have suffered by refusing to make that declaration would be remedied, and that from any given date this State was going to demand and going to get allegiance from its people.  I admit, even though only that were done, it would be a scandalous thing to suggest that the Irish people only owed allegiance when a certain man was elected as President, but at least it would mean that as from some date the Irish people were going to be equal to people in every other country in the world and were going to be governed by the same moral principles.</P>
    <P>We are apparently something different from any other people in the world.  The moral law that applied always and in all cases somehow or other does not apply to us.  This Bill is completely null and void.  It declares that we do not owe allegiance to the State and its effect is merely that the Government will be able to give money from State finances to people who are essentially traitors to this country.  We have been described up and down the country as traitors and the people who are most active in denouncing us as traitors are people who consistently declare that they give no allegiance to this country.  In a paper called &ldquo;An Phoblacht,&rdquo; week after week and even in ordinary newspapers, we see declarations from bodies that are directly responsible for putting the Government in office, declaring that they intend to give no allegiance and no submission to the laws made by this Government.  Apparently this Bill is introduced merely for the purpose of placating these people.  It does seem to me that it would be really better to let these people generally govern instead of doing, as they are doing, governing behind the smoke screen of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister read out a long statement rather inaudibly, I must say, and I cannot pretend that I heard the whole of it but I did hear one reference to a political test.  What is a <Col N="290" /> political test?  Is it a political test to demand that anybody performing any service which will be paid for out of public funds shall give allegiance to the State and Constitution?  Is that a political test?  If it is what would be a non-political test?  I quite agree that in one sense it is a political test because we are all political beings and it is the mere fact of a political nature that makes it so necessary to bind us to give this allegiance, but the implication of the words &ldquo;political test&rdquo; implies, and is meant to imply, that it is a test binding people to one political party in the State rather than to the State itself.  But here is a Bill declaring that this State is a party concern, that although Deputy de Valera is President of the Free State, the Free State is somehow or other the property, the thing as one might say, of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  Surely the Government do not intend to assert that.  We recognise that they are in charge of the State, that they can govern with authority, that they have the right to change the form of the State, the Constitution or anything else, and that in general we all owe allegiance to whatever form of State there may be.  But here is a most disgraceful and immoral proposal.</P>
    <P>We declare by this legislation that it is unjust and inequitable that the people of this country should owe allegiance to their own State.  It is a declaration that all that was ever said about us before, that the Irish people were unfit for self-government, was true.  The people were offered self-government and they were able to form a Government and to give to that State and Constitution the allegiance which is due to that State and Constitution. The Government might, in bringing in this Bill to reward their supporters. have merely made it retrospective and have said that as far as this test was concerned while Deputy Cosgrave was President nobody should suffer for withholding their allegiance but that as from the 9th March, 1932, or the 8th February, 1933, there was going to be no more nonsense about any people in this country&mdash;a new Government having been elected by the people&mdash; refusing to give allegiance to that <Col N="291" /> Government and to the Constitution whatever form it might from time to time take, that the Government was going to do its primary duty and see that conformity with the law and submission to the law were going to be enforced on the people.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to admire much of the legislation which this Government has brought in, but I submit that this Bill is, if anything, worse than the Bill which dealt with the Oath in this House.  In the other Bill they were able to pretend a certain stupidity and ignorance.  They could bring in the red herring about the King, but here there was no reference to the King. These people are merely asked to give allegiance to the Constitution as it is, and this Government comes along and says that the people of this country are not to be asked to give any allegiance. I know that as far as a certain small blackguardly section of the people in this country are concerned, this Government has already recognised their right to withhold their allegiance and to work against the interests of the people.  But it is even a more serious thing to come along and make it the law of the land, giving these people the right to withhold their allegiance and to be traitors to their own State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill.  I confess that I am quite unable to follow the line of reasoning which actuated the speech of the Deputy who has previously spoken.  He seems to indicate that if this measure passes we immediately give absolution to all citizens of the State to withhold their allegiance to the State.  I hold the very reverse view.  I hold that all citizens of the State owe allegiance to the State and to the laws made by the duly elected representatives of the people.  I believe this Bill is a measure of confidence in the people to give that allegiance without asking them to make this declaration.  This declaration was framed in an abnormal period, in a period of suspicion and unrest, a period which we would all religiously hope was not typical of the normal life of the country.  Having gone through that period, I think <Col N="292" /> it is up to the Government to remove the stigma which this test contained on the escutcheon of the Irish people. I see no reason whatever for its imposition.  If the officers and servants of local authorities are to be put to this test, then the citizens from whom they are drawn should have a similar test imposed on them in private employment.  This Government and Dáil are elected by the people from whom these officers and servants are drawn.  These people have qualified themselves for these onerous positions as officers and servants of the various public bodies, and in imposing this test upon them you, in effect, cast a suspicion of treachery upon them.  If they are not to give allegiance except through some form of words it will never achieve much in actual practice. I certainly agree that the Government are doing the right thing in removing this test, and I think they are more likely to get allegiance to the constitution and to the duly elected Government of the people by doing so. I, speaking as a member of the Labour Party and, having hopes that this country will one day have a Labour Government, would expect and accept the same allegiance from these officers as has been given to Cumann na nGaedheal and Fianna Fáil.  I think this test is absolutely unnecessary; it has been there too long, and I welcome its removal.</P>

      <P>This Bill attempts to enshrine in the legislation of this country something that is novel as far as my experience of the Constitutions of other States is concerned.  After listening to Deputy Keyes one really has to begin to wonder in what direction this House as representing the country is heading.  As Deputy Fitzgerald has emphasised here, one is amazed at the suggestion or the proposal contained in the primary purpose of this Bill, and that is to repeal a test which has applied to a civil servant, who is drawing a salary from the State, because he is going to come into the employment of the State.  It seems to me to be an outrage to suggest that a citizen entering into the employment of the State is to be under no obligation or duty as to his <Col N="293" /> service to the State.  So far as I am aware there is no State in this world where that exists and where some test of this kind of duty and loyalty to the State by a civil servant or the servants of the State does not apply.  Yet, we have this Bill being introduced into this House and approved of very eloquently by Deputy Keyes.</P>
      <P>I oppose the Bill on that ground, but I oppose it secondly on behalf of the taxpayers of this country on the ground that public money is being extracted from the taxpayers of the country to pay a salary to people who will be under no obligation whatever to the people from whom the money is taken to give them loyal and dutiful service.  For these two reasons I oppose this Bill.  I say that it is an outrage to suggest that money should be taken from the taxpayer to pay people to be servants of the State and that they will not be expected to owe any allegiance to this State.  It is an outrage.  It is without any precedent. This Bill is going to enshrine in the legislation of this country the principle that a person can enter into the State and be utterly disloyal to the State and at the same time draw his salary from the State.  I know of no country in the world where a Bill of that kind or where legislation of that kind obtains.</P>

      <P>I rise merely to say that it appears to me that at the present time such a test as is proposed to be abolished by this Bill serves no useful purpose.  We can abolish that test without infringing any international agreement, without any breach of international manners, or without destroying any of our international markets or, I think, incurring the slightest danger to our own State.  I think that the time for declarations, oaths, and all such tests has passed and that they should be abolished if they can possibly be got rid of.  No doubt they serve a useful purpose in times of civil war, rebellion or great disturbance and, therefore, apart from what Deputy Fitzgerald has said, the part of this Bill that does not appeal to me is its retrospective character.  I am thoroughly in favour of abolishing the test in the future, but it occurs to me that it was quite reasonable to <Col N="294" /> impose that test at the time in which it was imposed, and I am not at all inclined to see the ratepayers saddled with expenses of an unknown amount in order to undo something that, I think, the Government of the day was probably justified in doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill. I think that, at the particular period when this penal clause was imposed it was imposed for one purpose only, namely to prevent any individual, no matter what were his past services to the State, from getting any employment whatsoever unless he was prepared to be the political hack of the party then in power.  I have known men who left college in 1918, men who went out and fought from 1918 to 1922, who went for Civil Service examinations afterwards and who got very high marks in those examinations-men who were entitled to be called up in due course&mdash;but because they would not submit to this test were deprived of all employment from 1924 to 1932. I know men who suffered that, and I consider that there can be no greater test of loyalty to an ideal, loyalty to a State, or loyalty to a country than that a man who, knowing that he had only to sign such a test in order to get a good position and a safe position, still refused to sign that test against his convictions.  I can see or I know of no better sign of loyalty.  I know of men who have gone without the usual increases in salary to which they were entitled from 1923 to 1932 just because they would not submit to that test. These men have gone without those increases, to which they were entitled, for the last ten years.  They have gone without them long enough, and when Deputy Fitzgerald comes here and moralises about traitors and that kind of thing, he should examine his own conscience.  A traitor is an individual, who, during the war gives hope, aid or succour to an enemy.  This country has been at war for the last eleven months.  I do not care whether you call it an economic war or an actual war.  During that period the arms and ammunition used by that enemy were supplied by Deputies of this House&mdash; the arms and ammunition, the bullets <Col N="295" /> that were fired at the heart of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald devoted his speech to the question of loyalty to the State and to the question as to whether certain individuals who did not take tests or oaths should be paid out of public funds.  The Deputies of this House themselves are paid out of public funds and I think that it is very relevant to this discussion that we should inquire into the manner of the loyalty these Deputies gave this State during the past twelve months.  I think it is very relevant to the discussion, particularly in view of the fact that their actions have since been judged by the tribunal of the people and that they have found them guilty.  I think that the connection there is very clear. I think, when a Deputy of this House went across to endeavour by honourable negotiation to settle the difficulties existing between this country and the country across the water, that at that particular period when Deputies in this House got up on that very night and <Col N="296" /> immediately forged the bullets that were to be used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Individuals who passed a competitive examination, securing very high places, and who were entitled to Civil Service positions have been compelled to exist during the past nine years on temporary employment for two or three months at 50/- per week.  I know these individuals.  It is time that that ended.  Victimisation of that kind towards supporters of any political party&mdash;I do not care what party&mdash; should end.  There are constant complaints of victimisation, but if ever there were glaring cases of victimisation <Col N="297" /> these are the cases.  I know unfortunate school teachers who were deprived of their employment for two or three years because they would not subscribe to some special test.  It is time that that ended, and I am glad that there is a Government in office which is ending it.  I have to say this to the gentlemen opposite, that if they make much more noise we will take them out and get rid of a few of them &mdash;take them out before the tribunal again and lighten the number.</P>

In sub-section (7) of this Bill we have a suggestion to local authorities that they do something with regard to certain of their employees.  That discloses a policy on the part of the present Ministry which, in respect of their Left, is a very different policy from that which they would show to those people who are somewhat to their Right in their outlook on political matters.

      <P>Ba mhaith liom, a Leas-Chinn Comhairle, fáilte agus céad a chur roimh an mBille seo agus traoslú don Aire i dtaobh é thabhairt isteach.  Tá fhios agam-sa <Col N="301" /> an díobháil a rinne an dearbhú dílseachta gránna so do ghluaiseacht na Gaedhilge ó cuireadh i bhfeidhm é sa bhliain 1925.  Tá aithne agam ar dhaoine a chaill a slighe bheatha de bhrigh ná beidís sásta a n-ainm a chur leis agus tá aithne agam ar dhaoine a thug an chuid is mó dá saoghal ag obair ar son na Gaedhilge a fuair bata agus bóthar mar gheall ar an ndearbhú so.  Cloisimíd a lan cainnte mar gheall ar dhílseacht ach na daoine go ndearnadh éagcóir orra tríd an dearbhú so, bhíodar dílis do chuspóir atá chomh sean leis an gceo, sé sin cuspóir saoirse na tíre seo.  Do briseadh iad ach nár bhfearr don dream ar an dtaobh eile den Tigh seo sgaoile leis an Bille gan cur ina choinne agus gan bheith ag cainnt mar a táid?  Tá fhios againn go léir ná deineann dearbhú mar seo aon mhaitheas, ní dheineann sé aon deifríocht in aon chor.  Ní dearbhú mar seo a chuireann iachall ar dhuine bheith dílis.  Sé an spioraid agus an smaoineamh atá i gcroidhe agus in aigne duine a thugann an dílseacht don obair agus do sna daoine atá os a chionn.  Bíodh deire leis anois.  Ní chuirfe sé feabhas ar an obair a dheineann seirbhísigh phuiblí.  Leighisfidh an Bille seo an éagcóir a rinneadh ar na daoine sin go léir chomh fáda agus is féidir an éagcóir sin do leigheas anois.  Tá cuid de sna muinnteóirí Gaedhilge a briseadh mar gheall ar ná fuair lá oibre ón lá a briseadh iad agus is dócha go bhfuil daoine nách iad a briseadh mar gheall air sa chás chéanna.  Tá daoine ann, daoine agus clann ag brath orra, agus, mar gheall ar an gclainn sin, chuireadh a n-ainm leis an dearbhú cé gur chreideadar gur dearbhú gránna a bhí ann.  An gceapann éinne go dtugann a leithéid de rud an spioraid ceart amach i gcroidhe na ndaoine a mhothuíonn gur cuireadh iachall ortha a n-ainm do chur leis an dearbhú san?  Ní thugann agus ní thabharfadh choidhche.  Beidh deire leis nuair a ritheann an Bille seo agus a bheidh an dearbhú so sgriosta amach, agus, im thuairim-se, ba mhaith an rud é sin.  Cuidim leis an mBille agus traosluím don Aire mar gheall ar é do thabhairt isteach sa Dáil seo.</P>

      <P>Ní dóich liom go bhfuil a lán le rádh agam ach aontú leis an méid adubhairt an Teachta Donnchadh O Briain.  Muna bhfuil an dílseacht í gcroidhe nó in aigne an duine, ní féidir í do chur ann le dearbhú mar seo.  Ní féidir dílseacht do chur ag fás in áit na béadh sí go nádúrtha.</P>
      <P>That is the substance of the argument for this Bill, as stated by Deputy O'Brien, that no declaration of this kind or any other kind, forcing allegiance where it does not exist, will get more loyal or conscientious service from any State official or from any official in a public authority.  If loyalty to a public authority is not in the heart and mind of the individual, or the citizen, or official, no declaration of this kind that may be taken, forcing him against his will, will make him do his work better or more conscientiously. I think Deputy MacDermot is right in wishing to see an end of declarations of that kind when they cannot be accepted and abided by willingly.  If there was real necessity, and we felt that the work would be better done by asking people to make declarations of that kind there might be something to be said for it, but there was no necessity for it and it was not for the benefit of the State that this declaration was introduced.</P>
      <P>It may be no harm to go over the history of this declaration.  It was not introduced by the Government; it was not in the Bill when the Government brought it in.  Deputy Mulcahy was, I think, then the Minister.  He did not ask for it.  It was introduced into the Seanad by an individual who was a narrow-minded, bigoted, anti-Republican person, one of the worst that even Deputy Mulcahy's Party has produced, one of the bitterest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> Persons of the most vindictive character introduced this, not for the purpose of securing loyalty to the State, not for the purpose of securing better service for the State, but for the deliberate purpose of preventing anybody who would not sign it, whether Republican or not&mdash;and there are people, I am told, who are not Republicans who said they objected to a declaration of this kind and were, in consequence, penalised&mdash;from obtaining employment under the State.  It was because of the vindictiveness of Deputy Mulcahy himself that he accepted it and put it into his Bill when it came back from the Seanad.  We know what his character is.  There are people in this House who have very good reason to know the vindictiveness with which he pursued his political opponents as long as he had it in his power to pursue them.  There was nothing cold, callous or brutal enough that he would not do to down them in every walk of life.  Everything that ingenuity of the most devilish kind could suggest to get after those who were his political opponents he did, and I believe he welcomed this declaration.</P>
    <P>It is not right, perhaps, to be going back over these things.  I would rather wash them out and forget them. That is what this Bill is for.  It is an effort to try to blot out, as far as we can on our side, the memories of the vindictiveness of those who introduced this declaration into that Act in 1925 for the purpose of driving many more, after those who had already gone, out of their livelihoods&mdash;driving them to starvation, to exist on home help, driving them into the slums of America and Australia.  That is where many of them have been driven by the gentlemen who were responsible for declarations of this kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy now talks about asking the ratepayers to pay the people who destroyed Mallow Bridge. Yes, we are going to ask the ratepayers to pay those people who were loyal and faithful to the obligations they undertook, some of them in public and others in private.  They undertook to be loyal and faithful to the extent, <Col N="304" /> if necessary, of giving up their lives. It was not a mere matter of salary with them.  That consideration did not weigh with them.  They stuck loyally by their declared allegiance to a certain State.  Other gentlemen&mdash;I am not going to suggest that it was for filthy lucre&mdash;for, possibly, loyal and good reasons, and some perhaps for other reasons, broke their oaths and resolutions and declarations.  We are now asking the public to pay the men who suffered for their loyalty, their faith and their allegiance.  We have already gone before the people; we told the people in advance that we intended to ask them to pay and you all know the result.  I hope you are satisfied with the verdict.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one reference to public speeches.  Deputy Mulcahy ought to be the last man to talk in this House or anywhere else about freedom of speech.  There is no other man I know of who went to such extremes in his time to prevent Deputies and others who differed from him addressing their constituents.  I do not believe there is any other man in this country&mdash;there may be elsewhere&mdash;who went to such extremes.  I can give one or two instances for which I can vouch where forces that Deputy Mulcahy, as a Minister, controlled, fired with machine-guns on public meetings during the course of a general election&mdash;during a general election when everybody should be free to get up on a platform to address his constituents. The forces he controlled attacked with their machine-guns. They were not men in plain clothes; they were men in uniform.  May I remind Deputies of one instance on the 15th August, 1923, when Deputy de Valera, now President of the Executive Council attempted to address his constituents in Ennis?  What did the armed forces of the gentleman who now talks about free speech do during that general election?  I think I have said enough to show the sincerity that must be in the hearts of people who have the audacity to stand up here and address people who know the facts.</P>

      <P>I was going to get the business before the House over as quickly as possible were it not for these shameful references to things that ought to have been dead and buried.  The Deputy contributed very little to cool and calm past bitterness. We are doing our best to put an end to bitterness by introducing measures of this kind which will help to clear the path and bring about unity, harmony and good feeling between all the citizens of the State.  We hope that good feeling will be established before long, despite the efforts of the Deputy and others like him.  We will ask public bodies&mdash;we will not force them&mdash; to recognise adequately those servants of theirs who gave good service to the country.  They did make sacrifices; they did their best according to their lights.  We are asking public authorities to make good, as far as they can, to these people.  If they do not wish to do it, we will not force them.  We <Col N="306" /> are giving them power to restore what the vindictiveness of those who introduced the declaration of 1925 sought to deprive them of.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Keyes when he said that the introduction of this Bill abolishing the declaration was a vote of confidence in the people.  We are satisfied to leave the question of loyalty to the State to the people and, judging by recent events, I think we are justified in leaving that matter to the people's choice.  Deputy McMenamin referred to oaths and tests and declarations in other countries.  I asked him if he would name one country in Europe or in America where public servants have to take an oath or submit to a test of this kind.</P>

      <P>You have quite a variety of opinion. Let us take France.  In the Parliament of France you have people who detest the Republican form of Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so and even these tests do not prevent many people getting into the United States and the United States afterwards have to get rid of them because the statements made by them in the past were not correct.  Now it is not true, as was said by Deputy Fitzgerald, that we are bringing in a Bill here to absolve the people from allegiance to the State or absolve them from the obligation to obey the laws of the State.  That is a misrepresentation. The purpose of the Bill is well known to Deputy Fitzgerald and we do not go beyond what is in this declaration on the subject of allegiance or what is contained in the Bill.  We are satisfied that the laws of the country will be obeyed by the people.  We have a Government here that intends to see that the laws will be obeyed by everybody and by every citizen irrespective of section or class.  Again I do not think it will add anything to the love of this State or to the loyalty or allegiance that one bears to the Government of the State to force a declaration of this kind upon the citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Fitzgerald is not here.  If he were here I would have a few words to say to him.  One word I will say to him&mdash;that he ought to be one of the last persons in this House to talk about dishonouring bonds, breaking allegiance or breaking a trust.  There are people in this House who know the oaths that he swore in public and in private and which he, like others, did not hesitate to break when it suited their purpose. People of that kind, people in glass houses, should not throw stones and they ought to be careful when lecturing other people on loyalty and <Col N="309" /> fidelity and on breaches of trust. They ought to look into their own past and if they cannot talk to other people on these matters without hurting their own consciences, if they have any, they ought to leave that kind of talk alone.  Deputy Fitzgerald could get many sore things said to him by some of us who know a little of his past.  I will not go into it now; I do not want to go into it when he had not the courage to wait here and hear the reply but other opportunities will arise when he will hear something which even if it does not stir up his <Col N="310" /> conscience may do him good in other respects.  I will leave the matter at that.  He should not make the type of speech he did which entirely misrepresents the purpose of this Bill.  Its purpose is to wipe out injustice and bitterness and the punishment that was inflicted unjustly and improperly on numbers of persons.  This Bill is to help to wipe out the bitterness that does exist.  We propose to do that by treating people fairly in public employment as well as in private affairs.</P>
