As regards the subject of a bounty, it is not considered that, having regard to all the circumstances, and more especially the fact that no tariff has been placed by the British authorities on the import of that article, such payment is at present called for.

      <P>I do not know whether this point arises on either the Land Bill or the Land Bond Bill, but I have not seen in either Bill anywhere mentioned the period of the amortisation of the annuities, so to speak. Usually on this basis, it would be 68½ years.  That was the period stated, I think, in the Land Act of 1923.  That was the term in which the annuities would cease or the advances would be paid off, but I have not seen that term stated in either the Land Bond Bill or the Land Bill.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister should give a little more attention to the points that are being raised in Bills rather than to attempt to score points of opponents in a way that ought to be beneath the Minister.  It is very important that we should know, and that the people who will be taking these bonds should know, in what <Col N="1156" /> currency they will be redeemed when it comes to the time of redemption.  I wonder was the Minister's mind so obsessed by counterfeit tokens as to feel that there was something counterfeit in this Bill which he was ashamed or afraid to disclose to the House.  A man is asked to part with property worth £1,000 and he gets £1,000 worth of these bonds at their face value.  It is not stated&mdash;at least it has not been disclosed by the Minister during the discussions on this Bill&mdash;if those £1,000 worth of bonds will be redeemed in sterling.  That is a very important point.  Say, for example, they were not redeemed in sterling but in a Free State currency that has not yet been adopted in this country, and that a period of inflation set in around the 30 year period so that the Free State pound was devalued with regard to gold or to sterling or to dollars&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that our pound was devalued, as the French franc or the Italian lire was, to, I think, about one-fifth of their former value, this pound would still hold to pay internal debts as French and Italian currency are held to pay internal debts. It is very important to people who are asked to take a price to know if this will be paid in sterling.  I am not going to say that it should; but, as a business proposition, the public should know whether the bonds will be redeemed in sterling or in new currency.  If they will be redeemed in new currency, it is only fair to this House and to the country, and to the people whose property will be taken up at a nominal price, that they should know that&mdash;and by &ldquo;nominal&rdquo; I do not mean a price at the time it is taken up as only a nominal value, but a price fixed at a denomination that may not have that value when it comes to be redeemed in terms of the currency to which we are now accustomed.  If we had a period of inflation or devaluation it would amount to the confiscation of those bonds and the confiscation of the land that will be taken for which those bonds to be issued will be offered in payment.  There is no use in pursuing a discussion on what might take place if we had a new currency, but I think it is only fair to the House to know where they are going and to the country to know what is being given for the property that is changing hands, or rather what those tokens of currency will be worth 30 years hence. If there is a change contemplated in that time, then I think an outline in broad general terms should be given to the House; but, as we stand at present and from the knowledge that we can collect in ordinary commercial life even in this city, we know that any payments that are promised now are promised in Free State currency, whatever that currency may be.  I wonder if the Minister and the Executive Council contemplate redeeming those bonds in Free State currency whatever it may be in the future, or are they adhering to sterling?  If they are adhering to sterling and that there is a change in our currency this side of 30 years, has the Minister taken into <Col N="1158" /> account the possible and, perhaps, inevitable strain it would be on the finances of this country?  I say that because I cannot see circumstances obtaining here in which a separate Free State currency could be at a higher exchange value than sterling. The reason is that we could not afford it because we are a large exporting country to Great Britain.  In fighting for our place in the market there we will have to keep our currency, if we have control of it, slightly below the nominal exchange value of the British currency, just as the countries round the Baltic do in order to secure for themselves a good market and an advantageous position in the British market.</P>
      <P>Another point that will arise if we have a separate currency is this: it must of necessity, or in wisdom at any rate, be slightly below the exchange value of the British currency, and the question is: who is going to make good the deficiency?  Will it be the Exchequer, or will it be the people who have got the land?  Will they have to continue paying their annuities for a longer period than would otherwise be necessary in order to redeem that margin that would be lost in the exchange due to the different values of the currencies when the time for redemption comes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the general question of currencies, but would the Minister tell us the exact circumstances in which the British guarantee came to an end?  I am a fairly careful student of public affairs, and all that I can remember is that sometime, I think, last year a statement was published in the Press to the effect that the British guarantee would cease under the 1923 Act. I do not know the circumstances in which that guarantee was given at the beginning, but in view possibly of our having changed our currency it would have an appreciable effect on the value of the land bonds issued under this Bill as distinct from the land bonds that were issued under the 1925 Act. Perhaps the Minister could explain to us exactly the circumstances in which the British ceased to give their guarantee.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to take up the time of the House in dealing with the various figmentary points made by Deputy Belton in a somewhat rambling and incoherent speech. They do not really arise on this Bill. The Deputy's speech indicates that he has not read the Bill, and particularly Sections 4, 5 and 6 in which these points are dealt with.  With regard to the point made by Deputy Esmonde, the British guarantee covered an issue of £30,000,000 worth of land bonds. On the completion of that issue on the 18th December, 1932, a renewal of the British guarantee was not asked for because it was felt that the Saorstát credit was just as good as the British credit in the world to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill. Briefly, this Bill will alter the financial provisions of the Barrow Drainage Act, 1927, in three particulars.  It will increase to £550,000 from £425,000 the maximum expenditure on the drainage of the River Barrow.  The additional sum is being provided in equal shares by a Free State grant and by advances by the Commissioners of Public Works, <Col N="1160" /> repayable by the people in the localities concerned in accordance with Section 9 of the Act of 1927.  It will also provide for an increase from £4,000 to £6,500 in the average annual expenditure on maintenance.  It will enable advances, not exceeding in the aggregate a sum of £3,250, to be made to the Barrow Drainage Board by the State towards the cost of maintenance during the first year following the date of a final award.  That covers the operative portions of the Bill.  Certain explanatory particulars may be of use to Deputies, but I think most of them are familiar with the main provisions of the 1927 Act.</P>
      <P>The Barrow Drainage Act of 1927 provided for a maximum expenditure of £425,000 on the drainage of the River Barrow.  This sum is now found to be insufficient for two reasons.  The first reason is that the cost of excavation will be more expensive than was originally estimated and the second is that it is desirable to carry out the cleaning of a large number of minor tributaries and drains which had not been included in the original scheme under the 1927 Act.  As the House is probably aware, the Barrow drainage was begun in 1926 in anticipation of an enabling Bill which was passed in 1927 and under a scheme which was confirmed by the Minister for Finance in 1930.  The fact that works on the River Barrow were begun in anticipation of legislation was an indication of the general desire to take early steps to remedy grievances regarding the flooding of the river.  In order not to delay the introduction of the enabling Bill, a more or less preliminary estimate of £425,000 was made.  This estimate was based on a survey of the river made in 1885.  As there was little reason at the time to doubt the accuracy of this survey, it was decided to avoid the delay and expenditure involved in a new survey of the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the progress of the works, however, it was found that the levels of the bed of the river as shown in the old survey were inaccurate and that considerable silting had occurred in the last 40 years at many points. These two factors were in themselves sufficient to cause a rather large <Col N="1161" /> increase in the amount of excavation now deemed necessary.  The quantities of rock and &ldquo;soft&rdquo;&mdash;that is, everything except rock&mdash;were originally estimated at about 56,000 cubic yards and 2,200,000 cubic yards.  These figures are now estimated to be increased to 120,000 cubic yards and 3,000,000 cubic yards, respectively.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1927, it was the intention to deal only with the main artery, and as the scheme was regarded purely as an arterial drainage scheme, little attention was paid at the time of the passing of the Act to the cleaning of auxiliary drains and minor tributaries.  The results of the works already executed now show how very desirable it is from the point of view of the occupiers to have the large drains forming the boundaries of their holdings efficiently cleaned and properly maintained in the future. These drains are numerous, widely separated and of a total length of more than 120 miles.  The cost of including the arterial drains in the Barrow drainage scheme is fairly high, but none the less the cost of executing small individual drainage schemes would be considerably greater.</P>
    <P>The amending Bill deals with another question of financial importance, viz., the expenditure on maintenance of the completed works.  Provision is made for an increase from £4,000 to £6,500 in the average annual cost of maintenance during the first 35 years after completion of the works.  The necessity for this increase is obvious, in view chiefly of the additional expenditure to be incurred on the numerous minor tributaries and auxiliary drains. The fixed annual sum payable by the county council is accordingly to be increased from £2,000 to £3,250, while, as under the original Act, one-half of the ascertained expenditure in each year will be defrayed from State funds.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Act of 1927 provides that the county councils concerned should pay their contribution towards maintenance by equal moieties on each 30th September and 31st March, and that the Government contribution should be paid at the end of each financial year <Col N="1162" /> on the certificate of the Commissioners of Public Works that the works had been properly maintained.</P>
    <P>It may happen, however&mdash;it will happen&mdash;that during the first year the Barrow Drainage Board may not have sufficient funds available for maintenance works and the Minister for Finance consequently proposes in this Bill to take power to advance sums not exceeding £3,250 to the Board during that year.  The advances will be recoverable by deductions from the sums payable by the State towards the cost of maintenance in subsequent years, or, in the alternative, shall be repaid by the Barrow Drainage Board after the expiration of the 35 years period.</P>
    <P>I might remind the House that the amendment of the Act increases the total expenditure from £425,000 to £550,000.  It is enabling the maintenance to be increased from £4,000 to £6,500, and enables the State to advance £3,250 in the first year, in advance of moneys which in the ordinary way it would advance to enable the schemes to be comfortably maintained.</P>

      <P>After the rather clear and reasoned statement of the Parliamentary Secretary, I should not have intervened on this Bill at all, were it not for something, possibly, with which he is acquainted.  I refer to the rather lamentable speech of the Minister for Finance or, at least, the speech made during some period of the Finance Bill.  It seemed to me to throw a slur on the engineer for the actual Barrow drainage scheme that is now in existence.  I was very glad to learn from the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that there is not even a shadow of foundation for the impression conveyed by the Minister. I must say that I was rather shocked, and the public outside were shocked, that Mr. Challoner Smith should be attacked, as it seemed to me he was. I was still more shocked that the attack should take place on a man who was no longer there to give a defence, even a Departmental defence.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will look up that particular passage he will find <Col N="1163" /> that he would regret it more than anybody else, because the imputation was there conveyed that the scheme was botched, and that roughly £50,000 or £65,000 of a contribution was being added to the State burden owing to mismanagement in that case.  That was the impression conveyed.  I was in the House at the time, and I must say that the statement, coming even from the Minister for Finance, gave me a shock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that has emerged from the Parliamentary Secretary's exposition of the necessity for this Bill, is that the additional cost was practically inevitable, unless there was to be a great delay.  The continental expert gave an estimate of the cost of the Barrow drainage scheme as £1,000,000 or £1,200,000.  I forget the exact figure as it is many years since I was familiar with it, still, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, the late Government determined to go in for the lesser scheme.  The impression was conveyed that it was botched.  It is true that the late Government decided to go on with the less expensive scheme, and for that purpose Mr. Challoner Smith drew up a scheme and supervised the carrying out of it. I gather that there is really no fault to be found with that particular work, and that the new expenditure was due to two causes, increased expenditure on rock cutting, which probably would have taken place also in the case even of the estimate given by Professor Meyer Peter, because that estimate went on the old measurements, and an increase caused by entirely new work, not necessary to the success of the scheme but which, as the Parliamentary Secretary rightly points out, it is desirable should be done; and also increased cost of maintenance, due largely to increased work.  I intervened really in order to do what I considered to be a duty on my part, owing to my connection at one time with that Department, and owing to the fact that I had the greatest possible respect for the capacity of the engineer who was responsible.  He was an engineer of which any country might be proud.  I am quite sure the <Col N="1164" /> House will have no hesitation whatever in passing not merely the Second Reading, but any stage that is wanted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>As this scheme has been in evidence for six years an opportunity arises to see how far it has been a success, or otherwise.  I happened to be passing through Carlow in the early part of this year when there was serious flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was in March last when there was serious flooding. It was in or about that period.  I heard reports there at the time that while flooding had been relieved in the upper portions of the Barrow, it had been aggravated in the lower portions.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to question this expenditure; I know nothing about it beyond what is heard in this House; but there is no use in spending money in relieving flooding in the higher portions of the river and aggravating it in the lower portions.  By the introduction of this Bill an opportunity is now afforded the Parliamentary Secretary of giving some information to the House as to the success or otherwise of the whole scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the House is in such a nice, kindly mood that it will give us the remaining Stages of the Bill to-day.  Deputy Good discovered himself in Carlow after a hurricane, after a snowstorm of unexampled magnitude, after a visitation of Providence such as we have not come across in a whole lifetime, and he wants to argue from that basis.  On that morning, when in bed, any telephones that were working were bringing me messages telling me of all the places in the country that were flooded, due to the particular hurricane.  With £550,000 this Dáil cannot legislate for cataclysms of that character.  They can deal only with what one might call normal flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all cases of drainage work you have two or three prices at which you can do the work.  At one you will relieve light flooding which comes fairly constantly.  Another will relieve the flooding that comes once a year and <Col N="1165" /> sometimes once in five years; but no finances of this State will stand, in a flat country like Ireland, the relief of flooding which comes once in seventy years in cataclysms of the character I have described.</P>
    <P>The contention that the lower reaches of the Barrow are flooded, due to the cleaning of the upper reaches, is the contention which every one who has had experience of drainage in Ireland will know is made in relation to every single drainage scheme without exception that has ever taken place in this country.  In some cases, in respect of schemes under the 1925 Act, when we went in and reconditioned drainage, there was a certain amount of truth in that.  What happened was that in reconditioning a river we did clean the upper reaches and put them in a condition such as they had not been in for ten or 15 years, but we put the river back into the condition in which it was when originally handed out as a perfectly new scheme.  I have no information at present on balance which would enable me to say that it is true that the lower reaches of the Barrow have been flooded by the upper reaches.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that I have any amount of statements to that effect both in relation to the Barrow and every other river in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Unless the House is prepared to give us, instead of £550,000, a sum of £5,000,000, neither I nor anybody else can put forward a scheme which will prevent occasional flooding under very exceptional circumstances.  In this case, £550,000 is being spent under the best possible technical advice we can get, with the most efficient machinery and under the most efficient organisation we can devise, in order to get the best possible work achieved in the direction of freeing the Barrow from normal flooding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view the Dáil should accept the Seanad amendment.  This amendment exempts Civic Guards from this particular cut. In my opinion they should be so exempted.  I am not going to repeat the speech which I made here on the Second Reading as far as it dealt with this particular amendment, nor am I going to deal with the speeches which I made in Committee or again repeat the speeches or the subject matter of the speeches which I made on the Final Stage upon this particular amendment.  But there is one matter with which I feel myself constrained to deal and that is owing to the action which has been taken by the Minister for Finance in this House and more especially in another place.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Finance was dealing with this particular amendment or the subject matter of it in this House here, he declared that there had been a firm decision taken by the last Executive Council that the pay of the Guards should be cut.  I informed the Minister in this House upon that occasion that he was completely wrong, that no such decision had been come to and that however loosely or carelessly or otherwise the letter from the Department of Finance might have been worded that that did not represent the view of the Executive Council at the time.  I should have thought that that statement should have been sufficient for the Minister.  I likewise told the Minister for Finance that I had made that matter clear well over a year ago and that again I think should have been sufficient for the Minister for Finance.  But those statements of mine were taken by the Minister for Finance as being misstatements, as being untrue statements, and I discovered that the very statement which I had stigmatised in this House, at any rate, as being inaccurate is the very same statement that the Minister for Finance did make elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order that even the Minister for Finance may not make statements of <Col N="1169" /> this kind and class again, I will just refer to certain matters which were absolutely public, which were known to everybody in the State and which ought to have been known to the Minister for Finance at the time, and I dare say were.  But the Minister for Finance seems to suffer from as much defective a memory as from a fertile imagination.  I find reading from a report contained in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of January the 29th, 1932, the following passage:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The actual discussion continued for nearly one and a half hours afterwards and Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney, the Minister for Justice, told me (that is, of course, the <i>Independent</i> reporter) when leaving that the whole position from the point of view of the Government's proposals appear to have been very much misunderstood. He hoped, he said, to make a statement on the subject during the week-end.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This statement that there was a firm decision taken by the Executice Council had been circulated at the time and I took that opportunity of contradicting it.  I stated that I hoped to make a statement on the subject during the week-end.  I find that at a meeting held by me in Kilmaine, in Mayo, and reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> on February 1st, 1932, I made the following statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Referring to the proposed 5 per cent. cut in the pay of the Civic Guards, the Minister for Justice stated that Deputy Lemass was now championing the Guards, although he had always maligned them in the Dáil and tried to run down their reputation on every possible occasion. He is objecting, said the Minister (that is myself), to the proposed reduction in their pay of 5 per cent.  That was not a definite reduction, because no definite conclusion had been come to by the Executive Council.  Before the Executive can arrive at any conclusion, it is necessary to consult with the Representative Body of the Guards.  Although that Body has refused to put forward its views, or to make any representations or suggestions, <Col N="1170" /> no definite decision regarding the cut in pay has been reached.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a definite statement made by me and reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> on February 1st, 1932.  That is a definitely clear, unambiguous statement made at the time.  Yet in the teeth of that statement which was our attitude then, is our attitude now and always must be our attitude, and must be the attitude of anybody who in any way has regard for the existing law, we have the Minister repeating what is manifestly untrue.  No decision can be come to to cut the Guards' pay until the necessary statutory formalities have been gone through, and until the Guards' Representative Body has been consulted. No decision could have been arrived at and no decision was arrived at by the then Executive Council.  Any decision which was arrived at could have been nothing more and was nothing more than a decision to put those proposals before the Guards. Those are the statements.</P>
    <P>That same letter which the Minister read out had been misunderstood at the time at which it was written and I took that opportunity of explaining that no decision had been taken.  So much I found later on in other papers that that is entirely recognised.  I find a report in the <i>Irish Times</i> of February 3rd, 1932, to show how the matter was recognised, and how the true position was recognised in February, 1932, the position which the Minister cannot recognise to-day.</P>
    <P>The following passage occurs in an interview with General O'Duffy, the then Commissioner of the Gárda: &ldquo;The Representative Body may, of course, put up alternative proposals or amendments and these will be considered by the Government.&rdquo;  That is what the Representative Body is for. Any recommendations that they put forward had to be considered by the Executive Council and, of course, would have been considered by the Executive Council prior to the Executive having any legal justification for making a cut in the Gárda pay. The question of making a 5 per cent. reduction in the pay of the Guards, together with the pay of other persons at the <Col N="1171" /> time was proposed as a matter to be placed before the Representative Body. At the time it was recognised that some economy would have to take place in the administration of the Guards unless taxation was going to be increased, because we were not the reckless Executive Council that the present Executive Council are, willing to scatter money right, left and centre, to save 3d. here and 6d. there, and to fling away pound after pound in reckless expenditure for which they can get no return and are getting no return.  Whatever defence the Minister may put forward, or whatever suggestions he may make as to why this amendment should not be accepted, in the teeth of these contemporary statements&mdash;the only statements made by any member of the Executive Council upon the matter; statements which are uncontradicted at least by any other member of the then Executive Council &mdash;I do not suppose that even the Minister for Finance will again repeat what he stated here and what he repeated in the Seanad a short time ago.  I said a few moments ago that I was not going to go now into the merits of this amendment very fully because I have placed my views already before the House and because there was nothing that I could add to the arguments that I have already put forward to the House.  I do not think there is any particular advantage, even with the present Executive Council, in endeavouring to get them to understand the folly of the course they are adopting.  I do not think there is any hope.  I do not think that any arguments of mine, be they ever so cogent, let them carry as much conviction as possible to the ordinary unprejudiced minds, could possibly have any effect upon the Executive Council who now obviously have made up their minds. But, for my part, I intend to vote for the retention of this amendment inserted in the Bill by the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House in coming into a decision upon the issue raised in the Seanad and upon the amendment suggested by the Seanad, which the Minister says he <Col N="1172" /> proposes to oppose.  I think Deputy Norton in speaking on the Committee Stage and on the Report Stage of this Bill proved from documentary evidence to the satisfaction of everybody anxious to hear a fair statement of the case that President de Valera in the famous Rathmines speech in 1932 undoubtedly pledged himself at that time that he would not reduce the salaries of public servants who were in receipt of anything between £300 and £400 per year.  The Minister for Finance may quibble in any way he likes in regard to this matter, but I think that documents were produced in the House to prove that that statement was intended to apply to all public servants.  The members of this Party believe that it is bad Governmental policy to reduce the salaries of public servants or wage-earners, especially when these reductions are applied to individuals in receipt of salaries or wages below the amounts named.  It is very difficult to understand the most extraordinary attitude which the Minister now takes up when he has here on the Order Paper an amendment proposing to exclude from the operation of this Bill certain individuals, I suppose a small number of individuals, who are in receipt of anything between £1,000 and £2,000 per year.  Of course, we have not heard from the Minister, up to the present, the reasons which induced him to state that he was prepared to accept this amendment and to recommend its acceptance to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in the pay of the Civic Guards, which is included in this Temporary Economies Bill will, as far as I can ascertain, bring the pay of the Civic Guards to a level which cannot be justified and which will place the Civic Guards in the position of being the lowest paid police force in the English-speaking world.  I do not think such a policy can be justified for political reasons.  I have read, as far as was possible for me to read, in the Official Debates, the speeches of the individuals supporting the Government in this policy, especially the speeches in this House that I did not hear and the speeches in the other House.  The one thing that strikes anybody who <Col N="1173" /> followed the debates on this Bill very closely, is that while the Minister claimed that the proposals contained in this Bill were only of a temporary nature, most, if not all, the speeches made by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, both in the Seanad and in the Dáil, gave anybody who read them the clear impression that it was meant to be a permanent measure.</P>
    <P>I assume that the Minister will admit that Senator Comyn can rightly claim to be regarded as the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad.  If anybody wants to read a speech from any supporter of this measure which will clearly convince him that the measure was intended to be a permanent one instead of a temporary one, the speech made by Senator Comyn in the Seanad is the best one he can pick out.  The Senator stated that the Government were being pressed by the farmers, who are undoubtedly in a very precarious position, to bring in a measure of this kind and he made no apology whatever for suggesting to the Seanad that this was intended to be, as far as he was concerned, at any rate, a permanent measure.  The amendment, which is on the Order Paper, and which proposes to exclude from the operations of this Bill certain privileged people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has a bearing on the argument that I am endeavouring to make.  That amendment proposes to exclude from the operation of the Bill certain privileged people in receipt of fairly high salaries and suggests that they should be excluded from it because they were invited by this Government or a previous Government to relinquish a position in some other country and to come over here and take certain risks.  I do not think anybody who came over here in 1922 or subsequently took any risks when he came here.  As far as my information goes, and I hope the Minister will contradict me if I am wrong, anybody who came here on the invitation of the Government of the Saorstát since 1922 came over here with considerable <Col N="1174" /> advantages, especially from the point of view of the additional salary which he received, and from the point of view of security of employment compared with the prospects which he had in the service of the Government from which he came.  I suppose it is useless to use any kind of argument in favour of the acceptance of the Seanad amendment, because I presume the absent members of the Fianna Fáil Party will, when the division bell rings, come in and register their votes in the usual penny-in-the-slot-machine way in favour of a measure a discussion on which they have hardly ever listened to in this House.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has shown great economy of speech-making so far as this House is concerned, but he was one of the most eloquent speakers on public platforms that I heard during the general election.  Now he is strangely silent when a measure of this kind comes before the House.  I have been waiting and hoping that he would have the courage to make a speech here some day instead of making unintelligent interruptions on matters of this kind.  I venture to remind him that when he was speaking in Leix and Offaly, he did not tell the teachers who accompanied him that he was going to cut their salaries when his Government came into office, and that that was part of the compensation they would get for helping to secure him to be returned as a Deputy.</P>

      <P>I was rather anxious to reserve my remarks until Deputy-Fitzgerald-Kenney had returned to the House because what I have to say has a particular relation to some statements which he made in the course of this debate.  I see the Deputy has come back, and is now in his place, I am very glad of it because I would like to have from him a statement as to what he really meant by what he said on another occasion.  In the debates in this House originally on this matter, and in those that have since taken place in the Seanad, I made a statement which I repeat again that our predecessors, the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, when in office, had decided to reduce the pay of the Gárda Síochána&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Minister allow me to interrupt him for one moment?  This point has been discussed already at prodigous length.  I suggest to the Minister that for argumentative purposes it makes not the slightest difference whether the Government decided to reduce the pay of the Gárda Síochána or whether they wanted to reduce the pay.  It is perfectly plain that they wanted to do it and it is pure waste of time to argue the matter further.</P>

      <P>I agree with the remarks of Deputy MacDermot but I regret he was not here to give expression to them when Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was dealing with this matter. This letter of 5th January was based, as the Deputy knows well, upon an official minute communicating the decision of the Cabinet to the Department of Finance.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has said that there was a very carelessly worded letter from the Department of Finance but that nevertheless the Government had not decided to cut the pay of the Gárda Síochána.  If the letter from the Department of Finance was carelessly worded, what description or epithet would the Deputy apply to a letter from his own Department issued by himself to the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána dated 7th January, 1932 to the following effect: &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Justice to transmit for your information the attached copy of a minute received from the Department of Finance intimating that the Government had decided that a reduction of 5 per cent. should be made in the remuneration of the Gárda Síochána.&rdquo; Are we to assume that that letter issued under Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's direction was carelessly worded?</P>

      <P>Those letters were written on 5th and 7th January. They did create a certain amount of anxiety in the ranks of the Gárda Síochána.  The decision had apparently been conveyed unofficially to members of the Gárda Síochána.  In consequence, a certain agitation arose in the ranks of the Gárda Síochána, and throughout the country.  Possibly the Government reconsidered its attitude. We do not know.  We only know that towards the end of January the then Minister for Justice made a statement to a newspaper reporter.  The point would immediately arise as to which of these communications issued by the Minister for Justice, the initial letter written by his Department under his direction on 7th January to the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána, or this statement made by the Minister, I think late at night, to a newspaper reporter, was the more authoritative.  Which of them might be taken as conveying more correctly the actual position in the matter?  The Minister has told this House that when his Department wrote that the Government had decided to cut the <Col N="1179" /> pay of the Gárda Síochána it was an incorrect statement; that in fact they had not come to such a decision; that the letter did not mean what it said. What position does that put us in when we have to consider the statement issued on 29th January, in which the Minister informed a newspaper reporter that the Government had decided not to cut the pay of the Gárda Síochána?  Might he not, when he made that statement, have meant what he said just as little as he did when he directed the responsible head of his Department to write the letter to the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána on 7th January, stating that his Government had decided to cut the pay of the Gárda Síochána?  The one thing which emerges from the speech made here to-day by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is that the Deputy does not know when he means what he says, and that, therefore, any statement he may make as to what actually did happen, on 5th or 7th January, 1932, has to be discounted in the light of his own admissions that his letters cannot bear the interpretation which any plain man, understanding plain English, would put upon them.  I leave it at that.  I do not think the point is worth pursuing further.</P>

It must mean either that we cut the social services or increase taxation.  I am pointing out to the Deputy that an investigation of the position has gone far to convince me that if we have to increase taxation the burden would be distributed much wider and much further than I at one time contemplated.  I did at one time think it might be confined to those who were regarded as the wealthier class of the community, but I am not certain that I should be able to confine it to them.  If we have to withdraw this Bill because the Dáil accepts the Seanad amendment the consequences are not going to be confined to any small group or section in this country. The consequent taxation will have to be widely distributed.  The workers will have to pay just as heavily as the employers or the wealthier people in this country, and the farmers would have to pay too.</P>

      <P>If I might go back, I was pointing out to the House the consequences of this amendment.  I should like to stress once more that the Government has no alternative between asking the Dáil to reject this amendment, which has been inserted <Col N="1183" /> by the Seanad, and increasing the burden of taxation on the people.  We have been told that times are hard and that trade is bad.  We have listened to accounts of the difficulties of the farmers.  I ask any person who purports to speak for the farmers, and who represents them in this House, seriously to consider whether, in all the circumstances, and bearing in mind the conditions on which the Gárda Síochána scales of pay were laid down in the first instance, bearing in mind the decision taken in January, 1932, to reduce by 5 per cent. the pay of the Gárda Síochána, and bearing in mind the present necessities of the Exchequer, he would be justified in all these circumstances in accepting this amendment from the Seanad, and, as I have said already, increasing the burden of taxation on the people.</P>

I think we must all have got over the possibility of being filled with contempt by the Minister's attitude He most unquestionably on this particular occasion shows he does not know the meaning of words, because we get a most astonishing thing.  The Minister for Finance gets up, the spendthrift Minister, the wasteful Minister, the man who has spent millions of public money and got no return for it, and talks of a policy of economy, a Fianna Fáil policy of economy.  Was anything more absurd ever mentioned than a Fianna Fáil policy of economy?  Taxes put up by the million, and that is economy! Money flung right, left and centre without any return for it, and that is economy!  The Minister may apply any other epithet under Heaven to himself and the Fianna Fáil Party, but to mention Fianna Fáil and economy in the same breath is the act of an absolute lunatic for the time being at any rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that for the Minister to have called this Bill or anything else the Fianna Fáil Party put forward, an example of a policy of economy is the most ludicrous thing possible.  I say that nobody responsible for his words, no responsible individual, nobody who knows the use of language, could use the words &ldquo;policy of economy&rdquo; in connection with the Fianna Fáil Party. There is an obvious way by which this £250,000 or whatever it may be, and a good deal more, could be saved. How much is going in bounties that would never have to be paid if it were not for the idiotic policy that has been adopted?  To talk about a policy of economy with reference to this Bill or anything else certainly shows that the Minister has not the slightest knowledge of the plain meaning of words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the letter.  The Minister only read a certain portion because the Minister well knew that the latter portion of that letter would make its meaning perfectly clear.  I never saw the letter but the Minister suggests of course to this House that every letter from a Department which begins: &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for so-and-so to state&rdquo; has been scrutinised and its wording directed by the Minister.  That is what he suggests to the House but the Minister knows perfectly well that probably not one single letter leaves a Government Department which does not begin: &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister&rdquo;. To say that because the words &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister&rdquo; are at the beginning of a letter, the Minister has directed the wording of that letter, is a statement which the Minister himself knows to be inaccurate.  The Minister knows that letters leave the Department of Finance for instance, in which it is said: &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister&rdquo;<Col N="1185" /> and which the Minister has never seen.  He knows that but he conveyed the opposite impression to the House. That is what I would expect from him, but what I would expect from no other Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter states: &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister to forward a copy of a minute,&rdquo; and a copy of the minute and nothing else but a copy of the minute is enclosed. There is no fresh wording.  It is not an important letter because it is the ordinary form of sending on a document to the Commissioner of the Guards requesting the Commissioner of the Guards to call together the Representative Body in order that representations from the Representative Body may be collected.  I am perfectly certain that is the form which the letter took, though I personally did not scrutinise the letter.  It was the mere formal sending on of a document and nothing more.  There was no fresh wording.  It is simply a transaction of forwarding a minute, which however unfortunately worded, emanated from the Department of Finance.  I am perfectly certain that it contained nothing further than a request that the Representative Body were to be called together to consider the matter, and it is as clear as daylight that no decision could have been come to.  The Minister of course is endeavouring to frighten the House by threats but he has given no reason why this particular amendment should not be accepted or why that should necessitate the dropping of the rest of the Bill.  Personally, I do not care whether the rest of the Bill is or is not dropped.  What I do care is that this particular amendment should be kept in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>My Party voted against this amendment or against an identical amendment when it was put forward in this House.  We had an amendment of our own down which was confined to the non-commissioned ranks of the Civic Guards but we considered that this amendment went unnecessarily far.  On the present occasion, I do not propose to vote against <Col N="1186" /> this amendment.  On the other hand, I do not propose to vote for it for reasons which I will give.  I believe that the decision to cut down the pay of the Civic Guards is very unfortunate and, particularly, that of the rank and file. I do not think it is at all satisfactory that our police force should be worse paid than the neighbouring police force across the Border.  Moreover, some of the arguments which might reconcile us to cuts in other directions do not apply in this direction.  For example, one of the things that influenced me very strongly was that it was desirable that all classes of electors should feel the results of the present economic conditions and that, thereby, there would be spread throughout the community an impatience with the insane economic policy of the Government.  That, however, does not apply to the Civic Guards, because they are not electors.  They are outside the community in that respect and have no voice in the formation of Government policy.</P>
      <P>I do not feel disposed to vote for this amendment.  It would be very easy to vote for it because, owing to the absence of members on holiday occasions, there is no danger of the Government being defeated.  They have a comfortable majority, and one could vote easily for the amendment without any danger of upsetting the Bill.</P>

      <P>There might be in such circumstances a temptation to vote for it, so that one could have the honour and glory of saying that one was standing by the Civic Guards.  But the amendment goes further than we thought it wise to go.  In the second place, I am not prepared to cast a vote that might be interpreted as indicating that, in any circumstances, we would be willing to see this Bill dropped.  We would not.  We are as emphatically in favour of this Bill to-day as we were when it was first introduced.  Deputy Davin has suggested that these cuts are going to be permanent.  I do not know whether they are going to be permanent or not, or whether this cut in the pay of the Civic Guards is going to be <Col N="1187" /> permanent or not; but I do very much hope that, whether this cut or any other cut is going to be permanent, the policy, at any rate, will be permanent. I hope that the policy of economy will be permanent and that, while these cuts may be re-adjusted, economies will be made, and on an increased scale, next year.  I am just as satisfied as ever I was that our present scale of expenditure is absolutely ruinous. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that it is ludicrous for this Government to do anything in the nature of economy: that it is contrary to the whole trend of their policy.  No doubt it is contrary to the trend of their policy.  They have been tremendously extravagant, but I do not see that that is a logical reason for rejecting any little bit of economy they do offer to us.  They may be the prodigal son, but that does not say that we should not kill the fatted calf for them on any occasions they deserve it. I am afraid that this Bill only merits a very lean calf.</P>
      <P>There is another point that carries a great deal of weight with me, and that is that I, frankly, resent any action by the Seanad which tends to reverse economies decided upon by this House. Constitutionally, the situation is that they are entitled to do it, but I do not think it is right or proper or sound that they should do it.  The idea of the Constitution is that the Seanad are to be excluded from matters of finance and, in point of fact, they cannot stir a finger to prevent extravagance; but, when it comes to economies, the fantastic situation is that they are able to intervene and prevent us from economising.  The mere fact that this amendment comes from the Seanad, and that it is interfering with the decision of this House to economise in a certain way, is enough to stop me from voting for it, even though I cannot see my way to vote against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>But I am far more puzzled by the attitude of the Minister <Col N="1188" /> for Finance.  Perhaps I am incorrect in using the word &ldquo;puzzled,&rdquo; in this regard, because we are getting accustomed to the acrobatic feats of the Minister for Finance.  When he was introducing this Bill in the Seanad his whole attitude was to shake his fist in the face of the Seanad and to indulge in wordy phrases as to the alternative, which was either additional taxation or to place the income he expected to derive from this economy on the shoulders of those best able to bear it.  There he stood, shaking his fist, and left us guessing as to whose shoulders in this country are best able to bear increased taxation.  I would suggest to him that the shoulders in this country best able to bear increased taxation are the shoulders of those who are bearing none at the present moment.  It is easy enough for Ministers, with their four-figure salaries, their exemption from cuts and their exemption from income tax, to sneer at those who complain of the weight of taxation and at those who complain of the drastic nature of the cuts.  Yet, we have a policy in this country preached by those who put a frame around the word &ldquo;economy&rdquo; that taxation must be increased year after year, that income must be reduced year after year; but taxation will not be borne nor the income reduced by those who put a frame around the word &ldquo;economy.&rdquo;  I admit that the Ministers are doing their job at a lower rate than their predecessors, but I suggest that you will always get third-rate men to work at third-rate figures, and I do not think it is sound national economy to apply a third-rate figure to third-rate men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister came in here to defend his policy, what was his attitude? It was entirely different to his attitude in the Seanad.  It was the same old game&mdash;the cowardly game&mdash;of sheltering behind the back of another; the old gag that this was the Cumann na nGaedheal policy in 1931.  Why do they not stand for it as a Fianna Fáil policy?  Why do you want Cumann na nGaedheal to be your stalking-horse and to be blazing the trail for you to walk in ease?  Why does not this Government stand&mdash;if only for this <Col N="1189" /> once&mdash;on their own legs and say that it is their own policy?  We had many things to do&mdash;many hard things to do&mdash; but we never sheltered behind the back of an Opposition or of anybody else. If we had hard things to do, we did them, and we did not shelter behind anyone else's back.  The Government should stand over their own policy and say it is their own policy.  People will respect the men who have two legs of their own and who stand on them, but for the wobblers with no legs or feet of their own on which to stand, and who try to put the blame for their policy on the economic war&mdash;for which they blame outsiders&mdash;on the one hand, and a previous Government on the other hand, there can be nothing but contempt.  There can be nothing but contempt for such a Government and for that type of policy being advocated by such a Minister.  And all those reductions in the pay of an Irish police force, an under-paid and over-worked police force as it is, are introduced in the sacred name of economy.  What does economy mean in business, in the domestic household or in any sphere or walk of life?  To everyone of us, whether we sit on this or that side of the House, economy means spending less.  It never meant spending more. Here we have this particular Bill introduced, and this particular amendment objected to in the name of economy by a Government that cannot say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to certain elements in the country, by a Government that is on the run before certain elements in the country and by a jelly fish Government that cannot spell economy.  You have done injustices to others, and what is before the Dáil this evening is whether we are to continue doing those injustices so that a weak, spendthrift Government can have more money to spend at the demand of those who are the masters of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is in a very interesting mood to-day, but there is one thing that he cannot take out of his archives, and it is proof that I have got a pension although I have earned it for 20 years.  He tries to excuse the cut in the salaries of the Guards because he brings in to this Chamber documents alleged to have been written by his predecessor.  I doubt if it is good taste to bring the confidential correspondence of a Department into this House and read from it.  If there is not some point at which that will be stopped, the time will arrive when there will not be one confidential document in this country, no matter how serious that document may be for individuals concerned. Ministers write confidential documents of a character that we can imagine. They leave them there when they go out of office, perhaps to be taken up and brought in here by an opponent to be read for this House, and in that way scattered over the country by the Press, with the result that an ex-Minister's life might be in danger when he walked abroad.  I think, a Chinn Comhairle, there should be some limit to the introduction of confidential correspondence which either the Ministers of to-day or of yesterday <Col N="1191" /> carried out in good faith.  The Minister has now been in office for a year and a half, and must have some idea with regard to the practice of writing letters in Government Departments. He must know that the Minister who is the head of a Department signs very few letters, though every letter that goes out from the Department, and every letter received, is acknowledged in the name of the head of the Department.  There is no use in labouring that because every messenger in the hall knows it, and the Minister for Finance ought to know it and not be trying to make a debating point of it here.</P>
      <P>The Minister persists in having the salaries of the Civic Guards cut.  His only excuse is that his predecessors in office did the same.  Of course, that is not really his excuse, but he uses it in the vain hope that it will not do him or his Party much political harm.  That is a political gesture, but even if all that were true, there is this aspect of it not true: that the party or parties in Opposition did not go to the country at that particular time and say that if returned to power they would not cut the salaries of the Civic Guards, and then when returned to power start to cut them, and justify the cuts because their predecessors in office proposed to cut.  The Party that formed the Government a couple of years ago did not promise the country that they would not cut the salaries of the Civic Guards.  The Party in power now did promise the country that they would not cut these salaries if returned to power, and now when they are proceeding to cut them they say that what their predecessors in office did is a good enough justification for what they are proposing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins took the right course when he said that a Government should be courageous enough to stand on its own two legs, and to do a thing or not to do it because, in their judgment it was a good thing to do or not to do so, as the case might be.  The Minister for Finance looked over towards the Labour Party and said that since the Government came into <Col N="1192" /> office social services have been extended.  He threatened the Labour Party that if the Government were to accept the proposal to exempt the Civic Guards from this Bill then social services would have to be curtailed or new taxation imposed.  Will the Minister try to justify that?  Will the Minister deny that he took as his theme on the hustings in his constituency, that while the universal depression was being borne by the Irish people, the cost of the Free State government from 1922 to 1926 averaged £30,000,000, although the cost of British government for all Ireland, during the war years, 1914 to 1918, was only £19,800,000?  In leaded type in one document it was stated: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil will end the reckless waste and extravagance of the Free State Government, and the economic depression which is the fruit of it.&rdquo;  I do not know if I could call it an honour or a privilege to have stood on the same platform as the Minister, and to hear him deliver a speech with that as the theme, but I have never seen the Minister become so excited as or more eloquent than when he was slating the Free State Government for reckless extravagance, and comparing it with the record of the British Government in 1914-1918, when the country was being run for less than £20,000,000.  The Minister is now in harness.  I do not know if it was the Minister or some of his Party who, on one occassion, gave this quotation from the Scripture: &ldquo;By their acts I shall judge them, not by their promises.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He is going to curtail social services, but he did not enumerate what services. He was wise not to do so, because he would find that it was not the Central Government was providing social services, but local councils. Undoubtedly, that was the reason the Minister and his Party went back on their promises regarding de-rating. Since he came into office the Minister got a number of windfalls that were not in existence when he was denouncing the extravagance of the previous Government.  The Minister had taxes imposed in 1931 that would produce about £1,200,000.  I refer to taxes to produce money for the relief of agricultural rates.</P>

      <P>In dealing with this matter, the Minister said that if the Government cannot get the money in the way suggested, by cutting the salaries of certain classes of public servants, it will have to be found some other way.  I am afraid I had not developed the point I wished to make sufficiently, that since the Minister came into office there has been an added revenue, compared with what his predecessor had.  In that way I am referring to the taxes imposed in 1931; taxes which would produce £1,200,000, but which were ear-marked only to the extent of £750,000, giving the Minister £450,000 or £500,000 when operating for the full year, as they operated last year.  These taxes are still operating, and the Minister has taken from the produce of them £500,000 and diverted it from its original destination, into the Exchequer.  The Minister should explain to the House what added service he has given for that £500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the ruling of the Chair.  I understand that the matter before the House is an amendment that the Civic Guards should be exempt from cuts in salaries.  The case made by the Minister is that if he does not get the money from that source he will have to curtail social services.  The point I was endeavouring to make was that if there are increased social services, the Minister has increased revenue to meet them.  He has an <Col N="1194" /> increased revenue, as compared to what his predecessor had, which will more than meet any social services that are a direct charge on the Exchequer.  The rest will go into the Exchequer in the form of the land tax of 50 per cent. of the old annuities that is being imposed in legislation now passing through the Oireachtas.  That will more than meet the deficiency that would be caused by not passing this Bill in its original form.  I cannot see where the Minister has made a case for adhering to the Bill as it originally stood.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Higgins put it, a reduction in salaries means less money in circulation.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  He tried to justify an uneconomic proposition a few days ago, because it would put a lot of money into circulation.  He is now going to take money out of circulation, and is going to cut the salaries of a large body of public servants, to whose efficiency and loyalty tribute has been paid by the present Government on many occasions.  The country has been assured that in their hands adequate protection will be provided, and that there is no need for any &ldquo;blue-shirts.&rdquo; While the Minister can place such reliance on the Civic Guards, who are not overpaid, he proposes to adhere to the Bill as it originally stood and to cut their salaries.  I am not going to suggest that that will interfere with their loyalty or their allegiance, yet the tendency must be not to make them more loyal.  This proposal will reduce the standard of living, and the standard of wages.  It is natural to expect that the Labour Party is supporting the amendment.  Of course, the Labour Party must be prepared for a skelp of the rod with which to beat themselves. We did not vote for war, and did not vote for supplies.  The Labour Party voted for war.</P>

      <P>There has been no attempt to show on what Estimate he could save the amount involved in this amendment.  So far as I remember, when the Estimates were going through there was no proposal to reduce the amounts proposed in relation to the different Departments.  Now such responsible Deputies as Deputy MacDermot and Deputy O'Higgins talk about the Government's extravagance. Deputy O'Higgins thinks it is a joke to call this Bill an Economies Bill or for the Government to attempt to do anything in the name of economy.  That is not sufficient unless the same Deputies or some other Deputies attempt to show where the extravagance lies.  I have listened with average carefulness and attention to the debates on the Estimates, and I have not heard one proposal as to where the money could otherwise be saved.  In face of that, what is one to do who wants to make up his mind as to the rights and wrongs of this amendment? He gets no help from the Opposition except the statement that the Government is extravagant.</P>
      <P>No one likes to vote for the reduction of anyone's salary or wages. It is a very unpleasant duty, particularly when the amount in question is not much more than what would be required for the ordinary necessities of life.  No one voted light-heartedly for any clause of the Economies Bill, and we will not vote light-heartedly against this amendment, but until the Opposition are able to show how the Government can otherwise get the money&mdash;get it in a fairer manner than is proposed in the Bill&mdash;then I think we will have to agree that the Bill is necessary.</P>

      <P>Extravagance?  Why, you are pouring money up and down the country.  You do not seem to realise that, but people who have been in touch with local authorities for the last 30 years know very well what the situation is.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and others, before the election, said they would not reduce the Guards' allowances but they would reduce the number of the Guards.  Now they ask the House to support them in reducing the Guards' salaries.  I am not prepared to reduce them.  I represent the farmers just as much as Deputy MacDermot does and I am going to vote against the cuts.</P>

      <P>May I suggest to Deputy Moore that all through the year we have been dealing with the Government's extravagance?  This is not the place to do it.  We know from the ruling of the Chair that it would not be in order to deal with the matter here.  We have voted against Government legislation that meant the expenditure of more money; we challenged divisions on that matter during the year.  The onus is altogether on the Government to justify this method of raising money.  They have not attempted in other cases to do so.  This is one of the few occasions on which they made a slight attempt.  When the Bill was before the House some time ago the Minister for Agriculture, if my memory serves me correctly, did suggest that on the merits there was a case here.  He singled the Guards out for special dishonourable mention, if I may use that phrase.  He suggested there was justification for a cut here on the merits.  Nowhere else did he try to justify a cut on the merits.  Although he did single them out he was never able to prove that there was a case for cutting.  The onus rests on the Government, because they are taking the step.</P>

      <P>On every appropriate occasion we have called attention to the extravagance of the Government.  Anybody need only examine the situation to see that saving money is not the purpose of this Bill. The idea that the whole Bill must fall if one exception is made shows that saving money is not the purpose.  It is not on account of the comparatively paltry sum involved in connection with this particular cut&mdash;that is not the reason this amendment is being rejected by the Government.  It is not a question of money, because that in itself is not sufficient to upset the Budget.  It is because it is a portion of a general policy to cut down salaries and wages. That is why this amendment is being rejected.  I wonder do Deputy Moore and other Deputies believe that this measure will run only for one year, that the cut in the pay of the Guards will operate only for one year?  The Guards year after year since their inception have had new duties thrown upon them. Their numbers have been reduced, not increased, and new duties have been thrown upon them by various Government measures.  Instead of increasing their pay in consequence of the new duties they have to perform, it is now proposed to diminish their pay.</P>
      <P>It is idle for Deputy Davin to call attention to the promises of the Government.  We have had confessions practically from the Front Bench that these promises are not to be taken seriously&mdash;I mean so far as giving effect to them is concerned; that they were merely there for the purpose which they served&mdash;of taking in the people. Therefore, it is late in the day now to throw in the teeth of the Government their violation of their promises.  If the Government did not intend to pay any attention to their promises of not reducing the salaries of people under a certain scale, they could do so.  But they are proposing to reduce those salaries.  The onus is on the Government to justify this particular measure they are taking.  It is they who are taking these steps.  The House is trying to prevent them from taking it.  Anybody who has followed the financial measures of the Ministers could not agree to allow them to evade their promises.</P>

      <P>I must congratulate the Minster for Finance on having brought about the conversion of Deputy MacDermot.  When the Minister made the threat that if the Bill were defeated, or if the amendments from the Seanad were carried, the people whom Deputy MacDermot represents in the country would have to bear additional taxes, we had the spectacle of Deputy MacDermot giving a promise and an assurance to the Minister that he would abstain from voting.  In the course of his speech Deputy MacDermot was in sympathy with the Gárda but he is blowing hot and cold.  He got cold feet when the Minister used the threat of further taxes on the people whom the Deputy represents. The Government want to know how, if this cut is not enforced, the money is to be raised.  They want to know in what way, or by what means, the Government are to raise the £25,000 that would be represented by this cut in the Guards' pay.  Is it not a fact that the Representative Body of the Gárda have put up a suggestion to the Minister by which this money could be saved.  One was by reducing the bi-monthly inspections.  In that one way alone a sum of £10,000 would be saved.  In a number of other ways savings of more than £15,000 would be effected.  Another threat by the Government was that if this money were not saved social services would be interfered with.  The first threat to the Labour Party was that if they were to withdraw this Bill the social services would have to be reduced. What social services can be reduced? The labourers at present are paying more than their cost of the economic war.  The burden will have to be placed upon the larger number of the people.  There is no section of the community at the present time paying more for the economic war than the rural worker.  I am aware of where men, who, previous to the fight with England, were getting £78 a year, have had to sacrifice 5/- a week or £13 a year of that money to their employers. The labourers are told &ldquo;that is what you get by voting for the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  But these men are prepared to make even <Col N="1199" /> further sacrifices.  The people whom Deputy MacDermot represents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The farming community have received various benefits from the present Government.  They have got half their land annuities, and in addition they have got the agricultural grant.  While these benefits have been extended to the agricultural community, the workers in the rural areas have received no benefits whatever from the Government.  These people are making the sacrifices.  For every tax that is put on, the agricultural workers have to pay in the shape of reduced wages.  I hold that the Minister can find ways and means without interfering with the pay of the Guards.  In this matter I stand in a unique position in this House.  I am the one man here who was batoned by the R.I.C. and I was also batoned by the Guards.  I found no difference between the baton of the R.I.C. and the baton of the Guards.  The Guards were influenced to baton by their officers and by certain employers. That is why I wish now to see the Guards independent, and to see them in such a way that they will not worry about employers or T.D.'s, but that they will carry out their duties independently. If the Minister were to accept this amendment from the Seanad he would do a good day's work for the country.  Deputy MacDermot is out against the Seanad.  When the <Col N="1200" /> Fianna Fáil Government brings in a Bill dealing with the Seanad, will Deputy MacDermot take the same stand he has now taken and support the Fianna Fáil Government against the Seanad?  What he probably will do is that he will take similar action to what he has taken now.  He will go out and tell the people outside: &ldquo;I made a speech against the Government's Bill, but I am not going to vote on either side.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister knows very well the means by which he can find the money without interfering with the salaries of the Guards.  I have no ill will against the Guards.  They are a fine body of Irishmen and we are proud of them. That is why I have got up to appeal to the Minister to change his attitude on this Bill, even now at the eleventh hour.  I would ask him to reconsider the matter, not because the Seanad has put forward this amendment, but to show that he has the good sense and that the Government had the good grace to recognise that the Guards are a highly efficient body of men, and that their pay should not be interfered with. In the absence of the Centre Party from the Division Lobby, the Minister knows he has a majority in favour of the cut in the cost of the Guards. That is one of the reasons why I ask him to accept the Seanad amendment and in this way show his feeling towards a good body of Irishmen and not to reduce a body that are already underpaid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Committee accepts the motion to disagree with this amendment, it is proposed to substitute the amendment on the Order Paper.  The necessity for that arises in this way: After the institution of the Free State and the setting up of the new Government and, particularly, the new branches of administration here, it was found necessary to secure the services of a number of experienced individuals who had previously held positions in another country.  These men came back here.  They are not entitled to the benefit of Article X of the Treaty.  Some of them sought <Col N="1203" /> assurances, first of all, that the positions would be permanent; secondly, that their salaries and the appropriate bonus would be maintained; thirdly, that superannuation rights would be secured to them.</P>
      <P>In the case of a few of them, not a considerable number, these assurances were given in writing and in terms more or less as follows: that the then Minister for Finance felt that they were entitled to be assured as to their future in the Saorstát service and that on all the points in respect to which assurances were required he was prepared to give them in the fullest measure. The State recognised that these men surrendered their posts under another Government and gave their services to this State and it would be a serious step to contemplate that the assurances then given them would not be carried out.  I have documentary evidence showing that these assurances were given.  I feel, in view of the explicit form in which they were given, that these assurances must be honoured by me, and by my successors and, accordingly, I am suggesting that instead of the amendment made in the Seanad this one, which will enable the Minister to consider each case, and to determine each upon its merits, should be accepted by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I have some qualms of conscience about one official whom I interviewed personally late in 1922, or possibly in the beginning of 1923.  He was not in the service of another country; he had service in this country and relinquished his service in this country by reason of some of the national happenings of the period.  He was in a very good position in London.  He now occupies a more important position in the State.  He made no representations to me, good, bad or indifferent, either directly or indirectly, but if I was asked in respect to this position whether there was responsibility upon this State to give him the rights and privileges of Article X or any one of those mentioned, or intended in this connection, I would have said &ldquo;certainly&rdquo;.  The best possible terms should be accorded to him.  Although any communications <Col N="1204" /> I had with him were purely verbal, I believe I would be bound as a matter of public honour to keep the undertaking with that official.  The Minister possibly knows who this official is.</P>

      <P>I would not dare to suggest to any Minister for Finance, or to any Minister in any Government, that he should deliberately break an agreement, especially a written agreement, honourably entered into with an individual or a nation.  But I think a good deal more information is required from the Minister for Finance before he can justify a proposal of this kind.  Especially is that so in view of the fact that the President has told us again and again that this Bill calls for sacrifices from all.  Surely if the office cleaner in Leinster House and the lowest paid servants in the State have to suffer as a result of the cuts, there is a case for asking for some sacrifice from gentlemen, no matter what their nationality, who are in receipt of salaries between £1,000 and £2,000 a year.  Give us the number of the individuals concerned in this proposal and the salaries they got when they were invited to take up positions under this State, and the salaries now paid to them by the Government in office. Then we may be able to come to some fair conclusion as to what we should do in regard to a proposal of this kind. Will the Minister say that any of the gentlemen who are likely to benefit as a result of the exclusion proposal, are not to-day receiving salaries much greater than those they had when they came from the service of another Government in another country?  I feel fairly certain that some of the privileged people, who are to benefit under the terms of this proposal, if the House is silly enough to accept it after the speech of the Minister, have salaries in excess, and some of them 50 per cent. in excess, of what they received under the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise it is a good thing for a Government, or even for any business undertaking, if you like, to procure a man who has special experience in a particular line of business.  I agree that they would be well advised to pay a fairly decent salary in such a case, because such persons are supposed to <Col N="1205" /> be experts as a result of their long experience.  But I see no reason in a Bill of this kind, where sacrifices are called for, to exclude certain privileged people whose salaries are greater now than they would have been had they remained in their previous employment. This proposal really comes from Deputy Costello.  It is the one thing under cover of which he made a very plausible speech in this House and which the Minister for Finance undertook to consider.  It was the only proposal he undertook to consider sympathetically when this Bill was going through its Committee Stage. The House and the country are entitled to more information than the Minister has given.  The gentlemen who will benefit under the terms of this proposal are the very men responsible for the drafting of this &ldquo;Cuts&rdquo; Bill, and now they come along at the last moment, when the Bill is going to be put into operation, with this plausible appeal for themselves.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister deny any knowledge of a meeting held in Jury's Hotel at which some of the most prominent civil servants in the State were present?  Did he hear anything about that?  I think he is not as ignorant of these matters as he pretends when he puts forward a proposal of this kind without any explanation of his action.  If the postal officials called a meeting for a purpose of this kind, they would be sent to Mountjoy, or some such place, under cover of some Public Safety Act; but gentlemen lucky enough to be in receipt of £1,000 or £1,500 a year can hold their meetings in Jury's Hotel without molestation.  They can make representations &mdash; backdoor representations if you like&mdash;to the Minister, and &ldquo;pull his leg&rdquo; to the <Col N="1206" /> extent to which it has been pulled in this case.  The Minister pretended when he was speaking that he read from a document.  Will the Minister produce any one document to show that in any one case there has been a written agreement with any individual who is likely to benefit under the terms of this proposal?  Deputy Cosgrave has been very silent.  I am sure he could say a good deal on that.  I know Deputy Cosgrave is responsible for inviting&mdash;and the late General Collins was responsible in one or two cases&mdash; certain Irishmen to come over here, and take up service in this State, when it was first established.  I know some of them.  They held fairly important positions in Whitehall.  Give us the salaries that they were in receipt of then, and the salaries they now enjoy, and let us have the justification for this exemption proposal.  Produce a written agreement with any one of the individuals likely to benefit, and I certainly will look at the matter, so far as that one individual is concerned, in a different light, because I should not like to be a party to suggesting to any Minister that he should break any agreement entered into with a servant of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about superannuation rights.  The superannuation rights of civil servants who are going to suffer as a result of this cut are not going to be in any way interfered with. There is a clause in the Bill protecting their pension rights. That clause will give the same protection to the transferred officers likely to benefit under the terms of this proposal as it will give to the persons who will suffer reduction, whether they are clerical officers or cleaners in the Government offices.  I think this is the most indefensible proposal ever brought before this House, especially as it is brought before it by a Minister who purports to call for &ldquo;sacrifices from all&rdquo;&mdash;sacrifices from the fellows who do the donkey work, and exemption for those who enjoy fat salaries, some of whom would never have enjoyed such salaries if they had remained in the service of the British Government.  We are entitled to the information I am <Col N="1207" /> asking for as to what is the total number of people likely to benefit as a result of the proposal.</P>

I listened very attentively to Deputy Norton pushing some of that stuff down his throat by documentary evidence during the Committee Stage of this Bill.  The Minister, in fathering a proposal of this kind, should be compelled to give the House and the country some information as to the number of people affected, the salaries of the, I suppose, small number who are likely to benefit, when they were in the service of the British or any other Government, and the salaries they enjoy to-day.  We are entitled to ask for that information, and I think the Minister who is responsible for fathering this preposterous proposal should give that information to the House and to the country.</P>

I do know that this amendment <Col N="1208" /> was only one of a series moved by me on the Committee Stage.  The basis of every one of those amendments was the principle that agreements should be honourably kept.  I do not know who is affected by this amendment at all.  I cannot tell what individuals are affected.  No individual approached me directly or indirectly in connection with this amendment.  I have no idea whether the people affected are men with £1,500 a year or 1,500 pence.  I have not the remotest idea who the individuals are.  I based that amendment on one basic principle, and that is that public servants are bound to the State by an agreement which should be honourably kept both by the individual public servants and by the State.</P>

      <P>All public servants, great and small, whether they are office-cleaners, charwomen or anything else.  I based my opposition to this Bill on the broad principle that it was a breach of contract to cut the salaries of public servants, no matter who they were.  I based my opposition to the Bill in respect of every single servant of the State, whether humble or great. I make no apology for having fathered this particular amendment, even if it is accepted by the Minister as a result of a plausible speech of mine, because that plausible speech of mine was based on the broad principle that agreements had been made with certain individuals for valuable consideration. I am speaking from recollection, but I think that was the phrase I used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>An agreement was made for valuable consideration.  They gave up something they had on a definite undertaking by Ministers of this country, and that agreement should be honoured.  There was no difference between that amendment and every other amendment I moved. They were all based on the broad principle that agreements with public servants, even though those agreements are not enforceable in court, should be honoured.  This agreement was made with some set of public servants, the <Col N="1209" /> number or identity of whom I do not know.  Because of that principle I fathered that amendment, and I am very glad that the Minister has accepted it.  I only regret that he has not widened his generosity and broadened his acceptance of that great principle of honouring agreements entered into.</P>
      <P>I pointed out again and again during the discussion on the &ldquo;Cuts&rdquo; Bill that private individuals are bound to honour their contracts, and if they do not honour them they can be brought into court.  I saw no reason and still see no reason why the State, which is supposed to be a model employer, should not keep its promises to its humblest servant.  I do think that the prerogative which is at the disposal of the State should not be used against any individual servant of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand Deputy Davin's heat.  Quite obviously some person has misinformed him as to the genesis of this amendment. This amendment was not inspired by any person in the Department of Finance.  It was a matter which had been agitating my mind for a considerable time, an agitation which was brought to a focus during a debate which took place here on Deputy Costello's amendment.  I had to come to a decision as to whether, on the general principles which were put up to me by my advisers in the Department, I should not exempt those people who had entered into special agreements with the State, or whether I should exempt them, as I felt I ought to, in view of at least one specific agreement which was brought to my notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I decided that I was bound, beyond any possibility of alteration or recall, <Col N="1210" /> by the signature of my predecessor, in regard to at least one man.  Whether there are others I do not know.  My acceptance of the principle has been based upon one case which was brought to my notice.  It was the case of a person who, long after 1923, was in the service of another Government. He had rendered very special services here, services of such a sort that it was felt he ought to be continued in this position, because there was nobody else who could be got to carry out the duties of that office.  In those particular circumstances, when he was asked to retire from the service of another country to take up service here, he specifically raised three points; first of all, as to his permanency; secondly, as to the salary that would be paid to him; and thirdly, as to his superannuation rights.</P>
    <P>Let me quote the words of the then Minister for Finance:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the event of your accepting the offer of appointment, I feel that you are entitled to be assured as to your future in the service, and on all the above points I am prepared to give you the fullest assurances.  In doing so, I have recognised that a surrender of your post under the British Government at this stage of your service is a serious step for you to contemplate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position was this, that this particular individual was quite clearly demarcated from every individual in the public service of the Saorstát, because when they joined the public service or, when they elected to continue in the service of this Government under Article X, they elected to endure with us all the vicissitudes that might befall this State and the people of this State. If economic conditions improved here they would secure the benefit of them. If economic conditions disimproved, they would have to endure the consequences of that disimprovement, but this person, by agreement with my predecessor, was put in this position, that he would continue to enjoy, no matter what the circumstances, the security and the emoluments which he had in another service.  He was given that <Col N="1211" /> assurance because it was felt his special experience was essential.</P>
    <P>I am placed in regard to that man in this situation, that it is possible that this Government may be looking for the service of experts and may, possibly, have to take them from the service of other Governments.  I cannot allow it to go forth that any undertaking which I give in regard to permanency, salary, or any other conditions or service, is one which would not be honoured by my successor.  Accordingly, no matter what Deputy Davin may say, I have felt bound to come to the Dáil in a very difficult situation and ask them to accept that position with me also.  The position might have been easier if I were able to say to the individual concerned: &ldquo;Well, if you remained in the service of the other Government, your emoluments would be reduced by so much.&rdquo;  But that condition does not obtain.  If he had remained in the service of the other Government, his position would be as good and not any worse than it is to-day with us.</P>
    <P>As to the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave about another high officer of State, I say his position is rather different.  He left a private occupation to enter the service of Saorstát Eireann for the first time.  If he had remained pursuing his occupation as a private individual, he would have been subject to the ups and downs which attend private individuals in their occupations.  He would not have the same security in regard to salary and remuneration.  Accordingly, I think his case was very different from the case of the person who would have remained in a sheltered occupation on the other side.  He would have that security and those assurances which normally are not enjoyed by people who have to earn their living as ordinary private citizens.  Apart altogether from that, I am happy to say that that gentleman and every other person whom I have consulted in regard to the first part of the Seanad amendment, has strongly advised me not to accept it.  In accordance with that advice, the new form of amendment, the amendment which I now put <Col N="1212" /> to the House, has been drafted so as to exclude the particular kind of case which Deputy Cosgrave has in mind and the particular individual to whom he referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister to give the House any reason why he is turning down the first part of the Seanad amendment, paragraph (a)?  I should like to know if he can give the House some general reasons for so doing.  I know I am not allowed to make a second speech but I wish to make this one point.  There are in the service of the State, to my own personal knowledge, individuals who gave up their occupations not for the purpose of getting permanent employment in the State service but in order to give patriotic service to this State.  They actually sacrificed their income and their prospects in order to take up particular jobs in the public service. I suggest that the Minister might consider that class of case because I am perfectly certain that in the case of the present Government it will have, if it has not done so already, to call on specific individuals to make sacrifices and to come into the public service as a patriotic duty and not as a matter of getting jobs for themselves.</P>

Apart from the number of people who may benefit&mdash;and I do not know the individuals who are likely to benefit&mdash;as the result of the acceptance of this proposal, I wish to ask the Minister a straight question.  He is basing his case for this proposal on the peculiar circumstances of one individual.  I do not know from Adam who he is and I care less but I want to know from the Minister what was the salary of the individual concerned when he was invited to take up office in this State, what is his salary to-day and whether &mdash;this is a very important point&mdash;the cuts already put into operation in the case of all public servants covered by this Bill, have been applied in the case of the gentleman concerned?</P>

      <P>On the question which Deputy Costello raised, personal difficulties have prevented me accepting the proposal in paragraph (a) in the first place.  In addition to that, I am not able to accept the principle that a person who entered the service some years ago and who derived from his then occupation an income not less than he agreed to accept in respect of such appointment, can be altogether set free from the obligation to accept with the general body of the nation the consequences of a decline in economic conditions here.  If he had remained in that private occupation it is possible his income might have declined very much more than it will as a result of this Bill.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, it is at any rate, proper that when the general income declines the income of a private individual will decline with it.  That is the position in which, I think, those who would be affected by paragraph (a) of the amendment are placed.  Their position, since their advent to the service, even under this Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill would not be any worse, comparatively speaking, than it would have been in private life. Accordingly, I am not able, for that reason, to accept it because I think that would be directly contrary to the general principle of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular case under discussion at the moment is a case in which a man was earning, approximately, £2,000 a year and could have increased that for many years afterwards and would be able to earn that much outside.  He came in here. His salary was not fixed at the time. He was not one who agreed with the national movement, but his patriotism was beyond doubt.  He gave up what was a very remunerative occupation outside to do what he believed was his duty and which I do not believe anybody else outside could do.  For a long period his salary was not fixed.  He did not mind that.  He gave his services to the State and could have left it much to his own advantage and, if he had left the service of this State, he would now have, I suppose, around about twice the amount he was getting from the State during the last ten years. This is a peculiar case and one which, I suppose, Deputy Davin would never understand.  It must be understood that some of those men had to be bid <Col N="1215" /> for.  For some of them, I suppose, we did not bid high enough.  There was one of them whom we lost.  He is now in one of the highest positions in Great Britain and I am not sure that there have not been efforts made to get him back.  When you succeed in getting one of these men into your service, there is a considerable&mdash;I will not say condescension but rather a desire to come here.  Quite a number of them, possibly, would be prepared to take a much less sum than they could earn outside to come here.  I do not think any of them have had an increase of salary from the time they were bid for. I think these men should get the same consideration as the man who could have earned twice as much and the other man I mentioned about whom the Minister said that he is properly dealt with.  That man is not working for money purely and simply.  He did not enter into the national movement for money and his intention in coming here was to do something for the country. In the future, when we require such men, anyone of their advisers would say: &ldquo;Do you know about this particular &lsquo;Cuts&rsquo; Bill?&rdquo;  It may hinder this State from getting useful services from such men who might render wonderful value to the State.  They are not huge salaries and there is a field for that class of person in the British Civil Service which is theirs almost for the asking.  The top line is almost always a much thinner line than those beneath and if you want to get tip-top men they are worth paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance proposed a sort of guiding principle which seems to me to be basically inaccurate.  He talked about people who came here on certain terms having given up service outside and, at a given moment, he arbitrarily comes along and says that, as people's incomes outside have shown a marked drop&mdash;since his Government have come into power, if I might say so&mdash;he is justified in saying that these men's income would have shown the same drop and that, therefore, he is justified in cutting their salaries.  If a man accepted service in the State at a given figure and came along to the Minister and <Col N="1216" /> proved to the Minister that, if he had remained in his own business, he would now be getting four times as much as he got before, the Minister would say: &ldquo;You came in here and agreed to certain terms; you might have done better outside, but you have got to abide by the decision you made then.&rdquo; The Minister, however, will not accept that for himself.  In effect, he says that if the man can prove that he must get no more, but if it is conceivable that the man might have got less, then the Minister is justified in cutting his salary.  I will not say that that is as immoral a proposition as the one that was propounded by Deputy Davin which, I may say, is typical of Deputy Davin.  According to Deputy Davin's proposition, if the person is sufficiently cute to get you to put the agreement in writing you will have to abide by it, but if you can persuade him to accept your word of honour then says Deputy Davin: &ldquo;Here is a splendid opportunity of &lsquo;bilking&rsquo; this man; he cannot produce anything in writing, and we have got him and now can swindle him.&rdquo;  The Minister's proposal is not quite as bad as that, but it is certainly basically unsound.  A man enters into a contract which is more or less equivalent to circumstances outside at the time.  If the outside circumstances improve, well and good, and if they disimprove, the Minister is not bound.  As I say, it is not so scandalously immoral as Deputy Davin's proposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment which I think the Government would be very well advised to reconsider.  I <Col N="1221" /> wonder whether they have given due consideration to the proposal at all.</P>
      <P>This measure is one much on the lines of the Military Service (Pensions) Act, 1924.  On its introduction it was explained that the purpose was to pay compensation for the interruption of the careers of persons who had been engaged in the national movement. The interruptions took place at a time when they were in a position to start life in any of the professions, in education, business or any other calling.  In those cases there was a small number of years from 1916 to 1923, about 7 years affected.  In this case, although the Act will run on and affect other people, an additional ten years of a man's life was taken.  Every member of the Ministry will admit that it is a very serious proposition for a man in any occupation, to take ten or 16 of the best years of his life, and then to have an amendment like this introduced:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Executive Council may at any time by order revoke or suspend for such time as they think proper any pension granted under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an unusual power.  It is possible that we may hear some of the nonsense that was spoken when there was a motion before the House in connection with this particular officer, that the late Administration had put it in the Act that an officer was removable at the will and pleasure of the Executive Council, and that he was not in a position different from that of any other civil servant.  What is the opinion of the Ministry as regards the term of office, or the conditions that ought to have been implied?  Did they think that when the Executive Council was introducing the Gárda Síochána Bill of 1924, they ought to have put in a clause that it was only with the concurrence of both Houses of Parliament, and by resolution, that such alterations in the occupation of this office ought to have been made? I never heard of such a proposal as is contained in the amendment, in any Pensions Act.  I do not know what is the meaning of it.  If we are to interpret what we heard on Tuesday night from the President of the <Col N="1222" /> Executive Council, I should say that this order will be made very shortly. I do not think it is a wise power for an Executive Council to possess.  No reason need be given.  The Executive Council may make an order &ldquo;at any time they think proper.&rdquo;  There is not even that clause in respect of civil servants who hold office at the will and pleasure of the Executive Council who, when they think proper, may dismiss them.  That is not done.  In the case of any official who is dismissed there is a series of reports, and the file is sent to the Department of Finance with a recommendation by the Minister.  The various charges against the official are set out, and even after submission to the Department of Finance, there is examination.</P>
    <P>There is no machinery here for doing that.  The Executive Council has not the Departmental file regarding the activities of every person in receipt of a pension from the State.  I presume they will act, if they act at all, in the normal course of events.  When the file goes from the Department of Justice it would be dealt with by the police department.  That connotes some activity which would be hostile to the State.  Let us understand what is meant by hostile to the State.  If one were to venture an interpretation of that term by the present Ministry it would be, hostile to the present political Government of the State.  I do not know if that is intended.  In a case of this sort where there is an implied admission of compensation for interruption of a man's life, why not have it a gracious act, and give it in accordance with the terms which govern any other allowance, compensation, pension, or whatever it is called?  Why have this one difference?  Is it because of the individual? Remember that the authority which is exercised in the State, and respect for that authority, depends, to some extent, on the respect that that authority has for authority.  In a case such as this, a person who held very high office in this State, who has the confidence of very large numbers of persons in the State, and who occupies a very fine niche in the whole national traditions of the State, there ought not to be an attempt to belittle an officer <Col N="1223" /> of that sort by such an amendment as this.  I should have liked to have heard the Minister explain what reasons actuated the Executive Council to introduce such an amendment on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  What was it they wished to guard against? What was wrong when they departed from the customary procedure in the giving of pensions?  I oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is generally understood that the Bill now under consideration is one to provide a pension for one man, and possibly for some other person who may succeed him later on, and who may be treated &mdash;as I hope no one will be treated&mdash; in the same way.  I am informed that the man concerned will be entitled right away to receive a pension of £180 under the Military Service (Pensions) Act.  If I am wrong the Minister can correct me.  Under that Act, a pension cannot be withdrawn or cancelled except for a conviction in court, which involves hard labour.  That is generally understood to be the only reason which can justify a Government in withdrawing a pension.  Therefore if the man concerned commits such an offence as will warrant the censure of the Government, for some trivial reason the Government may be in the position to withdraw, revoke or suspend the pension of £320 while they will not have the same power, so far as I can follow the procedure, to interfere with the pension of £180.  It is a peculiar situation, if that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be a generous act on the part of this Government, bearing in mind the circumstances under which General O'Duffy was removed, to reconsider their present attitude.  The Leader of this Party has already expressed the definite views of the Party in respect to Government action in connection with that matter.  Bearing the whole situation in mind and having in mind, as I hope the Government have, the idea of attaining national unity in the country, I think they would be well advised to reconsider their attitude towards this amendment.  I hope the two big Parties in this House will endeavour to forget the bitter memories of the <Col N="1224" /> past.  This amendment is a peculiar one to find in any Pensions Act.  I do not think the circumstances of the time, or the atmosphere in which we have been living for the last couple of weeks, would suggest to any sensible public man that this is the right moment to bring in an amendment of this kind.</P>
    <P>I know several supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party in my constituency who did not agree with the Government action at the time General O'Duffy was removed.  I certainly disagreed with that action very much because his removal, at that time, might suggest to the minds of certain people that he was associated with another incident.  It was quite clearly proved afterwards that he had nothing whatever to do with it.  There is certainly a feeling of demoralisation in the minds of a great number of people, and it has been largely brought about by the discussions that have been taking place in this House since the last general election.  There have been attempts, on several occasions, by certain people&mdash;I am glad to say only a very small number&mdash;in this House to rehearse the history of the Civil War period.  It is about time the Government set a good example. They are the people who can set a good example.  They should nedeavour to let the memories of that period rest somewhere outside this House.  Let them give a good example to the people outside and give them a lead to forget all these things.</P>
    <P>It would help considerably in that direction if the Government would reconsider their attitude in relation to this amendment.  There is a feeling that the Government are anxious to take a power which was not secured by their predecessors in office to revoke, without the authority of the House, or cancel a pension given to a man for services rendered.  If General O'Duffy is entitled to a pension under the terms of this Bill, give it to him with good grace and do not interfere with it until such a time as General O'Duffy brings himself within the penalties of the law.  If he does anything like that, then he should be treated the same as every other citizen in the State would be treated in similar circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge) Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of Commissioner of the Guards, I think it will be admitted, is a rather unique position.  He is placed at the head of the police force, where he is in receipt of confidential information from all over the country and, therefore, he occupies a very responsible position.  Whether that was what was in the minds of the late Executive, when they repeatedly made provisions that he could be removed from office at any time, I do not know.  They are not inserted in any Act dealing with any other official of the State.  I quoted them here already on the debate raised by the Opposition when the motion about General O'Duffy was before the House.  Under the Gárda Síochána (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1923, Section 3, provision was made that the Commissioner could be removed by the Executive Council at any time.  Under the Gárda Síochána Act of 1924, Section 2, a similar provision was made, and under the Police Forces (Amalgamation) Act, 1925, Section 6, there was a similar provision.</P>
      <P>Now, let us bear in mind that General O'Duffy, although this Bill does not deal with him in particular, did represent to the Ministry of Justice in the late Executive the insecurity of the position, and did make representations to that Ministry to have his position clarified and put on a basis, where he would be entitled to pension rights.  I do not know why that was refused.  There is nothing to indicate it was refused except that it was not acted upon at that time.  It has been stated here that this is something new. The amendment that has been put before the House is, in effect, the same as is embodied in the Military Service Pensions Act, 1925.  Section 2 of that Act sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this section, the Executive Council may at any time by order revoke for reasons stated in such order any pension granted under the Principal Act whether before or after the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  No such pension shall be revoked in consequence of any act committed prior to the passing of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> (3)  No such pension shall be so revoked unless or until the reasons for such proposed revocation have been communicated in writing to the person in receipt of the pension and such person has been given a reasonable opportunity of making to the Executive Council such explanation, answer, or other case as he may think proper in relation to such proposed revocation or the reasons therefor.</P>
    <P>The only difference between the amendment that is tabled and Section 2 of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1925, is that under the Military Service Pensions Act the person whom the Executive Council sought to deprive of his pension would be given an opportunity of stating his reasons why he should not be refused a pension. There is no provision whatever that binds the Executive Council to accept that or to act upon it.  The reasons must be stated and an explanation given.  There is nothing, however, to bind the Executive Council to accept those reasons as being satisfactory, so that it can be said there was absolute power in the Executive Council to refuse a pension under the 1925 Act. That is the reason it is being inserted here.  We think it advisable in this particular position that such a power should be asked for and we are asking for that power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is impossible for me to describe the Minister's speech in any other terms than as exceedingly disingenuous.  Let us consider with what we are dealing. We are dealing with a pension relating to an officer of the Civic Guards.  There has been a departure from the general principles governing pensions awarded to officers, sergeants and men of the Civic Guards.  Why that departure? What is the explanation?  Why should one particular Civic Guard pension be on a different footing from every other Civic Guard pension?  The Minister has not attempted, in the slightest way, to give any explanation of that.  He talked about the Commissioner having a great deal of secret information at his disposal.  No doubt he has, but so has every single officer in the Guards. There is not an officer in a high place <Col N="1227" /> in the Guards who does not get a great deal of secret information in the ordinary discharge of his duties.  Yet all those officers are entitled to pensions on ordinary terms.</P>
      <P>This particular pension, however, is going to be given with this utterly unprecedented clause in it, unprecedented not merely in the Gárda Síochána code, but unprecedented in any Statute upon our books.  I would be justified in feeling perfectly satisfied, and I think the House would be justified in feeling perfectly satisfied that there is some reason which the Minister has not given to the House why there is a departure from the Gárda Síochána code in this particular respect.  I think the House is perfectly satisfied that that in itself requires an explanation.  The effort made to show that in a completely different code there is a statute which has a similar provision has broken down absolutely. If there were 100 statutes, with 100 similar provisions, and yet there was no such provision in the Gárda Síochána code, why there should be a departure from that code would require an explanation.</P>
      <P>The Minister refers to the Military Pensions Act of 1925 and he proceeds to read a section which puts his case completely out of court, because he has to admit that there a pension cannot be taken away until reasons are stated for so doing and an opportunity given for an explanation.  There is no necessity for stating any reasons here&mdash;that is a tremendous departure&mdash;and there is no opportunity of asking for, or getting, an explanation before the pension given under this statute is taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a passage of a well-known English writer: &ldquo;Condemn no man unheard is a rule of natural justice seldom violated in Turkey.&rdquo;  But here you have got an Executive Council who can award a pension one day and take it away the next without giving any reason or any sign for so doing, and without giving a man any opportunity of making an explanation of any conduct of his which they may think to be blameworthy.  No opportunity is to be given.  The Minister says that <Col N="1228" /> the taking away of a pension as it is prescribed in the Military Service Pensions Act of 1925, where the reasons for so doing must be stated, where explanations must be offered, is exactly the same thing as taking it away where no reason may be given, and where no opportunity of making an explanation is afforded.  Does the Minister think that with that parallel he will convince the House?  He says there is nothing to bind the Executive Council to accept the explanation.  Of course there is not.  The Executive Council before it takes away anybody's pension under the Military Service Pensions Act has to weigh up the man.  Of course they are not bound by any explanation, but they are bound as honourable men, bound in discharge of their public duties to give due weight to every single thing that is contained in the explanation, and if the explanation is satisfactory then they are bound in discharge of their public duty not to take away the pension.</P>
    <P>I again say that there is not the slightest precedent there in that statute for this particular amendment which is before the House.  Even if there were a precedent for it in that or in any other statute it would not be a justification for the departure from the ordinary principles of pensions for the ordinary member of the Gárda Síochána.  I stated here the other night that the Minister was not master of the situation.  The Minister cannot do what he likes.  At least I give the Minister credit for believing that this particular section here is a horrible section.  This particular power given under this amendment is a horrible power.  I give the Minister credit for believing that.  But I saw posters up around Dublin, and when I saw those posters stating that pensions must not be given under this Bill I was not at all surprised to discover that this amendment was brought in to defeat the object of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We got a definite pledge here from the President of the Executive Council that a pension would be awarded to General O'Duffy.  Everybody in the House understood, and I believe at the time the President himself meant to convey, that that was going to be the <Col N="1229" /> ordinary pension given upon ordinary Gárda Síochána terms.  We now discover that it is not.  There is not a single person in this House who is not satisfied that a pension is going to be given to-day and that it is going to be swept away in an infinitesimally short period of time after the time at which it is granted.  In other words, we have a Bill brought in here and afterwards an amendment to it which makes it perfectly plain that faith is being broken with this House.  Yes, faith is being flagrantly broken with this House.</P>
    <P>There was the pledge there that the pension was to be given to an officer who had been removed from his post without any cause whatsoever.  That pledge is going to be kept in the letter, but it is not going to be kept in the spirit.  What is the sense of saying: &ldquo;Oh!  yes, we gave you a pension for a week or a month, and that is what we meant when we said that a pension was going to be given.&rdquo;  This is a breach of faith with the House and a gross breach of faith at that.  But I do wish that the Minister now, at any rate, on this one particular occasion, would stir himself up and stand against any opposition that there may be to his acting straightforwardly towards the House in this matter.  A pledge to the House was solemnly given here by the President of the Executive Council. The House expects that that pledge will be honoured, and I hope that is the course which the Minister will pursue&mdash;the honouring of that pledge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no attempt to break the pledge in this matter.  All through the Executive Council has acted in a perfectly straight and, I submit, in a perfectly honourable way so far as General O'Duffy is concerned.  When he was removed from his post he was offered an alternative post at the same salary. He was removed from his post under one of the statutes passed by the previous Administration.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney tries to suggest that in bringing in this Bill we should follow the Gárda code as it refers to other sections of the service.  But there is no precedent for giving a pension to a Commissioner of the Gárda in the <Col N="1230" /> circumstances under which General O'Duffy left the service.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, when he was in office, had acted on the wishes and advice offered now to the Dáil and had brought in a Bill in the terms that he now suggests it should be brought in, this position would not have arisen.  When we want a precedent we will go to the precedent established by the previous Administration in dealing with pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act. Because it is not stated, the Deputy suggests that the Executive Council is going to suspend a pension or revoke a pension for no reason.  Now, if action is taken by the Executive Council, the matter can be raised in this House, reasons got and so on. The fact that it was provided in the Military Service Pensions Act that reasons would be given in writing, and that an explanation would be sought, did not bind the Executive Council to act on that explanation.  This amendment here has the same effect as that Section 2 of the Military Service Pensions Act&mdash;absolutely the same effect in its result.  That he is asked to give an explanation of a reason stated to him in writing&mdash;what effect has it? The Executive Council need not act upon it.  Will not the Executive Council, before they can revoke or suspend a pension, have reasons for doing so; have to give to the House reasons if it is raised afterwards?  It is on all-fours&mdash;it is the only precedent we have and we followed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much shocked by two references in the Minister's speeches, one in his previous speech in which he said the Executive Council were not bound to act on any representation that the person affected would make to them.  I do not know whether he intended that in its full implication or not.  But, if he did, it is a most unfortunate observation to have allowed to pass.  The Ministry admits that this officer was removed from office for no reason other than <Col N="1231" /> their will and pleasure.  There was no charge, no complaint, no dereliction of duty, nothing of the kind.  In other words, he went out with high character even from those who disagreed with him.  The second thing I object to is that the Minister, and even a more exalted person than the Minister, stand up here and point to the fact that General O'Duffy was offered two posts.  I suppose the Minister has often heard the American's description of an honest man&mdash;that he is bought and he stays bought.  Here is a man that cannot be bought, at any rate.  Here is a man who will not take an office in this State, who has no interest in money.  He wants it as well as anybody else for his livelihood, but the pursuit of money is not his sole object.  That is the Executive Council mind I am afraid with regard to officials.</P>

I do not know that in the experience of any Government anywhere, with such traditions as we are hoping to have here, such a case as this has ever occurred.  He is held up to the public view as a man who would not accept a post at so many hundred pounds per annum.  If that is the mind of the Executive Council, it is a small mind and the sooner they get rid of it the better.  Then we had the other explanation from the Minister, which I hope is not a full and complete representation of what is in his mind, that the Executive Council are not bound to accept the representations <Col N="1232" /> put before them.

      <P>I am very glad to hear it.  I certainly did not infer that.  As I have said, this from the point of view even of the most friendly critic of the Government is an unfortunate incident to have occurred because from the commencement it is not creditable to them. Their own endeavours to get out of it shows that that is so.  Here is an opportunity of doing something gracious. Will any member of the Ministry, or any member of the Party, say that if you take a man away from his ordinary pursuit or avocation in life for 16 years and then cause him dissatisfaction by the way in which you treat him, particularly a man of the ability of General O'Duffy, that he is not entitled even to a larger sum, free from any condition, than £500 per annum?  If I were arbitrating in such a case my decision would be that that man is entitled to about £10,000 compensation for his loss.  If the Ministry were not blinded by political conceit or prejudice or something of that sort, that would be their decision too.  £500 per annum, having taken 16 of the best years of his life, and putting him out now, and the only explanation that the Minister has got is that he was offered a post and he would not take it!  They have looked for precedents. This Ministry, who spent 10 or 12 years in criticising everything done by my Administration, when they want light and leading look up the precedents established during that period.  I do not think I have ever got such a compliment paid me.</P>

Because the mind that went to the consideration of them did not go according to the headline that the Minister told us of and which on reflection he stated was not really what he meant, that is, that they were empowered to stop this.  It was a mind to administer impartially and the mind which seeks to insert this particular amendment is not an impartial mind?  Why?  Because, even if they were to be placed in the difficult position we were in, when the Minister who had just come into the House was Minister for Defence in another Government, or something of that sort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What were the reasons they gave?  Seventy-six of them.  These are the reasons and no other.  If they were depending on the Labour Party at the time, they would not have done it.  They had no excuse to offer except the one&mdash;we had power to do it.  That is all.  Now they have power to revoke this pension&mdash;just power.  In their own interests I would advise them strongly to reconsider this, <Col N="1234" /> not in the heat of political turmoil, not with any prejudice towards the officer concerned, but remembering that one day they will have to give an account at the seat of judgment for all their acts.</P>

      <P>I believe that General O'Duffy had the necessary qualifications for at least one of the jobs I understand he was offered by the Government and, personally, I would very much prefer to see him in that position than the position he occupies to-day.  I listened very attentively to President de Valera's speech when he was defending the removal of General O'Duffy from the office of Chief Commissioner. In answer to a question addressed to him in the course of his speech he said, quite plainly, that if there was no other reason to give for his removal there was the fact that he had served the previous Government for ten years.  To any plain man, that meant that General O'Duffy was removed from office for political reasons.  I asked the Minister for Justice to tell me what attitude he would take up if, after being in office, he were confronted with a proposition for the removal of some officer whom he or his successor had placed in office, and if a proposal of this kind were put forward by his successor in office.  The peculiar thing that presents itself to my mind in considering this amendment before the House is, I understand&mdash;and I want to be contradicted if I am wrong&mdash;that General O'Duffy is entitled to and can get a pension of £180 a year which he was granted under the Military Pensions Act.  Is he in receipt of that pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not in receipt of it at the moment, but he would be entitled to receive it.  I think the figure is £160 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be entitled to receive that pension.  If he is lucky enough to get that pension it cannot be suspended or withdrawn from him by the Executive Council except &ldquo;for reasons stated.&rdquo;  But under this proposal he would get a further £350 a <Col N="1235" /> year or thereabouts, and that can be suspended without any reason.  That is a very peculiar position.  I think that this amendment was not fully or fairly considered before it was put down.  What was the reason for putting this amendment on the Order Paper after this Bill was introduced? I read in to-day's paper a suggestion made by General O'Duffy in a statement made by him, in addition to the many other statements he has made, that the Government were not going to grant him his pension.  I have never discussed the question of his pension with General O'Duffy but, in company with the Leader of this Party, I did endeavour to persuade him to accept the offer made to him by the Government. I am sorry he did not do that. If he had done so, he could have rendered greater service to the State in that position, having the necessary qualifications as he had for it, than he could render to the State in his present position.  Let us be generous towards a person to whom a large number of people in this country feel an injury has been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  But I do not believe, especially in the peculiar circumstances we are living in, at variance with a foreign country, that serious issues, on large matters of this kind, should be introduced, and friction created that could possibly be avoided. I hope the Minister will reconsider this matter.  I hope he will state quite emphatically whether the original intention of the Government to grant General O'Duffy a pension referred to when a motion by Deputy Cosgrave was under consideration, and subsequently, confirmed on his refusal to take on a new position offered him, has been rescinded by the same Cabinet. Is there any justification for the statement which appeared from General O'Duffy that the Government do not intend to grant him a pension?  If there is such a thing in the mind of the Ministry let them withdraw the Bill <Col N="1236" /> altogether and let us not bother wasting time in discussing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a precedent.  Will he state why this precedent is only talked about in this particular instance?  Why did not the Minister and his colleagues accept that precedent when the Pensions Bill which gave pensions to the Army of which the present Minister for Industry and Commerce was Minister for Defence was put through?  That Act is remarkable for the absence of any provision whereby these pensions can be revoked by the Executive Council.  In other words, the political friends of the Ministry are to have their pensions permanent, without any possibility of their being revoked, whereas those who are considered to be the political opponents of the Government are to be otherwise treated.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wished to refer to precedents surely there is a nearer precedent and that is the 1932 Pensions Act.  It is not necessary to go back to the Military Service Pensions Act which was introduced by the Leader of the Opposition when he was at the head of the Government in the year 1925.  I am afraid this argument about a precedent was introduced by the Minister at the last moment.  Why is not the President of the Executive Council here tonight? The day before yesterday, we had a similar example of the Minister for Justice being put up to make a case, but, then, the President came in towards the end of the debate and let the cat out of the bag.  Unfortunately the President is not here this evening. If he was we know very well, he would reveal the real reason for this amendment which is, I am afraid, really personal and political spite.  For my part, I can only say that I lost £1 over this amendment.  I made a bet that the Government, whatever their shortcomings might be, would sink their personal feelings and would act in a sportsmanlike manner in this matter.  The Minister might have thought of the precedent created by his own Government last year when they were awarding pensions to their own particular friends rather than go back to an Act of the Cosgrave Administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is of course now going through and anything we here have to say on it cannot be taken as opposing the principles involved in it but merely as sounding a note of precaution. We, who introduced sugar production to this country, and who have been working on it experimentally for a few years, introduced it, not as a hobby, but to endeavour to gain experience and, after having given a fair trial to sugar production, to see how far it would be wise to proceed on the lines on which we set out, to produce all our own requirements in sugar.  It was always realised by us, even by those outside the Government, who urged the Government of the day in 1924 and 1925 to experiment in sugar production and in the growing of beet, that money was never going to be made on the production of sugar. There were other considerations that we considered would compensate for any monetary loss in the production of the sugar beet crop.  I hope Ministers who are sponsoring this Bill have considered every aspect of the case and have rid their minds of prejudice bias, or any ulterior motives, that they have weighed all the factors, and that <Col N="1240" /> they are satisfied that the loss, which must be inevitable and which has been inevitable in every country in the world where sugar has been produced from sugar beet, can be recouped by indirect benefits from the industry.  I hope they are satisfied that on the whole the economic advantage of sugar production will be greater than the apparent loss in the book-keeping returns of the venture.  I am sure Ministers have gone well into that aspect of the matter and that they are satisfied that the economic advantage will be greater than the book-keeping loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we here, on this side, have not had perhaps the same data recently to work on as the Ministry had, we are not without certain misgivings about this plunge.  We are especially apprehensive because we have fathered this project up to the present, and we would regret very much if too much haste now might spoil all that has been done up to the present.  It is well, however, that the country should know the exact position, nationally speaking, with regard to this project.  Some Ministers, I think all of them who had a hand in the Bill in this House, have tried to mesmerise the House and perhaps the country as to the advantages that will accrue from the production of sugar, to meet our entire requirements.  All I intend to do is to put the facts on record as to the position as I see it and I shall invite Ministers to controvert them, not by any sleight-of-hand trick, but by cold argument and by solid facts.  We are going to produce another 80,000 tons under this Bill, to supplement the production of the Carlow factory and to meet our entire requirements.  The Carlow factory will, if it operates until the year 1936, when I think its agreement runs out, cost this State £400,000 a year. Assuming we were able to start next year with four similar factories to produce 20,000 tons each, we are going to incur another national deficit of £800,000 a year.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce shakes his head in disagreement.  The disagreement, I am sure, is a suggestion that my figures as regards loss are too high.  Nobody in this House would be <Col N="1241" /> more pleased to know that the figures are too high than I myself would be. I am putting the case as I can analyse it&mdash;not from any research outside this House, but according to the figures given by the Ministers opposite.  I should like, and I am sure the House would like, and it is due to the House and to the country, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will do more to reassure the House and country than shake his head in disapproval of this particular point I am making.  It is not really a point.  I do not want to make a point and I hope that, if it is construed as a point, the Minister will be able to knock it down.  The more success that will attach to this the better for us all and for the country, and if the figures I am giving err on the side of being too high, I shall be glad to have them proved to be too high and I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce will prove them to be so.  That £400,000 that we lose on the present factory in 1936 and the £800,000 that, as I see it, we are going to lose on the other factories if we start them, will mean a national loss of £1,200,000. We are going to lose £1,200,000 in the production of sugar, and I put it to the Ministers opposite that this year and for many years past, on the average, we could buy that same quantity of sugar for £1,000,000.  So, we are going to lose £200,000 a year more than the cost of the article would be and we have to produce the article as well. That is the position as regards production. The Minister's own figures are 23/- a cwt. at which we can produce it here.  The best he anticipates is 20/8 a cwt.  It is not a few thousand pounds one way or another that we are concerned with, but with the principle of the way the thing works. Assuming that we can produce it at 20/- a cwt.&mdash;and that is 8d. a cwt. less than the Minister for Finance hopes, in his brightest moment, to produce sugar at other prices that he has given for raw materials and costs here and there throughout the process&mdash;20/- a cwt., or £20 a ton, for 100,000 tons is £2,000,000.  The Minister for Finance stated, in his opening speech on the Second Reading of this measure, that <Col N="1242" /> we can buy that sugar for £10 a ton below on the quays; so, even when the large subsidy that is being given to the Carlow factory is brushed aside and we have five factories operating under this Bill producing 100,000 tons of sugar, we must look to a perpetual loss on the industry of £1,000,000 a year.  These are the figures supplied by the Minister for Finance.  I am not saying that, because of that, the Bill should not go on, or should not be enacted, and that the factories should not be set up.  I am just putting it as I see it and the responsibility of securing, notwithstanding those figures, an economic advantage to the country will certainly rest with the Government and, I dare say, more particularly with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I certainly pay a tribute to his courage in facing that and I hope he will be successful.</P>
    <P>As regards prices of beet, the Minister fixed 35/- a ton as the highwater mark to pay for beet.  He said that if the farmers will not accept that price then the whole scheme falls.  I think I am quoting him substantially correctly when I say that.  I mentioned here before the working of a German factory at which a guinea, or a decimal over 21/- a ton, was given for beet, and sugar was produced in that factory at an all-in-cost of 8/6 a cwt.  I should like the Minister to justify the allotment of prices he is making to the producer of beet and to the refinery in the light of those German figures. In Germany, at a guinea a ton for beet, it meant that the producer of beet got at the rate, roughly, of 3/6 per cwt. of sugar, and it meant that the refinery got 5/- a cwt. to produce the sugar. So that, the cost was 8/6 a cwt.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear it. You say, producing sugar at an all-in-cost of 8/6 a cwt?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the figure as I read it.  Taking it on that basis, I do not know how the Minister can justify a highwater mark figure of 35/- a ton for beet here with the threat that that must be accepted or there will be no factory, and, of course, the natural corollary of that would mean that the present factory in 1936, when it arrives, would shut down also.  At 35/- a ton the price, roughly, that the grower gets here is 6/- per cwt. of sugar produced. The Minister will accept that I think, as a rough calculation.  In his first expectation, according to the Minister for Finance, the cost of sugar will be 23/- per cwt., so that the allocation of prices that is made in this Bill would work out this way&mdash;6/- per cwt. of sugar to the grower and 17/- per cwt. of sugar to the manufacturer.  In the German factory it is 3/6 per cwt. of sugar to the grower and 5/- to the manufacturer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking of that, but I am talking of the costs of production. I hope the Minister will be able to controvert the statements I have made.  I would be glad to find that I was in the wrong.  According to the price of beet in Germany, and the allocation of prices, the farmer here should be getting about £3 a ton for his beet.  The Minister said that he cannot exceed in this Bill 35/- a ton for beet.  If the figures that I have quoted are found to be substantially correct, then I think that a lot could be clipped off the manufacturer here before we would be anywhere near the allocations in the case of the German factory.  Now, supposing that the Minister when increasing the production costs here could clip 1/- per cwt. off the manufacturer of sugar and add it to the price of beet&mdash;after all <Col N="1244" /> 1/- in 17/- is not very much considering the other allocations that I have given&mdash;it would be adding 6/- a ton to the raw sugar beet, and it would be increasing rather than reducing the price of beet at present.  I have no connection with the Beet Growers' Association, and I do not know how they arrived at this figure, but I read in the newspapers a statement it published that the proposal of 35/- a ton here, with other considerations, meant a reduction in price of 9/-, that is to say, that they were really going to get 30/- a ton.  I do not know how they arrived at that figure, but I would ask the Minister to comment on it.  It is just a warning on the road in this very big undertaking that he is proceeding with, and a dangerous one. I did not notice anything in the Bill allowing for an extra price for beet of over 17½ per cent. sugar content.  In the case of the Carlow factory, I understand the present arrangement is that it gives 2/6 for every 1 per cent. over 17½ per cent.  I think that 2/6 per 1 per cent. is hardly sufficient, but even if the Minister could not see his way to give more than 35/- per ton over the standard 17½ per cent., perhaps he could see his way to give 3/- or 4/- per 1 per cent. over the 17½ per cent. so as to encourage the production of a high-grade beet.  I hope that the Minister will deal with these points. For the sake of a better word, I hope that he will be able to knock down the points I have made, because it is in the national interest that he would be right and I would be wrong on the points I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Belton will be glad to hear that the national interests are going to be served by this proposal and that the points he made, so far as he made any points in the course of his speech, are ones that can be easily knocked down.  He talked about a compensating loss.  He referred to some entity, whatever it may have been, as a compensating loss.  I know of no loss that carries compensation.  Then the Deputy went on to say that the company can recoup this national loss of £1,200,000.  I gather that he wished <Col N="1245" /> the House and the country to assume from that that the net effect of the beet scheme in the national economy will be that the community is going to lose £1,200,000.</P>

      <P>On a point of correction. What I said was that in book-keeping it will be a loss to the country of £1,200,000, but I recognise that there are economic compensating advantages, and it is for the Ministers who have sources of information that people outside the Ministry have not to weigh up whether the compensating advantages are worth the losses shown in the book-keeping loss.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy so dull of apprehension that he does not see that he is now after abandoning, in the statement he made in his interruption, the ground which he took up in the opening part of his speech?  He now admits that there is not going to be any loss, and there is not going to be any loss to the community as a result of the extension of the sugar beet industry in this country.  The Deputy said that in the endeavour to bolster up a case for this proposal, there was going to be a national loss of £1,200,000, and he went on to say that we were going to buy the same quantity of sugar as we proposed to make in the new factory for the sum of £1,000,000, and that it was going to cost us, he said, something between 20/- and 23/- to manufacture that sugar.  Since the Deputy has mentioned the figure of 23/-&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>The Minister did not use that figure.  The figure of 21/3 was used, and not 23/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not matter very much for the purpose of argument whether it is 20/- or 23/-.  For the purpose of making a calculation it would be more convenient if we took 20/- a ton.  At the present moment the cost of producing 80,000 tons of sugar at £20 a ton would be £1,600,000.  That is what it will cost the factories to produce 80,000 tons. At present we import 80,000 tons of sugar which the Deputy says we could buy for £1,000,000.  The first question <Col N="1246" /> that arises is, who would we buy it from?  From an outsider.  In buying from an outsider we are to give him £1,000,000 either in goods or in cash, which is taken out of the pockets of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of argument, I am not going to contest Deputy Belton's statement that we could buy 80,000 tons of sugar for £1,000,000.  For the purpose of argument, I am not going to contest the Deputy's statement, that it would cost us approximately 20/- a cwt., or £1,600,000, to produce that sugar in the factories.  But that is the cost to the factories; not the cost to the community, which is quite a different thing.  The Deputy will see that it is a different thing, if he considers where the £1,600,000 would go.  About 59 per cent. will go to the farmers and growers, representing £930,000, almost as much as would go out of the pockets of Irish farmers if they were to continue to buy beet sugar made very largely from beet grown in other countries.  About 21 per cent. of the balance, £330,000 would go to the factory workers and the suppliers of raw materials, such as lime, bags and possibly coal.  With the exception of about £80,000, which would go out of this country for coal, the whole of the £330,000, or a net sum of £250,000 would be distributed amongst Irish <Col N="1247" /> workers in one form or another, either amongst those employed directly in the factories, or indirectly, in providing bags, sacking and the limestone necessary for manufacturing purposes. There would be expended on rates and insurance approximately 5 per cent., or £80,000, every penny of which will remain in this country.  Of the balance there is left about £260,000 for depreciation, capital charges, contingency and other expenses.  That makes up £1,600,000.</P>
      <P>When dealing with this aspect of the question in my speech on the Second Reading, I pointed out that if we assumed our additional imports of sugar could be bought for £800,000, and if we assumed that in the construction of the factories we shall have to spend £1,000,000 on foreign-made machinery, and have to continue to buy all the coal required for the purposes of the factories, our total export of capital or cash for these purposes would be £200,000.  Subtracting that £200,000, and the £800,000 which we should have to pay if we were to continue to import sugar from abroad, we get a net sum of £600,000, which represents the real, true economic advantage to this country of expenditure on the sugar beet industry.</P>

As to the terms on which beet can be purchased, that is a matter for negotiation between the factories and the growers.  The factories are there and I am sure they will get beet at prices which will be satisfactory to the growers.  In that connection, I would like the Deputy to remember that the principal argument on which the Opposition, in the earlier stages of the Bill, founded their criticism of the <Col N="1248" /> Government's proposals, was that it was going to increase the price of sugar to the consumers.</P>

      <P>A white elephant if it is going to cost £400,000 yearly, after having spent £3,000,000 upon it.  We were told by Deputy Hogan, Deputy Belton's leader, the former Minister for Agriculture in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government&mdash;the Minister for Grass, as Deputy Belton used to refer to him&mdash;that we were paying too much.  The Carlow sugar beet factory would certainly be a white elephant if, after spending £3,000,000 on it, the only result was to prove conclusively that it was impracticable and folly to extend the sugar beet industry here. Then it would have been a white elephant.  We are trying to convert that factory from being a luxury, a hobby and a toy into being something useful.  The elephant under our control has become piebald, and when this <Col N="1249" /> Bill becomes law, when the new company comes into being, and the sugar beet industry is extending, then that elephant will be paying for its keep, and justifying its existence, which it has not done up to the present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The total additional cost to the Exchequer of this country, or to the community, of the extensions which are contemplated under the Bill will be very much less than the Deputy has suggested.  He said that the Carlow sugar beet factory had cost £400,000 yearly.  The Deputy is not far wrong in his figures.  It is not £400,000, but it is quite close to that. If we were to extend, as is contemplated in this Bill, and if the extension was going to cost £400,000 per factory, the Deputy would be quite right if he said that these three new factories are going to cost £1,200,000 and that adding that to the £400,000 the Carlow factory is costing, the total cost to the community would be £1,600,000.  But the proposals are not going to cost the community anything like that.</P>
      <P>It has already been indicated to the Deputy and the House that when the Bill becomes law and the company is formed the protective duty which sugar will bear will be from ½d. to ¾d. a pound.  It may not.  If things go well, and if Deputies only support the Government in its external policy and we win through this year or next year, there may not be any increase in the present price of sugar and, therefore, as compared with the present position, the extension of this factory will not cost the consumers that additional ½d. or ¾d. per pound.  If that additional sum is necessary the additional cost to the consumer for the three factories, plus the Carlow factory, will be less than twice what the Carlow factory is at present costing.  For that expenditure, instead of supplying only one-fifth of our needs in sugar, we shall be supplying the whole of our requirements.</P>

      <P>Not at all&mdash;thanks to the business acumen of the present Government.  I would like to deal with the Deputy's statement that the manufacturers are going to get too much out of this.  At the present time the Carlow factory is the most efficient in Europe.  The factory costs, in this most efficient factory, are very much higher indeed than the figure of 5/- per cwt. which the Deputy mentioned.  I am sure if I put that to any experienced sugar manufacturer, or any authority that the Deputy can produce, and if I were to ask him: &ldquo;Could you make sugar from ordinary farm grown beet at 5/- a cwt?&rdquo;  he would say that the proper place for the person who would put that question to him was Bedlam.  As a matter of fact, in most countries the cost of manufacture is almost four times that.</P>
      <P>Supposing we are giving the manufacturers too much, as the Deputy says, how does he want us to reduce production costs?  The efficiency of the machine is not determined by us; the efficiency of the management may, to some extent, be determined by us.  We will get the most efficient manager procurable and we may assume that so far as the factory processes are concerned there will be no avoidable waste.  Having the most efficient management and machines, the next head under which we may look for some reduction in the cost of production is under the head of wages and salary.  Is it the Deputy's contention that the wages paid to the factory workers must be reduced in order that we may pay more for the beet?  The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  His Party has criticised this Bill on the ground that when it goes through we are going to increase the price of sugar.  Does the Deputy want that?</P>
