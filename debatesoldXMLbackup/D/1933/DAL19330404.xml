    <Title>Road Transport Bill, 1933&mdash;Committee.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment 46.</P>
    <P>Before section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The wages paid by the holder of any merchandise licence to persons employed by him in the operation of his business of merchandise road transport and the conditions of their employment shall not be less favourable to them than the wages and conditions generally recognised by trade unions and employers as the wages and conditions applicable to employees in the business of merchandise road transport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2048" /> (2)  Any trade union representative of persons engaged in merchandise road transport may make representations to the Minister to the effect that the wages paid to, or the conditions of employment of, any persons employed by the holder of any merchandise licence are not in accordance with the requirements of the preceding sub-section, and the Minister shall, after a review of the facts, take such action thereon as he may deem appropriate, including the revocation of such merchandise licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that if we are going to have some kind of State control and regulation in the matter of road transport it is desirable that fair conditions of labour and fair rates of wages should be paid and recognised in the transport industry.  Under this Road Transport Bill licence holders are given certain statutory rights which they formerly did not get.  The State has come in now and is issuing licences to people in the road transport industry and giving these people certain rights which they never had before.  It is desirable, therefore, to see that if the State is going to interfere by control or regulation in road transport something should be done to protect the interest of the operatives engaged in that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to make it obligatory under penalty for individual licence holders to comply with the rates of wages generally accepted in the industry for the other people engaged in that industry.  The object of the amendment is to ensure fair conditions of employment and to the extent to which it will do that it will ensure that the employer who is paying a fair rate of wages and giving fair conditions of employment is not driven out of business by reason of the activities of another employer who is paying cheap wages and is not observing fair conditions of labour.  The amendment seeks to eliminate the inequalities which will be bound to arise if there is not general control in the matter of wages.  It is obviously the kind of amendment which will commend itself to the Dáil.  I feel <Col N="2049" /> that an amendment of this kind will be acceptable to the bulk of the people in this business so as to ensure that such employer as I have referred to has not an unfair advantage over his colleagues in the industry.</P>
    <P>The principle of the amendment is not new.  It has already been accepted by the Government in the Cereals Bill and in the Housing Act of 1932.  I hope the Minister will agree to accept the amendment as its provisions are similar to the provisions in the Housing Act, 1932, and of the Cereals Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it is necessary that we should discuss this amendment at length as we discussed the idea of regulating wages in this manner at considerable length when the Bill was before us on Thursday last.  There is no divergence between the object which Deputy Norton wishes to secure and that which the Bill aims to achieve.  Any difference is merely in the matter of machinery.  The Deputy says the purpose of his amendment is to ensure that fair wages and conditions of employment will prevail in the road transport industry.  The Bill provides for that already.  The powers conferred upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce under Section 14 will be used definitely to that end. In fact I can say that the manner in which these powers would be utilised would be to give effect to what is embodied in sub-section (1) of the Deputy's amendment, that is, to ensure that the rates of wages and the conditions of employment operating in respect of any licensed service will not be less favourable to the employee than those generally recognised by trades unions and employers in the business as a whole.  I am satisfied that the machinery proposed by the Bill is much more likely to achieve the aim which the Deputy has in mind with less amount of dislocation than his amendment would achieve it.  I again advert to the experience of those engaged in the road transport industry as to the manner in which the powers under the Road Transport Act of 1932 have been exercised.  The Bill and the <Col N="2050" /> amendment are both trying to achieve the same thing.  I am still convinced from my experience of the Road Transport Act, 1932, and for other reasons that the proposal in the Bill is infinitely better than what is in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that Section 14 set out in the Bill itself gives power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to do what he likes?  The Minister may take a favourable view of the conditions which operate.  But to that extent there is a very big gap between what is in Section 14 and what is sought by the amendment to be inserted in the Bill. Section 14 depends upon the view that any Minister may take of the matter. Amendment 46 is designed to make sure that the Minister will see that the holders of a merchandise road transport licence will be compelled to observe the trade union conditions.  I think there is a very big gap between the possible intentions of the Minister as set out in Section 14 and the very definite provisions which it is sought by the amendment to have observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already accepted in principle, and in somewhat similar language, in the Cereals Bill a similar amendment, and also in connection with the Housing Act of 1932.  If it was desirable to have a very definite amendment on these lines inserted in the Cereals Bill and in the Housing Act of 1932, I cannot understand how the Minister contends that it is not desirable to have this amendment inserted in the Road Transport Bill.  I am not satisfied to take the Minister's intention, as indicated in the House, in relation to Section 14.  I think it is too weak, too loose, and depends all the time on what the Minister's views on decent wages and decent conditions are.  So far as I can ensure, I am not going to trust any Minister in any Party to be the sole arbitrator in the matter of decent wages and decent conditions. I want to have this amendment accepted, so as to oblige merchandise licence holders to pay trade union rate of wages and to observe trade union conditions.  It imposes no burden upon them, because they are <Col N="2051" /> only asked to accept rates of wages which are generally recognised by trade unions and by employers in the road transport industry.  I think the Minister might reconsider the matter, and do in relation to this Bill what has been already done in the Cereals Bill and in the Housing Act of 1932.  There is no difference in principle.</P>

      <P>The point at issue shortly, is whether trade unions shall boss the State, or whether the State shall boss trade unions.  Broadly speaking, I think that the State should boss the trade unions.  This House is perfectly capable of calling the Minister to a recognition of the propriety of the case if he errs in any particular instance.  This House is likely always to be a democratic House, and I do not see that there is any reason to fear that the Government, which is dependent upon democratic favour in this country, will err in the direction that Deputy Norton fears.  I appeal to the Minister not to weaken in his attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The opinions so often expressed by those who would like to see the trade unions crushed, and who take every opportunity to decry the efforts of trade unionists to better the conditions of their fellow members.  I agree with Deputy Norton that the amendment gives the Minister arbitrary powers.  It might be that the present Minister is sympathetic to the claims of those persons who will be engaged in the transport services, but as the Section stands it reads:</P>
      <P>Whenever the Minister grants a merchandise licence he may attach to such licence such conditions as he shall think proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2052" /> In my view, that gives to any one Minister too much power.  I know that there is a body in existence in the railway industry which, to some extent, regularises the wages paid to the various grades of railwaymen.  I am wondering if the Minister could see his way&mdash;and I am making the suggestion without having discussed the matter with the Labour Party&mdash;to have a body on the same lines as the Railway Tribunal on which both sides would be represented, namely the people primarily responsible for the transport system and the operatives. If that was done I feel that it might usefully perform the functions suggested by Deputy Norton's amendment. I am throwing out the suggestion for what it is worth.  I know that the Railway Tribunal has its imperfections and limitations, but it enables persons with grievances to appear before it and discuss these grievances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement made by Deputy MacDermot that this is an attempt on the part of trade unions to boss the State is on a par with, and is as correct as the statement made recently by the Deputy at Enniscorthy, that Labour candidates at the last election were financed by British unions.  The Deputy should not jump at conclusions of that kind without recognising their weakness and the comparative weakness of the Labour Party in the House in relation to the present Government.  The Minister is wrong when he says that the difference between what is in the amendment and what is in the section is merely a question of machinery.  That is not so. The difference between us is very little and if the Minister reads the amendment carefully he will see that.  When application is made for a licence the question is that the Minister should have reference to the matters mentioned in the amendment.  No watertight regulations are being applied for here in the way that the Minister claimed they were put forward in a previous amendment.  The Minister then said he pretty well agreed with us except on the word &ldquo;maximum.&rdquo; Let the Minister read Deputy Norton's amendment carefully and tell <Col N="2053" /> the House what sentence or word he objects to.  Is it not fair, when considering applications for licences, that he should have some regard to the wages and to the conditions of work in every section of the road transport industry?  Is there anything objectionable in asking that, or, so far as the Minister is concerned, in allowing the trade unions to make representations which would enable him to have the full facts and to say whether a licence should be revoked or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection is to impose upon an industry, which is at the present time entirely unorganised, and in relation to which we have very little information of a definite character of the conditions prevailing, something about which we have equally indefinite information.  We want to know what we are doing.  I say to the Deputy that we are taking power in the Bill to impose conditions on which licences shall be granted, as to the conditions of employment which should operate, and that we will use those powers in the manner that similar powers under the Road Transport Bill of 1932 are operated. In relation to that Act, not merely were those concerned permitted to make representations, but they were invited to do so.  On every occasion on which representations were made by them the conditions to which they related were fully examined with the result that we have been able to effect improved conditions in the passenger road transport business.  But the conditions are not uniform.  The unions themselves have agreed to different rates and different conditions in respect of services where different circumstances operate.  It is precisely to allow for that elasticity, that mutual arrangement, having regard to the difficulties of the situation <Col N="2054" /> and to secure a general levelling up without serious dislocation that the machinery in the Bill is designed. That machinery can operate to that end, whereas we have no pledge of what would happen if Deputy Norton's amendment was passed.  If clear knowledge existed it would not make much difference.  I still say that the machinery envisaged by the Bill is far preferable, in so far as it permits of each case being considered on its merits, having regard to the circumstances existing, and in consultation with the representatives of the unions and with those holding licences.  If the Deputy can say that similar powers given by the Act of 1932 were not operated to achieve the aim he has in view, I will admit that there is some weight in his argument.  That is why I think that the Bill should be allowed to go through as it stands as it embodies far more effective machinery than Deputy Norton proposes. On the point made by Deputy Anthony, I would like him to put that to the unions responsible, and ask them whether they would or would not prefer the machinery in the Bill to the establishment of machinery analogous to the Railway Wages Board; whether they would prefer to have it as a definite condition, enforceable by law, that certain wages and certain conditions of employment should operate, or to have merely a Railway Wages Board, the findings of which are not binding upon anybody.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate the Minister's difficulty but when he mentions a flat rate I do not know whether it would be acceptable to the Labour Party or not.  I have not discussed it with them.  The Minister speaks of a flat rate; it is a common practice in many unions to recognise that there are such things as district rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>But the unions do not recognise a flat rate; in fact they have negotiated agreements involving varying rates in the same district.  I am suggesting that there may be a way out of this apparent impasse.  The Minister appears to make an attempt, at any rate, to be fair to the employees in this particular industry.  The bogey that he is conjuring up in his own mind is the bogey of the flat rate; in other words, that the rate that would apply in the City of Dublin should apply also in the town of Ballina.  My experience goes to show that the unions catering for the transport industry are always very willing to meet either the Minister or a body set up for the purpose of securing proper rates of wages in certain districts.  It is a common practice in many unions to have varying rates.  If that is the only thing the Minister has in his mind I feel sure that Deputy Norton will alter his amendment to meet that point.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has read the amendment, but its clear purpose is that the wages and conditions of employment shall not be less favourable to them&mdash;that is the persons employed in the merchandise road transport business&mdash;&ldquo;than the wages and conditions generally recognised by trade unions and employers as the wages and conditions applicable to employees in the business of merchandise road transport.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know a good deal about the matter.  It would be well if the Minister knew as much.  This amendment seeks to make applicable to licensed holders whatever rates are <Col N="2056" /> recognised by trade unions on the one hand and the employers of the district on the other hand.  If the employers and the unions meet together and agree upon geographical rates, or agree on rates determined by the size of the lorry or the distance to be traversed, all these separate sub-agreements as it were can be applicable to anybody else in the industry under conditions similar to those agreed upon.  If the trade unions and the employers meet and say that there shall be five rates of wages, based upon area or upon distance or time occupied in travelling, then there is nothing to prevent that agreement being made applicable to other licensed holders in the industry, each of them finding the different category under which he would fall.  If there was a flat rate agreed upon by employers in the industry it would apply under this amendment; if there was a varying rate, based on district rates, it would apply under this amendment; if there was a rate based upon distance travelled, or time occupied in travelling, it would apply under this amendment.  There is no question whatever of making it obligatory to pay a flat rate.  The only issue involved is that if the trade unions on the one hand and the employers on the other hand agree to certain rates of wages or certain conditions of employment they should be made applicable to the people in the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

They were quite satisfied to permit all the circumstances of each undertaking to be examined separately, and an agreement arrived at designed to secure the best conditions possible for their members in all the circumstances.  The same thing will apply to the road transport business.  It is because of <Col N="2057" /> our knowledge of the manner in which the powers under the 1932 Act were operated, and the difficulties we encountered, that I must resist the amendment in Deputy Norton's name. The proposal in the Bill is much more likely to achieve, and achieve speedily, the end Deputy Norton has in mind.</P>

The Minister suggested that this amendment purported to seek a flat rate for all those engaged in road transport over the country.  But the Minister must know well that in every area in the Free State there is no such thing even as a flat rate for railwaymen.  Is he aware that, here in the City of Dublin, different rates prevail for railway porters&mdash;goods and passenger porters? It is not fair for the Minister to suggest that this amendment purports to set up a flat rate for the road transport service because the unions have not insisted on that, and for very good reasons.

I want to tell the Deputy that I have no earthly interest in any association or society or in any organisation that is in the smallest way affected by this Bill.

      <P>I do not think that adds much to the Deputy's previous statement. The people who went on that deputation and were received by the Minister were people who believed that their business was being ruined and their livelihood taken away.  So far as my going with the deputation is concerned, I was asked about two hours before it took place, in the most informal way, to join the deputation, but I want to make it clear that I have nothing whatever to do with the Transport Federation.  It was as an act of courtesy that I went with the deputation. As a matter of fact, I went with the deputation not at the request of any member of that body, but at the request of the solicitor acting for that body.  I suggest to Deputy Davin that he should be more careful in making statements of that kind, statements that apparently are intended to be a reflection on the character of Deputies of the House.  The Deputy, I think, could not have made a more direct statement with regard to political wire-pulling than he did.  His statement was much more than an insinuation that there was wire-pulling.  If there was wire-pulling going on, I know nothing about it.</P>

I am afraid that though Deputy Davin talks of the Minister not having proper information the Deputy's own information is not always too reliable. The Deputy referred to bus companies <Col N="2061" /> not issuing tickets in every case to passengers.  I can speak of the bus companies operating in the district where I live and that pass Leinster House gate.  My experience of them has been this, that the bus conductor never allows a passenger to leave without issuing a ticket.

      <P>I move amendment 47:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 21, before the word &ldquo;conditions,&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;of the prescribed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to limit the Minister's powers with regard to these conditions which he may attach to a licence, but to limit his powers only to the extent set out in a later amendment.  It only limits whatever the Minister may do in addition to prescribing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we could accept this amendment.  I think it is necessary to have power to impose conditions that will have relation to all the numerous circumstances that may arise.  In my opinion, these conditions could not be prescribed.  The Deputy himself, when he was Minister, had the same difficulty in the Road Transport Act of 1932, and this is a transcript from that Act.  The Deputy found the circumstances were so numerous and so difficult to foresee that the conditions could not possibly be prescribed in advance.  Whatever difficulties would apply in that case would apply equally here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has got to prescribe them in advance for himself, because he has to attach them to the licence?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, then; if it is possible to do that, it is equally possible to put them before this House.  The Minister's power to impose conditions is not held up in any way by putting them before the House.  The only thing is that the House has information given to it in regard to them.  They can be changed at any time.  The Minister can amend them. Whatever he can do, he can do with this amendment in, with the simple addition that he puts these changes or amendments before this House.  That is the whole point.  There is no argument in what the Minister has just said&mdash;that it is impossible to think out all these things beforehand.  He may not think of them all at first, but he may think of something else afterwards, and this only means that he should put these before the House also.  Unless he is going to attach conditions after the licence is granted the amendment is quite as easy.  It means transferring them from the licence to an ordinary Order Sheet of this House and putting them to the House.</P>
      <P>I call the attention of the Labour Party to this amendment I have down because it will ensure that whatever the Minister is going to think proper, with regard to wages and conditions of employment, will be notified to the House before these conditions come into operation and, therefore, I think it is a valuable check to have on the Minister's ideas with regard to reasonable conditions of employment and wages.</P>

If the Minister for Industry and Commerce notifies the Dolphin's Barn Transport Company that they may not carry pigs' heads on the Dolphin's Barn route, is <Col N="2066" /> that condition to be specifically laid on the Table?

      <P>What I am asking the Deputy to explain is whether his amendment means that every individual amendment, subtraction from or addition to existing conditions in a licence are to be laid on the Table in the form of a State paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the amendment mean that, where a new licence is being issued, the conditions attaching to that licence and to each individual licence shall be laid on the Table as a State paper, or does it mean that the Minister will set out a whole series of conditions which he may or may not apply to a licence, and then say to a licensee: &ldquo;You are subject to conditions 1, 7, 12 and 15 as laid on the Table in the schedule of conditions&rdquo;?  I do not quite understand what the words &ldquo;of the prescribed conditions&rdquo; mean.  I do not know whether they mean that each set of conditions which attach to each licence is to be laid on the Table or whether the Minister may not prescribe a condition that he has not already incorporated in a State paper which has been laid on the Table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In case of any misunderstanding, I should like to point out that there will be no secrecy about the conditions.  There is a provision in this Bill for the preparation of a register of licences which may be <Col N="2067" /> inspected.  There is no similar provision in the Road Transport Act of 1932.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; and any interested party can ascertain what are the conditions attaching to any licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Dillon, I should say that, in fact, to carry out the intention, I should move to insert the word &ldquo;prescribed,&rdquo; but the amendment I have moved is attached to a later amendment, amendment 93, I think it is, which necessitates regulations being published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and being laid before the House.  All I want is that, taking them in relation to the section to which they are moved, in relation to the conditions which the Minister may attach to a licence and, in particular, with regard to wages and conditions of employment, these should be notified by simply being laid on the Table, as we understand that phrase.  The Minister objects to that because he says it means terrific trouble, but I say that it only means taking a second copy. He is going to attach conditions to a licence&mdash;very good; duplicate it and bring it before the House.  That is the simplest notification that one can ask him to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was the effect of the amendment I should strongly support it.  I am strongly in favour of that procedure but I doubt if it would be the effect of it, because the section would read, if the amendment were put in:</P>
      <P>The Minister may attach to such licence such of the prescribed conditions as he shall think proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose the Minister prescribes a particular condition for the Terenure Transport Company.  That does not come within the scope of this Bill until it has been laid on the Table and, if it has been laid on the Table, does it become a prescribed condition for every other company or will it have <Col N="2068" /> to be laid on the Table every time the Minister proposes to apply it to any other carrying company?  If this amendment simply means that, when the Minister makes an individual regulation, he is constrained to act in accordance with amendment 93, I support it but as to whether it has a wider meaning which might give rise to difficulties in regard to his special regulation being binding, owing to the definition &ldquo;prescribed,&rdquo; I am doubtful. Can the Deputy assure us, from his experience, that this form, &ldquo;of the prescribed conditions,&rdquo; will be met by his amendment 93?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so but, after what Deputy Dillon has said, I am inclined to agree that the amendment would better have been phrased as &ldquo;such prescribed conditions&rdquo; leaving out the words &ldquo;of the&rdquo;.  I am taking the Deputy's interpretation of the amendment that the Minister must first prescribe a general set of conditions, and that he can then attach any of these to a licence, but that he cannot attach anything to a licence except it is in the general conditions prescribed. That was not the intention.  The intention was that, whenever the Minister attaches any condition to a licence, he shall specify it and prescribe it and, by a later amendment of mine, regulations would necessitate the bringing of it before the House.  That was the intention, but the amendment does not exactly meet that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will do us the courtesy of communicating his reasons for objecting to this procedure, and not simply lean across to Deputy McGilligan and say: &ldquo;Because you did not do it, I am not doing it.&rdquo; If he makes a regulation constraining a transport company, it imposes no hardship whatever on him to send a carbon copy up to the printers and get it through the usual procedure to have it laid on the Table of the House as a State paper.  There is virtually no difficulty involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know a good deal about it.  I am well aware it involves the technical possibility of being revoked in 21 days, but has the Minister ever known such regulations to be revoked in 21 days in his experience? Amendment No. 93, which is consequent on this amendment, provides that the regulations may well operate at the moment that they are made.  Even if they are revoked in 21 days it indemnifies the Minister and the carrier for anything done under such regulations.  It is a kind of limitation that the Minister himself often defined when he was in opposition.  It cannot possibly involve him in any inconvenience whatever, if accepted in the revised draft suggested by Deputy McGilligan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude adopted by the Minister, in his last sentences, proves quite clearly that he wants to throw aside all parliamentary control over his Department and his administration at the moment.  The adoption of the Fianna Fáil transport policy now, or in the future, by some Minister, visualises at the same time the setting up of a transport board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to go into the necessity for the establishment of such a board, but the refusal of the Minister to set up a board over the administration of such a measure <Col N="2070" /> shows that this measure will be administered by his Department. What reasonable objection can the Minister advance against the principle of Deputy McGilligan's amendment, which provides that there should be some way of criticising the regulations made by the Minister in connection with the administration of this measure?  I could not possibly conceive the Minister standing for anything like that when he was in opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister consistently claimed more control over administration when Deputy McGilligan was in office.  At any rate, whether the Minister or Deputy McGilligan stands for that or not, in view of the Minister's words where he tells us he would not submit to such control, I think the House should divide on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon talked of sending a carbon copy of the regulation made to the Clerk of the Dáil. If the Deputy knew the first thing about it he would know that it is mere nonsense to talk like that.  If regulations are prescribed they must be prescribed by order.  The statute lays that down.  It is impossible to foresee the incidents that may arise that would necessitate the imposition of conditions and power should be given to the Department to deal with every possible eventuality and the whole set of conditions that may attach to a licence.  The amendment is impossible because it would involve a new statutory order on every occasion that a new set of conditions had to be attached to a licence.  It would make administration exceedingly difficult.  It was precisely, because of that, in connection with the Road Transport Act, that neither Deputy Davin nor myself, in view of these things, asked the then Minister to accept such an amendment as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Many measures passed by the late administration and, also, by the present administration, made it necessary, in connection with those <Col N="2071" /> measures, to have certain papers laid upon the Table of the House.  The Minister well knows that Deputies have never taken an unfair advantage of that.  But Deputies belonging to the Fianna Fáil Party, and other Deputies, should see to it that effective parliamentary control is maintained over measures of this kind.  If the Minister, and the staff attached to his administration, know that they are likely to be challenged by the Dáil on the issue of these regulations it would make them much more careful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister like to try to bluff?  What is the meaning of saying that the procedure suggested by amendments 47 and 93 would lead to frightful complications, and dreadful difficulty, and is calculated to make his work impossible? What part is calculated to make his work impossible or a source of difficulty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming that Deputy McGilligan alters his amendment, in the sense suggested, it would make the Ministers's task quite easy.  All the Minister is then required to do is to publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the regulations he has made and to lay them on the Table.  Unless they are cancelled by resolution within 21 days after they are laid on the Table they are immune from further interference. If such procedure was never adopted, in any circumstances, I can conceive that there would be some inconvenience, but I assume in the Minister's Department where dozens of these orders are made and laid before the House there would be no difficulty. I have seen Statute after Statute passed in which Papers were required to be laid before the House, where the Minister has to make an order, and if such order was not repealed by resolution within 21 days it becomes law.  That is a common procedure. There must be some routine method in his Department through which orders of that kind are passed and appear upon the Table.  Amendment 93 deliberately provides that no red <Col N="2072" /> tape delay should take place that would delay the Minister in bringing his regulations into force.  The regulation here come into force the moment he makes them, and he can insist on its observance.  If there is anything in what the Minister says about the intolerable difficulties calculated to make his work impossible perhaps he would kindly explain them to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have done so.  I have pointed out that it would be impossible to foresee the circumstances that would necessitate attaching conditions to the licence.  In every other Act that passes through the House similar difficulties are met in precisely the same way as we are doing here.  In other Acts where regulations have to be made by order, and laid upon the Table, it is always taken that one set of regulations will apply almost permanently or for a definite time. This amendment would necessitate a new order in connection with every licence.  Do Deputies contemplate the staff that would be required for such work as that?</P>

      <P>The Minister is mixing up two things.  If the amendment meant that no licence could be ratified without coming before the House I agree it would be a cumbersome procedure, but so far as I understand this amendment, the order is good until the House has nullified it. I do not understand what difficulty there is if the Minister has to make 500 regulations; they can all be laid upon the Table, and they hold good unless they are nullified by the House.</P>

      <P>Let us try to find out what it is that the Minister says in regard to this amendment.  Deputy Dillon has described the Minister's answer as bluff, and he was right.  The Minister says that you have to foresee before any licence is granted, a great number of things.  You have not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You have not. Deputy Dillon stated that the whole thing amounted to sending a carbon copy to the Clerk of the Dáil.  The Minister, in order to make that appear difficult, talked about statutory orders. The wording there is somewhat involved.  You have such phrases as &ldquo;Be it hereby enacted, or made pursuant&rdquo; to a particular thing.  Then you get the carbon copy.  That is all that it amounts to&mdash;a carbon copy with one preambulatory phrase.  This has not even to be done specially for the House. If there are conditions of this type they have to be specified in the licence according to the Minister's own procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us think of the situation.  If there are no conditions attached, then this amendment of mine causes no trouble.  If there are conditions attached, they are to be specified in the licence.  Before being specified they have to be drawn up.  What is the difficulty?  There must be some formula thought out for this and put into the licence.  That formula is taken, with the preamble I have spoken of, and 500 of these forms can be printed for next to nothing.  All there has to be done is to put in the carbon copy of whatever the specification is containing the conditions, and that is put before the House.  That is what we are asking to be done and the principle is that the House in that way gets brought before it the particular things that the Minister wants to attach in relation particularly to wages and conditions of employment, notification of the agreements made in relation to such business by the licensee with other persons engaged in transport&mdash;that is to say, to make public these agreements which used to be called secret agreements&mdash;and, thirdly, there is the matter of whether or not the vehicle is manufactured and to what extent in Saorstát Eireann.</P>

We want to have this House given information about these and whatever else the Minister attaches to the licence; that after he has drawn up the formula, after he has specified them in the licence, he will simply put on the Table of the House a carbon copy of the specification with the preambulatory phrase I have spoken of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to this.  It is one of the reasons why I mentioned Section 15, because Section 15 gives the Minister most extraordinary power.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the House to glance for a moment, in order to understand this point, at Section 16 (2), which recognises that the licensee has a certain claim to continuity; that the licence shall continue in force for a period of 12 months and that it is not within the Minister's discretion to withdraw it, except for cause stated, for at least 12 months. Section 15 (1) provides that &ldquo;the Minister may, on his own motion during the currency of a merchandise licence amend (whether by addition, omission, or variation) in such manner as he thinks fit the conditions attached to such licence.&rdquo;  That gives him the power to do covertly what he is prohibited from doing by Section 16 (2). Supposing he wanted to take a licence from a licensee and could find no legal reason for doing it, under Section 15 (1) he could proceed to prescribe impossible conditions and, having laid down impossible conditions, charge the licensee with a breach of them and withdraw his licence under another section.  All we are asking him to do is to lay a copy of any conditions he makes or attaches to a licence on the Table of the House, so that if any Minister attempted such an enterprise as I envisaged for the purpose of withdrawing a licence from a licensee, this House would be in a position to pass judgment on his action, and to prevent the execution of his purpose.  That may seem a remote contingency at present, but it will reflect on the commonsense of this House if they permit such a situation to arise.  We ought to reserve <Col N="2075" /> to ourselves the right to restrict the Minister from doing a thing of that kind, if we give the Minister the right to prescribe conditions in the way the Bill lays down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon seems to suggest in his final remarks that parliamentary action would be impossible in the event of very severe conditions being imposed on any licensee; that, unless the amendments that are being discussed are passed, the House will be unable to defend any licensee that the Minister may wish to drive out of business, or upon whom he may wish, for other reasons, to impose exceptionally severe conditions.  Surely if anything like that were to happen, the method of parliamentary question is usually a great deal more effective than by this formal publication and placing of the regulations made by the Minister on the Table of the House.</P>

      <P>It redounds to the discredit of Deputies.  They are the very last things which are read.  I think that Deputies McGilligan and Dillon when emphasising the importance of this are deliberately forgetting that it is a formality that is almost useless; that nobody ever takes the least notice of regulations laid on the Table of the House.  If they are anticipating anything like what Deputy Dillon has referred to, namely, the Minister being unnecessarily severe or unjust towards a licensee, if they are motivated in their amendments by a desire to prevent a thing of that kind happening, then I think that they are on the wrong track.  I submit that people who are treated with injustice like that are not slow to come to their representatives about it, and I think the Minister will be much more in fear of a debate being <Col N="2076" /> raised on a question that may be asked with regard to an act of that kind than he will be of any criticism likely to arise through the regulations being laid on the Table of the House including one which may be objectionable to a particular Deputy.</P>

      <P>May I speak possibly as a little bit of an expert in this matter, possibly with as much experience as anybody else, and, say that I never yet encountered a Minister who was very much afraid of, or who ever considered important, any debate on the adjournment.  The only way in which a matter which has been raised by way of question and answer in the House can be considered is by a debate on the adjournment upon which there is no division, and in consequence there is no real parliamentary control at all. Moreover it is within the knowledge of the House that a Minister is able to give sometimes, if he wishes, in answer to a question a very slender amount of information and then hold his tongue.</P>

If there is a desire on the Labour Benches to test the principle, that test will arise on amendment 93, where the procedure is laid down for laying these regulations on the Table.  To challenge a division on this simply means that the principle will not be tested, because we cannot vote for this amendment as it does not mean what the Deputy said he proposed to deal with.

      <P>In this matter, we are merely carrying on the policy of the late Government.  It is obviously desirable that the Minister should have a certain power of control over arrangements and agreements to be entered into by transport organisations.  A similar clause was inserted for that purpose in the Road Transport Act of 1932.  If we have that control in relation to passenger road services, we should have it in relation to merchandise road services.

      <P>We are holding out to persons operating merchandise services in and around the principal towns, a definite inducement to confine themselves to the exempted areas by saying that if they want to operate long distance services, they are going to be subject to regulation and control, not merely in relation to those long-distance services but in relation to the whole of their services.  The main purpose of that Part of the Bill is to ensure that persons whose main business is short-distance transport around port towns will not set themselves up in competition with the railway companies for long-distance business.  If we were to give complete exemption to licensees in the exempted areas, everybody would seek to operate on the long-distance routes and the operators would put themselves in the position that they would have something which <Col N="2082" /> the railway company would have to acquire.  This is a sort of penalty the operators must pay if they want to continue in or go into the long-distance haulage business.  No doubt, a number of operators will go into that business in any event because it is their man business, but there are others whose main business is the haulage of commodities in and about the principle cities and port towns. We want to give these people a definite reason for confining themselves to that work and not have them setting out on the long-distance routes.</P>

      <P>When we were discussing this measure on the Second Stage, I really felt that this whole &ldquo;exemption-area&rdquo; provision was an inversion of what was in the Minister's mind and that we would have a much more satisfactory measure if the exempted areas he had in mind before&mdash;15 miles&mdash;were really reserved for the big companies to batten on in the development of their industry.  That would avoid the dangers of interference in respect of the kind of transport services we have outside in the rest of the country. The Minister insisted that the right idea from his point of view had been enshrined in the Bill.  The proposal now will further react on the major distributing bodies who are deprived to some extent of trade in the exempted areas and given a thinner field outside.  If they are taking advantage of the trade in the exempted areas that even, with a considerable amount of competition, they might take advantage of, they will be prejudiced by this proposal which seems to hit against the main idea the Minister has in mind of building up large transport companies in the country.</P>

      <P>We discussed this matter at very considerable length on Section 6, and it is hardly desirable that we should reopen the discussion. The Deputy should appreciate that if we had no exempted areas or no restrictions upon anybody in exempted areas, then obviously a person in the haulage business operating a short distance service around Dublin would <Col N="2083" /> have every reason for applying for a licence to operate outside the Dublin area, a licence to which he would be entitled under the Bill as it stands. In so far as he would have a right to conduct a service outside the exempted area, he would be a potential competitor of the railway company and would have to be acquired by them if they wanted to acquire a monopoly.  If that business were acquired the person concerned could always go back to the exempted area and start business again, because there would be no restriction.  Our point is that if he wants to go outside the area where the bulk of his business exists, then he is going to be subjected to certain definite handicaps, not merely in relation to his long distance services but in relation to the whole of his services.  If we were to amend the Bill and abolish the exempted areas, in my opinion it would make it much more difficult for the Bill to achieve its objective.  It would be more difficult for the railway companies to get into the position of being the sole long-distance carriers.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I am bringing the Minister over already covered ground, but there is one point here that we ought to be clear about. It is proposed to issue a licence to persons who form authorised merchandise carrying companies. Then you have a second class of existing carrier and other analogous classes.  Does the Minister contemplate applying restrictions to an authorised merchandise carrying company operating in the City of Dublin? Is he going to apply restrictions to that company in respect to carrying goods inside the 15 miles radius around the City of Dublin?</P>

The licensee is not a common carrier.  He is subject to no regulations whatever. But if he wants to operate the service <Col N="2084" /> outside the 15 miles radius, then the whole of his service will be subject to whatever conditions may be attached to the licence.

      <P>The railway company will be the licensee in respect of a much wider area than ten miles outside Waterford.  The company will have a licence to operate over the whole of the Free State, with the exception, possibly, of areas served by other railway companies.  But an independent operator confined entirely within the radius would be free from regulations and control.  If that same person proposed to run a service outside the exempted area, then he would be subject <Col N="2086" /> to the control imposed by this Bill and that control would extend to his whole service.  He would have to specify the goods he was prepared to carry and he would have to be prepared to give to everybody, in relation to these goods, the same terms, conditions and facilities.  He would be subject to these regulations, whereas the people who do not go outside the exempted area may pick and choose their traffic and may refuse facilities to persons if they so desire.  The intention is to give an inducement to persons the bulk of whose business is in an exempted area to confine it entirely to the exempted area and thus reduce the number of operators outside the exempted area who would otherwise have to be acquired.</P>

      <P>There was no necessity to offer inducements to any clear-minded carrier as to why he should remain within an exempted area. However, the inducements are now quite clear, and the Minister will see the advantage that will be taken of the measure in that respect.  The man who knows the value of business inside the exempted area is not going to be so foolish as to leave that area when he knows that he can compete within it on preferential terms with the railway company and other companies.  It would be much better if the Minister had the courage to tell the House that he has finally abandoned the policy of unification in the case of public ownership or private management.  If he did that I could quite understand his case for giving preferential treatment to one set of carriers in an exempted area as against others.  We are still led to believe, without having any positive assurance on the matter, that the Minister still stands for definite unification.</P>

      <P>Of course it does. Unification means that there must be fair competition for all who compete inside or outside the area.  Does the Minister believe in fair competition? Would the Minister, as a merchant, or if he had an interest in a business, <Col N="2087" /> support in this House any proposal which would put £100 upon a licensed trader or shopkeeper at one end of the street and only £10 licence fee on another shopkeeper doing the same business in the same street or near it? Would that be fair competition?  Would the Minister support a proposal that one shopkeeper paying trade union rates of wages should pay £100 licence and allow another shopkeeper to escape with £10?  Would he say that such would be fair competition?  The Minister knows very well that no case whatsoever has been made for freedom and lack of control or restrictions for one set of carriers within an area competing with another set of carriers, and putting on the other carriers severe restrictions in the very same area.  The position will be that one set of people doing the carrying business will have to take whatever traffic is offered and the other will please themselves as to what traffic they will take.  They will take the traffic that pays best, and they will refuse the other traffic.  Naturally, people who will be in the position of taking whatever traffic they like will take the better paying traffic.  They will have an inducement to take only the better traffic, and it will not be necessary for them to take the less desirable traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be better if the Minister would say whether this matter of an exempted area is based on speculation or on an inquiry.  A very considerable number of carriers will remain within the exempted areas and will not apply for licences under the Bill.  It would be a very regrettable thing, I think, if, in a Bill like this, in which exempted areas are one of the big features, the whole idea of exempted areas proved to be based on a calculation that was not justified.  I do not think there are many carriers earning their living by carting within exempted areas.  If the Minister, in coming to a conclusion with regard to exempted areas, was basing his conclusions on speculation I do not think that would be a satisfactory thing.  I would suggest <Col N="2088" /> to Deputy Mulcahy or Deputy McGilligan that the wording of the amendment is not in accordance with the explanation given by Deputy Mulcahy.  As the amendment is worded, it suggests two separate businesses altogether.  It does not suggest one business encroaching on an exempted area, or that a licensee was living in the provinces and taking business within the exempted areas.  It does not suggest a licensee living in Dublin and going all over the country. As the amendment is worded, it suggests to me two businesses: that Mr. Murphy of Tullamore gets a general licence and the amendment proposes that no condition attached to his licence shall affect any merchandise road transport business carried on by him in an exempted area.  In that respect as a matter of fact, the licence is supererogatory.  If the amendment were worded differently it would effect more strictly what the Deputy had in mind.  But as it is worded at present, it does not accord with the intention as proclaimed by the wording.</P>

If the railway company is working the town of Skerries either from the Dublin or Drogheda end by road transport, it is going to be subject to certain restrictions until it comes to these four miles from Skerries on the Drogheda side and two miles from Skerries on the Dublin side.

      <P>Section 15 is in direct accord with the other sections.  The Bill proposes to give the Minister power to grant the licence on such conditions as he thinks fit, and to alter or vary the conditions on renewal. In the Act of 1932 we found that power to amend the licence during the period of its validity was very necessary and desirable.  It would be more necessary and desirable in merchandise road transport concerning which we have less information as to the difficulties which are likely to arise than when dealing with passenger transport.  No doubt after three or four years the powers proposed in Section 15 will probably not be utilised at all.  In the first few years it will certainly be necessary to have power to amend the conditions attaching to a licence during the period of its validity.  As the Minister has in fact power to impose conditions at his discretion, it seems necessary and desirable that he should have power to amend.  Our experience in relation to the Road <Col N="2091" /> Transport Act was that not merely was the proper administration of the Act prejudiced, but frequently the interests of people engaged in the industry were prejudiced by the absence of such a provision.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now to be taken as a dictator, with no one to interfere with him.  If the Minister had indicated his intention of accepting amendment 93 this would be less objectionable, although it would remain objectionable.  At present it means that if the Minister had a quarrel with any individual licensee he could put him out of business by a turn of his hand and there would be no one to say nay to him.  He can impose conditions. Although he makes a pious gesture in sub-section (2), in the next section there is a guarantee of the licence for 12 months.  In Section 15 (1) he takes power to make the retention of the licence absolutely impossible. The Minister piously says that that solicitude for the welfare of the licensee was brought in because of the administration of the 1932 Act, that if he had not this power the poor licensee would suffer terribly.  The amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;on his own motion&rdquo; and to substitute the words &ldquo;with the consent of the licensee.&rdquo;  The Minister's previous solicitude for the licensee goes by the board.  This gives the Minister an opportunity of withdrawing the licence and that is what the Minister proposes.  I do not know why the Minister objects to the amendment, seeing that it does not interfere with his right, at the end of the 12 months, to put a man out of business if it is for the public good. The Minister has made no case except simply that he finds it difficult to administer the Bill without this power. He makes the pathetic case that the licensee may make a claim, the fact being that the Minister wants power from the House to run the show without interference.</P>

He always contemplates that every power given to a Minister is to be exercised for personal spite or for some secret revenge.  If the Deputy could only get it into his mind that Ministers will act rationally, and that any power given to them is power given by the Dáil, that they are responsible to the Dáil, and that the Dáil can take away the power if they act irrationally, I think he will be able to bring to the consideration of these measures a much more unprejudiced mind than he has at present.</P>

He has defended it in the past from the Opposition Benches, time after time, and very properly, when overruled.  Grave abuses have arisen in certain cases where unlimited power was given to make alterations during the currency of a licence, without reference to the House for confirmation. This is an extension of that regulation and gives further powers, which no Minister asked for before, to make changes in the course of the licence and not at the time of renewal. <Col N="2093" /> I object to that because I think it is wrong and open to abuse.

As he did not accept a previous amendment I think it is essential he should take the powers asked for now.  I prefer that the power of control should be with the Minister, and not with the licensee.  It was sought in a previous amendment to have the conditions in the industry recognised, so that employers should conform to these regulations.  As that was not accepted by the Minister it is evident that he must take stock of the situation from time to time, must take power to step in and stop abuses that may arise in the case of some licensees. It is essential in the interests of transport that the Minister should have the power he is seeking.</P>

      <P>For merchandise carrying.  A person gets a merchandise carrying licence on the understanding that he is facing 12 months' trial.  Now Deputy Moore tells us that the licensee can get a letter from the Minister telling him that he has been accustomed to send a car along a certain route at 9.30 a.m. but that in future he should send it there at 7 a.m.  That becomes a condition of the licence.  I think that is a very strong case for the amendment.</P>

      <P>In the interests of the licensee and of the community.  The licensee may not be so concerned about the interests of the community.  Does the Deputy recognise that he voted for the principle of this Bill, that in the average rural district there is no duplication of services, and that the community must be considered regarding the conditions to be imposed on the licensee?  The Minister will be able to prescribe the conditions that are suitable to the community.  Where a transport service has been established for three or four months, complaints from the community might be so numerous and so strong that the Minister would compel the licensee to make an alteration owing to the fact that the people were being inconvenienced.  Is not that <Col N="2095" /> a reasonable suggestion for justifying the alteration?</P>

The interests of the community which the licensee serves will have to be the paramount consideration.  If they do not get paramount consideration the whole principle of the Bill will very quickly be endangered, the people will rebel against the measure, and there will be agitation for the repeal of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>All these amendments have very much the same purpose. They are applicable to different sub-sections of Section 18.  The purpose of this amendment can be described briefly enough.  It is to limit the peculiar discretion which the Minister is taking to himself in all these matters.  As the section runs, an application for renewal may be refused because: (a) in the Minister's opinion there was a breach or failure to observe or comply with one or more of <Col N="2100" /> the conditions attached to the licence, or, under paragraph (b) because the Minister believes that there was, during the currency of the licence, a breach or failure to comply with the provisions of the Act or of the regulations made thereunder.  Where the phrase &ldquo;in his opinion&rdquo; occurs in the section I want to have it removed so that the Minister will not be the final authority in these matters.  If there is going to be such a penalty imposed upon a person as a refusal to renew his licence then, I think, the Minister's discretion should be subject to review by the court.</P>
      <P>I also want to put his terms of reference for the court not merely in paragraphs (a) and (b), but also in paragraph (c), so that there would have to be such a serious breach or failure to observe or to comply with the conditions as to make the licensee unfit to hold a licence.  In other words, that we would not impose upon the court to find automatically that there had been an offence, but that there had been an offence so serious as to make it decide that the licensee was unfit to hold a licence.  The purpose common to all the amendments is to have the Minister's discretion overlooked, so that when a person is brought to court he is not going to be met there by the mere statement of the Minister: &ldquo;Well, I think there has been a breach or a failure to comply, and because I think so that ends the matter.&rdquo;  I think there should be some appeal given in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take an entirely different view of this.  I think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whoever he may be, assisted as he would be by the officers of his Department who are from day to day dealing with transport matters, is much more competent to decide the question arising for decision under the section than any judge or court, because they will relate to matters of public policy. The question that would arise is whether, having regard to the transport situation existing and the transport needs of the future, the particular offence which the licensee was guilty of, breach of conditions or other offence of <Col N="2101" /> which he was convicted, he should be allowed to continue in the transport business.  That is a question of public policy in the first instance.  It is a question which can be decided much more competently by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, advised as he will be in the way that I have described.</P>
      <P>I would again remind the Deputy that in this matter we are following the very excellent example which he laid down in the Road Transport Act of 1932.  It is an important consideration that there should be, in relation to both Acts, some similarity in practice, and in so far as the Road Transport Act of 1932 gives these powers in relation to the refusal to renew a licence we should have the same powers in relation to merchandise transport.  In any event, the opinion definitely held is that the administration of these Acts should be entirely in the hands of the Government Departments concerned, and that they should be allowed to take into consideration the questions of public policy that would arise in refusing the renewal of a licence as is proposed here, bearing in mind that the Minister is always responsible for his acts in that connection to the Dáil. In the last resort the Dáil is the final court of appeal, apart from the general body of the people, on matters of general policy.  If the Minister abuses the powers given to him, or acts contrary to what the Dáil considers to be good public policy, then he will have to answer for his actions here. Therefore, I think it is the Minister and not the court that should determine this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I want to take out the phrase &ldquo;in his opinion&rdquo;.  That does not prevent the Minister from making any regulations he likes so long as they are within the Act.  He can modify public policy in whatever way he likes and in whatever way it is open to him to do under the Act, but after that the Minister says: &ldquo;Having made the regulation I am now going to determine not whether the regulation was right or whether the person should have obeyed it, but whether he has obeyed it&rdquo;.  That is a different thing.  It is a question of fact, and I think should be left to somebody else to decide.  In connection with that, I propose to put in the words in one of my amendments, &ldquo;was so serious a breach&rdquo;... &ldquo;as to make the licensee unfit to hold a licence,&rdquo; because I think a mere technical breach should not prevent a renewal of a licence.  If those words were not there, the court might find itself constrained to give the Minister power to refuse.  I think that they, in their discretion, should be enabled to say that, as a matter of fact, there has been a breach of, or a failure to observe, or comply with one or more of the conditions attached to the licence, and that it is so serious a breach of, or failure to observe or comply with these conditions that they may give that power to refuse.  As it is, that does not operate at all.  The Minister still makes the conditions and, therefore, he still makes public policy. What I want is that the court should be enabled to decide on this point as to whether or not there has been a breach of, or a failure to comply with the conditions and whether that breach or failure to comply is so serious as to render a man unfit to hold a licence.</P>
      <P>Similarly, with regard to an offence. I think it ought to be an offence of his own act or of his own negligence and of so serious a nature as to make him unfit to hold a licence; but no talk of public policy should be allowed to override this.</P>

      <Col N="2103" /> Last week I cancelled a licence because there had been a breach.  I feel certain that, if that matter had to be determined by a judge of a court who knew nothing about the transport situation, he would have given a verdict which would have made it impossible for the Minister to cancel the licence.  Yet, the licence was cancelled by me, and I venture to say, properly cancelled.</P>

That is apart from whether the Minister, or anybody else, forms an opinion or not.  It must be a question of fact.  For instance, I form an opinion that X has committed a breach, or has failed to observe or comply with <Col N="2104" /> some of the conditions.  I form an opinion.  Surely, there is some machinery to report the matter if there has been a breach committed, or a failure to observe or comply with the conditions.  Is it the Guards or who is it?  It is simply a question of whether or not it is a breach of the regulations.  Public policy has nothing to do with it.</P>
      <P>Take (c) which says: &ldquo;on the ground that the licensee under such licence has during such currency been convicted of an offence (whether under this or any other Act) in relation to the merchandise road transport business to which such licence relates, or the vehicles used therein.&rdquo;  That is, obvious.

      <P>Thank you very much. I agree with Deputy McGilligan that there is no question of public policy involved.  I remember the Minister, when he was making the case in favour of getting dictatorial powers for the purpose of closing down certain branch lines on the railways, saying that he wanted Deputies to realise that they must face the facts of the situation and that he did not want <Col N="2105" /> deputations coming to him or representations being made to him afterwards for the keeping open of these lines.  I can quite understand Deputies sitting behind the Minister making a good case and appealing to the Minister to see a deputation representing certain people who would be associated with the refusal of a licence, and I can visualise the Minister seeing his way in such a case, perhaps in a weak moment, to receive a deputation or to listen to representations before he would make up his mind as to whether or not there had been a breach of existing conditions.  Is that not possible?  Will the Minister say here and now that under no circumstances will he receive a deputation or hear representations from anybody?</P>

      <P>I realise, of course, that this may be what might be called a lawyer's amendment and likely to be welcomed by briefless barristers in court.  But I realise the value of having a safeguarding amendment of this kind in the Bill.  It would make Ministers and others concerned much more careful before they would take a chance of being brought into court. The Minister is asking for dictatorial powers.  I am not saying that the Minister himself would act in that way, but some other person who might succeed him might be open to certain persuasion on the matter of whether there was a breach of the regulations or not.  The Minister, in his usual manner of camouflaging the dictatorial powers he is seeking, says that the Dáil is the final appeal on matters of this kind.  But we can realise the value of that by his action on a previous amendment when he refused to lay papers before the House and give Deputies a chance of challenging certain matters.  This, then, is the final court of appeal!  What kind of a court of appeal is that where you <Col N="2106" /> will only get an evasive answer to your questions?  If there is an appeal to a court by a licensed carrier the Minister cannot afford to ignore it.  I want to see less power in the hands of the Minister.  I want to see the overriding power which Deputy McGilligan is asking for in this amendment inserted in order to make the Minister and his officials and advisers more careful in the administration of the dictatorial powers he is asking for and, apparently, going to get, in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to urge again, and particularly with regard to those amendments which aim at cutting out the phrase &ldquo;in his opinion&rdquo;&mdash;there are two of these, one to lettered paragraph (a) and the other to lettered paragraph (b)&mdash;that it seems to me to be a bad thing to leave the licensee subject to the Minister's simple statement: &ldquo;I think that a breach has been committed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When did the Deputy first get that opinion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he wants history, I will give the Minister a bit of history. These phrases were all part of what I think is a bad tradition, started by the House on a particular Bill.  It arose, first, in connection with the Live-stock Breeding Act.  That measure, as introduced, had not the great discretion reposed in the Minister which, afterwards, was placed in the Minister.  The reason why it was put in was because the House, as a whole, was in favour of a very sudden move against people who were said to be destroying the export trade of the country by certain malpractices but, when that Bill came into the House, there was not this terrific discretion given to the Minister and the conditions were different from what they are in this regard.  It was recognised at that time that every association&mdash;I think the Minister said on Second Reading that he had been in touch with every association, certainly with regard to the Eggs Bill, which was one of the first and, I think, he said it with regard to the Live-stock Breeding Act&mdash;had urged him to bring in this measure.  He was appealed to by the <Col N="2107" /> then Deputy Johnson, who led the Labour Party, and by the then leader of the Farmers' Party, to insist on very rigid conditions indeed and, because the House asked it unanimously, and because the statement was made that the exporters' associations, who were mainly concerned, had asked for the measure, the Minister was granted the very extensive powers which he afterwards got, but these powers were not in the Bill as it was first introduced to the House.  I think, as a matter of fact, that one of the phrases actually came in by way of an amendment by a Deputy of the Farmers' Party, by which the exporters of eggs and those who were engaged in the breeding of cattle were put under the control of the Minister.  That, unfortunately, stood as a precedent, and, because no great objection was taken to the matter thereafter, it was extended away from those two or three measures, in respect of which the associations had been entirely in favour of a rigid regulation, to another series of measures in respect of which, if the people had been consulted at all, they were certainly not unanimously in favour of giving the Minister this power.  Those concerned, at the moment, have not expressed themselves by any means unanimously as desiring that the Minister should have this power.  A certain number have, in fact, said the very contrary and it is because of that that I think that this phrase should be removed and that the Minister should be subject to a check in the only way in which that check can be exercised&mdash;the check of the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, remember that it is a different circumstance.  There is the question of a licence in which the Minister is taking power to step in; where he is doing that without the approval of the associations concerned and where he is taking power to say: &ldquo;I think the offence has been committed,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I think a breach has occurred and a failure to comply with the conditions has occurred,&rdquo; and, then, he simply stops the licence.  I myself think that, in the circumstances of this measure, it is too wide a discretion to give to <Col N="2108" /> the Minister.  I am amazed that the Minister, after introducing a case as a headline, would not go on and give details of the case which he says would prove that the Minister must have this power in his hands.  He said that a case was prominently before his mind on the other measure in which he refused a licence where he thought it proper and in which he believed that the court would not have refused to grant it or renew it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The breach of the conditions related to the observance of a time table.  It was a matter of keeping to a time table or not.  Because the licensee not merely failed to keep to the time table but persistently failed after warning the licence was cancelled. The Deputy will appreciate, in relation to the omnibus position, particularly, in the City of Dublin, the importance of making the licensees adhere closely to the time table they themselves prepare, but anybody not familiar with that position would not necessarily attach the same importance to the fact that the time table had not been rigidly adhered to.</P>

      <P>That is getting a little bit away from it.  We were told distinctly that the Minister believed that he had properly refused the grant or renewal and that the court would not have upheld him.  He tells us now that it was a question of a breach of a condition to keep to a time table.  I do not know whether it is his evidence that is at fault.  Did he get evidence of the breach?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the only question was would not the court have upheld that?  I wonder why he says that the court might have refused.  The Minister proceeds on the basis that the court will not regard public policy. Why does he say that?  The courts have been known to do that and the courts do consider public policy and, if the courts had the Act before them, and had the Act which allowed regulations to be made in order to carry out certain things which were left a little bit vague in the Act, and, if these regulations were produced, I have not the slightest doubt in the world that the court would take that as material for its consideration in making up its mind as to whether there had, first of all, been a breach and, secondly, whether the breach was sufficiently serious as to warrant cancellation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the Minister, advised by his Department, is more competent than a court to make that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the net issue.  Let us get away from the argument about public policy.  It has been thrown overboard.  The Minister agrees that public policy is entirely within his control by the regulations and modifications he can make within the four corners of the measure itself and the only thing, then, is the citizen's right to have a court decide, with the facts presented to it, with the measure presented to it and with the regulations presented to it, whether or not there has been, in fact, a breach, and, secondly, whether that breach is so serious as to warrant the refusal of renewal.  That is the issue.  I do not know why the Minister should refuse this.  The conditions are definitely apart from those associated with the earlier measures in which this type of discretion was given to the Minister and I think it is about time that we made a new precedent in the new circumstances and, if necessary, the Minister might go back and amend the 1932 Act in the same way.  If, as he says, there is an example before his mind of a refusal made under his authority which the courts would not have upheld, he really should go back <Col N="2110" /> and amend the earlier Act.  This is a very ordinary right that is being asked for and, where there is property at stake, the people concerned should have that right not entirely subject to the Minister's sole discretion and the position should be that, on the rare occasions on which a man would want to go to the court to get a decision, he should be enabled to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what type of evidence he acts upon before he forms his opinion?  Would he say whether the licensee is given an opportunity for making a case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Section 18, where application for a renewal of licence has been made, there would, undoubtedly, be every opportunity given to the person to make his case. In the section power is given to cancel or alter the conditions of the licence during the term of the licence, and the person is given notice of that fact, and is entitled to make representations.  In this case application for a renewal is made.  The licensee is informed that he broke the conditions or, perhaps, that he was convicted on evidence, and then the question arises whether we should renew his licence or not.  It may be refused on the ground that the renewal of the licence will conflict with sound policy.  But every opportunity will be given the licensee.  In fact, all Departments of State are much more likely to err in such cases in favour of the licensee rather than against him.  In almost all such cases repeated opportunities are given to the licensee to rectify the matters complained of against him.  In the case I referred to, three times during the six months, notice was given that the licence would be cancelled if things were not made right, and it was only after the third time that the licence was cancelled.  That is always the case, and necessarily so, seeing the conditions and the responsibility that a Minister has to the Dáil. I could not contemplate any modification of the powers there.  And apart altogether from the general question of the advisability of getting away from <Col N="2111" /> the bad precedent Deputy McGilligan has set and his Government established&mdash;&mdash;</P>

How he is going to do that I do not know.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were last discussing this Estimate I moved to report progress.  I was then asking the Minister to consider the desirability of setting up a small independent committee to examine the position of the Irish language in connection with primary education in the country.  One gets accustomed in public life to misrepresentation and the extent to which misrepresentation can go is sometimes rather alarming. I recently had a cordial chat with a young priest.  We found that we agreed on many things, and when we parted he told me his name and I told him my name.  He then said to me: &ldquo;Oh, are you the man who attacks Irish?&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;I am not aware of that,&rdquo; and he replied: &ldquo;I thought you were the man who attacked Irish in the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I will say again what I said when I discussed this Estimate on the last occasion it was before the House in 1932.  In my opinion the record of the Minister for Education will stand or fall by the degree of success his efforts to preserve the Irish language meet with.  He, above all other Ministers, is charged with preserving the language and promoting it.  Any criticism I have made, or may now make, on the position of the Irish language in relation to primary education is purely for the purpose of helping the Minister to pursue an effective policy of revival of the language in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out already to the Minister that in my opinion the practice of teaching even one subject through the medium of Irish in a school where all the children cannot speak the language fluently is to be deprecated, because teaching children a subject through the medium of a language <Col N="2122" /> they do not fully understand is likely to injure their health and, further, is likely to result in their not securing a full mastery of the subject they are being taught.  The result of that is that parents develop a disproportionate prejudice against the language, very often a misinformed prejudice, and I am aware that the fight to preserve and promote the language is hard enough without creating new prejudices that have to be overcome.</P>
    <P>I put it also to the Minister that it is his duty to see that in those schools where Irish may be profitably employed as a medium for education, real Irish is employed and not what is commonly described in the country as book Irish.  So long as he is not in a position to say that every school in the Gaeltacht is manned by Irish-speaking teachers, he ought to be very reluctant to press Irish on schools where the children do not speak the language at all.  I urge on him that the way really to promote Irish in this country, and re-establish it in the position it ought to occupy is, first, to secure that the disappearance of Irish in the Fior Gaeltacht will be arrested.  It can only be arrested by securing that no child who is a native speaker of Irish is taught any subject, with the exception of English, through the medium of the English language.  Every word of instruction in a Fior Gaeltacht school should be imparted by a native speaker of Irish or somebody who has reached so high a degree of proficiency in the language that he can scarcely be distinguished from the native speaker.</P>
    <P>Outside that the Minister's objective should be&mdash;it cannot be realised immediately, but it can be pretty rapidly&mdash;to see that Irish is taught in no primary school except by a native speaker.  In the Breac Gaeltacht that is particularly necessary, because if the children are taught Irish in the Breac Gaeltacht by somebody who does not impart to them the real language, when the children go home to their grand-parents they are held up to ridicule; their grand-parents laugh and tell them they are not speaking Irish at all.  If you get the children taught real Irish in the <Col N="2123" /> Breac Gaeltacht they will then go home and take a childish pleasure in talking to their grand-parents over their parents' heads in a language their parents had not been using. You rapidly find that that use of the language in the home, skipping one generation, will bring these middle-aged people who are now on the verge of losing the language back into the everyday use of it.  Once you can do that you will turn a strip of the Breac Gaeltacht into the Fior Gaeltacht and once you turn the tide there it is a tide that will move across the whole country, and the language revived in that way will be revived in a form in which it will live.</P>
    <P>I live in a district on the borders of Mayo and Roscommon.  It was the Breac Gaeltacht up to ten years ago. To-day, subject to the limitations of my knowledge of the language, if I start a conversation in my place of business in Irish with the old people, very frequently middle-aged people, whom I do not think have the language, will join.  Those people who so join in the conversation might not speak the language again during a whole twelve months.  These people say that they cannot understand the class of Irish that children are learning in the schools.</P>
    <P>What I want, if it can be achieved, is to ensure that each child coming out of a national school will be a propagandist for the language, and will be a centre from which the language will spread out in his own particular district.  If the children are taught real Irish by competent teachers, each child can become such a propagandist; but if you attempt to teach a child who does not know the language such subjects as mathematics, geography and other matters of general knowledge through the medium of Irish, you will make that child hate the language, you will make its parents hate the language and you will do the whole language cause irreparable harm.  If the children are taught Irish by a competent teacher who will impart to them the real language, you can make every child in every national school a centre from which <Col N="2124" /> the language will spread out in his or her own particular district.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to a certain confirmation of my view contained in his own statement. Under the heading of Secondary Education, beginning on page six and continuing on page seven, he is discussing the question of the Irish language in secondary schools.  He says he recognised serious difficulties existed and that he circulated questionnaires.  &ldquo;Valuable information has been furnished,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and the endeavour made by so many managers to be of practical assistance is much appreciated.  From the answers received it would appear that there is a considerable body of teachers competent to teach subjects through Irish.  The difficulties mentioned vary, naturally, according to the type, location, etc., of the schools, but the obstacle most frequently mentioned is the inability of the pupils to benefit fully from such instruction.&rdquo; That is what the Minister said.  When I said that here twelve months ago the Minister for Education remarked that after the violent attack made by Deputy Dillon on the Irish language, such and such a thing would happen. These are the very words I used two years ago.  The Minister makes his inquiries and finds what I said confirmed by persons to whom he pays tribute for their co-operation in helping to restore the language to its proper position.</P>
    <P>I know this information applies to secondary schools; but, after all, children are very much the same whether in secondary or primary schools.  In the light of that, all I ask the Minister to do is to set up a small independent committee of competent people, such as Teachta Breathnach or some Deputy on this side, or an independent person.  Let it not be a departmental committee. Let it be composed of independent persons whom the teachers will have no reason to fear and before whom they can give full and free evidence. Let it be confidential, if needs be, and let the committee report to the Minister privately, if needs be, if that course is acceptable to the Minister. <Col N="2125" /> Anyway, let the committee report fully and frankly what the situation is.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when introducing this Estimate, spoke of the condition of school buildings and mentioned that he foresaw that considerable sums of money must be laid out in the renovation of school buildings for a variety of reasons into which I need not go.  I should like to invite the Minister to consider this proposition when he addresses himself to the task of replacing dilapidated schools.  In certain countries it has been decided that where there is a scattered population, instead of putting up small national or primary schools here and there through the district, it is better to lay out money in building one good school in a central spot, running bus services out and picking up the children in the outlying districts, thus bringing them into one good school. The economy effected makes it possible to build very much better schools, and it has this added advantage&mdash;that the State can provide accommodation for gymnasia or games for the children.</P>
    <P>Having a large number of teachers in the larger school the Minister can create something in the nature of an academic atmosphere in the establishment which greatly benefits the teachers and the children.  That is an atmosphere quite different from the ordinary wayside school to which the teacher has to reach from a considerable distance at 9 o'clock in the morning. There is the advantage that the teachers are there.  They can spend their evenings together in social discussion and intercourse.  They have fine premises with modern amenities and facilities for giving the children all sorts of instruction and advantages that they could not be expected to give them in the small, isolated school in outlying districts. It would have this added advantage that in those small outlying districts it is difficult to provide proper sanitary accommodation for the schools.  If the schools were in certain areas in the towns, and the children brought into the towns by bus service, there would be no difficulty.  There is electricity now, and there is the <Col N="2126" /> benefit of the electric light everywhere in the bigger towns in the winter evenings.  There is ample sanitary accommodation, and conveniences can be provided where the children come in with wet clothes and wet boots to have the clothes and the boots dried. Very often a child walks across the bog, his clothes and his boots are wet and very often the teacher is perplexed to know what to do.  In these large schools, too, it would be possible to arrange for giving the children some kind of a meal in the middle of the day and keep them on for study in the afternoon.  It would be possible to do that in these large schools rather than as at present in small schools dotted through the country.  I ask the Minister to consider that suggestion at his leisure.  The question, perhaps, is a complicated one, but he can consider it when making up his mind as to what programme he is to pursue.</P>
    <P>On page 13 of his speech, the Minister spoke of the erection of technical schools for primary technical education in the Gaeltacht.  I urged that on the Minister on many occasions, and I urged it in connection with the scheme which I suggested to him for getting a sufficient supply of competent Irish teachers.  I asked him before to take every boy and girl in the Fior-Ghaeltacht who is willing to go in for an educational course, to try them out, and see if they could be made competent teachers.  Should he find that they are temperamentally unsuited to the teaching profession, I asked him to give them a technical education as carpenter or dressmaker, and then they could go out equipped with that knowledge.  I pointed out to him, that in the Gaeltacht, one of the great difficulties is the economic one, where the children must send home money to their parents, if the parents are to keep things going.  We want to keep these children from going to America.  I want the Minister to provide good jobs for them at home as teachers.  In that way he can get some of the most competent teachers of the Irish language.  I suggest that he should take every girl and boy who are native Irish speakers <Col N="2127" /> and who are willing to go on for the teaching profession, try to train them for the teaching profession and, if temperamentally unsuited, train them in some trade whereby they can make a living.</P>
    <P>I see the Minister here is taking steps to build technical schools in the Gaeltacht.  That school I see is in Galway City.  I do not complain of that.  The Irish University is there, and I suppose it is only a fair thing to set up a technical school there. But I do say that he should consider the desirability of building a technical school in the Gaeltacht in Donegal. There is the finest division of the Irish Gaeltacht in Donegal.  There is already a great training college there, and I think it would be a reasonable and proper thing to put up a technical school there where the children of the Gaeltacht might be educated in crafts which would fit them to earn their living and make it possible for them to remain at home and live and use the valuable gift of the education they have got.  I can understand that Deputies who come from Cork, Kerry and Clare would make similar claims, but I would ask the Minister to give special facilities to the Donegal Gaeltacht in consideration of its standing.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the establishment of housewifery in Killarney.  I think that more important even than a school of housewifery would be the equipping of a school to train the girls to become competent nurses for children.  There is no more fruitful way of spreading Irish in the home than by providing Irish speaking nurses for the children.  The pity is that not many Irish speaking girls coming from the Gaeltacht are qualified to take up the position of children's nurses which requires considerable sagacity.  Most of these girls coming from the Gaeltacht are young girls.  None of them are married women, and therefore, people are reluctant to commit their children to their care.  Here is an opportunity of doing something in that matter and the result would be that in a short time there would be a supply of <Col N="2128" /> children's nurses who knew Irish. Again I say there is no more effective way of spreading the language than by spreading it in the circles where it would be most helpful.</P>
    <P>Under the head of Reformatory and Industrial Schools I ask the Minister how many children are detained under his jurisdiction under the School Attendance Act?  I consider the detention of young children in a reformatory or industrial school under the School Attendance Act as an unChristian and scandalous procedure. To withdraw a child from the family circle because it has mitched from school is, to my mind, absolutely indefensible.  It is an absolutely indefensible interference by the State in family life.  I can quite understand that if the State can prove that the parent is continually conniving at breaches of the law in withholding the children from school, it is the parents who should be made amenable to the law and punished.  But why punish the child by withdrawing it from the family influence, because it does what any child would do&mdash;to mitch from school?  That, to my mind, is a very bad thing to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are ample means under the existing law.  If a child is caught playing games in the street or doing anything that is fundamentally wrong, or if his parents have completely lost control of him, an information could be sworn and the child placed under the kind of control provided by the law.  Similarly, if a child is found begging on the streets action could be taken.  It is a very extreme and a very grave thing to remove a child from the family and to place it in a reformatory or an industrial school.  I do not for a moment desire to reflect on the industrial schools or the reformatories. I am quite satisfied they are as good <Col N="2129" /> as such institutions go, but the whole trend of Christian teaching and of social science is against the removal of children from the family influence. There is no substitute for the family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should, in my opinion, do his best to prevent children being sent to industrial schools, to reformatories or other institutions under his charge.  He should make it manifest that the Department does not approve of such a course but regards it as a most undesirable expedient&mdash;one to be resorted to in the very last stage.  I go so far as to say that the Minister should decline to receive such children and should have them sent home.  If the Department of Justice wishes to make anyone liable in cases of that kind the parents should be held liable; not the children.  Unless a child was committed under the Vagrancy Acts or charged with a misdemeanour, I strongly disapprove of the procedure adopted.</P>

If the Deputy is not satisfied with the administration of the Act he should seek another opportunity to deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has missed the method that I advocated I know that he has power to release them without reference to the Minister for Justice or anybody else.  Normally, I know, he would consult the District Justice or the Minister for Justice.  In this case what I am suggesting to him is that he ought to exercise his discretion, release those children, and restore them to their families, on the ground that as Minister for Education and knowing how those places are administered&mdash;and must be administered no matter how well they are run&mdash;he is of opinion that they are no substitute for family influence. I am suggesting that in order to mark his knowledge of that matter he should exercise his power of release in a very unusual way.  He is responsible for the education and welfare of children of school age in this country.  They are under his charge.  If there were no industrial schools they would still be in primary schools, under his charge. What I am advocating is&mdash;I know I am advocating something extreme&mdash;that as often as he gets an opportunity he should send those children back to the primary schools and say: &ldquo;I, as Minister for Education, am of opinion that this is no remedy.  If you want to victimise people under this Act victimise the parents.  They are the responsible people.&rdquo;  If the only fault of those children is that they have not a proper attendance at school the place for them is in the family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <P>Surely the Deputy knows it would be a most extraordinary procedure for me to negative an order of the court without examination, because <Col N="2131" /> that it what it would amount to.  As the Deputy probably knows, in individual cases where I am satisfied that the children can be released he is released, but this is not done against the advice of the District Justice or the local police authorities.  If the suggestion of the Deputy is that the child should be released in spite of the advice of the police, and also in spite of the definite committal order of the District Justice, I do not know where it is going to lead.  I think it would be much more straightforward&mdash;if the House were to accept the Deputy's suggestion&mdash;for us to repeal the Act.</P>

I am not free to say that we should repeal the Act, but what I am free to say is that the Act should never have been passed.  I am putting it to the Minister that it is fundamentally wrong to victimise a child in this case, and that nothing is achieved by removing a child from family influence and putting him in the best industrial school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the Act provides that it may be done, and in 58 cases it has been done.  What I am asking the Minister to do&mdash;as Minister for Education, responsible for children, and with expert information at his disposal as to how children get on in industrial schools&mdash;is to mark his disapprobation of the exercise of that power under the Act by releasing those children, as he has a right to do. Without any amendment to the existing law the Minister could release any child committed to the care of an industrial school or reformatory, if he desires to do so.  I am submitting that in these cases under the School Attendance Act&mdash;and only in those cases&mdash;he ought to do so, on the grounds that in his opinion, as Minister for Education responsible for the welfare of the children of this State, it is not a suitable procedure, and to mark his disapprobation of the legislation which made it possible.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister made a note to say a few words when he is winding up on the present position of junior assistant mistresses, and their position as to pension rights.  I hope he will have time to examine that aspect of the situation.  I can assure him that anything I can do to help him in promoting the Irish language as the spoken language of this country I will be glad to do.  I trust that he will take steps to secure for himself impartial and outside information as to what is the true situation of the Irish language in the schools.  If and when he does that, I am satisfied that there will be very little between us as to the best method of restoring Irish as the spoken language of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, on previous occasions in this House I have offered some criticism on the Education Vote, and I propose possibly to repeat some of the things I said on previous occasions.  I criticised this Vote when Cumann na <Col N="2133" /> nGaedheal were the Government, and I criticised it subsequently when Fianna Fáil came into office.  I pointed out on previous occasions in this House the difficulty that parents and guardians have in getting to know how their children are progressing in the national schools of the country.  Of course I realise that that word &ldquo;progressing&rdquo; is capable of two interpretations. I give the interpretation of it in its widest and most liberal sense; numbers of others, who are educationists, give it the interpretation that progress means the advancement of the particular pupil in the Irish language. I have suggested that the publication of the elementary text-books in one language, and that the language which is not generally spoken, namely, the Irish language, has been a big handicap and a very serious drawback to the children attending national schools in this country.  We have evidence all around, if we care to see it, that the programme which national teachers are called upon to put into practice is one almost incapable of successful achievement.  No blame whatsoever can rest on the national teachers of the country, because they are endeavouring to carry into practice an overloaded and almost impossible programme, while subjected every now and again to inspections and inspectors who may or may not have a bias or a flare for the language. There is a very big volume of opinion in the country that the Department of Education is not going the best way about reviving the Irish language as the spoken language of this country.  The worst feature of Irish public life at the moment is that if one has the temerity to criticise a policy,&mdash;the policy of the present Government, for instance&mdash;but particularly to criticise, even in a friendly way, the manner in which it is sought to advance the language of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not.  If the Deputy cannot understand English, I can.  I spoke about the co-operation of the parent with the teacher.  It cannot be denied that under the old regime the co-operation of the parent or guardian was a very valuable asset to the teacher.  The parent or guardian, who, perhaps, got only a national school education himself, was able to correct the home exercises of the child.  What do we find to-day? Many thousands of people&mdash;in fact, the vast majority of the people of this country who passed through the national schools during the last twenty or thirty years&mdash;are unable, because of their ignorance of the Irish language, to correct the home exercises of the children or advise them as to the spelling of a word.  I want to ask, would it not be far better for a child, at the beginning, at any rate, to get most of his education in the English language, and be brought along by easy stages until such time as he is able to understand what is being taught to him in the schools.  I am not going to go into the question of teaching a lot of extra subjects through the medium of Irish.  I think that carries with it its own condemnation in the fact that you have a very limited number of teachers in this country who can teach through the medium of Irish.</P>

      <P>I was endeavouring to show, when interrupted, that the co-operation of the parent in the home has been looked upon as a very great asset, indeed, to the teacher in the school.  I do not want to labour the point, because I think it will be admitted by everyone that it is so. The parents who are Irish speakers do not form one-tenth of the population in our cities and towns.  Therefore, the great majority of parents are considerably disadvantaged by the fact that they cannot supervise and, perhaps, correct some of the home lessons of the children.  I think that is admitted.  When we have regard to the fact that most, if not all, of the pupils attending the national schools of the country leave school at the age of 13 or 14 years to earn a livelihood they should not be handicapped, as I submit they are, by an overloaded programme, seeing that an inordinate proportion of the school week is devoted to the teaching of Irish.</P>

I am trying to make my speech under very great difficulties. In connection with this matter to which I was referring when interrupted, the hardship as regards parents who can afford to send their children to secondary schools or to the Universities is not so great as in the case of parents whose children attend the National Schools.  In this matter the Department of Education refuses to budge an inch.  As long as this grave handicap and hardship is allowed to continue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Practically no Deputy has written to me on the matter&mdash;not Deputy Anthony in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret not having heard the Minister's observations on that occasion, but the reason must be obvious to the Minister.  The Minister introduced his Estimate with a speech in Irish of which there was no translation furnished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that in Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Well then it must have been that I got so disgusted with the Minister's attitude to the whole business that I was not in the House when the Minister was replying, but if the Minister wants particulars of individual cases I am prepared to give them to him.  I am a sportsman, and if the Minister is satisfied&mdash;I do not want to make a bet with him&mdash;I am prepared to forfeit £5 to any charity in Dublin or Cork City if I cannot supply him with the particulars of at least three very bad cases within my own area of Cork Borough.  As the Minister does not seem inclined to take that up, I had better proceed. I would also ask the Minister to give extra consideration to the poorer children attending national schools in the way of supplying them with books and utensils.  I would be slow to suggest <Col N="2138" /> that the Government should undertake all the duties of parenthood and act as kind of Guardian Angels to everybody, but we all know, national teachers best of all, that the parents of many poor children attending the national schools cannot afford to buy all the necessary books and utensils they require.  In dozens and dozens of cases the national teachers themselves supply these to the children out of their own pocket.  I could quote many examples of the kind for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a previous occasion I asked the Minister to indicate the policy of his Department in regard to married lady teachers.  I want to ask him the same question now.  I did not suggest then, nor do I suggest now, that if and when legislation is introduced which will compel a lady teacher to retire on marriage it should have any regard to existing circumstances or to teachers now in the profession.  I would like to have an indication from the Minister as to his policy with regard to future appointments so that if the Civil Service rule is made applicable to lady teachers, then lady teachers will go into the profession with their eyes open, knowing that on marriage they will be compelled to retire.  That may appear a very unpopular thing to say.  It may not be a vote-catching proposition, and I have antagonised a section, not a very large section perhaps, but an important section of these people in the country, so much so that a number of those national teachers were actively opposed to me during the last election, canvassing from door to door for no other reason than that I had made that suggestion here in this House.  As I have just said, therefore, it may be considered an unpopular thing, amongst a certain section at least, to advocate that policy in this country, but I have advocated it and will continue to advocate it, and I am satisfied, after one or two years' advocacy of this proposal, from the reports that have come to me from various classes of the community, rich and poor, that the proposal that I made then and that I make again now, that these lady teachers should <Col N="2139" /> be compelled to retire on marriage, has a bigger backing than I thought at that time and than I thought up to and including the last general election.  So that, with all the forces&mdash; I was nearly saying &ldquo;all the King's horses and all the King's men&rdquo;&mdash;of that wonderful organisation, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, against me, because of my attitude&mdash; notwithstanding all that, I actually increased my poll by another thousand.</P>
    <P>There can be no question of hardship in asking these lady teachers to retire on marriage if and when it becomes the rule of the Minister's Department because, as I have just said, they go into the service in the same manner as any lady in the Civil Service who usually has to retire on marriage.  I will be told, of course, that there is no analogy between the case of the civil servants and that of the lady teachers.  I will be told, of course, that as they go along the teacher becomes more efficient&mdash;the inference being that the civil servant does not grow more efficient.  I was told that, in answer to a question I asked in relation to the whole question of substitutes for lady teachers.  The lady teacher retires for a certain number of weeks and an assistant is appointed, and this wonderful trades union of the National Teachers' Organisation permits the exploitation of one of its own members in asking that teacher, as an assistant, to act as a substitute for the married lady teacher, something at about half or three-quarters of the salary.  I consider that that is an injustice.</P>

      <P>At any rate, these teachers who take the place of the <Col N="2140" /> married lady teachers on leave are usually paid something about half or three-quarters of the salary of the person who is on leave.  If that is not exploiting the teacher who is unfortunate enough not to have been married, I do not know what it is at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreathnach" hpid="Cormac Breathnach Cormac Breathnach">
      <NameTxt>Cormac Breathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion is absurd, because sometimes the married lady has many years' experience and the other teacher has perhaps only one year's experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Admitting all that, it is contended of course, and with some degree of logic if you like, that the teacher with twenty years' experience is more competent and more efficient than the teacher with only one or two years' experience.  On the face of that it is a good proposition, but it is not trades unionism as we would expect to find it in the I.N.T.O., because, as the Deputy well knows, if a man serves an apprenticeship at a good trade he is entitled to the full journeyman's wage when he finishes his apprenticeship of seven years.  The idea underlying the practice of appointing a lady teacher to take the place of a married lady teacher on leave is to appoint a teacher at a lesser wage.  But who gets the benefit of the difference?  Does the difference in the wage go back to the Department or to the married lady teacher on leave?  It is unanswerable. That is what is occurring.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made here to the Gaeltacht and to the cases of children who have had to be put into industrial schools.  In so far as establishing technical schools in the Gaeltacht is concerned, I agree with Deputy Dillon that it is one of the best ways of spreading knowledge of the Irish language.  There, you will be preserving the people who have kept the language alive, the people who will be able to teach some of the professors of Irish now how to pronounce words in the Irish language.  My experience, as one with a fairly well-trained ear, is that having heard the native Irish speaker and having also heard the newer specimen of Irish speaker, there is as great a difference between them as there is between chalk and cheese.</P>

      <P>So that I welcome this move on the part of the Minister to establish a technical school in the Gaeltacht where the people in the Gaeltacht will be taught to do something better than picking periwinkles and carrigeen moss.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister also to make full inquiry into cases where parents&mdash; particularly parents in the towns and cities&mdash;are penalised because of noncompliance with the School Attendance Acts.  Many cases have been brought to my notice where parents made every endeavour humanly possible to get their children to attend school but the children were able to evade the vigilance of the attendance officer, to evade the teacher and to evade the parents, but in the long run the parent was prosecuted and had to pay a penalty.  I feel that where the parents can establish a case like that, it is very unfair to penalise them.  The alternative, of course, is for that child to be put into one or other of the industrial schools.  I agree with Deputy Dillon largely that that should be the last step to be taken if possible, especially for the wayward boy or girl who has merely been guilty of what is termed miching from school.  I think that such a boy should not be brought into contact with boys who, perhaps, have been put into those places because of other delinquencies, to use a very high term.  I hope that the Minister will be able to give some attention to the points I have raised and that he will introduce legislation at an early date giving effect to the abolition of what I can only call the continued scandal of the retention of the married lady teacher.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 72:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After sub-section (2) (a) (i) to insert two new sub-paragraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(ii)  if such licensee was a partnership firm and such transfer of ownership shall be due to a dissolution of partnership firm the Minister shall in any case where there is no dispute as to the right of the surviving or continuing partners or partner to carry on such business transfer such licence to them or him: provided that in any case where one or more of the former partners shall on such dissolution have by the agreement of the parties or by testamentary <Col N="2144" /> disposition the right to continue to carry on a portion of such business separately from his or their late partner or partners, the Minister shall for licensing purposes under this Act divide such business between the partners intending to carry on in such manner as he shall think just and shall grant a transfer of the merchandise licence relating to such business separately as to portion of such business to one or more of such partners and as to the remainder thereof to the other or others of them; and in any case where there is a dispute as to the right of the surviving or continuing partners or partner to carry on such business or as to the persons or person entitled upon such dissolution to the ownership of such business, it shall be lawful for the Minister for licensing purposes under this Act either finally or provisionally and without prejudice to the rights of the parties as he shall think fit to determine such dispute in any manner that he shall think just and to grant a transfer of such licence as to the whole or separately as to several portions of such business accordingly;</P>
    <P>(iii)  if such transfer of ownership shall be due to the amalgamation of two or more businesses or to the conversion of a business into a limited company or to the reconstruction of a company holding a merchandise licence, the Minister shall on the application of the owners of the business transfer such licence to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It does not seem clear that the Minister has the power under the Bill as it stands which this amendment seeks to give him.  The case with which the amendment deals is that of a partnership of, say, two or three brothers.  The partnership is breaking up and the desire is to divide the service as between the different members of the partnership.  Paragraph (iii)  provides for the transfer in the case of a joining up of a certain number of businesses.  It is not clear whether there is power in the Bill adequately to deal with this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Bill as it stands, sub-paragraph (1) of lettered paragraph (a) sub-section (2) there is power to transfer a licence in the case of a person becoming entitled to a business under a will or intestacy.  In fact, the licence must be transferred in these cases.  In so far as the dissolution of a partnership is due to the death of one of the partners, the case is covered.  On the other point embodied in this amendment, the amalgamation of businesses, it is definitely not the policy to allow it.  It is definitely contrary to the whole policy of the Bill to allow amalgamation of road traffic businesses to take place other than with the railway company.  The intention is that those who get licences for road transport services will continue to operate these services.  They may pass into the hands of members of the same family, or by will or intestacy, but after that, under the process now, where there is to be new ownership, it must be a railway company; that is the policy of the Bill.  In so far as this amendment is in accord with the policy of the Bill, then it is embodied in the section as it stands.  The other part of the amendment is designed to do something that the Bill is designed to prevent.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as sub-section (2) is concerned, I agree the Minister has the necessary powers but, so far as sub-section (3) is concerned, the Minister does not contemplate areas outside the reserved areas where companies exist already, and where the railway companies will not wish to take them over.  If there are areas where the railway companies will not wish to take over, then, the absence of such a provision from sub-section (3)  would prevent the amalgamation say of two small companies run in an uneconomic way, and therefore not giving as good a service as if they became one amalgamated company. However, everything hangs on whether the Minister thinks there is any such area in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Ordinarily we would not be very agreeable to sanction two existing companies amalgamating their businesses.  Of course there is power <Col N="2146" /> under the Bill to transfer a licence but it is permissive power.  In paragraph (2)  of Section 8 there is power to transfer the obligation of a person if he wishes, that is to transfer the licence from one person to another.  The policy behind the Bill is to ensure that any transfer of ownership that takes place will be into the hands of the railway companies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 82:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 26 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister shall cause to be established and kept a register of all merchandise licences granted under this Part of this Act, and such register shall be in such form and contain such particulars as the Minister shall direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2152" /> (2)  The said register shall at all reasonable times be open to inspection by any person on payment of such fee not exceeding one shilling as shall from time to time be fixed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any person shall be entitled to obtain from the Minister a copy of any entry in the said register on payment thereof of such fee, not exceeding sixpence for every folio or part of a folio of seventy-two words contained in such copy, as shall from time to time be fixed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every fee payable under this section shall be collected and accounted for in such manner as shall be prescribed by the Minister with the sanction of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This is to provide for keeping a register of licences.  It was suggested that it should be open to anybody to come to the Department and inspect the register, and I agree.  There is no such provision in the Road Transport Act, 1932, but we have in fact always given information to anybody who is entitled to get it and desired it.  This section regularises that procedure in reference to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to put something before them.  The Minister was to exercise a certain discretion with regard to the tabling of regulations or conditions attaching to the various licences.  He said that he was introducing an amendment which would deal with all that.  Sub-section (1)  of this amendment says: &ldquo;The Minister shall cause to be established and kept a register of all merchandise licences granted under this Part of this Act, and such register shall be in such form and contain such particulars as the Minister shall direct.&rdquo;  Amendment 83 asks that the Minister shall keep a public register <Col N="2153" /> of all the merchandise licences issued by him and of conditions applicable thereto.  One of the matters of the greatest importance, from the point of view of information that we are looking for in connection with these licences, is what are the conditions attaching to them.  Under the Minister's amendment the Minister can keep a register that would satisfy the statutory requirements without making available in any way the detailed conditions attaching to the particular licences.  The amendment can be made in actual administration to do what the Minister was suggesting to-day that he would do and what amendment 83 asks.  But in the amendment as it stands, information that we have been asking for to-day and which we have been promised might not be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is definitely intended that the conditions attaching to a licence shall appear in the register, because that is obviously information which anybody should have for the purpose of applying for the acquisition of a licence, or anything of that kind. But it is clear also that information may be available which would be of a rather confidential nature relating to the extent of somebody's business and which should not be available for anyone to discover.  That is why the precautionary term is put in, in order to ensure that the information which will be available for inspection will be such information as can be and should be made public to interested parties.</P>

    <P>(6)  There shall be paid on every application for a vehicle plate under this section to the Chief Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána to whom such application is made a fee of such amount as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the Minister for Justice, and the payment of such fee (which shall be retained whether the application is or is not granted) shall be a condition precedent to the consideration of such application.</P>

      <P>(1)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a vehicle in respect of which a vehicle plate has been issued has been sold or ceases to be duly licensed under Section 13 of the Finance Act, 1920, as amended by subsequent enactments, or</P>

    <P>If any vehicle plate issued in respect of a particular mechanically <Col N="2158" /> propelled vehicle is affixed to any other mechanically propelled vehicle, the owner of such first mentioned mechanically propelled vehicle and also the owner of such other mechanically propelled vehicle (if he is not the same person as the owner of such first mentioned mechanically propelled vehicle) shall each be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding ten pounds.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that he is not doing a risky thing in inserting amendment 87?  A man may have two vehicles, for instance, and be a licensee for a transport service.  We all know that motor vehicles are likely to give trouble very often and unexpectedly they go out of order.  Would it be such a serious thing if a plate in respect of one vehicle could be used on another?  Suppose a man had a spare vehicle which was not licensed at the time, would there be any great harm done to the community, or any great offence committed, if he used the plate for that spare vehicle?</P>

In fact, a man is entitled to replace one vehicle by another of the same unladen weight for the purpose of a service, but obviously, if we had not some such section as this in, that plate might be used by a person who is not licensed at all, and who might evade the Act by the fact that he had secured this plate.</P>

I wonder would he, in consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, see to what extent the amendment moved by me to the Road Traffic Bill is being met by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and make such alterations on the Report Stage of this Bill as will fit in with that amendment?</P>

      <P>This section deals with an entirely different matter.  Under the Road Traffic Bill inspection is carried out to ascertain the state of repair and the suitability of the vehicle and that is a matter that required expert knowledge.  The only question that arises here is whether in fact the law is being broken and it is not necessary to have anyone except a member of the Gárda Síochána engaged on this work.  The question that arises here is whether in fact the law is being broken, and powers are given to members of the Gárda to enable them to carry out their duties in that respect.  There is no question here of the suitability of the vehicle or anything of that kind which would require skilled knowledge. There is no similarity between the two cases at all.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that if we accepted the amendment it would open wide the door to evasions of the Act and that every case where an unlicensed person was found to be carrying goods for reward would be found to be an emergency.  I do not think it is possible to accept the amendment for that reason.  It is possible to conceive cases in which a difficulty might be caused by the absence of such a provision, but these cases would be relatively few, far fewer than the number of cases of evasion which would arise if the amendment were accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reasons why cases of this sort should be covered in the Bill.  The Minister will have remembered that in the Road Traffic Act in England a proviso was introduced whereby a person who was compulsorily insured under that Act might not take in tow any vehicle and the result was that where a man's car broke down, if a passer-by came to his assistance in that grave emergency, and brought him into the nearest town or garage he was prosecuted and fined because there was no provision in the Act to cover such emergencies. The second reason for the amendment is this.  Suppose there is an emergency of the kind envisaged by the proposer of the amendment and there is a technical breach of the law.  You are throwing on the local sergeant of the Civic Guard the onus of making up his mind whether there was in fact a grave emergency or not, otherwise there must be a prosecution.  It is true that the Bench might discharge a defendant under the Probation of Offenders Act or something of that kind or impose a nominal fine, but what is the use of doing that?  It is an unpleasant experience to be brought into a police court even for a technical offence.  A great many decent citizens do not like to have to go there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the section which prevents one man doing a friendly turn for another.  There is only an offence when merchandise is carried for reward.  If a person is in the position of having to deliver merchandise urgently and gets somebody else who is not a licensed carrier to deliver it for him for reward, that is an offence.  The only emergency that could be envisaged in connection with <Col N="2162" /> this amendment would be an earthquake or a war.  In ordinary cases the law would be definitely broken if an unlicensed carrier agreed to take goods for reward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the law as it stands nothing can excuse a man going to his neighbour and saying, &ldquo;The licensed carrier has not turned up, these are perishable goods which must be delivered at once.  I will give you £1 to take them.&rdquo;  That would be a case of vital urgency but nothing can excuse that.  The amendment proposes that a discretion should be given here to meet that emergency.  Does the Minister seriously think that that discretion would disrupt the administration of the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister to take this aspect of the matter into account, that there is no compulsion on the Great Southern Railway Company, once they have got a monopoly, to send a lorry to a farmer who requires to have either live stock or produce forwarded in an emergency?  He may go to the nearest depot asking that a vehicle be sent to his farm or premises but there is nothing in the Bill to compel the Great Southern Railway Company to send that vehicle.  It is, I suggest, a serious thing to put a farmer in this position, a farmer who wants to send cattle or lambs or something of that kind to a fair.  His neighbour may have a lorry but he dare not hire his lorry for that purpose.  The Great Southern Railway Company may say that they are not prepared to carry that traffic or they may already have given him a quotation which will baulk him.  I would remind the Minister that in his own lifetime there were a few foot and mouth disease scares. Usually, the moment a scare is mentioned, people who have live stock will rush them to the nearest market town. In such cases it would be open to the monopolist company to say: &ldquo;We have no vehicle available for that purpose,&rdquo; and to refuse to send a vehicle.  That is an extraordinary situation and, one that is calculated <Col N="2163" /> seriously to interfere with the natural economy of the country.</P>

      <P>Suppose somebody is taken ill in a suburb of Dublin&mdash; Howth, for example&mdash;and a doctor is called up and he announces that the person who is ill has acute pneumonia and must have oxygen forthwith.  One must send some kind of conveyance to Dublin in order to carry out cylinders of oxygen.  You cannot bring them out under your arm, and you cannot very well get a licensed carrier at 2 o'clock in the morning. In the circumstances, one may have to ask the local grocer to send in his lorry to Dublin in order to bring out the oxygen.  Under this proposal the grocer is placed in the position that he cannot permit his lorry to run, as it would be a breach of the law.  No doubt he could run in the lorry and refuse to accept money for so doing, but a great many people would be reluctant to ask a man to drive fifteen or twenty miles without some compensation.  They would be only too anxious to pay expenses. Admittedly, such an occurrence would be very rare, but if this provision goes the court would have a very definite interpretation.</P>

      <P>If the case ever did come to a court the justice would act with a complete knowledge of the facts and decide accordingly.  In my opinion it would be very unwise to insert a provision which might be pleaded in quite a number of different kinds of cases, probably with no justification, as a reason for evading the Act.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Moore, it is a condition which will impose on the monopolist company as well as every licensee that they must provide the facilities that are required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act specifies excessive user.  Under this section, a man can put a tractor, or any other heavy vehicle he proposes using as a licensed carrier of goods on a road and, though he may completely wreck the road, the local authority has no remedy against him.  Take a county like Donegal.  Throughout the west of Donegal, which is a gigantic county, a very large part of which is very poor and the rateable valuation of which is very low, the roads are not very formidable constructions.  The people living in these areas are people who usually use a donkey cart or small horse cart, and for that type of traffic the roads are admirable.  To maintain roads suitable for heavy motor traffic in the West of Donegal would put an absolutely intolerable burden on the ratepayers of the county.  A haulage contractor can use these roads for lorries of almost any weight.  If the vehicles are very heavily laden the roads will completely collapse under <Col N="2166" /> the strain and the obligation devolves on the county council to restore the roads out of the rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Davin were a Donegal farmer living on seven acres of land with a poor law valuation of 35/- and were obliged to earn part of his living in Scotland as a migratory labourer and part of his living trying to catch fish which are being stolen from him because of the laxity of the Department of Lands and Fisheries, while his wife was trying to knit and his children to do odd jobs on the land in order to scratch a living out of the holding, he might not ask the question &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;  The answer is that you cannot take blood from a turnip, nor can you draw water from a stone.  The people cannot pay any higher rates in those areas.  They have a right to depend upon the Act of Parliament which gives the local authority power to insist that nobody can use the roads to the detriment of the ratepayers. The remedy available to the local authority is very rarely resorted to and wherever it is resorted to it is fairly and justly resorted to for the protection of the poor people.</P>
      <P>I do not see why these traction companies should not be made liable for excessive users.  They are not made liable for ordinary user, but under the Act I have referred to, if they put wholly unsuitable vehicles on the road they can be made liable by the local authority.  I think it is very wrong to withdraw that remedy from the hands of local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A section of the Public Roads (Ireland) Act, 1911, entitles the local authority to take proceedings against a person responsible for the amount of damage caused by the placing of excessive weights on the roads and damaging the road thereby or damaging it by extraordinary traffic.  The matter came to a head some time ago when a couple of county councils took proceedings against an omnibus company.  In pursuance of that, a section to this effect was inserted in the Road Transport Act of 1932.  The position is that the <Col N="2167" /> Minister for Local Government and Public Health has power under the Road Traffic Act to make an order closing any road against traffic which is unsuitable for that road.  I submit to the Deputy that it would be unfair to penalise a road carrying company for using a road where no order had been made by the Minister against its use.  That is what is behind the section.  If the road is unsuitable it should be closed to traffic.  In that case the licensee would not be able to use the road.  He should not be liable for damage if the road has not been closed to traffic.</P>

      <P>(1)  Any person aggrieved by the Minister's refusal of a merchandise licence, or of a renewal or transfer of such a licence, or by the revocation or suspension of such a licence, or by any condition attached to such a licence, whether on the original grant thereof, or on the renewal thereof, or otherwise, may appeal from the Minister to the High Court.</P>

    <P>This amendment seeks to provide that the Minister will not have the complete powers of life and death over everybody engaged in the road transport business.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 95:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (a), page 13, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;carrier,&rdquo; line 48, to and including the word &ldquo;company&rdquo; where it secondly occurs in line 51.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to make it possible for all those who receive merchandise licences whether a merchandise carrying company, a shipping company, or an existing carrier, to be brought under the same effective control as is proposed in the Bill, namely, the Railway Tribunal. Under Section 1 (a) and (b) it is proposed, apparently, to make provision for the continuance of the present management of the railway carrying companies&mdash;in other words, Messrs. John Wallis and Company&mdash; owned by the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways, to be carried on as at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, roughly speaking, 8,000 lorries, either owned by merchandise <Col N="2172" /> carrying companies, by shipping companies or by existing carriers, but under the Bill only about 2,000 of them will be brought under the Railway Tribunal.  That means, that out of the 8,000 only 2,000 would be obliged to submit rates and classifications to the Railway Tribunal.  The others being free of control would be able to carry on until such time as the railway or shipping companies or other merchandise carrying companies would be enabled to buy them out. Deputies know quite well that some of the existing carriers are by no means owner drivers.  I know many persons who own from ten to forty lorries.  In this case Deputy Moore need not be concerned about the poor fellow who carts turf on a by-road in Donegal, or about the man who will have to take cattle down some by-road in Blessington.  We believe that under the terms of the Bill 6,000 out of the 8,000 lorries engaged in the carrying business will be free of the Railway Tribunal.  I am sure Deputy Moore knows quite well people coming under the definition of existing carriers who are engaged in no other business.  With his knowledge of the transport business, can the Deputy give any justifiable reason why these people should be exempted from the control of the Railway Tribunal?  Why should they get liberty to operate freely while competitors in the same business are placed under the obligation of submitting rates and merchandise classifications under the Railway Tribunal? I hope the Minister will accept the amendment so that there will be uniformity in the services owned by the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways and that they will be brought under central management. This section is worded in such a way as to safeguard a continuation of the present unbusinesslike methods, apparently for the purpose of allowing Messrs.  Wallis to carry on&mdash; although owned by the Great Southern Railways&mdash;as a competing concern against that company, and to do more damage than has been done up to the present.  Can the Minister give any reason why 6,000 out of the 8,000 <Col N="2173" /> lorries should not be put right away under the control of the Railway Tribunal, or why they should get this freedom until some merchandise carrying company buys them?</P>

      <P>The sole reason why the classification must be fixed is to have maximum charges.  Whether it is intended or not, the effect of the amendment would be that a company would not be allowed to charge more than the charges fixed by the Railway Tribunal for the various carrying companies.  I submit that that is <Col N="2174" /> not necessary.  Apart from that, great difficulty would arise if we had to enforce maximum charges on all the companies.  I think no useful purpose would be served by proposing this arrangement.  It would involve a tremendous amount of work on the Railway Tribunal and serve no purpose. No difficulty arises out of excessive charging for merchandise.  The sole difficulty arises because the charges are so low that transport is sold at a loss, or at a cost that is uneconomic.  We propose to deal with that by bringing that under a definite form of control.  There is no problem of excessive charging.</P>

      <P>I agree that there will be a possibility of excessive charges arising as soon as a monopoly position is reached.  That is why this section has been inserted, to have the charges that will be applied by the company occupying that monopoly position, subject to control.  That is why maximum charges are prescribed. That would be necessary in these circumstances to ensure that excessive charges will not be in operation.  The Deputy's amendment is probably moved from a slight misunderstanding. We cannot possibly enforce minimum charges.  I propose to stop that in another way by eliminating by purchase those causing the damage.  We cannot do it in any other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not stop at the charges.  The section also provides for classification, and the Minister will remember that like the difficulty there was about &ldquo;millable wheat,&rdquo; which <Col N="2175" /> ended by everyone saying that they could not define &ldquo;millable wheat,&rdquo; when the Minister was asked to define &ldquo;class&rdquo; for the purposes of the licensee, he could not.  We are passing a statute regulating road traffic, one provision of which is that carriers must declare what class of merchandise they are going to carry, but no one knows what the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; means.  If licensees are brought under Section 32 they are obliged to adopt the railway classification which can be unsatisfactory, or, at least, unnecessary.  In any case they are obliged to submit some concrete classification to the Railway Tribunal, which the Railway Tribunal will control, examine, and delineate.  I should like to hear the Minister's view on the desirability of doing that, or, alternatively, I should like to hear the Minister's view as to how he is going to delineate the classes of merchandise, and the items which are to be included in those classes, which licensees will be under statutory obligation to carry as common carriers under Section 12.</P>

      <P>The policy, as far as one can follow it&mdash;and it is very difficult to follow it, because the more you hear the Minister speak the more he gets away from what he said on more important occasions&mdash;is that at any time, whether it be six months, twelve months or two years, after the passing of this Bill, all those who come under the definition of an existing carrier, not now controlled by companies, will, as a result of orders made by the Minister some time within that period I have mentioned, be bought up by a company.  My case is why leave them free from the control of the Railway Tribunal during the intervening period?  One has to keep in mind the possibility of a number of railway branch lines being closed down by order of the Minister.  He was very emphatic on that when speaking on the Second Reading of another measure.  Does he not see any danger, from the point of view of maximum charges, of the necessity for the elimination of those words, so as to control people who may get a road <Col N="2176" /> monopoly in the area where railway branch lines are closed down?</P>

      <P>Would it not be a very handy way for the Minister to shake off his shoulders the necessity for going into this question of classification with the licensee?  The licensees have to state to the Minister what they are to carry as common carriers.  The present difficulty is if they want to be common carriers of hardware the Minister has to go down the whole list of everything he can think of to see if they are common carriers of them.  If he sends them to the Railway Tribunal, the Railway Tribunal can ask &ldquo;Are you going to carry classes 1 to 8 of the railway classification?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On the point made by Deputy Davin, the only liberty which has been given to licensed carriers not covered by the section is the liberty to charge high rates for the carriage of merchandise.  Ordinarily, that will never arise.  That is not our problem.  Our problem arises because of the fact that they are not charging enough, and that consequently the whole transport position has become disorganised.  Circumstances may arise in the future where the danger of excessive charges would exist, but those circumstances could only arise when what is tantamount to a monopoly position has been created.  In so far as it may arise, it is completely covered by this section, as only companies who will then be operating will be subject to the maximum <Col N="2178" /> charges.  If a branch line is closed down under the Railway Bill the railway company must provide, before the order can be made, the road service to replace the railway services, and the railway company in relation to those road services will be subject to the maximum charges that will be set out by the Railway Tribunal.  I think we have safeguarded the public against the possibility of maximum charges, and it is not necessary to do as the Deputy suggests&mdash;to apply to other licensees maximum charges which will never be charged.  The problem would be solved if we could get everybody in the carrying business to charge the maximum charges which the Railway Tribunal fixes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I get some further information on this point?  As I understand the position of the road services under the Railway Tribunal, they have to give certain information to the Tribunal in order that the Tribunal may fix maximum charges.  That is a competing service with the railways.  There is no doubt about that.  The only jurisdiction exercised by the Tribunal is to fix maximum charges&mdash;&ldquo;they cannot charge more than so-and-so, but can go as low as they like.&rdquo;  Those road users are in competition with the railways.  What are the obligations of the railway companies with regard to the Railway Tribunal?  As I understand it, the Railway Tribunal fixes rates below which the railway companies cannot go.  Here you are putting them into competition with road users.  You are only fixing a maximum rate for road users, and they may go as low as they like below the railway charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quite admits that there are areas where road competition exists.  I want to get an opinion from the Minister on this question that I am raising, whether on this or on some other section.  When the Minister pointed out to Deputy Davin that the only jurisdiction exercised by the Railway Tribunal over <Col N="2180" /> road traffic was to fix maximum charges, it immediately occurred to me that this was unfair to those in competition with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum charges will be fixed for road services owned by the railway companies. If the railway companies wish to compete with themselves in the manner that the Deputy suggests, of course that is another problem.  Apart from the shipping companies, which are a different consideration, the only services covered by this section are those owned directly or indirectly by the railway companies themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue is not quite so simple as that.  The Railway Tribunal fixes a standard rate, and at that rate the railway is a common carrier.  If the railway company goes to the Railway Tribunal for a standard rate on a certain article and the Tribunal fixes a rate, then the railway companies must carry that article subject to the regulations at the company's risk, but they can get anywhere within 40 per cent. of the rate at owner's risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard rate for the railway is fixed for the purpose of producing standard revenue.  That is the sole purpose behind it; that it be a rate, having regard to the volume of traffic likely to be carried, which will yield a standard revenue.  The railway companies are given a certain discretion in charging rates in so far as they can go 40 per cent. below the standard rate to get traffic against competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make out that the standard rate is a fictitious rate which is very rarely availed of.  The railway companies have a discretion to go 40 per cent. below that for competitive purposes.  The railway company is a licensed carrier and not an authorised undertaker under this measure and can drop down to any level it likes without any reference to the Railway Tribunal, whereas if the amendment were carried a licensed carrier would be placed in exactly the same position as an authorised undertaker.</P>

      <P>The inference is perfectly clear.  The Minister should read sub-section (1).  That sub-section says &ldquo;the licensee under such licence shall, within three months after such grant or transfer or after such business becomes owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an authorised (merchandise carrying) company or a shipping company (as the case may be) submit to the Railway Tribunal a proposal for the classification of the merchandise specified in such licence for the purposes of the application to such merchandise of rates of charges under this Part of this Act.&rdquo;  That means that he has got to submit classifications.</P>

      <P>The Minister is galloping along instead of waiting to hear. If he will turn to sub-section (3) he will find that &ldquo;the Railway Tribunal shall have power to divide any classification determined by them into a number of classes.&rdquo;  The object of that is to tie the licensee down to the terms of this award.  Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

It is true that the purpose of the section is to classify them for the purpose of charging maximum rates, but has it not got the second purpose as well? Are the railway companies not common carriers?</P>

      <P>That is what I want to come at.  There is provision, where licences are given, for the licences to specify the classes of goods that the people with these licences shall carry.  If the Minister, in his slapdash classification done under Sections 8 and 9, is doing that for the purpose of being explicit for the information of the trading community, then I do not see any reason at all for worrying the Railway Tribunal to turn in and deal with the classification of the merchandise that shall be carried.  In fact, I can imagine that the Railway Tribunal, working along the lines already indicated, probably would give a less satisfactory classification than the Minister would give, bearing in mind that he is dealing specifically with road services, so that if the commercial community are being given a definition of the class of merchandise in the licences, then, I agree with the Minister that there is no point at all in worrying the Railway Tribunal and in having the carriers, who are going to be left for, apparently, a short period working along their present lines, to come before the Railway Tribunal and work out as between themselves and the Railway Tribunal a classification which they can, more easily and more satisfactorily, work out between themselves and the Minister.  If that is the trouble, I do not think there is any case for Deputy Davin's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that this word &ldquo;classification&rdquo; is leading to a lot of misunderstanding.  In the licences it is not so much classification as description. It is, so to speak, &ldquo;John <Col N="2185" /> Murphy is hereby authorised to carry potatoes, vegetables, milk and so on, in the district of Meath and Louth.&rdquo; That is all that amounts to.  In the other case, if this amendment is carried and the private carrier has got to be subjected to maximum rates, the classification means that he will have to divide, with the assistance of the Railway Tribunal, his licence, that is, the goods mentioned in his licence, into various classes&mdash;potatoes in one class, milk in another class, vegetables in another class, and so on, for the purpose of fixing maximum rates for each of these.  What on earth is the idea of making a private carrier, whose existence will not be more than six or twelve months, go to all that trouble, and why go to the expense of getting the Railway Tribunal to examine these classes and fix these maximum rates for the different classes of goods when there is no likelihood that the private carrier would be charging these rates, and when there is no proposal before the Dáil that he should charge any rate?  The proposal is that he should be at liberty to charge anything he likes subject to a maximum charge. The whole of this Bill has arisen through private carriers charging too low a price for the carriage of their goods, but here we are bothering about minimum rates for fear they would charge too little.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore is a very able Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister and the Deputy is not half so innocent as he pretends to be in these debates in this House.  Both the Minister and Deputy Moore, for the purpose of good argument, are endeavouring to persuade Deputies that the railway company will get a monopoly under the terms of this measure.  I do not think that is likely to happen.  They appear to think the railway company will have complete control over the 5,000 or 6,000 lorries for twelve months after this Bill passes. Where would they get the money to buy all these buses and who will buy them?  We must link up with the Minister's speeches on this amendment the statement he has made already that he has positive evidence in his possession that a good case can be made for the <Col N="2186" /> closing down of certain branch lines of the railways and that deputations need not be brought to him nor representations made to him about it.  Let us suppose that that applies to the branch lines in Co. Kerry and in Co. Clare. The Minister knows that there are operating in both of these counties at the present time people who will come under the definition of private carriers and who would have a monopoly. Would the Minister contradict that?</P>

      <P>Formerly carried on the roads.  I would like to connect that with the other statement made.  The Minister talks of railway transport both on rail and road and that connected <Col N="2187" /> with the words &ldquo;directly or indirectly.&rdquo;  He makes provision for having road service indirectly controlled by the company.  He provides for a road service to-day against the railway service competing against the railway but owned by the same shareholders. I contend it is possible for an existing carrier to get a monopoly in a part of the country where railway branch lines are almost certain to be closed down, and in that way they will escape being brought under the jurisdiction of the Railway Tribunal.  The Minister will not make his case by pure bluff the same as the other night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is assuming the role of a prophet when he says there will be no occasion for enforcing maximum charges for private carriers.  It depends entirely upon the action of the company.  Will they go out and capture all the traffic on the roads, and side roads, and become real monopolists?  If one carrier should decide that the traffic is for his advantage and the Minister licenses one of the big carriers for a certain area there would be a certain risk. The private carriers themselves would be in the position of being monopolists and there would be a case for submitting maximum charges.  I do not believe, however, that the thing is serious enough.  It depends upon the Great Southern Railway and their powers when this Bill becomes an Act. I do not think it would be worth while to go into such points and make provision for such emergency until there is to some extent a real emergency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>No, a carrier that will not be in competition.  Let me explain. I can imagine certain districts&mdash;take Roundwood and places like that, hilly districts&mdash;that do not offer much attraction to the Great Southern Railway. The company may well decide to leave places like that alone for a year or two.  They are not there already and they may say &ldquo;we will not go there for a year or two until we have everywhere else developed.&rdquo;  During that time one or two private carriers may get a licence for the district. They would be in the position of monopolists as long as the Great Southern does not appear, and the same case would exist for fixing maximum rates for them as for the Great Southern Company whenever they have a monopoly.  At the same time I do not think the prospect is important enough to justify making a change.</P>

As I understand the position, in future, when that road transport becomes licensed, the competition will continue.  The road transport will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal as far as maximum prices are concerned. The railways which are in competition with the road transport will not alone have maximum prices fixed by the Tribunal, but minimum prices fixed.  Where are the conditions uniform?

The Minister has ideas with regard to this measure that within a limited period these road services, which are in competition with the railways at present, will become railway property.  I am not at all satisfied that that is going to happen in the near future.  I see monetary and other difficulties in the way, and I do not see any assistance given to the railway companies to meet these difficulties.  At all events, they exist and they will continue to exist for some time after the Bill becomes law.  Where is the equity in the treatment allotted to the two?  The Minister will see that the railway company are tied hand and foot by the prices which are fixed by the Tribunal.  Road transport, on the other hand, is only fixed as regards maximum charges.  It can go as low as it likes and take all the traffic it likes from the railway company.  Where is that inequality of treatment which exists at present met under the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>By these things: (1) in so far as road transport is operated by <Col N="2192" /> independent operators, the railway company are in a position to acquire them compulsorily; (2) in so far as it is operated by the railway company, if they choose to cut their own throat, I do not see how we can stop them.  That is apparently what the Deputy contemplates they will do; that they will start a war between their right hand and their left hand in order to serve some purpose which it is not possible to see. The conditions cannot possibly arise. If the railway company are anxious to stop the cut-throat competition going on now they can do it under the Bill, (1) by acquiring independent companies that are doing it; (2) as a consequence of the acquisition, by revising the rates which they themselves are charging on the road transport.</P>

      <P>He can charge what he likes up or down.  Deputy Moore has raised a point which, to my mind, is fairly important.  If the existing carrier is free to charge what he likes, I take it it will really be to the districts surrounding Roundwood.  He is not tied to any classification of goods, as understood by the railway classification. In other words, there is only a classification of goods under his licence, but not a classification as regards rates, since he is not controlled by any prices.  Is that the position?</P>

Can he contemplate the possibility of the closing down of a branch line where you have a large number of big market towns, and forcing the railway company, after having done so, to provide a road service which would take the equivalent by road of three special trains on a fair day?

There might be an objection on various grounds to admitting to audience of the Railway Tribunal trade unions whose headquarters are outside the Saorstát. That would constitute a difficulty.

A harbour board might allege that the interests of a particular harbour were being prejudiced by the fact that the rates of charges in operation in respect of services feeding that harbour were higher than the rates of services feeding another harbour.  They all appear to me to have a very definite interest in the charges to be levied for the various classes of merchandise to be carried.  I have no desire for restrictions in this matter.  I want to give the right of audience to everybody who can show that he has a definite interest in the rates of charges.  I do not see where the trade unions referred to in the amendment come in in that connection.  If that is shown, I shall consider the matter, but it has not been shown yet.

I am quite satisfied that, as a result of the provisions of the Railway Bill&mdash;we cannot discuss many of these provisions at this stage although the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has given us a considerable amount of latitude&mdash;will make it exceedingly difficult for the railway company to get new capital in the future.  We will probably hear a good deal of that aspect of the question when we come to discuss the Railway Bill but, at this particular stage, it is sufficient for my purpose to say that it will be difficult for the railway company to get new capital in the future.</P>
      <P>This Bill throws obligations on them of acquiring these other competing services in order to get the advantages which this Bill is supposed to give them.  Where are they are going to get the money?  That is my difficulty and I think it is desirable, at all events, that they should be given breathing time to enable them to consider the financial obligations.  I suggest to the Minister that if he does not accept this amendment in its present form the principle of it is desirable and that he should determine the period within which this compulsory clause will become operative.  If he cannot see his way to make a definite statement on that subject at the moment, it is one of sufficient importance for him to consider and to bring it up again on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, was, as the Deputy is aware, designed to enable each of the principal railway companies in their areas, and the Dublin United Tramway Company in the City, to acquire a dominant position in the passenger carrying business.  That was the main scheme of that Act and the policy behind it as explained by Deputy McGilligan when introducing it as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  To a considerable extent, that policy has been borne out and the end aimed at has been achieved but not entirely.  It has been achieved almost entirely in the areas of the Great Southern Railways Company, but it has not been achieved to anything like the same extent in the area of the other railway companies.  So far as the City of <Col N="2205" /> Dublin is concerned, it has not been achieved at all and no progress to that end has, in fact, been made.  It is intended, therefore, to take power to speed up development in those areas if such speeding up is considered necessary.  We are anxious that the position contemplated by the Road Transport Act, in relation to passenger traffic, and this Act, in relation to merchandise should be produced as speedily as possible in view of existing circumstances and it is, therefore, necessary to take this power.  It would only be utilised in exceptional circumstances because I think that in relation to most of these services, there should be no difficulty in arriving at agreements as to terms of amalgamation or terms of acquisition.</P>
      <P>The existence of this power, however, will act as a spur in the cases where delay has occured in achieving the policy of the Road Transport Act, 1932.  I think it is necessary that it should do so.  I see little advantage in enabling the railway company to buy out passenger services in its area if, in fact, it cannot get agreement to do so, no matter what price is offered, or in enabling the railway company to get effective control of the merchandise traffic and leaving the passenger traffic outside its control.  Similarly, in the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained in the course of the Second Reading discussion, the effect of the Road Transport Act of 1932 in the City of Dublin has merely been to eliminate pirating and also to reduce the number of licensees and the number of new entrants into the passenger carrying business, but it has not, in fact, improved the position in so far as the total number of separately owned services operating has been only very slightly diminished and, on a number of routes, competition, and all the evils associated with competition, still exists.  I had, during last year, tentative discussions with interested parties as to the position in the City of Dublin, but I was unable to get very far in the matter of the determination of a policy for an improvement of the position here.  If the Bill goes through as drafted we will have some more power to ensure that <Col N="2206" /> those people interested in the position in the city will definitely determine a policy and make plans designed to ensure that within a reasonable time the position here will be improved and that the evils against which the 1932 Act was directed will be eliminated. I would be very slow to use the powers given here in relation to the city position, but I think they should exist to be used in the event of the position which I found existing last year continuing to operate in the future.</P>

      <P>I beg to move, on behalf of Deputy McGilligan, amendment 119:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>An application for an order transferring a particular merchandise (existing carrier's) licence shall indicate to what extent the applicant desires to have transferred to him in addition to the licence:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the vehicles and parts thereof used by the existing carrier for the purpose of such existing carrier's business, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the garages and garage or other accommodation used in connection with such existing carrier's business and any interest in such garages and other accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides for the transfer of a licence.  Sections 48 and 49 provide for compensation in respect of injury suffered as a result of the compulsory transfer of a licence.  If this amendment is accepted, an amendment on similar lines will need to be introduced to deal with the passenger side.  This part of the Bill proposes that there may be compulsory acquisition by an authorised merchandise carrying company of another company in a certain set of circumstances. That company probably has been operating for some time and it possesses a certain amount of storage <Col N="2208" /> accommodation, certain offices and certain transport vehicles.  In the case of passenger services, perhaps it may have a certain number of well-established garages as well as buses and offices.  It strikes one as being reasonable that, when a company makes application for the purpose of compulsorily taking over another company, it should in the application indicate for the information of the arbitrator what exactly it proposes to take over in the way of plant and equipment belonging to the other company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides that the licence only will be transferred and compensation will be assessed on the basis of the pecuniary loss sustained by the transferor.  If the railway company acquires certain vehicles, garages and other equipment of the licensee, then the compensation will cover their value.  If, on the other hand, the transfer of the licence does not involve the transfer of equipment, and if the vehicles are of no value to the licensee, then the pecuniary loss sustained by him will be increased to that extent and the compensation paid will recoup him for any loss in that respect.  The idea is to leave all these matters to the arbitrator. Deliberately we have left out the question of property because it would complicate the matter considerably. It would involve questions of ownership, mortgages, charges on property and other questions which it would be difficult for a Minister to deal with.  We think that the arbitrator can deal with all these matters in a satisfactory way when calculating the pecuniary loss which the person who transfers sustains arising out of the transfer of the licence.</P>

      <P>Is it no part of the Minister's scheme to arrange that as well as compulsory acquisition of a licence there may be compulsory acquisition of part of the company's plant?  My point is that there may be powers compulsorily to acquire certain parts of the plant, whether it be offices or garages or vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The licence only can be compulsorily acquired.  In addition to <Col N="2209" /> the licence, the acquiring company may desire to get a garage, in which case the payment to the transferor will include this loss as distinct from the pecuniary loss sustained by him following on the transfer of the licence.  If the acquiring party does not desire to take the vehicles or the garage it is quite possible they may be left on the hands of the ex-licensee and be of no value to him, in which case they would have to be taken into account in assessing the pecuniary loss.  It seems to be the simplest method, where agreement cannot be reached, to leave all these questions to be investigated and decided by the arbitrator.  It would not be advisable to lay down in relation to the property any definite rule that might have to be followed.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister will realise that the licensee cannot know too soon what scheme is intended by the party who are desirous of acquiring his licence.  This amendment does not propose to impose any penalties or to make anything compulsory. It merely leaves the licensee in the position that at the earliest possible moment, when he gets notice that someone wants to acquire his licence, there will be an indication given him of the intentions with regard to the rest of his plant and premises. Surely he is entitled to know the intentions at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may take it that no order for compulsory acquisition will be made until the method of private negotiation has been tried and found impracticable.  If a railway company come for an order to acquire a licence, they would be told that they must endeavour to effect a purchase by private negotiation first.  All those matters would then be considered between the two parties.  In the event of no agreement being found possible, and public interest necessitating it, a Ministerial order for compulsory acquisition or sale would be made. The licensee will not be taken by surprise. He will have probably very long discussions with the other party before any question of an order will arise.</P>

    <P>The following amendment stood in the name of Deputy McGilligan:&mdash;</P>
    <P>126.  Before Section 46 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  No order shall be made by the Minister upon any application under this part of this Act without the consent in writing of the holder of the licence to which such application is directed (in this section called the licensee) until the matter of such application shall have been investigated by a committee of inquiry under this section nor unless the application shall be justified&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  where such application is for an order transferring a licence, by evidence that the business carried on under such licence has during the six months immediately preceding the date of such application been conducted in a manner so inefficient or with so defective an organisation or so inadequate an equipment as to be prejudicial to the public interest, or</P>
    <P>(b)  where such application is for an order reducing classes of merchandise or the area of operation specified in a licence, by evidence that the business carried on under such licence has with respect to any class of merchandise which the applicant seeks to have eliminated from such licence or within any area which the applicant seeks to have excluded from such licence (as the case may be) been conducted in a manner so inefficient or with so defective an organisation or so inadequate an equipment as to be prejudicial to the public interest.</P>
    <P>(2)  A committee of inquiry under this section shall consist of three persons, of whom one shall be the chairman of such committee appointed by the Minister, another shall represent existing carriers where a merchandise (existing carrier's) licence is concerned or the holders of annual passenger licences where an annual passenger licence is concerned, and the third shall represent <Col N="2212" /> the authorised (merchandise carrying) and authorised (passenger carrying) companies.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister shall constitute a panel of twelve existing carriers and a panel of twelve holders of annual passenger licences and a panel of twelve representatives of authorised (merchandise carrying) and authorised (passenger carrying) companies, and shall, whenever occasion requires, select from such panels respectively a person to sit upon a committee of inquiry as representative of existing carriers or of holders of annual passenger licences and a person to sit upon such committee as representative of such authorised companies.</P>
    <P>(4)  A committee of inquiry under this section shall have power to administer oaths, enforce the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, take evidence orally and by affidavit, hear solicitor or counsel, adjourn from time to time, conduct any part of its investigation <i>in camera</i> where the interests of justice so require or where the interests of a licensee may be injured by publicity, and to award costs and expenses; and the Minister shall make regulations under this Act to secure the effective exercise of all such powers and to regulate the procedure to be followed by every such committee.</P>
    <P>(5)  Every such committee shall make its report and recommendations in writing to the Minister and shall at the same time supply him with the minute of the material evidence upon which such report and recommendations are based.</P>
    <P>(6)  The Minister before determining whether or not to make an order upon any application under this part of this Act shall take into consideration the report and recommendations and minute of evidence of the committee of inquiry (if any) charged with the investigation of the matter of such application.</P>
    <P>(7)  Every order made by the Minister under this part of this Act shall forthwith be published in the <Col N="2213" /><i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, and shall at the same time be communicated by the Minister to the parties immediately concerned.</P>
    <P>(8)  Whenever such an order shall be made by the Minister, he shall cause a copy or print of the report and recommendations and minute of evidence of any committee of inquiry which shall have investigated the matter of the application to which the order relates to be supplied on demand to the parties immediately concerned at such price as he shall consider reasonable.</P>
    <P>(9)  No such order shall become effective until the expiration of 21 days from the publication of the same in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, or, in case there shall be an appeal from such order, until such order shall have been affirmed by the High Court.</P>
    <P>(10)  Any person aggrieved by any such order may within 14 days from the publication of the same in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> appeal from the Minister to the High Court.</P>
    <P>(11)  The Minister may, in any case where new facts shall be brought to his notice, revoke or vary any order made by him under this part of this Act, and he shall publish in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and communicate to the parties immediately concerned every such new order in the same manner as the original order.</P>
    <P>(12)  An appeal to the High Court shall lie from any such new order by any person thereby aggrieved in the same manner as an appeal lies from an original order.</P>
    <P>(13)  Provision shall be made by Rules of Court for regulating appeals to the High Court and those rules shall provide for notice of every appeal to be given to the Minister.</P>
    <P>(14)  The Minister shall be entitled to appear and be heard on any appeal under this section.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2214" /> (16)  The decision of the High Court on an appeal under this section shall be final.</P>
    <P>(17)  In case the High Court shall affirm an order of the Minister but shall make any variation in the terms thereof, the Minister shall make a new order in lieu of his original order to give effect to such variation.</P>

      <P>Where there is a transfer of licence there is compensation payable following the transfer.  If, in addition to the licence, the actual equipment, vehicles, or garages are transferred then the amount payable to the licensee will include the value of the assets transferred.  On the other hand, if they are not transferred the arbitrator would have to take into account the difficulties the licensee would have in disposing of them; whether he could dispose of them.  In some cases he might not be able to dispose of them except for scrap, in which case the pecuniary loss would be increased accordingly, and the compensation payable increased.</P>

      <P>Yes.  A company applies for the transfer of the licence only and it is transferred on Ministerial order.  If, in addition, there is a proposal to transfer assets that is another matter and it increases the amount payable.  If it is not proposed to take over the assets that factor has to be taken into account by the arbitrator, in so far as the licensee may or may not be able to dispose of them.  These are circumstances the arbitrator will have to take into account in fixing the payment. There is no definite obligation on the railway company to take over the assets if they do not want them.</P>

I wonder if the Minister is satisfied that it cannot be carried a great deal further than he intends. Take a case where a carrier has sunk a lot of money in a business which is not doing well.  Could this term be stressed to cover any capital loss incurred?</P>

A man claimed that he has a premises the lease of which he bought by a loan from a bank, which has yet to be paid back. He said that if he is deprived of his carrying licence the lease of the premises will certainly be unsaleable, and he will be at all that loss.  He wants to know if I can tell him whether or not he is likely to get compensation for that.  I do not want the Minister to say, because he could only give an opinion, but I quote it as an example of the difficulties likely to arise under the section.</P>

      <P>In section 48 we have the words &ldquo;pecuniary loss and expense&rdquo;.  This section here deals with awarding expenses to the licensee who has been awarded compensation. I think the Minister would be wise to look over the matter&mdash;before the Report Stage&mdash;with regard to the tacking on of the word &ldquo;expense&rdquo; to the words &ldquo;pecuniary loss&rdquo; in Section 48, and to leave expenses to be covered by Section 51 as they are covered here.</P>

      <P>I wonder could we get agreement to take the Report Stage on Thursday evening or Friday morning if the amendments are circulated in time? I am anxious to get this Bill through this week if possible, because the Dáil will be adjourning for a couple of weeks, and the Bill would be under consideration in the Seanad before the Dáil meets again.  I do not, however, want to press the matter, despite the obvious case for getting those Bills through as speedily as possible in the situation that exists.  What I suggest is that if we could get the amendments circulated in time, and Deputies&mdash; having seen the amendments&mdash;are agreeable, we might take the Report Stage on Thursday evening or Friday morning.</P>

      <P>We are anxious to facilitate the Minister in the speedy passage of this measure.  I can assure <Col N="2232" /> the Minister that when we considered the question of putting down amendments originally, we put down the least possible number in order to help him.  We discovered subsequently that it was desirable to move other amendments, which we had not put down on this stage of the Bill.  I would ask the Minister to take that matter into consideration.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy could have the amendments circulated to-morrow I would then have to consider myself whether I would not require more time.  My position is that I do not want to press that the Report Stage be taken this week unless there is more or less general agreement to it.  It is possible that in another House some amendments might be considered.</P>
