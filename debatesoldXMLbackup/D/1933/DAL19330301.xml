    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, there has been no departure from public policy.  It is strictly in accordance with the Act.  Section 2 of The Gárda Síochána Act, 1924, empowers the Executive Council to remove the Commissioner.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The general direction and control of the Gárda Síochána shall, subject to regulations made by the Minister under this Act, be vested in the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána, who shall from time to time be appointed, and may at any time be removed, by the Executive Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not used capriciously.  If it is the opinion of the Executive Council that the public interest will be served by a change, the Executive Council is entitled to make that change and, if it does so deliberately as we did, then it is not capricious.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President if he will state when it is proposed to introduce the proposals for legislation necessary to secure the de-rating of agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Government in this matter was announced in the House last November. It has since been stated outside the House and approved by the electors.  As the Deputy does not appear to have understood, I may again inform him that it is not proposed to increase the amount available for the de-rating of agricultural land.  The Government proposes instead to reduce by one-half all land purchase annuities and other annual payments under the Land Purchase Acts.  This concession will cost the State considerably more than the sum that would be required to complete de-rating, and it will be of proportionately greater advantage to the agricultural population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the President's reply, it would appear that the Government have definitely abandoned the policy of de-rating which was preached in the country throughout 1932.  It is now definitely abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We have definitely changed from de-rating and we have decided instead to give a remission of one-half of the Land Annuities, which <Col N="36" /> will be of greater advantage to the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has received complaints regarding the failure of the Laoighis County Board of Health to make use of loans made available for housing schemes in the county; whether he can state the date when the Board made application to the Royal Liver Friendly Society for a loan of £35,000; the date when this amount was paid to the treasurers of the Board; whether he can state the date upon which sanction was given by his Department for an additional loan of £21,000 for a similar purpose; how many houses have been <Col N="39" /> erected or are in course of erection, and what steps, if any, he proposes to take in order to compel this body to make use of moneys already sanctioned for the carrying out of housing schemes in this county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations have been received as to delay in the use of a loan of £35,000 obtained by the Leix Board of Health for the building of 71 cottages on plots already acquired and about 50 cottages of a new scheme which was being formulated.  The loan was obtained in September last and the Board then decided to apply it exclusively to the new scheme. This course was agreed to by me in October last, but subsequently on going further into the question of the deferred cottages the Board decided to revert to their original proposal. Tenders were invited in November last for 28 of the deferred cottages, but only 19 cottages were tendered for by contractors and the prices for these, save in three cases, were excessive. The three tenders were approved of and fresh advertisements issued for the remainder.  The Board originally invited tenders for masonry only, but in readvertising they asked for tenders in four alternative forms of construction.</P>
      <P>Tenders have now been received for 24 cottages and are under consideration by the Department.  Of the remaining 44 deferred cottages three have been abandoned on the ground of the sites being unsuitable and plans for the remaining 41 have been revised by the Board's engineer on the advice of the Department and are now before me for formal approval.  Tenders for these cottages can be invited at once by the Board of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this, the Board is formulating a new scheme for 293 cottages in connection with which about 50 sites can be acquired by agreement.  When these 50 sites are secured the cottages can be built out of the balance of the £35,000 loan.  In the meantime the Board of Health propose to proceed with the acquisition compulsorily of the remaining sites. The Board have also at present 560 representations for further cottages in <Col N="40" /> the hands of their Sites Committees, but until it is seen clearly the total number of cottages to be included in the further scheme the question of raising the additional loan remains deferred.</P>

      <P>I think I can correct the Minister by stating that gold size may certainly contain a percentage of varnish but that does not make it varnish.  At the same time I should like to urge on the Minister that it is a raw material for the manufacture of paint and that it is desirable to have the matter cleared up definitely.  I do not want to press him now to give an answer, but if he can get down to some logical basis in which we can find out what is gold size and what is not we would be much obliged.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt in our minds as to what is gold size, but apparently there is a substance commonly known as gold size which comes <Col N="51" /> under the present definition of varnish, and if the Deputy will be good enough to send to my Department, or the Revenue Commissioners, a full statement of the difficulty which he has experienced in this matter, I will see whether the definition of varnish cannot be amended to meet the case he has made.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstands the purpose of this question.  The Deputy, in his supplementary question, seems to have in <Col N="52" /> mind the actuarial investigation that took place about 1926 or 1927.  The investigation that is now proceeding is to see how far and in what way the fund can be put in a solvent position. Naturally, there have to be negotiations of a certain character with the various interests concerned, including all classes of teachers.</P>

      <P>In connection with this there is confusion in the public mind. I will not say that there is any confusion in the Ministerial mind.

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>It is hereby resolved under Article 38a of the Constitution, that the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Bill, 1932, be again sent to Seanad Eireann in the form in which it was first so sent with the following modification which is necessary owing to the lapse of time since it was first so sent, that is to say, the substitution in Section 4 of the figures &ldquo;1933&rdquo; for the figures &ldquo;1932.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to make any statement.  This Resolution is moved because of the Constitution, which, as Deputies are aware, provides that if a Bill is not passed by the Seanad, or is passed only with amendments to which the Dáil does not agree, after a period elapses, if a resolution like this is passed, the Bill can be sent once more to the Seanad, and if the Seanad does not pass it within a period of sixty days, on a further resolution being passed by the Dáil the Bill becomes law.  The accounting period is one of eighteen months from the day the Bill was first sent to the Seanad, or the first day there is a re-assembly of the Dáil after an election.  In this case an election has been held.  This Bill, I think, went <Col N="69" /> to the Seanad on May 19th of last year, and the re-assembly of the Dáil after the General Election took place on February 8th.  In this case the period ended on February 8th, and I am, therefore, moving this Resolution. The subject matter of the Bill is well known, and I do not think I should waste the time of the House by discussing it any further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Resolution. Notwithstanding what has been said by the President in the rather perfunctory address he has made to the House in regard to it, I do not think it any waste of time of the House that there should be intervention on this particular Resolution, even in the way it has been put before us.  I want to have understood what is being done.  We are now sending back to the Seanad, free from amendments which the Seanad put in, a Bill which bears on its face an acknowledgment that it is a breach of the Treaty.  It bears that on its face as a matter of draughtsmanship. It is there in the contents of the Bill as we discovered in the course of many debates on the substance of the Bill. It is proposed to send back that Bill and to have it made law without allowing any further time for the attempt to achieve what the Seanad had asked might be attempted.  In this House on 27th April of last year a resolution to the same end was proposed by Deputy Cosgrave.  It was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to this Bill pending negotiations and agreement between the Executive Council and the British Government upon the question at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now turning our backs on the method of negotiation and agreement. We are now going to put through a measure which, as I say, bears on its face evidence that it is a breach of the Treaty.  Very good.  Let us do that with our eyes open, and let there be a definite declaration from the many Parties in the House as to what they think of the Bill with that evidence upon its face.  As far as we are concerned, the important fact is that, <Col N="70" /> notwithstanding this measure and questions about the Oath, at the moment the Treaty still stands.  It has not, at least, been formally denounced.  There has been no straightforward honest breach and denunciation of the Treaty.  An attempt has been made to get certain things accomplished.  There has, however, been no attempt made to get rid of the Treaty in a direct fashion.  The result has been that those who profess themselves Republicans find themselves attached to an alliance which they profess to find disgusting, and they find themselves further in the awkward position that they get all the disadvantages, according to themselves, of being so associated, and get none of the advantages of being inside the Commonwealth.  A Treaty was negotiated, and it was ratified at three successive elections.  It still stands. We of this Party stand for the national progress of this country in every way, including both advance in political status and advances for the temporal or economic welfare of the people.  We believe still that both the temporal welfare of the people and their spiritual welfare, too, would be benefited, I do not say by association with the British Commonwealth of Nations, but by this people keeping their pledges when pledges have been given.</P>
    <P>In this House we have asked on several occasions, and we now ask finally, that the method of negotiation and agreement should be tried.  There could be no spiritual harm come to the people of this country in trying to amend by negotiation and by agreement with the other party anything found distasteful in the agreement. There could be even little harm done temporally by attempting such a thing. There could be no harm done spiritually in attempting this negotiation. I feel, however, that what we have now before us is a denunciation of the instrument, and it is quite clear that great spiritual harm can be worked by the bad example given to private citizens if they follow that example in their private lives, by the Government's declaration that they are going to take certain action in face of <Col N="71" /> the contention that what they intend to do is a breach of an agreement, and despite the fact that the other party hold that it is a breach of the Treaty. We have it established clearly&mdash;though it is an incidental and a minor point&mdash; that grave temporal harm is being done to the people of the country.</P>
    <P>We have over and over again suggested this method of negotiation and except for the speech which the President made on the first day the Bill was discussed on Second Reading, there has been no effort made to show cause why negotiation should not be attempted.  The President's argument on that occasion did not sound well. It did not sound as if he believed in the argument that by negotiating about this matter the Government would lay themselves open to the objection from this side, that the mere act of negotiating was prejudicing our claims and so destroying the fruit of all the progress that ten years had achieved.</P>
    <P>That was answered&mdash;answered many times, and answered by reasoned statements. From every quarter of the House when the Bill was on Second Stage there came this further offer to the President that if he did attempt negotiation, he would go across to negotiate with the full approval of every Party in the House.  Seven or eight Deputies from this Party said so. At least two Deputies from the Independent group said so.  The President could have gone across to negotiate without prejudicing his later actions in any way and could have taken steps towards negotiation with the full approval of this House, with unanimity from every Party.  Instead he preferred the method of declaring his Party's point of view, and of acting upon a legal opinion which established that the point at issue was doubtful, and in the revealed circumstances that there were divided opinions on it as far as the legal advisers of the Government were concerned.</P>
    <P>We still believe that the only approach to this subject should be by that method of negotiation.  We take our stand on this, that there was an agreement made and that it was sanctioned at three elections.  We take <Col N="72" /> our stand further on this: that this country can at any moment denounce that Treaty but we think that the one thing it should not do is to break it, break it by act of one of the two parties and in the teeth of the statement that the other people do consider this legislation to be a breach of the Treaty.  We think that there is no cause why this irregular course of action should be followed.  If the President would only survey, as he now can survey from the inside, the progress that has been made in changing certain aspects of the Treaty by the process of negotiation&mdash; the negotiations were so successful that they drew from himself shortly after his advent as President of the country the remark that more progress had been made than he in 1921 or 1922 would have thought possible&mdash;he would see that he is now in a very strong position to act through negotiations. He has refused negotiations.  He is embarking on this course which I say is bad temporally for the people of this country, and as an example is calculated to work grave spiritual harm to the people of this country, in their private lives in their dealing one with the other.</P>
    <P>There is this one last aspect of the matter.  A motion stands on the Order Paper, the first motion to be discussed in Private Members' time, asking the House to subscribe to the opinion that a reunion of the Irish nation founded upon goodwill should be the primary object of the Government and that every other constitutional issue should be subordinated thereto.  Does the President believe that the biggest national question outstanding is national unity?  Does he believe that the course he is taking with regard to this particular issue arising out of the Treaty is going to lead more speedily to national reunion?  Do those people who formulated this motion believe that harping on this matter and sending it back to the Seanad in the way that is now suggested is subordinating every other constitutional issue to the main question of national unity?</P>
    <P>We are now at the last stage of this matter, but even now the President, whether he heeds it or not, should have the position made clear to him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> Again I want to repeat what was said by at least seven Deputies on this side.  If the President agrees to negotiate on this matter he will get the full support of this Party in that matter.  If the President enters into negotiation with the people on the other side on this or any other Treaty matter which he finds distasteful and which he thinks is disadvantageous to the people of this country, he will have support in these negotiations, but if he is going to proceed on the basis of trying to do by the act of one party to an agreement, what the other party objects to, then we are not going to support him in that.  For that reason we are going to object to the Resolution being sent forward to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>During my time in the Dáil, whilst I have represented the City of Cork, I have never given a silent vote on matters of major importance or of moment to the people of this country.  On more than one occasion I differed from some of my colleagues, former colleagues, on matters of what I considered vital national issues.  When I entered Dáil Eireann I gave certain undertakings to the people of Cork that I would, as far as I was able, implement the Treaty, and that if at any time the people of the country, expressing their views through the medium of the ballot boxes, suggested that it was a desirable thing to get rid of the Oath, or in any other way to alter the Constitution of the Free State, I would be prepared to help in every way by negotiating with the other party to the Treaty to bring about the state of affairs desired <Col N="74" /> by our people as a whole or by our people represented by a majority.  I have endeavoured throughout the whole of my public life to fulfil these obligations.  I feel that we should have the decency, the manliness and the courage to repudiate the Treaty, not in part, but as a whole rather than attack the Treaty piecemeal as we are doing; doing what I consider the unmanly thing, and the dishonourable thing.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that these obligations in regard to the Oath were superimposed under the Treaty. There are two opinions on that aspect of the position, two opinions expressed in our own country, and we cannot neglect the important factor, that there is a very definite opinion on the other side, that is to say, a definite opinion openly expressed by the other party to the bargain, namely, Great Britain.  I do not attach too much importance to the portion of the Treaty dealing with the Oath, but at the same time, as I have just suggested, there are two parties to this bargain.  I have not the slightest doubt that if the President were strong enough and bold enough, he could have approached the other party to the bargain, and he would have little difficulty in getting rid, by means of negotiation, of what appears to be one of the most objectionable features in our Constitution.  Because of that, because I believe in standing up to my honourable obligations, and because I believe this country should stand up to its honourable obligations, I propose to vote against this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the administration of this new Act, I am afraid that considerable confusion arises in respect of the provisions for pensions for blind persons.  The definition in the Act of &ldquo;blind person&rdquo; is, according to my information, in danger of breaking down.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to ascertain what degree of defective vision entitles a person to a pension under the terms of the Act. The terms of the Act provide, I think, that if a person's vision is sufficiently defective to make it impossible for him to pursue his normal vocation, he is entitled to apply for a pension.  This would, perhaps, suggest that a person who was by trade an engraver&mdash;a trade which requires exceptional excellence of vision&mdash;might, with the advance of years, become entitled to a pension if he ceased to be able to do the finest class of engraving.  I should like the Minister to say officially whether the necessity of assuming spectacles would bring a person under that head; whether the fact that defective vision could be removed by means of that kind would deprive him of the right to a pension and whether he would be entitled to refuse to assume spectacles and to claim a pension on the ground that he had not sufficient vision to pursue his normal avocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We were aware when this Bill was being drafted of the great difficulties which would arise if the very stringent definition of &ldquo;blindness&rdquo; which stood in the original Acts were to be relaxed or modified in any way.  Because we thought that that definition was too stringent, we did modify it in that Act and we are endeavouring, by the exercise of administrative commonsense, to ensure that only people who would be considered by ordinary, every-day citizens to be incapacitated by reason of defective vision from earning a livelihood in any one of the normal avocations which might be open to them will be entitled to a blind pension.  I myself, though I am not the final authority in this matter&mdash;appeals lie from my Department to the Minister for Local Government <Col N="79" /> and Public Health&mdash;would certainly not hold that the mere assumption of spectacles to cure defective vision would entitle an applicant to a pension.  I would go so far as to say that in the case of the engraver who, owing to failing vision, was not able to engrave with the same artistic fineness as he was able to do earlier in his career, he would not be entitled to a pension merely on that ground. I say that a man with alternative employment open to him ought to endeavour to provide himself with a livelihood in that alternative occupation. It does not necessarily follow from the definition in the Act that a person who was not able to follow his ordinary employment should get a blind pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Local Government and Public Health introduced this Bill I welcomed it, but I suggested that its administration would be greatly simplified if the Minister would consult some small panel of reliable oculists, or persons of that kind, and if he would incorporate in the Bill some definition of statutory blindness.  I believe the Parliamentary Secretary would be able to inform us on this matter.  There is a regular system of measurement as to people's capacity to see which goes by sixteenths I think.  It would be very difficult, of course, to provide against malingering, but if a standard test, on the lines I suggest, was prepared it would greatly simplify the administration of the Act.  The Minister advocates the use of commonsense.  The words of the Statute give the citizens certain statutory rights and the law is not always interpreted in a commonsense way.  People have to go to the Statute and the more watertight we make the Statute the better.  What I suggest is that these matters should be taken into consideration and expert advice sought in order to ascertain if some more satisfactory definition could not be hammered out in order to provide security for legitimate applicants and to defeat persons who sought to take advantage of the Act to which they were not entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usual for the Minister for Lands and Fisheries to be present in this House on an occasion of this kind, but as Senator Connolly is absent in America we must excuse his absence.  On three separate occasions, I think, I asked the Minister what was delaying the opening of the factory in Crolly.  The opening of that factory would provide employment, which is very necessary in this exceedingly impoverished area. On each of these three separate occasions the Minister answered that the factory would be opened immediately. On the last occasion I asked the Minister what he meant by &ldquo;immediately,&rdquo; and he said there was only one meaning; but the factory is not yet open.  I asked the first question <Col N="82" /> six months ago.  I ask the Minister's attention to this and I invite him to communicate with the Department of Lands and Fisheries and ask them why this matter has not received attention.  I do not think it is necessary for me to point out the condition of things obtaining in that part of Donegal.  They are as difficult there as they can be.  The supplies that this factory could make available are wanting; there is a market for them in the Saorstát but they are not to be had.  I consider it is a grave reflection on the Department that the Crolly factory should be idle and especially when there is so much need for employment.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of simplifying the matter the original provision of £6,500 was spread over different Estimates.  On the Vote for Industry and Commerce originally appeared the sum of £1,500 towards the cost of erecting a hall of industry.  On the Vote for Agriculture and the Vote for Lands and Fisheries there appeared a sum of £500, respectively, towards the cost of erecting a State Hall.  That was 1931/32.  In 1932/33 the provision was spread over the Vote for Industry and Commerce, the Vote for Agriculture, the Vote for Lands and <Col N="85" /> Fisheries and the Vote for Technical Instruction.  There were four Votes altogether in respect of which some provision was made towards providing in the aggregate a sum somewhat less than £6,500&mdash;a sum I think of £5,200. In order to simplify the procedure, and in order that we might not have to have a separate discussion and separate estimates under each of these four Votes, we have taken it all under Vote 56.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, as I explained when this Vote came before the Dáil before, it is not my intention to vote against relief schemes, because I recognise that they are now essential&mdash;that relief schemes are going to be, as long as the present Government remains in office, part of the permanent economy of that Government, and that it will be necessary that relief schemes should form part of their permanent economy. We all recognise that there must be relief grants or starvation.  That is the policy of the present administration, but there are a couple of things on this relief grant on which I would like some information from the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am not going to repeat the speech which I made on the last occasion, but there were a couple of matters in it to which I would like to again draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  One of the matters is that employment under these relief schemes is being given out with gross unfairness, and that certain persons in my constituency, at any rate, are proceeding to dominate the giving out of work, and declaring who is to have work and who is not to have it, and that there is a policy of proscription in force, by which members of a certain political party are proscribed and are not allowed to get any work on these relief schemes.  And what is more than that, this is now spreading to other Government Departments.  I will have something to say on another Vote on that matter, but I will just simply mention the fact that it is spreading to other departments in order that the Parliamentary Secretary may recognise that this is a very real grievance. These relief schemes are granted by this House for one purpose, and for one purpose only, i.e. for the relief of people in want&mdash;and in the greatest want&mdash;and they are to relieve the people who are in greatest want irrespective of what political views those persons may happen to hold. Then demoralisation is bound to set in, <Col N="88" /> indeed has set in, in this State.  I cannot imagine anything more demoralising or worse to the people of this State than that it should become common knowledge that the benefits derived from the Votes of this House are to be enjoyed by supporters of the Party in power, and by no other persons.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, because I am sure the Executive Council cannot approve of what is being done, to take immediate steps to see that these relief grants are given out fairly to the persons in the greatest need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to refer.  I suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary that enormous sums are being spent this year for relief works and that a future generation looking back will see nothing for this huge expenditure.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should endeavour to think out, with the help of the best expert advice he could get, some schemes which would be, if not economically productive, that is to say, schemes, even though they did not return a fair rate of interest, so to speak, on the capital invested, would at the same time return some rate of interest, as there would be something to see.  But, unfortunately, the bulk of this money, looking at it from the permanent point of view, is being completely wasted. The bulk of it is being spent on road work and this money spent on road work is not real or lasting or even an improvement to the roads.  I see roads being widened and trenches dug along by the sides of them filled up with the most hopelessly bad road material, and sometimes not filled up at all.  I know, and everybody knows, that in a couple of years time the grass will have grown precisely where it was before and the roads will show no permanent improvement. Besides, this work, which is useless, is fully recognised by the men engaged upon it as being valueless work and this is the most demoralising thing of all.  Better give a man whatever you are going to give him, whether £1, 25/- or 30/- and do not ask him to do anything, rather than turn him out and say: &ldquo;You are only going to-day and you need not do anything more than a quarter day's work.&rdquo;  Teaching <Col N="89" /> a man to idle when he ought to work is more demoralising than paying him and allowing him to be idle.  And that is not alone our experience.  For many years in England when relief schemes and poor law benefits were being given to relieve distress, it was determined that work, which would be of benefit to a particular individual, should not be done, and therefore, the workman had to be kept on road work. Whenever you do not know what to do with a man the usual course is &ldquo;We will do something to the roads and give him work on them.&rdquo;  Now, in the year 1834, there was an Inquiry into the working of the Poor Law Relief in England&mdash;a very important and very famous Inquiry.  I will just quote to the House one passage from that Report, and it is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Whatever the previous character of a man may have been, he is seldom able to withstand corruption on the roads. Two years occasional employment there ruins the best labourer.&rdquo;  And that is what is happening now.  I will again press upon the Parliamentary Secretary that you have got to spend this money.  It is a national necessity that relief work should be carried on, but give up the road work and put them on something which is useful.  Put them on drainage, land reclamation, put them to something that is useful, but do not keep them on this useless work where they are idle, and where you are not only getting no value for the money you are expending but you are deliberately demoralising the people.  I do think that surely the Department of Local Government and Public Health and the other Departments of State cannot be so entirely devoid of imagination as to be unable to evolve any schemes which are capable of being in any way reproductive and are incapable of spending vast sums of money usefully, but are driven to spend them as they are being now spent uselessly.</P>

      <P>Not alone will I say I could not do anything of the kind, but I will say that anything of the kind would be entirely undesirable. What I do say is, that you have got to look to your various districts and see what can be done usefully in those districts.  You should not put everything in a sort of press and say: &ldquo;This is a scheme that must be universally applied.&rdquo;  It is because the Parliamentary Secretary evidently thinks that there must be only one universal scheme for the whole State, as his question to me certainly implies, and I say that is probably the reason of the breakdown.  I do not mean every parish should be examined, but every substantial area should be examined and see what work can be done there.  There are areas of land which are now lying useless that can be reclaimed.  That would apply to a great number of places in the County Mayo, County Galway, County Donegal and in other counties of that nature, but land reclamation is not at all applicable to Kildare or Meath, or at any rate only to a very small extent in those counties.  You may look at each county by itself and see what can be done to improve that county and get the assistance of experts&mdash;get the views of the Land Commission. See what drainage can be done here and there and where it may be desirable to spend the most money.  You should consider if it is not possible to spend the money profitably and not simply throw up your hands in despair and say there is no profitable way of spending Government money and then put people to useless work on the roads.</P>

Has he any other suggestions to put forward?  He says he cannot give one definite instance.  He <Col N="91" /> refers to a whole series of counties and sets out different conditions.  Let him give me a list of the things which have come to his knowledge.  On one occasion I offered the Deputy £100 for a definite suggestion.  I still have the £100.  I do not want the Deputy merely to sit down after making a declamatory speech.  I want him to give to the House the knowledge he professes to possess.

      <P>I told Deputy Flinn that he could spend his £100 relieving people who are in need. I am glad to say that at the present moment I am not in need of the Parliamentary Secretary's charity.  I think his offer is just the offensive sort of thing one might expect from the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am glad of one thing, and that is that the Parliamentary Secretary recognises he is not competent to carry out his work, and he wishes me to come to his assistance.  I am glad of it, because up to this I never saw any sign of modesty on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary; I thought it was the other way about.  I am glad to see that the Parliamentary Secretary, with all the machinery behind him, thinks he is incapable of evolving schemes without my assistance.  The proper thing for the Parliamentary Secretary to do is to discover areas in which there is a considerable amount of land which needs reclamation.  He might then spend his money in having lime burned, drains cut, fences made and the land generally reclaimed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that money was not necessary for such work while he occupied a Ministerial position here?  We never heard anything from him, when he was a Minister, about the necessity for such work.  I maintain that money was not provided for very necessary work of that type during the time the Deputy occupied a responsible position on the benches here.  This Government has declared itself in favour of providing work for all able-bodied citizens and, failing the provision of that work, it has declared itself in favour of maintaining the unemployed citizens at a decent standard.  I think that policy carries with it the acceptance of a national responsibility for the maintenance of the able-bodied unemployed who are unable to get work and a determination not to allow the financial responsibility to be borne, as it is being borne to an increasing degree, by the ratepayers.  I do not see why the ratepayers of different localities should have to bear the increasing charge for the maintenance of men who are unable, through the agency of the Government or the local authority, to get work.  I hope we are not far away from the day when the Government will put its declared policy into operation and so relieve the ratepayers of the responsibility of providing home assistance.  I hope to see the day when the Government will make that a national charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, too, have received complaints in regard to the method of selecting men for employment on relief schemes.  In some cases I am told that preference is given to members of the A.C.A. In other instances you will get the complaint that the men are selected by local Fianna Fáil Clubs, and it is stated that deserving, able-bodied, married men in receipt of home assistance are being ignored.  Members of this Party have conveyed the views of the Party to the Minister for Industry <Col N="94" /> and Commerce in relation to that particular aspect of the question.  I agree that it would be absolutely impossible to put, in clear-cut English, regulations which would satisfy everybody.  I agree that the best regulations that could be drafted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in consultation with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, would not prevent some complaints coming forward. The present regulations require to be altered and amended and I hope that will be done as soon as possible.  I hope when the promised regulations are issued that it will be impossible for anybody to make a charge against a county surveyor or the manager of an employment exchange to the effect that preference was given to certain people for political reasons because they had certain political affiliations. I am surprised at Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenny's lack of knowledge as to what is going on even in his own constituency. Does the Deputy know of any grants that have been allocated to the constituency he claims to represent or, if so, does he know for what kind of work these grants have been allocated? If he does he should know very well that none of the money in this Vote goes for trunk or main roads or even for county roads.  It is only for such things as bog roads.  Considerable sums are allocated to boards of health for waterwork schemes and the Deputy should know&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Waterwork schemes were carried out by the local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has spoken three times already.  The carrying out of these waterwork schemes should not be made a charge on the people in a local area.  I am very glad that the Minister has considerably increased the grant for waterworks and sewerage schemes, compared with the grants provided by the previous Government. The provision of these schemes will in the time to come considerably reduce the public health charges, which now have to be borne by the ratepayers in the localities where we have any of <Col N="95" /> these useful public schemes.  Time will prove that these will be a saving in themselves, apart altogether from the benefits to the people who occupy houses in the area where such schemes have been carried out.</P>
      <P>There is just another matter to which I want to refer.  I think the conditions of employment on these relief schemes are quite unfair.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is responsible for these conditions.  The conditions under which the men are working on relief schemes in the rural areas cannot be justified.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is very eloquent, but I think it is impossible for him with all his eloquence, to defend the payment of 24/- a week to men employed in a quarry getting materials for bog roads knowing that in the same quarries men are employed doing the same class of work for the county councils at a rate of 29/- a week?  Is there anyone who can defend the payment of 24/- a week to men working under the relief schemes while there are payments of 29/- a week to other men working in the same quarries both procuring the same class of road material?  I hope that state of things will be altered, and I hope that the local rate of wages will be paid to the two classes of men doing the same class of work.  I want also to say that the hours during which the men are to work set forth in the circular from the Board of Works are simply ridiculous.  It is simply ridiculous that men should be compelled to work until 5.30 o'clock on a December evening while the men who are employed by the local authority are allowed to leave their employment just before dark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say also that I think it is quite unfair that men should be employed on this class of work without having their cards stamped by the authority responsible for giving the employment.  I hope these matters will be looked into at once.  I know that representations were made by members of my Party on this matter during the past few months and before the Dissolution of the Dáil.  We were then <Col N="96" /> assured that these matters were under the consideration of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance. I hope before this Vote passes that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to make some statement with regard to the matters complained of.</P>

I would like now to have the assurance of the Parliamentary Secretary that this resolution will have effect given to it.  The Cavan County Council will undertake to formulate and prepare schemes and furnish them to the Parliamentary Secretary with a view to having them carried out.</P>

      <P>For years I have been listening to debates on these relief schemes.  We had these debates here when Fianna Fáil Deputies were on these benches.  Time and again, year in and year out it was said that unemployment was not going to be relieved by relief schemes.  But on different occasions since the Fianna Fáil Government came into power we have these schemes for the relief of unemployment put forward in just the same way.  I do not care what work is being carried out under these relief schemes.  I believe all power is being taken out of the hands of the county surveyors and the assistant county surveyors.  In the West of Ireland all the power lies in the hands of the members of the local authority and in the hands principally of the Fianna Fáil members of these local authorities. I am not speaking from hearsay.  I am going to give the House a few instances of men who worked under relief schemes generally.  I know of two men, one of whom worked for one week, who were dismissed by order of the Secretary of the Galway Board of Health.  The dismissal order was <Col N="97" /> signed by the Secretary of the Board of Health who stated that he was instructed to inform these men that their services were no longer required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

      <P>Was this under a relief scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, under a relief scheme in Galway town.  In that scheme there were 50 men employed. Within a few days after another letter came from the Secretary of the Galway Board of Health dismissing the ganger who was in charge of 50 men, on that particular scheme without any reason whatsoever.  I know that that ganger was fully qualified to carry out the work.  There were very few men qualified to act as foreman over 50 men or able to handle 50 men properly. But this man had been certified by the engineer as most satisfactory.  The engineer in charge of the area approved of his work.  These are the conditions under which relief schemes are being carried out in Galway.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to take a note of these matters and to say whether the Chairman of the Board of Health has any power to order the dismissal of men working on relief schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that men worthy of employment and who are most in need of the work on these roads should be given priority.  I know of several cases in the County of Galway where men who have been working on the roads for the past three or four years are big farmers.  Some of these men got land, as much as 30 or 40 acres within the last eight or ten years.  I say that it is not fair that such men should get employment on relief works.  Men who have land should be made work on it and the relief work given to the unemployed who have no land.  Deputy Davin made a remark in regard to what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said about drainage&mdash;that is that relief grants should be given for drainage schemes.  I take it that is what Deputy Davin referred to.  I have not seen any relief grants for drainage under previous votes.  Deputy Davin said that money was given under the Land Commission schemes and not under these relief schemes.  Deputy Davin also <Col N="98" /> stated that there was a big amount of work being carried out in the way of waterworks and sewerage works in the different counties.  I cannot say the same in regard to Galway.  I know that in Tuam in North Galway a demand was made time and again for help in the carrying out of a sewerage scheme in that town.  The sewerage in Tuam at present is by an open drain. The people have asked for a grant to carry out proper sewerage works there but none has been given them.  The grants are not sufficient and the local rates are called on to bear too much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and twice during the time of the present Government, and we have got no further.  I have seen no grants given in the way of sewerage or waterworks schemes in Galway except in Roundstown, where a grant was given for waterworks a few years ago.  Beyond that there have been no grants given for sewerage or waterworks schemes in the County Galway.  I say that it would be very useful if such grants were made available&mdash;I mean sufficient grants to enable the local authorities to carry out these works, because the grants given formerly were only about one-fifth of the estimated cost and were not sufficient, nor is the present grant sufficient.  The rates would be too high on the ratepayers if the work were carried out.  Another difficulty is the area of charge.  I would like if some means could be found by which the area of charge could be settled.  I know that in the different counties under the local authorities the area of charge is disputed time after time; the people cannot agree on the area of charge for particular works.  I would like the Government to consider some means by which we could get over that difficulty.</P>

      <P>It was rather amusing to hear Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies getting so vocal on this matter.  We had Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney complaining of the special treatment that he said was being given to one political party over another in connection with relief grants.  It was rather amusing to hear it coming from him when the late Executive Council were responsible during the last ten years for putting up a proposal here by which single men got preferential treatment over married men with families for all work.  Even if a man had a wife and ten children to support, if he had not served in the National Army a single man who had served in the National Army would get employment before him.  There was another special Department under Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's direct control, under which individuals, because of their political views, were hounded out of private employment and black lists supplied to employers, particularly to Messrs.  Ford of Cork, warning them not to employ these individuals.  It appears rather peculiar to hear Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney complaining now.  He also complained that two years of road work would ruin any man.  Any little money given for the relief of unemployment during the last ten years by the late Executive Council was devoted almost entirely to road work.  I wonder how many men are they responsible for ruining permanently during the last ten years.  When Deputy Brodrick complains about these matters we wonder <Col N="100" /> why he did not get any of these schemes put into operation during the last ten years, when he had his own Executive Council in office.</P>

I wonder how much relief money the late Government spent on it when they had the advantage of his voice in the Executive Council.  I wonder he did not put forward that scheme and see how Deputy Mulcahy would view it. Deputy Brodrick also complained of useless work.  I saw men under the last Government breaking half a load of stones per day and considering they were doing too much for the 29/- per week they were getting.  Of course they were all ex-members of the National Army and were entitled to the work, no matter who else had to go by the board.  I remember the second week I served on the county council I had to go down to Glanmire for the purpose of clearing out a gang of hooligans brought from the lanes of Cork City to work in Glanmire, five miles away, while married men in Glanmire were left idle.  These people got that employment under the direct orders of the late Minister for Local Government, Deputy Mulcahy.</P>

      <P>I have seen proposals that were turned down in 1929 by the late Executive Council brought forward during the last twelve months, and by reason of small grants being given under the relief scheme these works gave as much employment as if three times as much money was spent. As a matter of fact the result was that permanent employment was given to a large number of men.  I have seen that in my constituency. My sole complaint is that the <Col N="102" /> Cork County Council were invited to put forward schemes for these relief works.  They put forward schemes all right, but we have got no reply from the Parliamentary Secretary yet.  We are waiting for that, and we want cash, too.  I hope that we will have a reply immediately in regard to that proposal.  Undoubtedly, the amounts are not sufficient or nearly sufficient to cover the large number of unemployed that unfortunately there are in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to look for extra funds and see that the money, when obtained, is devoted immediately to the relief of unemployment in the rural districts. We find in a large number of cases that where you have work for twenty or twenty-five men on a relief scheme you have from eighty to one hundred men looking for the same employment. If there are any people who have reason to complain of the manner in which these relief schemes have been worked they are certainly the Republicans.  They have had no employment during the last ten years. During that period they were barred from getting any employment, and because of that they were unable to get married.  Therefore, they are largely single men and because of that they are barred from getting employment now.  The married men get first preference.  Because of the circumstance that I have stated, I think that single men with dependents should get the same preferential treatment as married men.  I have seen this proposal of giving a preference to married men work out very badly. I have seen, for instance, an old man close on 65 years of age having to go out to work, leaving his three able-bodied sons whose ages would range from 25 to 35, sitting down at home idle.  The old man had to go out to work because the sons were not eligible for it, but the father was on account of being a married man.  That is a matter that I took up before.  I hope that now something will be done to rectify it and that single men with dependents will get the same treatment as married men on those relief schemes.  I hope, before Deputies on <Col N="103" /> the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches again complain, that they will remember their past sins and not start talking about other people's faults.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the industry and the zeal of the Parliamentary Secretary, but I wanted to draw his attention to circumstances that may have escaped him which create a difficulty for the administration of this sum.  Most water and sewerage schemes are normally prepared by county surveyors.  Two such schemes about which I wrote to the Parliamentary Secretary, consequent on a speech which he made in the last Dáil, have been held up because the county surveyor has had so much work thrown upon his shoulders administering minor relief schemes that he is unable to find time to prepare adequate schemes for laying on water to towns and for sewerage improvements.  If some means could be devised whereby <Col N="104" /> county surveyors' duties could be lessened in connection with minor relief schemes, such as the making of bog roads and minor road repairs, there would be greater hope of getting some important and useful schemes prepared in such form as would enable the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to provide funds for them forthwith.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if there is anything fundamentally wrong in the possibility of giving assistance to the Electricity Supply Board with some of this money in this way.  I take it that light, water and sewerage are all very desirable public amenities for small country towns.  There are a number of small towns into which it would not be an economic proposition to bring the Shannon power at the present time. The result is that there is no street lighting in those towns and none of the amenities that a town is entitled to.  The Department of Industry and Commerce have laid it down that they cannot sanction an extension of the Shannon lines into any town unless there is an immediate prospect of an economic return for the moneys invested.  What I am anxious to know is: would it be possible to consider contributing something towards the capital cost of bringing the electric light into a town and then handing over whatever work was done to the E.S.B. on the ground that it was making available to a rural district a very valuable amenity, and at the same time was making available to the E.S.B. an added market for their current? I quite see that there may be some grave objection to that on the ground that it would establish an undesirable principle.  I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the complaints about the victimisation of persons who do not hold Fianna Fáil views, in getting work on the minor relief schemes, I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that cases of that kind are arising up and down the country.  I know how very difficult it is to prevent that kind of thing happening in remote rural areas, but I think that the <Col N="105" /> Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and, more particularly, the Minister for Local Government, could do a great deal to prevent it if they let the county surveyors and the assistant surveyors down the country know that where cases of that kind are brought to their notice they are prepared to take very strong action and hold them responsible.  The truth of it is that it is only men on the spot who can correct that kind of business, and unless the assistant surveyors know that they must compel their gangers to stop preferring this man to that man in a county on account of his political convictions, they will be unable to do anything.  The Minister for Local Government and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance should make it clear to county surveyors and assistant surveyors that if cases of victimisation are proved the Ministry will hold them responsible. They should be told that this is a local problem and that it is their responsibility to see justice done.  I do not believe that the central organisation can do anything more than to make it clear to the county surveyors and the assistant surveyors that they are prepared to insist on that.  I think if that course is followed victimisation will be very largely put an end to.</P>

Suppose a man who is a supporter of the National Centre Party or Cumann na nGaedheal gets a job, with a flourish of trumpets, at the labour exchange and is sacked the following morning by the local ganger, what consolation is it to him to say: &ldquo;You got your job even if you did get the sack afterwards.&rdquo;  It is a mystification but, perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary will enlighten us later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole objection is in the arrangement made with the labour exchange.  I have had experience of large numbers of men with families who are in receipt of home help and the men who were the first to get employment were the owners of ten and twenty acres of land, with a number of cows, against men in receipt of 5/- and 6/- a week.  We recognise that we are dealing with a national question but I do suggest that when public bodies put up proposals to the various Departments the least that should be done is that these proposals be considered with a view to remedying the state of affairs I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last Estimate I pointed out that, in my county at least, we had men receiving 32/- and 35/- a week and that, under the regulations made by the Board of Works, you were going to place men alongside them who, owing to starvation and unemployment in the area, were to be forced to accept 24/- a week, longer hours and not the same facilities with regard to the stamping of their unemployment <Col N="107" /> cards.  We had the Parliamentary Secretary adopting the attitude that these men were agricultural labourers employed by the Land Commission and, as such, not bound to be insured in respect of unemployment benefit, although doing similar work to that done by employees of county councils, on engines, in quarries, raising stones, breaking stones and spreading them in various places.  I suggest that some change will have to be made, and I know that it is not the policy of the Government, having adopted the policy of maintenance, to force men in the present wave of unemployment to accept 24/- a week.  I have advised men that it is better to take the 24/- than to have to live on 5/- or 6/- a week home help, but I warn the Parliamentary Secretary that there are men organising various clubs who will demand in my county maintenance for the unemployed, and I am not going to be a party to having men working at 24/- a week in company with men who are receiving 32/- and 35/- a week and working a lesser number of hours.  It may happen in the West of Ireland, but even there such conditions should not exist.  The principle whereby farmers paid for the improving of land running up to their houses under a minor relief scheme was all right, but when you accept men from a labour exchange and put them to work, I say that these men should be paid the same rate of wages as is paid by public bodies and they should receive the same benefit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has suggested that it would be better to give men 24/- or 25/- a week and not ask them to do anything.  Under the relief schemes sponsored by the previous Government's predecessor I have not found that there were any useless schemes put up.  Any scheme to be sent up would have to be put up by the county surveyor and submitted to the engineers of the Department and it must be approved before they give it sanction but, according to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, it would be better to give them 24/- or 25/- a week than to have them pretending <Col N="108" /> to be working.  My whole objection is that in my county at least&mdash;I do not know what happens in Mayo&mdash;men have to work longer hours and have to work harder for a lesser wage than they ever had before, and no scheme has been put forward unless sanctioned by the various Departments.  I am not going into the question of political favour because I realise that it may happen under the labour exchange system, but I do suggest that the method of employing men through the labour exchanges must be changed.  We want to get the most deserving men no matter what army they were in or what political party they belong to.  A man is entitled to work, and let an Irishman get preference over others; but give no favour to any man because he happens to be a supporter of Labour, Fianna Fáil or anything else.  I objected to that system when the previous Government maintained that unless you had been in the National Army you were not to get work.  The Minister's officials know that I have fought it in my own county and that we got work for every man no matter what his views were.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary asks for schemes.  I have sent in to the Forestry Department schemes in respect of thousands of acres of land in my county which is suitable for afforestation. You can absorb a large number of men and get useful work done under these schemes.  I admit that our county is suitable for it and we have had large numbers absorbed on minor relief schemes and under relief grants but much more can be done.  On another estimate, I want to say that you will absorb a large number of men and give plenty of work, work that will give a return, by placing men on forestry operations.  In Wicklow, owing to the recent storm, a large amount of property is in danger and you can put men at work on coast protection and absorb them in employment, instead of paying them home help, while saving a large amount of property.  I admit that you are not going to get 20/- in the £1 for it but you will save valuable property and give plenty of employment. £150,000 is not going to do very <Col N="109" /> much and I agree with Deputy Corry that it is insufficient to meet the demands of the unemployed.  Boards of health are overburdened at present. We have deputations and marches from the unemployed demanding maintenance because they have got letters from the Local Government Department pointing out that it is their duty to go to the board of health and that it is the duty of the board of health to provide maintenance.  The boards of health.  I know, went out of their way to do all they could to relieve distress, but the Government should not ask boards of health and other public bodies to bear full responsibility for the maintenance of able-bodied unemployed.</P>
    <P>Most of the public boards have taken advantage of the relief schemes.  In County Wicklow every village and small town has availed of the relief grants for waterworks, sewerage and drainage.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to bear in mind what I have said about the small wages, the long hours, and the unfair conditions that prevail where men are engaged on minor relief schemes.  I ask that a change be made, because if it is not made the men will make it themselves. I, for one, will not continue to be an advocate of support for a Party that would ask men to work for what is merely sufficient to keep body and soul together, not to mention their wives and families.  On the other hand men employed by public bodies are treated fairly in the matter of wages, hours, and conditions.  Instead of the hours being reduced for the unemployed an effort is being made by officials in the Land Commission, who have the old British mentality, to increase them. Men are being asked to work 60 hours a week for 24/-.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have that state of affairs changed, and to say that he is not going to be a party to increasing hours and paying 24/- for work for which the men should receive 36/- a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that a useful way to spend portion of the relief money in County Leitrim would be on drainage, which is one of the most necessary <Col N="110" /> improvements that could be carried out there.  Arterial drainage is badly needed in that county.  Proposals have already been made to the Department and suggested works have been inspected by the engineers.  Some of these proposals were turned down because they were considered uneconomic. But, in the long run, if these works were carried out, they would prove economic, because the farmers are concerned, seeing that each year's harvest is damaged by flooding.  One scheme I have in mind affects areas from Lough Allen to Dromahair and has been inquired into by the engineers. Another scheme embraces the area from Glenade to Dromahair, and another in the opposite direction, towards the sea, from Glenade to Tullaghan.  Another is in the district of Ross Inver, on towards Kinlough. Proposals in connection with this have been made to the Board of Works.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if he examines the possibility of spending money usefully in County Leitrim he might come to the assistance of the ratepayers concerned by making grants for the carrying out of these schemes.  Work would be provided for perhaps 1,000 able-bodied men for a period of three months.  As the schemes are ready all that is required is approval by the Department. They could be carried out this spring.  Some of these schemes came before the county council, but unfortunately there were differences of opinion about the grant-in-aid and the danger that for a few years the rates might be considerably affected in the upkeep of the works.  These difficulties could be got over, and much needed employment might be given in large areas in County Leitrim, if the schemes were carried out.  The work would be reproductive and would be of untold benefit to the farming community. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will look into the possibility of giving grants in aid for these schemes, the carrying out of which would, I am satisfied, be of untold benefit to the county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add a word of complaint to what has been already stated from this quarter of the House <Col N="111" /> as to the totally inadequate provision made to deal with the present situation. Undoubtedly, the position is an extremely difficult one.  I find that local boards of assistance in County Cork have an increasing difficulty in meeting the claims made on their funds.  A striking instance of that was provided at the meeting of the West Cork Board of Assistance held at Cork on Monday last.  I want to say that I think the wages provision for minor relief schemes is nothing short of a scandal.  It is a most inconsistent provision, because in all public works and contracts that have to be sanctioned by the Board of Works, in connection with the erection of public buildings, there is what is called a fair wages clause.  There is, on the other hand, a very unfair wages condition in the relief schemes.  As soon as the Board of Works takes over the administration of schemes of this kind the hours are lengthened.  When schemes of a similar kind were carried out by the Land Commission work started at 8.30 a.m. and stopped at 4.30 p.m.  On some works now, where the wages are 24/- weekly, work starts at 8 a.m. and finishes at 6 p.m.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to try to imagine the position of men during the last two months who have been engaged on small drainage schemes, where they were standing, in some cases, up to their waists in water for 4/- a day.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he is satisfied with that position.  I think he should be ashamed of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer also to the very frequent complaints made to me, and to other members of this Party, about the selection of men and of gangers.  I do not want to vouch for all the complaints made, but they are of such frequency, and made in such increasing volume, that I am inclined to believe there is something in the story.  For instance, it has been stated that lists of gangers to be employed on relief schemes were sent from the office of the Board of Works to county surveyors. I am aware of the fact that a good many people so recommended were people who worked previously for <Col N="112" /> the Land Commission, but I understand that quite a number of people who never did any work of the kind before, such as ex-shop assistants and others, were recommended for political reasons.  If that is so it is a shame.  I characterise it as a shame, and I dissociate myself from action of the kind.  It has been suggested that men have been victimised for political reasons.  That has been suggested so often that I am inclined to believe there is something in the story.  In connection with relief works it has been reported to me that men have gone round and told the unemployed that unless they belonged to certain clubs and certain organisations they would not get work.  If that is so it is not only a shame but a public scandal.  I want to say that if certain men attempt to play that game they will be met and beaten at it.</P>
    <P>This is not the time, certainly it is the last time that any attempt to exercise political preference should be made.  We on this side of the House opposed the same preference under a previous administration and we shall certainly oppose it as strongly now because we think it is decidedly unfair.</P>
    <P>In connection with work that should be carried out in future, drainage appears to be the most urgent, the most necessary and the most useful. Cork County Council submitted to the Parliamentary Secretary a scheme embracing very wide opportunities for drainage work.  Quite a number of schemes have been already examined, during the last two or three years, by the local surveyors and are ready to be executed as soon as sanction is given for the execution of the work.  I can see very much greater possibility of doing useful and necessary work by the expenditure of money on drainage than in other directions.  Quite a number of schemes of that kind are available. Quite a number have been lodged in the Office of Public Works already.  I shall hope and ask for a very early examination of these schemes.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that when works of this kind are being executed in future he should make very careful enquiries <Col N="113" /> as to whether there is any foundation for the charges made very frequently, and made by responsible people, too, and that he will not have again the position that where a road is being made into two or three farmers' houses, one of these farmers is the ganger on the work.  That is a very undesirable position.  In work of that kind it should be possible to find a competent labourer, not from that locality, who could be put in charge.  He would see that the work would be carried out properly, and he would not know the political views, the relations or friendships of any man who worked under him.  It is not going to be permitted in future, and if it is tried in the country or in the Office of Public Works it will be exposed.  I want to express the hope that as a result of this discussion the slightest sign of anything like that will be completely and ruthlessly wiped out in the future.</P>
    <P>I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will be in a position to indicate shortly what further provision is to be made in this respect.  The provision that has to be made up to the present would be some way useful in normal circumstances, but the present situation is not normal.  It is altogether abnormal. It is extremely difficult and hard, and the people who have to suffer most in the present situation are people who have nothing to sell but their labour. There should be greater opportunities for the sale of that labour by the provision of further moneys.  I suggest that that can best be done by the initiation of a very large number of useful drainage schemes that can be carried out at small expense and with the greatest possibility of useful results in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring under the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary the condition of the streets of Carrick, in Tipperary.  I think I can say that their condition is the worst in Ireland.  They have not been repaired in the past for the reason that the sewerage was not considered to be in a fit condition to allow of the streets being repaired as they were in every other town.  These streets are certainly now in a very bad state.  They are awaiting grants, and I hope the <Col N="114" /> grants will be forthcoming.  In regard to the references made by various Deputies to the manner in which the work under these unemployment grants has been carried out, I can say that it has been reasonably and fairly done in my district.  There has not been much room for criticism in that regard in so far as the work carried out by the county council is concerned.  It is news to me that a rate of 24/- per week is in operation, where, I do not know.  I have heard it for the first time here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard it for the first time here but I do say that it is hardly playing the game to pay such a rate with all due respect to everybody.  It has come under my notice also, although I do not say it is prevalent to a large extent, that there has been victimisation in regard to the political views of workmen.  I join with other Deputies in calling the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to this matter and in asking him to do his best to see that that practice is not permitted anywhere in carrying out these works.  I want further to complain that sufficient money has not been allocated in connection with road work.  I do not mind what some other Deputies may say, but I know that a lot of road work can be done and it is much better to do this work than to spend the money in home assistance as it is being spent in my county, to the detriment of ratepayers.  It was never expected that the rates or the ratepayers should solve the unemployment problem.  I think that is a task that devolves on the Government of the day.  I hope they will take it up and try as far as lies in their power to remedy it, because that is their duty and not the duty of the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters to which I should like to refer in regard to my experience of the administration of these grants in County Donegal.  Deputy Murphy has used very strong language and has said that instructions went down from the office to the county surveyors to select particular gangers.  I have made some inquiries myself concerning <Col N="115" /> the administration of the grants in County Donegal.  So far as the machinery was concerned, in justice to the office I should say that the order of procedure was, when a grant was made to a county council, that the county surveyors were put in complete charge of the money to be spent.  I never heard that any further instructions were sent to them, but there were grave complaints that where a ganger was selected, he generally got himself pushed on, for some reason unknown to me or perhaps unknown to anybody.  That ganger was usually the head of a Sinn Féin Club and he would not employ any worker unless he was a member of the club.  I think that it is unfair to attribute that to the Office of Public Works.  It is very unfair to charge the county surveyor with it either because it may well be that he would not know anything about the politics of the man.  It undoubtedly was the case in various districts that the ganger appointed was a violent political partisan and that he openly refused to employ men, poor men with families, on these jobs, because of their political views.  I want it to be clearly and distinctly understood that I am not attributing that to the office, because as far as I know no instructions of any kind went out from the office.  The county surveyors in the respective counties were put in complete control of this money.</P>
      <P>Secondly, with regard to the spending of this money, I agree that this road work is very necessary and very useful, but I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to apportion some of this money for drainage purposes. The difficulty is that when this kind of work is given in the winter time money is scarce and it is very difficult to carry out these drainage schemes.  Hence I would recommend that a portion of this money should be given in the summer time when the weather is dry and such work could be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Before proceeding with what I want to say, I want in the first place to pay a tribute to the Government for the amount of money that they have made available to local <Col N="116" /> authorities to do certain useful work; but, at the same time, owing to the abnormal situation prevailing in the country at the moment, I am very sorry to say that, in my opinion, the amounts allocated are absolutely inadequate, with the result that the life of a public man at the moment is not to be envied.  We have demonstrations and marches by the unemployed, and they are not to be blamed because they are faced with a situation where their wives and their families and themselves are faced with starvation. I do think that, apart altogether from the amount of money allocated for relief work, some subsidy will have to be given to public health boards in order to supplement the amount of money that such boards have to pay in relief generally.  In my own county of Wexford the maximum given amounts to 6/- per week, and I think that everybody listening to me will admit that you cannot do much with 6/- a week. These boards are faced with rates getting higher year after year and, as far as I can see, during the coming year there is no prospect of the weekly relief of the men, who are unfortunate enough to have to seek it, being raised. I think that the best thing the Minister could do would be to allocate some money from some fund&mdash;no matter what fund it might be&mdash;in order to help those people over the difficulties which they are encountering at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the methods of employment are concerned, I have heard nothing about political prejudice being used in my native county of Wexford, but I will say that there is great dissatisfaction generally about the method of employment through the labour exchanges.  I do not want to blame the managers of the various labour exchanges, but I submit that they are not sufficiently familiar with local conditions to deal with the matters that should be dealt with. People can go in to the managers and state things with regard to their needs which are contrary to fact.  In a great many cases, as a result of this lack of knowledge, a man gets preference in getting work which he really should not get.  My point is that there should <Col N="117" /> be some kind of consultative or advisory body in the different areas so that the manager of the local labour exchange might be able to get bona fide information to enable him to make up his mind as to the particular men who should be employed in the most deserving cases.  Preference is given to married men, but I suggest that certain single men with dependents should be enabled to get work also.  I think that at least 25 per cent. of the available work should be allocated to single men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>You mean single men with dependents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, single men with dependents, and I do sincerely hope that that will be done.</P>
      <P>In so far as the wages paid on minor relief schemes are concerned, I want to enter my protest with regard to the amount paid.  Surely, we should expect more from the present Government than 24/- per week and the men not having their insurance cards stamped.  After all, if these men are employed at quarry work or road work &mdash;as they are in a great many cases&mdash; it comes under the National Health Insurance Act, and I believe that it is compulsory that these people's cards should be stamped and that the Government has no right to intervene in the matter.  If their cards were stamped they could derive some benefit. I think that the Government should agree that the wages paid should be at least as much as those prevailing in the area and paid by the local county councils.  Quarry work or road work is very hard, and after all if a wet day comes in a week there is very little left of the 24/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from this type of worker, there is one type person for whom I should like the Government to make provision, and that is the dock labourer in the seaport towns in this country. Owing to the economic war which is going on at the moment, both imports and exports in the seaport towns have fallen off considerably, with the result that dock labourers who, up to quite recent times have had a large volume of work, find themselves compelled now to draw outdoor relief.  Whilst I admit <Col N="118" /> that the farmers are entitled to the bounties and subsidies which the Government has put aside for their relief, I submit that dock labourers and people of that kind, who have been hit by the present economic war, are victims just as much as the farmers and should be treated accordingly.  I submit, therefore, that some special provision should be made for those who are immediately affected by the conditions prevailing to-day, and amongst these I would particularly include the dock labourers in the seaport towns.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the Government credit for what has been done.  They have made large grants available but, owing to the very abnormal condition which prevails at the moment, I think that much more should be done. Waterworks and sewerage schemes have been mentioned&mdash;I think by Deputy Dillon&mdash;and I submit that in consequence of the fact that county surveyors and people of that kind have to submit their estimates beforehand, without knowing what amount of money is available, they are not able to cope with the matter.  I would suggest to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that before a local authority is forced to indulge in a certain amount of expense, the Minister should give an indication as to the amount of the grant which he proposes to allocate to the particular local authority, and that then the surveyor and other people concerned would be in a better position as to the plans and specifications which they should submit.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to stress the position with which local authorities are faced as a result of the abnormal demand which there is for home help at the moment.  I would ask the Minister to consider the advisability, where work cannot be provided, of giving some subsidy to county boards of health to enable them to supplement the meagre allowance which is being given at the present moment to able-bodied men at home.</P>

      <P>The fact is, as Deputies on the Labour Benches have told us, that there is a wave of unemployment throughout the country.  As Deputy Everett said, the present is not a normal situation at all.  In the words of Deputy Murphy, it is altogether abnormal.  The situation with regard to unemployment in the country is, as Deputy Corish said, such that the life of a public man is becoming impossible. Unemployment is pressing very severely on all sections of the people, including shop assistants, as Deputy Murphy mentioned.  The situation is pressing on people with small holdings in the country and on people without small holdings.  In these circumstances, there are complaints from every part of the country that the money being spent on relief, as well as the money being spent on ordinary road-fund matters, is being spent on political lines.  The conscience of the County Wexford gangers, surveyor, and County Council may be quite clear.  A question has been addressed to the Parliamentary Secretary arising out of some suggested responsibility in the Office of Public Works.  That may or may not be the case, but the wider field from which I hear complaints is from persons who are seeking employment under local bodies.  The complaints made show that a very scandalous state of affairs exists in some counties.  While Deputy <Col N="120" /> McMenamin would, to some extent, relieve the Minister and the Department concerned of responsibility, I think a considerable amount of responsibility does lie in view of the widespread nature of the complaints. When this Estimate was before us in November last, attention was drawn to this matter.  I raise the matter again now because complaints have come from County Mayo that men have been &ldquo;stood off&rdquo; employment because they are not politically acceptable to the people they were asked to associate with in employment.  When we were dealing with this Estimate in November, I had to draw the attention of the Minister for Local Government to a letter addressed by the county surveyor to the County Council of Mayo, in which he pointed out that he was being completely over-ridden so far as employment on the roads was concerned; that some of the gangers, put into office without consultation with him, to replace gangers previously employed, had refused to take instructions; that they employed more men on some of the jobs than they were authorised to employ, and that 60 per cent. only of the value that might be expected from the expenditure was being got.  He gave instances in which numbers of men pressed themselves into employment in the area without reference to him&mdash;men who simply made up their minds that they were going to work on a particular part of the road and went in and worked.  In so far as there was any kind of instruction that men to be employed on this work should be taken from the labour exchanges, that, he said, had completely broken down in Mayo.</P>

      <P>Yes.  When I raised this matter before, the Minister for Local Government stated that inquiry was being made into it.  In view of the continued penalising on political grounds of persons looking for employment, I ask what has transpired as the result of the inquiry into the county surveyor's complaints.  The complaints of the county surveyor suggested that instructions which were stated to exist, that men should be employed through the labour exchanges, had completely broken down, that unmarried men were being employed where married men were available, and that men had been employed who had not been registered, good, bad or indifferent.  He stated that men simply came on to work on their own account, that the gangers permitted them to come on and work and that, in many cases, the gangers allowed them to do so because they were afraid to tell them to go home.  I have paraphrased some of the complaints of the county surveyor and, in view of that report and of the position in different parts of the country, I think responsibility does lie on the Minister, notwithstanding that Deputy McMenamin would, to some extent, relieve him of that responsibility.  The House ought to be told what the result was of the Minister's inquiry into the Mayo position and whether, in view of the complaints still coming from Mayo, he will inquire further into the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to know from the Parliamentary Secretary or from anybody else with responsibility for the expenditure of this money what arrangements have been made and are being carried into effect with regard to the expenditure on roads which are already under contract.  What arrangement has been made with the contractors in these cases?  Is the contractor being paid for maintaining the road and is money being spent on it at the same time in another way?  Many complaints have come to me with regard to the position in County Mayo and I think the Parliamentary Secretary, through one of his chief executive officers, is aware of the circumstances. Is the contractor to be <Col N="122" /> responsible during the time that this money is being expended on the roads and how is he to be made responsible for the maintenance of the roads in the future?</P>
      <P>Roads have been widened, sides that existed heretofore have been removed. It is purported to widen the roads, but I say that instead of improving it has disimproved the roads, and their appearance and utility has not been the same at all but, on the contrary, has been very much less.  Heretofore a contractor entered into an engagement at a particular time and with a particular specification.  There was a certain width defined in that specification, which was to be maintained.  The contractor now, if I understand the position rightly, will be responsible for the maintenance of a different road altogether.  Is that so or is it not? Materials are put there but nothing is done except to throw the stones on to the road.  There is no effort to put in the necessary material that would make the road passable, or that would show that there was anyone in charge of the work with any sense of responsibility as to the work undertaken.  As for the existence of political partisanship that goes without saying.  There are many instances.  I point to one where a particular ganger is employed. He is a young man, son of an ex-national teacher.  His brother is the principal in the school where the father formerly taught.  The father is now on pension and this son is employed as ganger in that particular area.  In that particular district a man with a wife and nine or ten children applied for work and was refused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">

He has no wife or family, but here is a neighbour of his with a wife and eight or ten children and he seeks employment and cannot get it.  One of his children is now in employment as a result of complaints made and, also, because I drew the attention of some responsible person to the particular case.  He was refused on political grounds.  I make that statement and can prove it.  I have received various other complaints; some of these are already in the possession of the responsible officer, who I am convinced, is endeavouring to the best of his ability honestly to carry out a very difficult duty.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary must be fully aware of these facts.  They are known not only in Mayo, but all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people suggest that because some men have a few acres of land of a certain valuation they should not be entitled to employment.  But there are many farmers, up and down the country to-day, who are much more in need of employment than any other class, as a result of certain consequences of which we are all aware, and for which these men are not responsible.  I have investigated the lots of many of these people.  It is unnecessary now to go into the reason why they are in such an unenviable position.  I do not desire to introduce matters of that kind into a debate like this, but I say that there are many of those farmers very badly in need of employment.  They are in debt because it was necessary to enter into certain obligations to maintain their homes and families.  And as a result of these things they find themselves in a very difficult situation. Many of them are undoubtedly more in need of employment than many single men who, perhaps, as a result of their own indifference are not in employment. <Col N="124" /> It goes without saying that there are such people.  There are people who need employment and who are worthy of employment if they could get it, and there are those who are certainly not so deserving.</P>
    <P>I desire again to draw attention to the fact that money is being expended on roads already under contract.  As far as I know and as far as disclosures were made as a result of communications between the county surveyors and the county councils and the Local Government Department, nothing has come to my knowledge to show that any necessary or desirable arrangement has been made as to whether this money is being expended to the advantage of the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am trying to point out the difficulties and the overlapping.  If there is overlapping it must follow that there is waste of money in between.  You have the contractor at the one end liable to see these roads are maintained&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I say that not a single penny of this £350,000 that we are now spending has been spent or could be spent upon such a road.  If it has been spent upon such a road and that was within the knowledge of the Deputy, or the county surveyor, then it was the business of the Deputy or the county surveyor to bring that to our knowledge. But to the best of my knowledge and belief the Deputy is now discussing something which has no <Col N="125" /> relation whatever to this £350,000.

      <P>Is that not sufficiently clear and lucid for you?  I gave you credit for having a lot more intelligence. I always thought you would be able to judge who was the Chief Executive Officer in the county, who is responsible to you for the carrying out of work of that kind.  That Chief Executive Officer will be quite able to answer you.  The indications which I have given you will put him in possession of the necessary information, and he can point his finger to what it is. I will abide by the ruling that I must discontinue, as I am not in a position actually to put my finger on the expenditure of this money, but I now put it up to the Parliamentary Secretary himself to show at any future time that the money that I have pointed to is not being used as part and parcel of this grant.  I will now leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The money might have been expended in various ways which possibly would be more beneficial than the way in which it is being expended just now.  I have heard references made by many Deputies to the fact that expenditure on drainage would be very beneficial.  I have no doubt in my <Col N="128" /> mind that it would be much more beneficial than the way in which it is being expended.  When I say that, I fully realise that this is not just the time at which expenditure on drainage would be most beneficial.  The summer season would be the best time to select for the expenditure of money for drainage purposes.  It would bring better results at that time.  I fully realise that it may be quite beyond the power of the Parliamentary Secretary &mdash;and it has been fully revealed by the Chief Executive Officer in Mayo that it is beyond his power&mdash;to keep control of the expenditure of this money so as to prevent it from being expended on political lines.  Beyond yea or nay it is being and has been expended on political lines.  I do not know whose is the responsibility, but whoever has the responsibility, there is no good in trying to get away from the fact that such is the case.  That has been proved beyond yea or nay.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will now interest himself in the manner in which this money is being expended, and whether it is being expended on political lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time in this House when relief schemes are being discussed we hear complaints of political bias being used in the administration of the money.  Everyone of us comes up against those complaints. Within the past couple of days I myself have come across them.  Men have come to me and told me that certain gangers in certain parts of the county have used political influence. They have told me that this particular ganger or that particular ganger, because he happened to be a strong supporter of the Opposition Party in this House, would not give them a job. Probably other men will go to representatives of the Opposition Party in the House and tell them that because a certain ganger is a supporter of the Government Party he would not give <Col N="129" /> them a job.  Very often those complaints are exaggerated.  Because men, for reasons other than political ones, cannot get a job, they immediately jump to the conclusion that they are refused it because of the particular political opinions they hold. Very often those complaints should not be taken too seriously.  I myself made a complaint to the county surveyor that certain men had complained to me that they could not get a job.  He said: &ldquo;Look at this.  Here is another complaint from another side that certain other men could not get a job. Do not take them too seriously.&rdquo;  I think a lot of Deputies in this House are taking those complaints too seriously.  Personally, I do not think that any money has been unfairly spent in this country for a long time on relief schemes.  Apart from the advantage it was to the unemployed&mdash; because practically every penny of the money spent went into the pockets of the unemployed; no money was spent on machinery; no money went on special salaries&mdash;practically every penny of the money went as it should have gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that altogether, many of these by-roads which have been put in a passable condition were very urgently in need of repair, and very many of the small farmers in this country and the big farmers, too, who for years past have been unable to get out of their places are now in a position to do so. In future, when money is to be expended on the relief of unemployment, I do not think that it should be spent as it has been spent for the past few months.  I may have certain pet schemes of my own upon which I would like to see money spent.  One of them is the repair of embankments along our rivers, especially tidal rivers, and I think in some cases it would be very well worth while if these embankments that have been maintained in the past were looked after and so keep the land from being waterlogged, and see that the necessary repairs are executed at once.  There are many embankments which would need repair, and if not done now will in two or three months' time cause damage which will cost thousands of pounds to repair.  If <Col N="130" /> done in time the repair can be executed for practically a very small sum of money, but if they are neglected, and if the neglect is allowed to go on for any length of time, it will cost an enormous sum of money.  Then again there are farmers living adjacent to these embankments, and if the banks are not done in time their land will become absolutely useless.  In the past they were repaired by the landlords.  In some cases the landlords took it on themselves as a legal liability to keep the banks in repair.  Now that liability ceases.  The Land Commission, in many cases, refused to accept liability, and if they are not looked after there is grave danger that most of these lands will become absolutely useless.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I should like to mention.  Nothing has been done in connection with the supplying of lime, and I think it would be well worth while to invest some money in it. Individuals cannot do it, and, of course, it would not do for the State to come to the support of individuals and finance them to produce lime, but I think it would be a good idea if the county surveyors would get power to use some of the limestone they have at their disposal and turn it into lime or crush the stone&mdash;this latter course, I believe, would be the better one&mdash;and have that limestone available for the farmers for manure.</P>
    <P>Now, I said at the beginning that I thought this money was well expended, and I hope in the future when money is to be expended it will not be expended on any work which will need the use of machinery.  One of the strongest complaints we receive down the country is from workmen, where machinery is used in the quarrying and crushing of stone as, of course, it deprives them of employment.  When we have to spend money on the relief of unemployment we should see that every penny goes into the pockets of the men who need it most.  It is a pity, indeed, that we have to spend money towards the relief of unemployment, and it is a pity that money has to be spent on purely temporary relief, and that time and again Ministers have to come to us for money to expend it in this way.  We can only hope that some <Col N="131" /> day we will be able to provide a more permanent form of employment for our people.  We cannot keep the people on the dole for ever, and we cannot provide temporary relief schemes.  It is up to every one of us to see that our people are provided with work in some form of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad that this scheme was introduced, and especially when the money was devoted to the repair of many of these lanes and by-ways, because I have been for many years attempting to get that done.  In fact, since I entered the Dáil it was one of the pleas I made each year.  The reason I did that was because I had seen the difficulties and hardships which had to be encountered. I had seen the difficulties and hardships which clergymen and medical men found in entering some of those houses situated along those lanes. Up to last year there seems to have been no attention paid to that plea, and I believe the people are extremely thankful that these improvements are taking place.  I only hope that it will be continued.  I know in County Meath, as well as in many other counties, that the condition of affairs there was very extreme and that the hardships were enormous, in fact at times it entailed loss of life, and up to the present there was no heed taken of that.  Now that it is being done we hear, for instance, Deputy Davis trying to rake up some question of a political issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a chronic state of affairs.  I have complaints from many parts of Meath which go to show that it is all Cumann na nGaedheal supporters who get the work, that the gangers are Cumann na nGaedheal and that everybody is Cumann na nGaedheal.  Deputy Davis knows that as well as I do, but of course we must allow him to have a little play on that point as perhaps that is the only satisfaction he has.  So far as relief schemes are concerned, I am glad money was devoted towards the repair of those old lanes and by-ways and I am surprised that further steps were not taken to devote other moneys from the main roads and put them to some more reproductive purposes.  I know we <Col N="132" /> have roads in Meath which are the best in Europe&mdash;in fact comparable to the best in the world.  They will remain that way for years to come and I do not see why more money should be spent on them.  However, I think that some of the smaller farmers should get an opportunity of having their water-logged land drained, and that, of course, is reproductive work.  I would suggest that that matter be considered and see whether it would be possible to be effected even though you may break the law in doing so. Besides it would give a lot more employment; no machinery would be involved; the value of the land would be increased and it would undoubtedly give the farmers a chance of working. At the moment, as a result of the big storm, a greater part of the lands of Westmeath is under snow and the land not under snow is now under water. We have this big problem of drainage. I believe the draining of small rivers leading into the minor drainage schemes could be well undertaken to the advantage of the workers as well as to the advantage of the farmers.  I hope the steps taken to improve the laneways will be continued still further. I also hope that relief will be given towards the drainage of water-logged land, which, of course, would improve the health of the people generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene at this stage for the purpose of supporting the appeal of Deputy Goulding in connection with the expenditure of some of this money on the repair of river embankments.  These embankments, in many cases, have been sadly neglected, and I understand there is no sufficient reserve fund in the Land Commission to put them in proper repair.  The amount of money necessary to put them in repair now would be comparatively small if compared with the amount of money necessary at some future date when breaches would occur.  A couple of hundred pounds expended now may in many cases save thousands of pounds later on.  I am aware, from personal experience, that many embankments in the County of Waterford are badly in need of repair, and I would like to support Deputy Goulding's appeal to the Parliamentary <Col N="133" /> Secretary to have this matter investigated, because the land, which will be lost as a consequence of any breaches, is the land which is security for the annuities.</P>
      <P>I would like to support the appeal made in regard to the burning of lime throughout the country.  There are many lime kilns lying idle and very useful employment could be given if lime were burned extensively.  The lime could be utilised with advantage on farms as a cheap form of manure. I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to have these two items closely investigated.</P>

      <P>Very few, at all events. We are told that the work in some cases has been useless.  From my own experience of relief work, and from contact with some officials who had charge of the work, I am aware that in every case an examination was made into the merits of schemes put forward and in every case I think the desire was expressed that sanction should be given only to schemes possessing the highest labour content.  I <Col N="134" /> found that was the main object of the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials.  Of course there have been complaints about supporters of Fianna Fáil getting too much work and supporters of Cumann na nGaedheal getting too much work.  Such complaints are bound to arise.  There have been, no doubt, cases where local prejudice intervened and, perhaps, some political prejudice.  If this is a new scheme and if new money is being issued it would be as well to let us know so that we will be in a position to put some practical ideas before the Parliamentary Secretary.  On the other hand, if the money has been spent already&mdash;and I am afraid it has &mdash;then we have been beating the air, so to speak, for the last couple of hours.</P>

I would like also to refer to a point I made during the last session of the Dáil.  I then pointed to the fact that the total number of unemployed in Kerry had not been calculated at a given period, but that the figures were subsequently handed in.  May I take it that in the matter of allocating money on the basis of the number of unemployed, full credit will be given in the case of Kerry?  A certain amount of difficulty was experienced in getting the total number of unemployed in the county and submitting it to the Department in the given time. In view of the circumstances that prevailed I would like to know if full credit will be given to the county when the relief money is being allocated.</P>

I have assisted in putting forward a scheme for the establishment of a system whereby lime will be made available for the inhabitants of the poorer districts in Kerry.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will give every co-operation in that matter.  I hope a <Col N="135" /> substantial sum will be set aside for the inauguration of a scheme for supplying lime to the poor people in the mountainous districts in Kerry and other counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I would like to say that, to me, the administration of an unemployment fund is a big responsibility. A certain amount of money is set aside to be used for the purpose of relieving, as far as possible, distress due to unemployment.  My object has been&mdash;and it is the only possible honest way of looking at it&mdash;to see that the money gets into the hands of those who require it in the areas in which it is most required and at the time when it is most required.  I have considered every proposition put forward, whether it concerned the desirability of drains, afforestation or anything of the kind, purely and simply on those grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been very unfortunately, running through this debate an atmosphere which was not by any means as marked on a previous occasion.  I refer now to the suggestion of conscious collusion in victimisation by those who were responsible for the administration of this money.  The first line upon which victimisation could take place was in the division of the money over different areas in the country from the point of view of counties and, within those counties, over areas depending upon the popularity of certain people. The answer to that is that for the first time, I think, in the history of unemployment relief in this country, the whole of the facts have been openly at the disposal of any member of the House who chose to go into the office of the officer responsible to the House; there he could get the facts and improve on the distribution, if he could do so.  There are men on every side of the House who can bear testimony to the fact that they have been invited to examine into the distribution and to suggest an improvement.  It is within my knowledge that a considerable number of people, who were prepared to make complaints of the unfairness of the distribution, were not prepared to accept that invitation lest they should have to stand over their responsibility of having seen a document <Col N="136" /> in course of preparation which their knowledge, their sense of fairness and humanity might have improved.</P>
    <P>I have told to the House that when this scheme is finished I will lay on the Table, in the Library or wherever anyone wants it, a map showing the distribution of every penny of this fund. There are going to be mistakes in it. I hope there will be mistakes in the distribution of it, because any practical man who wants to get through a job must be prepared for a certain amount of mistakes in detail or, in the attempt to prevent them, he is going to pay insurance in overhead cost and delay which would be out of all proportion to the degree of improvement he will get in the elimination of probably a very small proportion of mistakes.  And for that reason if anyone will point it out to me I will look carefully into it.  For instance, I gave you two cases where wrong work has been started.  There have been little things of that kind. As to those, we make no pretence at all to hide them.  These are the things that would have to happen if you were to get away with new machinery to deal with this kind of work.</P>
    <P>Gross unfairness has been attributed in the allocation of the employment.  I want to say that everything humanly possible has been done to get a fair distribution.  We have examined every complaint that has come to us.  We have had complaints from the Labour Party against the Fianna Fáil Party and from the Fianna Fáil Party against the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and from the Cumann na nGaedheal Party against the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have had complaints from the Centre Party and from all Parties.  As far as I humanly could I investigated these complaints.  I got a special office from the Executive Council for the purpose of investigating them, and I investigated the complaints without any regard as to whom they came from. Because apart from the ordinary sense of decency in administering this money which is the gift from the people to those who are poorer and more unfortunate&mdash;in my opinion it is damned bad politics over a period of years to attempt to do anything else but to be rigorously fair in a matter of that kind. I looked upon it from the point of view <Col N="137" /> of the Government that was here to stay, not a Government that was to be here for a short period.  We have got to get down, in administering Government relief, to the position where all will know that they will get a fair crack of the whip and that is what we have tried to do.</P>
    <P>There have been some allegations such as the allegations made by Deputy Davis, that he told somebody whom I should know about something which, being inquired into, I might find out. That is exactly what he did.  He had knowledge of the particular incident.  I think he was Chairman of the Mayo County Council, if he is not now At any rate, he is a very responsible Deputy.  He was Chairman of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, and that is the sort of stuff he offers here, and he offers it to a man whose office was open every day to him as it was open to every member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  There is not a man on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches who can say that any information of any sort or kind or description that he was in possession of, that he was in a position to give and that he can give in relation to schemes of this kind, whether for or against this administration, is not eagerly welcomed.  Instead of using the ordinary machinery of franking a letter which he could have used if that was so, or if it worried him, of writing to me to say that &ldquo;on a particular road which is under contract you are spending money for doing the job,&rdquo; he does nothing of the kind. Instead of writing to me he gets up here and says that some particular official that I do not know has whispered into his ear something which I never heard, whispered a story which maybe is not true.</P>
    <P>I will take another case where the Deputy, I am sure, did not intend to be unfair.  That was where Deputy Dillon got up here and said: &ldquo;I have in my pocket a letter from a man,&rdquo; saying that the surveyor or the Deputy county surveyor in Donegal had refused to give work to a man because he had voted for Deputy Dillon, or something to that effect.  Does Deputy Dillon realise what he is doing?  Does he realise that he was accusing the whole <Col N="138" /> body of county surveyors and deputy surveyors of Donegal?  And he has not produced that letter to me.</P>

      <P>To the extent that I have misjudged the Deputy in connection with this letter I apologise.  But that statement did cover the whole body of the surveyors and deputy surveyors in County Donegal and I made the same inquiry of each, but I found that I could not find one case of the kind referred to.  It is just stories like that and there are millions of them in that vague way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must ask the Parliamentary Secretary not to refer to vague stories of that kind.  I made a statement and I said the moment the House rose I would wait on the responsible Minister and place the facts before him.  I waited on the responsible Minister and put all the facts to him.  There was nothing at all vague in it, no general attack.  It was a specific case for the Minister and at the earliest possible moment I placed all the facts before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No man in this House is an enemy of this Government who exposes anything that is wrong in the expenditure of this relief.  No man in this House is a friend of the Government who hides anything.  We want <Col N="139" /> all these cases exposed and I hope that is understood.  Now there have been abuses.  The questions raised by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and Deputy Mulcahy were all practically in relation to Mayo and have nothing whatever to do with these roads.  There were attempts in Mayo&mdash;and I will take that specific case under the Minor Relief Schemes&mdash;of individuals to abuse the relief schemes.  Certain people did attempt to run it but I want to know whether any of them got away with it after we had knowledge of it?  If any one starts trying to get away with a game of that kind it is the duty of every Deputy to put the information in writing before the officer who is responsible to this House for the honest administration of these schemes and strict inquiry will be made into the matter.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney wanted works of permanent value.  He was full of these works until he was asked for them.  It was another bluff. For ten years&mdash;and I am sorry that item has to be dragged into it&mdash;the previous Government had been administering these schemes.  They did not leave on their files any of these permanent works that we could indulge in.  If they had left these on their files I would have investigated them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the question of land reclamation. I have half a dozen land reclamation schemes covering 800 or 900 acres.  I did not get one in which the value of the land would be a quarter or a fifth of the value of the money which would have to be spent, and one-eighth of the value which went into the labour working in any one of them.  It goes to my heart to spend money on things which are unproductive. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has brought forward certain schemes in relation to mineral development&mdash;going in and taking over the burden of minerals of various kinds.  If we can find any case which we can fit in under the mineral schemes we will do so.  I merely complain that there are no permanent schemes but if any Deputy has them let him bring them along.  Somebody in England suggested that as they were up against the problem of unemployment, <Col N="140" /> they should use the railways to bring the refuse from the dumps in the mines in the North of England down to fill up the lakes in the South. I do not know if anyone here is going to suggest anything quite as large or as foolish as that.  But if anyone is going to suggest any new lines in which we can use money for relief in the future we are only too glad to have these suggestions.  I have tried drainage schemes.  The difficulty with drainage schemes, as has been admitted by some Deputies, is that you may get the money spent in the areas you want it spent, but you cannot spend it at the time you want it spent. The time we want to spend it is from November to March.  You are then in the dark days, the wet days and the short days.  In addition to that, the specific value of an hour's work done at that time in wet ground and so on is altogether lower than the other. There again it is a question of fitting it in.</P>
    <P>As far as lime kilns and so on are concerned, we are spending money on lime kilns in Kerry to the great joy of Deputy Flynn, even if he did not know it.  It is being spent there in three or four places.  It is being spent in West Cork, in Laoighis and in Galway.  We hope to spend a good deal more money upon things of that kind if we can get them.  For instance, I did go to the trouble of reading&mdash;it was only a summary unfortunately which came into my possession&mdash;a memo. prepared by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney under the old system in relation to the grinding up of stone as distinct from the burning of limestone but we could not fit that in.  Again I say if any of you know anything, this is the time to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, every lime kiln job is a difficult one because as a rule it is on private property.  In certain cases it means financing the repair of an existing derelict kiln.  In some cases it means putting a road <Col N="141" /> into a limestone deposit which is not otherwise available.  In other cases it means financing the production of a lime kiln.  There was a rather curious but fortunate case in West Cork, where there is one single out-cropping of limestone in a great big boggy area. The land has been vested in tenants and curiously enough this piece of limestone is vested in tenants surrounding the boglands who have no bog.  It has been necessary for us to set up a little Public Utility or Co-Operative Society in order to have someone to whom we could make the grant which would enable us to open that limestone quarry for them.  In practically every case where we have run up against limestone we have run up against difficulties of that kind.  All I can tell you is that there are a couple of members of the Dáil who are a little committee on the subject&mdash;Deputy Fred Crowley and Deputy Seán Moylan &mdash;who have a very close knowledge of the particular problems engaged in it and if any Deputies have a limestone proposition of their own that they want to put through I would rather suggest that they should discuss with these two Deputies the difficulties in relation to it and see what can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin said that the regulations in relation to the labour exchanges were faulty.  I certainly would like to see included, and I think there will be included in it, a certain clause.  The two classes, broadly, up to the present have been married and unmarried.  It will be with dependants and without dependants as a beginning.  In other words, a single man with dependants, if his dependants were somewhere approximate to the same conditions as a married person, certainly ought to be somewhat on the same level.  In addition, I think, there ought to be some provision for men who are neither single men with dependants nor married men with dependants, but are simply single men.  I cannot take the line myself that the mere fact that a man is single is to leave him out of the whole ambit of unemployment schemes. I should like to see a certain proportion of single men definitely included in that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin, I think it was, wanted the charges on local authorities reduced from the point of view of sewerage; in other words, a larger proportion of grant for sewerage schemes.  In this particular case you got £500,000 of an additional grant which was to be used for all these purposes, and side by side with that £550,000 of money raised out of revenue this year to be used as loans for local authorities.  It is simply a question of the proportion in which they take it.  I think the proportion there is about £103,000 gone out as grants to energise loans for public health purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question.  On the money advanced from that fund there is an interest charge of 5¾ per cent.  Does not the Parliamentary Secretary consider that too high?  If it could be lowered, certainly that fund would be taken <Col N="144" /> advantage of to a greater extent than at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a hope that it may be.  Roughly speaking, the grant varied from 30 per cent. up to 70 per cent.  Seventy per cent. was given in cases in which the local authority had refused to do the work at any price but where, on public health grounds, it was absolutely essential it should be done.  In connection with public health schemes, what happens is that all applications for sewerage and water supply schemes first go through to the Local Government Department, where they are examined on their merits. They then put them forward for a grant out of the unemployment fund, and, to be quite frank, on as low a basis as they think they can get away with for the purpose of getting as much work done as possible out of whatever limited sum we have.  In every case it is a question of working within the limits we have.  When we came to the allocation of the £500,000 this year, we allocated about £100,000 for the purpose of grants for sewerage schemes and that sum energised, roughly speaking, two and a half times that amount of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>All these things&mdash;every single condition that you put there&mdash; will limit your freedom in the matter of making relief schemes in the future. Deputy Brodrick, of Galway, spoke of dismissals by the board of health on a relief scheme.  Up to the present I have not been able to trace that.  I know of no minor relief scheme that took place in the City of Galway, though in the County Galway there were a great number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad.  We have no knowledge of any such thing, and if the information comes to our possession we will do the best we can with it.  The allegation was made that, in <Col N="145" /> relation to some of this £350,000, certain board of health people in Galway did, under conditions of victimisation, dismiss certain people.  If Deputy Brodrick gives us the facts we will go into them.  All that I am concerned with is that so long as the Deputy gives me the facts I will see what I can do with them.  Again, I say to the House that there is nothing that we want to conceal.  If anyone tried to play games of that kind let us know.  We have no right to do anything except to administer the money fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputy said that no money had ever been given out of a relief vote on drainage.  Money was given in two cases, in the case of the Fergus in County Clare and of the River Sow in County Wexford.  Broadly speaking, we are very anxious not to mix up drainage work of a fairly large order with minor relief work.  The reason is this: that if you take an ordinary drainage scheme it is put forward for the purpose of benefiting a particular agricultural area.  What happens in that case is that three people are asked to subscribe to it: the people whose land is benefited; the county council that benefits by the benefit that the people get, and the central authority which is unable to resist the pressure to provide the largest sum of money possible for the purpose of carrying out the scheme.  All these things have to be worked out in an engineering scheme and have to be reduced to a definite price.  If that is so, you are going to get into grave difficulty if, in the employment of people on those schemes, you are going to have a purely relief atmosphere worked into them.  You have got to get full value for all the money you spend, because, otherwise, when the whole thing is over, if the estimate is exceeded, then in every case you are going to have a row with the central authority which will be asked to make a larger grant, with the local authority which has already granted more than it believed it ought to have granted, and with the beneficial owner of the improved land who will be difficult to convince that he ever got value at any time.  For that reason we do not want to mix up the two.  The only drainage works carried out have been minor <Col N="146" /> ones.  The following are some fairly good examples:&mdash;(1) the removal of rock obstruction in a river, (2) making a new road in a district where previously tenants had to carry their meal and flour on their backs, (3) the erection of a bridge to render a road passable, (4) the drainage of flooded lands, (5) another removal of a rock obstruction which was causing a river to flood plots of land, (6) repair to a damaged bridge, (7) clearing floods.  Small floodings of that kind can be done, but when you come to deal with schemes where there have to be contributions from two or three authorities, if you mix them up with relief schemes then you are going to get into trouble.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dolan is under the impression that there are a lot of drainage schemes which, while uneconomic, would do untold good if carried out.  I do not quite know what the Deputy means.  I can tell the House that I have been through all the schemes&mdash;remember these are the chosen pet ones&mdash;which have come forward up to the present: the ones that the Board of Works have carried out, the ones that they are carrying out and the ones that they intend to carry out.  So far from being economic, the position with regard to them would be represented in this way: that for every £4 spent only £1 is effective in the sense of realised improved value due to the work done. If that is the position in relation to what one may call the choice schemes, I need hardly tell the House what it would be in regard to the ones rejected.  Against that, there are small works such as what you might call local drains and things of that kind which, under a relief scheme, if a relief scheme were wanted during the dry weather, would be very valuable. These schemes are very difficult to carry out with any economy during the wet and dark winter months in which the work is really required.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question which I think has been worrying a good many and that is the wages paid upon minor relief schemes.  Minor relief schemes are really an extension of the work that used to be done by the Land Commission and by the old <Col N="147" /> Congested Districts Board.  The ordinary way of making a relief grant in this House in the past was to make that grant to the Land Commission. It was really a very ingenious method. It really did not cost anything&mdash;the giving of the money to the Land Commission to do unemployment relief work.  The unemployment relief work they did was on those bog roads and so on which they previously used to do and they found that their establishment and activity were only capable of reaching on a given total which they had done in the last year and, therefore, anything you added to them &mdash;this is their own contention and not mine&mdash;to do new unemployment work meant that they could not do their own work.  The result was that while you issued £240,000 or whatever it was for unemployment relief, it simply meant that you had coming back out of the Vote something approaching the same amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary say whether the Land Commission carried out any repair work on bog roads outside the congested districts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the £240,000 voted for relief work last year was put through the Land Commission.  They did the work and we wanted them to continue to do it.  However, what we are dealing with now is a simple question. The work we are carrying out under minor relief was the work I speak of here and these works were carried out as a rule, in the old areas, that is, the old congested areas, and, at the present moment, I think there are between 9,000 and 10,000 people employed on minor relief works in the different districts and there has been no difficulty and no complaint of any sort or kind in relation to the wages paid for those works in these old areas. In fact, the position is entirely different.  I am satisfied that there is more enthusiasm and more interest and more willingness to work on these particular schemes than there are in any other portion of the work which we have to do.  However, in probably a mistaken sense of fairness, in this <Col N="148" /> particular year, we did extend the minor relief schemes into areas in which they previously had not been. There have been no such works done, for instance, in Wicklow, Wexford, Waterford or Leix, or any place of that kind, and, to a limited extent, we have had complaints in those areas in relation to the wages paid on the minor relief schemes.  What the House must remember is that this is a mixed scheme.  Two million pounds have been provided for the purpose of relieving unemployment and of relieving distress. The money which is being spent, as the House knows, in Donegal, Mayo and places of that kind is more in relief of distress than it is in relief of mere unemployment, and the standard of distress was that men desired to get work at agricultural wages.  That is the test.  That is the test under which all the work is done under drainage schemes and that is the test under which the whole of the Land Commission work is done.  It is exactly the standard under which the work has been done for the last ten years. There has been no change of any sort, kind or description in doing that except that, in a mistaken sense of fairness, we have extended into the areas which were comparatively prosperous the kind of work which used to take place in the really distressed portions of Ireland&mdash;Clare, West Cork, Kerry, Galway, Mayo and Donegal. What we have done there is that we have simply allocated money to the different areas as fairly as we can on a money basis.  We can do two things. We can leave the position as it is in relation to carrying out that number of minor relief works on the same basis in Leix as they are carried out in Galway, or we can use the same amount of money to employ a lesser number of men to do a lesser number of works relatively in Leix than we have in Galway.  Either of those are fair methods.  Neither of them are popular methods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  That is the difficulty I said I had.  My difficulty was to justify having extended the minor relief works into places like that because there were not in those areas the kind of works that used to be done under minor relief schemes in other places.  In Kildare and places of that kind, men were not carrying turf two miles on their backs over a mountain in order to get into their houses because they had no road. They were not carrying flour halfway across a mountain because they had no road.  The people who speak of that have no conception of the difference of distress, the difference of need that the people have who are eagerly anxious to get work done at this rate.  If we have a limited sum of money, I put it to Deputies simply as a matter of fairness, how should we spend it.  Should we do a lesser number of jobs at a higher wage or should we do a larger number of jobs at a lower wage and, in an agricultural district, are we to make as a standard for relief a standard higher than the standard of agricultural wages?</P>

In Leix, at present, am I to reduce the number of works and what works? Am I to give to Leix and other places of the kind&mdash;I am only using Leix because it was the first one that came into my mind&mdash;more money relative to their unemployment than I am to give to the distressed districts of Kerry, Connemara, Galway, Mayo or Donegal?

      <P>Deputy Davis is again on the point that there is something going wrong in Mayo, and that we do not know anything about it.  Again I tell the Deputy: &ldquo;Put it in writing.&rdquo;  As to the allegation that farmers are working when others are unemployed, there may be cases where farmers are just as unfortunate as other people, just in as critical a position, for instance, as Donegal people, or those in Mayo.  A good many may be little farmers.  It does not follow that there are not certain cases where men have been employed who should not have been employed.  We have done our best to alter the fact.  I want to see a fair solution.  I come back to the question of wages.  What I suggest is that in future in cases where we are dealing with areas that are not congested areas, where there is no work of <Col N="154" /> a bog road character, that in order to get over the difficulty of two people doing work that is similar, only minor relief schemes are put forward, or minor county roads.  In that particular case the only way I can see that we can justly meet the difficulty in these areas is to add to what might be called the ordinary relief the proportion which otherwise would have gone into other relief funds, and the county surveyor can carry out of the Road Fund minor relief to the extent to which he could do it within the amount of money, but at the same rate of wages.  That is my difficulty.  The only way I can see that we can meet Deputies&mdash;and I am anxious to meet them&mdash;is that in future there will not be a separate allocation of minor relief money for areas in which that money was all spent before; that a sort of composite fund would be made out of which such work would be met.  Otherwise I find it very difficult to find a solution.  As far as I know we have about 34,000 men employed on relief schemes.  At the end of September we had about 20,000, at the end of October about 23,000, at the end of November about 27,000, and at the end of December about 37,000.  As the money runs out towards the 31st March we will be dropping down again to the level of September.  As the House knows the object was to spend that money during the peak portion of unemployment.  From the diagram it will be seen that we have, as far as possible, followed in our unemployment allocation the actual necessities of the case.</P>

I want here and now to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to name the time, the place and the scheme in regard to which I made any observation of that kind.

All sorts of Deputies came to me in relation to their constituencies.  This lasted through March, April, June and July.  In all cases when I produced the graph showing the unemployment level, they were all satisfied that the money should be spent, not in the summer&mdash;that is the point I was concerned with&mdash;but over the winter months.

      <P>(Clare): Could we get from the Parliamentary Secretary any ruling showing whether a man working on a drainage scheme is not entitled to have his cards stamped?  He said in his concluding remarks that there would shortly be a drop back to the number of people employed in September. That would mean that a large number would be unemployed and they would not be entitled to draw insurance benefits.  To suggest that some of the work they are doing is agricultural work is something I could not stand over.  I want to know what decision the Department has given, and whether they are stamping the necessary cards to enable these men to get unemployment insurance benefit when they are unemployed.</P>

Deputy Corish did not discriminate between drainage schemes by way of relief work and other schemes.  I understood the Parliamentary Secretary's reply to be this, that drainage works have previously been declared agricultural work and that, therefore, they would not be obliged to stamp the cards of those engaged in these works.  I understood him to make a discrimination with regard to drainage schemes and that only.  Is that a fact?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I get my point clear?  May we take it that three things are now being done under the relief works that are going on&mdash; road works, land improvement schemes and the item to which Deputy Corish has specifically referred, quarrying work.  As far as quarrying work is concerned, it was always regarded as an insurable occupation, no matter at what time of the year carried out. The same applied to road work.  I understand that drainage schemes were held to be agricultural work and that, therefore, they did not entail the stamping of cards.  On these three things has there been any change made?  Quarrying was certainly an insurable occupation and so was road work, but drainage work was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see the position is that on any work that is labelled a minor relief scheme no insurance card is stamped.  The Parliamentary Secretary may not know that, but that is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be wrong but I have been under the impression and I have been informed that there has been no change whatever in relation to the stamping of cards and in relation to the amount of work we are doing, but I shall have that investigated if you like.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

I am <Col N="159" /> faced by the decision of those who are competent to decide&mdash;I cannot say it is entirely obvious&mdash;that a man who is working on a drainage scheme is an agricultural labourer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but in the same way as minor drainage.  What I intend to do is to get a review of the position and get a decision.  The only thing that one wants to be perfectly satisfied about is that the men themselves do want it.  Whether we should press in that direction or not is another matter, but in the meantime I will get a review of the whole position, as I said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get this matter cleared up further.  The last phrase which has been used by the Parliamentary Secretary certainly does not relieve anxiety.  The Parliamentary Secretary has now said that he would like to have it clear as to whether or not the men desire it.  I submit that it is not for them to desire it.  It does not depend on the men at all, and I suggest that it would be a very retrograde step to have unemployment insurance remitted, even in doubtful cases, just because the men themselves desire it.  It is going to lead to a certain type of man being employed, because county councils and other such boards will say: &ldquo;We have not any obligation to stamp cards and it is therefore cheaper not to do so,&rdquo; and it will mean that in the end nobody will be able to ask for his unemployment insurance to be paid for him on this type of work.  Otherwise, it would be almost blacklegging in a sense, to interfere in the matter.  We are dealing at the moment with a sum <Col N="160" /> of £350,000, and I should like to know what proportion of that sum roughly, has been expended, or is likely to be expended, on what I have described as &ldquo;insurable occupations&rdquo;&mdash;say, quarrying, roads, or big reclamation works&mdash;and what proportion of it has been or is likely to be expended on the type of drainage work which has been declared to be a non-insurable occupation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the £500,000, about £160,000 has been spent on minor relief. Some of that would be road work and some drainage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Board of Works spent £31,000 on agriculture, and I think that most of that would be on agricultural wages.  The Department of Industry and Commerce has spent £27,425 on insurable occupations.  On public health work £103,000 has gone out in grants along these lines, and most of that, I think, would be insurable.  The Dublin Corporation&mdash; £122,000&mdash;all insurable.  So that, practically the major portion would be insurable.</P>

I submit, therefore, that unless an endeavour is being made to cloak over this matter, it is in order.  All I am asking for is that the Minister should give us something to reassure this House that the scheme is not being completely overridden in Mayo, as reported by the county surveyor there, so that less than 60 per cent. of the value of the money expended is being got in Mayo.

      <P>Has the Minister not worked out the figures?  It is usual, in introducing a Supplementary Estimate of this kind, to divide up the losses under different headings.  Losses have been incurred in the past in the <Col N="165" /> case of grazing lettings and so forth under this sub-head.  The figure I want to get from the Minister is that of the amount lost in respect of untenanted land and the amount of money the Land Commission had to pay for annuities for the period between the gale day and the dividend day.  That is usually included under the sub-head and I should like the Minister to distinguish between the figures.</P>

      <P>It is not worth while to go to all that trouble to get that particular figure.  The Dáil is getting the essential figures to enable it to arrive at a decision whether it will give this money or not.  I think it is quite unreasonable for the Deputy to ask for all these details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil is certainly entitled to details.  This figure is abnormal.  The normal figure provided under this sub-head is £10,000.  When the Minister comes before the Dáil with an Estimate which increases that figure to £83,000, surely the Dáil is entitled to some information as to the increase.  The Minister does not supply the Dáil with any details whatever.  I realise that the Minister for Defence may not have had an opportunity to master the details of this Estimate.  He is deputising for another Minister but I am quite prepared to agree to the Estimate being left over until the Minister for Lands and Fisheries is present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been told the reason for the big increase.  He can easily understand himself the reason for the big increase.  When the Estimate was going through originally, a sum of £10,000 was provided to meet deficiencies which would normally accrue.  Since then, there was a complete change of policy in connection with the collection of land annuities and the amount in arrear has naturally <Col N="166" /> become very much larger.  The normal amount of £10,000 increased to about £93,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister assure me that the additional expenditure has been incurred merely by the fact that the Land Commission had to provide money for the purpose of paying the annuities not received from the period between the gale day and the dividend day in cases vested under the Land Act, 1931?  If the Minister will give me that assurance, I shall be quite satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the first question on this Estimate and I cannot say that I am in possession of very much more information.  I did not ask what the amount of the deficiency was, because I had that information before me.  But that is all the information the Minister has given us. What I wanted to know was how the deficiency arose.  In his second attempted explanation, the Minister said it arose because there had been a change of policy.  Why?  We are told that, when the original Estimate was going through, it was estimated that only £10,000 would be required to meet deficiencies likely to occur in income from untenanted land purchased under these 1923-31 Land Acts.  Now, that sum of £10,000 has increased to this big figure because we are told there has been a change of policy?  Why?  When that policy was first mentioned, I am not certain that the word &ldquo;treason&rdquo; was not applied to it.  People were, at all events, threatened that they would be put in jail for asking that this policy should be put in operation.  The Minister thinks it is a proper way to treat this House merely to say that there has been a change of policy.  What necessitated the change?  I think that that is clear.  The realisation came that certain people could not pay.  But, again, why?  Why was that accepted late as a fact&mdash;a fact which was staring the Government in the face right from <Col N="167" /> the moment the economic war started. This is an advance.  Taken in the ordinary way, there would appear to be an Exchequer charge&mdash;something to be borne out of the fruits of ordinary taxation, however that taxation is to be raised.  Yet, we are told that there is a Suspense Account.  Is it not possible to use that money for this purpose?  Is the money going to be so used?  We are told it is there at the moment; that there is a nest-egg of something over four millions.  Yet we are asked, in order to meet something due owing to the change of policy, this change having occurred owing to the economic war, to vote something out of the Exchequer. When is the nest-egg going to be used? We are told that there is four millions awaiting distribution yet we are asked to vote this additional £48,635 out of taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now trying to appear much more innocent than he really is.  He know, as every member of the Government does, and as the more experienced Deputies here know, that merely because the House is asked to sanction expenditure for certain purposes, it does not necessarily imply that the whole of the amount for which sanction is asked will be spent; and it certainly does not imply that the whole of that expenditure is to be met out of taxation.  His other point is; why was not the necessity for this Supplementary Estimate foreseen?  If the Deputy will throw his mind back to the circumstances in which the original Estimates were introduced into the Dáil he will recollect that, in submitting them, the Government stressed the point that the Estimates had been prepared by our predecessors, and that they had not time to revise the final figures and that consequently a certain amount of revision and possibly some Supplementary Estimates might have to be introduced into the Dáil as soon as the Government policy had time to shape itself into operation.  Even then it would not possibly have been necessary to introduce a Supplementary Estimate, in the way it has been introduced at this moment, if it had not been for the attitude which the <Col N="168" /> Opposition took up in regard to this question.  If we had the support which we were entitled to expect from Deputies opposite during the past 12 months we would have been in a position, I hope, at any rate, to have laid before the House definite proposals for dealing with the whole question of land purchase instead of having to make, what, after all, is temporary provision pending the period when these proposals will be definitely formulated and the House will be asked to make provision in regard to them.  The point I wish again to recapitulate and stress is that it does not at all follow that because an estimate is introduced into the House, and because the House gives the necessary final authority to expend money, the whole of that money will be expended and that that expenditure will have to be met out of taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>My question has not been answered.  The Minister for Finance told us when these Estimates were first going through this deficiency was not foreseen, and that was because the Estimates were drawn by the Minister's predecessor and that the Minister did not foresee the deficiency in this and the other bunch of Supplementary Estimates; but he has had a fair amount of time since to make up his mind and to estimate the deficiency to be made up.  He tells us that when the present Government's policy is properly outlined and formulated we will have their Estimates but what we were promised was not an addition but a reduction.  The Minister has forgotten his two millions reduction.</P>

He now tells us that if he had had time we would not have had these Supplementary Estimates and that they would have been in his original Estimates. We will see when the Budget makes its appearance.  He will then no longer have the excuse he makes now.  Again we have the further comment that the money is not necessarily going to be spent because it is voted. <Col N="169" /> Nobody suggested that, but when the Government asks for £83,000, reduced to £48,000 as between this and the financial year, we feel that they should have some appreciation of the amount that they are going to spend.  Why are they taking this sum out of taxation? Why not break in on the nest egg?  What about the four millions cash held out as a glittering prize to the people?  £48,000 is a small sum out of £4,000,000 to be distributed.</P>

      <P>I am still waiting for an answer from the Minister.  I asked for details and the Minister, so far, has not supplied any.  I want to know from the Minister under what particular heads these losses have been incurred. This Estimate is to make up the deficiency in the income from untenanted lands purchased under the Acts <Col N="170" /> of 1923 to 1931.  I know that when the Minister takes land, before he is ready to proceed to distribution, it may be necessary to incur loss but it was always the policy of the Land Commission to reduce these losses to the lowest point.  Am I to assume that this huge loss is entirely attributable to the fact that the Land Commission has taken possession of a big area of land and has not distributed it, and that by taking it over they assume responsibility for rates, loss of grazing rights and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy that I had not the details here, but that if he put down a question I would look into it.  I told him also that the principal amount in this was due to the non-collection of the amounts due from the people who have been allotted untenanted land.  In the ordinary course every year there is a deficiency in the Land Commission which arises from three things: first, rent payable by allottees; second, the making up of two months interest from the gale day to the dividend day; and third, the difficulty in letting temporarily grazing land acquired.  The nearest I can go to it now is that, of the £93,000, not more than £2,000 to £3,000 is due to the two months interest between the gale day and dividend day.  The rest of it is due to the moneys not being collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, I am to take it that out of a figure of £83,455 only £2,000 to £3,000 will be recouped subsequently to the Land Commission? There will be a net loss of somewhere about £82,000 to be made good by the general body of taxpayers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  That £2,000 to £3,000 will be recouped in full.  The £83,000 will come under the ordinary fund.  The whole of it will be recouped over a period of fifty years.  These arrears will be funded and will be repayable over fifty years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to assume that £81,000 of this amount represents the annuities on untenanted lands?  Surely there were other losses?  You had to pay rates?  What amount does that represent?  Those are items I would like to get from the Minister.  I suggest a postponement of the discussion on <Col N="171" /> this Estimate until the Acting-Minister or the Minister himself is in a position to supply us with the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows per fectly well that the information he is asking for is comparatively unimportant. Those normal deficiencies are accounted for in the £10,000 for which he has heard the Dáil being asked to meet an Estimate.  They were all included in that £10,000 and I take it when he was arriving at that Estimate he knew what the normal thing would be.  Apart from that £10,000 of the normal deficiencies was the abnormal situation which arose when the Land Commission were instructed not to press for annuities.  That is the reason for this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows perfectly well that it was always customary in introducing a Supplementary Estimate to supply to the Dáil details of that Estimate.  Those details were supplied under various heads.  I know it is quite possible for the officials of his Department to supply him with those details.  The Minister suggests that this is a comparatively unimportant matter, but it is certainly not unimportant to the Dáil to realise that the loss under this particular heading increased from £10,000 to £83,000 in a period of less than twelve months. That is surely not an unimportant matter.  The Dáil is entitled to know how the loss occurred and for what reasons the loss has been incurred.  I think in fairness the Minister should agree to a postponement of this discussion until we are in a position to get those details, when this Estimate can be discussed intelligently.  If the Minister himself were present I should raise many other points on this particular Estimate.  I naturally hesitate to raise the points now because I understand that the Acting-Minister has not had an opportunity for preparing his brief even for this Estimate and he has not had an opportunity of mastering the details.  I think in fairness to the Dáil the discussion should be postponed until a later date.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £15,860 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1933, for payments under the Railways Act, 1924, the Tramways and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, etc.; and for other purposes connected with Irish Transport.</P>
      <P>There are three sub-headings to this Estimate.  The first, repayment to the county council, is a payment in respect of the Government's subvention towards guaranteed shares of the Dublin and Blessington Tramway. Payments were made to the Dublin and Wicklow County Councils on their producing evidence that their liabilities in connection with the railway had been duly met.  In respect of an instalment of £200 normally due to be paid to the Wicklow County Council in the year 1931-2 evidence did not become available until after 31st March, 1932.  The provision in 1931-2 therefore lapsed, and it is now necessary to revote the amount in the current year.  In consequence of the passage of the Act of last year for the abandonment of the tramway this provision will not again be necessary.  Sub-head E. is payment in respect of steamer services.  The original Vote was for £800 and the revised Estimate was £1,460.  There was included in the original Estimate a sum of £300, the estimated loss on the working of the steamer services between Sligo and Belmullet and Sligo and Killybegs until 31st March, 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have explained to the Dáil before, our predecessors decided in or about December, 1931, to terminate those services, but for some reason perhaps not dissociated with the <Col N="173" /> fact that there was a General Election in February, 1932, an announcement of the decision was not made to anybody. When I took office in the middle of March, 1932, and this matter came to my notice I found that a decision had been made to terminate those services, that no provision had been made to continue them after 1st April, 1932, but that nobody connected with the services was aware of that fact.  In those circumstances I decided that we could not terminate the services on that very abrupt notice.  The service between Sligo and Killybegs was continued until the end of May and the loss on that service between January and May was £183.  That service was not of long duration.  It had been started upon certain undertakings that it would realise a profit.  Those undertakings proved to be without foundation. The service realised a loss from the beginning and consequently ceased on 31st May, 1932.  The service between Sligo and Belmullet was one of very long duration.  It had been in existence for a very large number of years and it always realised a loss which had been met by annual Government subvention.  In recent years the requirements of Belmullet were being met to a growing extent by alternative transport facilities, by sea from Westport and by road from Ballina, and consequently the service was terminated.  The boat with which the service was continued was disposed of by sale.  The £661 now asked for is required to make good the loss entailed by these services between the 1st April, 1932, and the date upon which they were terminated.</P>
    <P>Sub-head FF, Payments to Railway Companies in respect of wages is, of course, the most important item upon this Estimate.  This is portion of the amount required to make good the offer of the Government to the Irish railway companies to subsidise them to the extent of the difference between the wages paid prior to the 26th December of last year, and the wages which would have been paid after that date if the award of the Irish Railways Wages Board had been brought into operation.  The Government offered to make good to the railway companies <Col N="174" /> the difference between the two rates of wages in respect of railway employees whose headquarters were in the Saorstát until the 30th April of this year.  As Deputies are probably aware, wages and conditions upon Irish railways are regulated by an agreement providing for a scheme of machinery in which all the Irish railway companies and the railway trade unions are parties.  That agreement had been registered with the Department of Industry and Commerce at the instance of the trade unions, as the agreement contemplated in Section 55 of the Railways Act of 1924.  On occasion the railway companies had intimated their opinion that they did not consider that scheme of machinery entirely appropriate to Irish railway conditions, but at the instance of the unions the machinery was maintained.  In July of 1932 the railway companies considered it necessary to give notice of application to the Wages Board for a reduction in wages.  After passing through the various stages provided for in the agreed scheme of machinery, the application came before the Wages Board on November 24th, 1932.  It is not necessary, I think, to state here in broad outline the nature of the case made on behalf of the associated Irish railway companies, or the nature of the case made on behalf of the different unions that were represented.  The finding of the Irish Railway Wages Board was that a reduction of 10 per cent. should be made in the rates of wages and salaries paid prior to May, 1931, which was equal to a reduction of about 6 per cent. from present earnings. It is, of course, to be understood that the Irish Railway Wages Board is in no sense an Arbitration Board and its findings are not binding upon any of the parties concerned.  Opposition to the award was shown by the unions catering for the various grades of railway workers, and a proposal was made by them to the unions through me that that finding should not be put into operation for a period, and that the companies and the unions should await the transport legislation which was in contemplation, the intention being to secure from the Wages Board a new finding within the period after the <Col N="175" /> nature of the legislation had become known.</P>
    <P>An agreement upon that basis was not found possible, and after negotiations with the various parties and when it seemed that a general strike upon the Irish railway system was the only alternative, the Government decided to make the offer to the railway companies to which I have referred.  It was proposed by us, and agreed to by the companies and the unions, that the rates of wages paid prior to the 26th December, 1932, and the rates which had been payable since May, 1931, would continue until the 30th April, the Government making good to the companies the difference between the amount which they would have to expend in consequence of that arrangement and the amount which they would otherwise have paid in wages if the award had been brought into effect.  The main criticism which might be directed against the action of the Government in proposing the subsidy is that it deferred, at the expense of the taxpayers, a strike upon the Sáorstat railways but may not have prevented it, as in fact it did not prevent it, upon the Saorstát portion of the cross-Border systems, and that we will be presented on April 30th with a situation as grave as that which we were faced with in December.  The Government considered, however, that before the situation was allowed to go to a head which might have had irreparable consequences for the Sáorstat railways ample time should be allowed to all parties to think it over and that the nature of the contemplated legislation should be made known and that an effort should be made to create and to maintain an atmosphere conducive to agreement before and not after a strike had taken place.  The trade unions, at the time the subsidy arrangement was agreed to, stated their intention following the publication of the Transport Bills to endeavour to effect an agreement with the companies either by direct negotiations or by invoking the machinery of conciliation again.  I would like to take this opportunity of saying that <Col N="176" /> so far as the Great Southern Company is concerned, I trust that when that effort is made a satisfactory result will not be prevented by any undue advertence to what has gone before, and that both parties will wholeheartedly endeavour to effect a settlement in the full knowledge that a stoppage is likely to have disastrous results for the country and for the future of the railways and of railway employment.</P>
    <P>The position of the cross-Border services is, I think, known to Deputies. A strike is in progress and shows no signs of an early termination.  The position of those companies operating cross-Border services is not, of course, affected to the same extent as the Great Southern Company by any legislation which may be enacted here. Our legislation will, no doubt, improve their position and strengthen their prospects of earning increased revenue in the future.  Heretofore, agreements as to wages were made between the associated railway companies on the one hand, and the trade unions on the other, and applied to all Ireland.  If that position is to be maintained the cross-Border companies must be interested in any effort made to effect an agreement which will obviate the possibility of a stoppage on the Great Southern system on April 30th, and such an agreement will presumably be capable of an all Ireland application. If I might make a suggestion, therefore, it would be that the Companies and the Unions should separately and jointly reconsider the position as affected by the proposed legislation, the terms of which have now been published, and mutually endeavour to effect such arrangements for such period as will ensure the continuity of railway services during the time the new legislative proposals are being put into effect, and until the present trade depression is past and the future of railway transport can be more clearly estimated.  It would certainly help considerably towards the making of such arrangements if service on the cross-Border systems could be resumed while such reconsideration of the position was taking place.</P>
    <P>It should be understood that the Government does not propose to continue <Col N="177" /> the subsidy now payable to the Great Southern Company after April Deputy prepared to take the Second 30th, so that decisions as to the situation which is to prevail after that date must be made in the near future.  The payments provided for in the Estimate are: to the Great Southern Company, in respect of January and February, £13,138; the Irish Railway Clearing House for the same period, £260; the Great Northern Railway Company, to January 30th only, £1,230.  As the strike took place upon the Great Northern system and upon all the cross-Border systems on January 30th, the subsidy ceased to be payable from that date.  The payments further include the Sligo and Leitrim Railway, £55; the Donegal Railways, £147; the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway, £120; the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway £50, making a total of £15,000.  The amount payable to the Great Southern Company on 30th April will be provided for in the Estimates for next year.  I move the motion and I merely wish to say that the total sum required under all headings is £15,960.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in the opinion of the Dáil a reunion of the Irish nation founded on good-will should be the primary object of our Government policy and that every other constitutional issue should be subordinated thereto.</P>
      <P>I am hoping to have the general sympathy of the various Parties in the House for this motion.  I propose to deal with it in as non-contentious a manner as possible.  Of course, I agree with what Deputy McGilligan said this afternoon about the Oath Bill and I could apply the same remarks to some of the other measures the Government introduced during the past 12 months. I agree that there is an inconsistency between such action and the principle and spirit of this motion; but I do not want to spend our time this evening in crying over spilt milk, or in putting forward propositions that I know the Government Party are not likely to agree to.  I want to deal with the matter briefly and non-contentiously and to command such general sympathy for the motion as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject-matter of this motion has become very fashionable during the last two months.  But we are not raising it in order to be in the fashion. When we formed our Farmers' and Ratepayers' League last September we adopted, as one of our principal aims, the abolition of partition.  We proposed to abolish partition by abolishing <Col N="179" /> the animosities which are the cause of partition.  Since then we have been stressing the subject at practically all our meetings and it figured prominently in the election manifestoes of the Centre Party.  Of course, I am not so foolish as to claim originality on the subject for our Party, but I do want to lay emphasis on the fact that it always has been a very prominent consideration in our minds.  Moreover, as the record of our infant Party is necessarily a very short one, I hope I shall not be thought egotistical if I say a few words about my own connection with the subject.</P>
    <P>I had my first experience of electioneering in 1910, 23 years ago, when I went off to assist Nationalist candidates in County Derry and County Tyrone and, naturally, my efforts on those occasions were devoted to trying to persuade Ulster Unionists to cast aside their traditional prejudices, antipathies and animosities.  When the 1912 Home Rule Bill was being prepared, I took an active part, both on public platforms and on a semiofficial Committee which was formed in London and of which the late Erskine Childers was one of our colleagues, in supporting the widest possible kind of Home Rule so as to get Irish members away from WestMinster and away from the discords that were created by the connection of Irish members with the various English political parties.  When about that time a proposal was put forward in order to meet the Ulster problem that Ulster should be excluded from Home Rule for a trial period, I put forward an alternative proposition that Ulster should be included for a trial period and that after a certain term of years, if Ulster had been treated unfairly, she should have the right to go out of the Irish Home Rule Parliament.</P>
    <P>That was a proposal that was taken up a good many years later by Sir Horace Plunkett.  Then in 1914 when, like many thousands of Irish Nationalists, I joined the British Army and served in the European War, the overpowering motive with the vast majority of us was that we thought that by doing what we did we could <Col N="180" /> accomplish a great deal towards the conciliation of Ulster.  That was a very generous hope and, of course, it was a hope that was shattered by what occurred in 1916 and the events that followed 1916.  In 1920 I put forward in the Press another proposal bearing on the Ulster question; that was that Southern Ireland should be given Dominion Home Rule for a period of years and that after that we should be given our choice to decide whether we wanted a Republic without Ulster in or to be a Dominion within the Commonwealth with Ulster included.  Then, finally, in 1929 I stood for Belfast as a representative of the Northern Nationalists, and when I came into Free State politics it was with the determination to do whatever I could in their cause.</P>
    <P>We are not, therefore, introducing this motion in order to be in the fashion.  Neither are we introducing it as a matter of tactics to distract the Government from declaring a Republic.  If the Government were to declare a Republic to-morrow either for the Twenty-Six Counties or for the Thirty-Two Counties, I should personally not be at all dismayed by their action because I suspect that this is one of the several dissipations that we have still to indulge in before we have sown our wild oats.  A Republic in prospect and all the propaganda connected with a Republic in prospect are even a more formidable barrier in the way of reunion than a Republic in being.  A Republic may be a stage on the road to unity that it is impossible to cut out even though it takes us far out of the direct way.  But if so, do not let us dilly-dally about it. Let us start out and get it over.  Some day we shall return from Eldorado with a great many illusions shattered.</P>
    <P>This motion does not arise from abhorrence of a Republic.  What it does is that it asks the House to take the view that such issues as the Governor-General or no Governor-General, Oath or no Oath, Free State or Republic are trivial in comparison with Irish unity, that such unity can only be founded on goodwill and that it should be the constant preoccupation and the principal aim of <Col N="181" /> all our Governments.  We can endure a certain amount of straying from the main road so long as we are quite clear about our destination and are actively determined to get there.</P>
    <P>Kevin O'Higgins once said that we should think a lot about partition but never talk about it.  I cannot agree with that view, because if it is not talked about by sensible men it will be talked about on wrong lines by men who are less sensible, and instead of our policy being so conducted as to promote reunion it may be so conducted as to perpetuate partition.  Moreover, it is essential that the Nationalists of the North should not feel themselves to be deserted.  If 90 per cent. of the Northern Nationalists are pro-de Valera, as they are, the reason is that they were allowed to form the impression that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was indifferent to their fate.  I suggest that the cause of reunion should be often on our lips as well as in our hearts.</P>
    <P>What are the principal factors of the problem?  British politicians, like politicians everywhere, have evidently short memories and they often speak as if this were a problem which we Irish created for ourselves.  In truth, however, the English bear a very heavy responsibility for it.  Without troubling to go back into the more distant past, it is safe to say that the action of prominent British statesmen in coming over to incite Ulster's armed resistance to Home Rule and the action of certain British soldiers in promoting the Curragh mutiny are at the root of a great part of our difficulties to-day.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is up to the British to undo a little of the harm they have done.  I believe that those of them who think about Ireland at all would like to see partition abolished if only it could be abolished by mutual consent. I wish, then, that they would say so and say it loud and often.  The immense and ridiculous buildings erected at the expense of the British taxpayers to glorify the Six-County Government certainly give an opposite impression.</P>
    <P>On the whole however, the work of Irish reunion has got to be accomplished in Ireland itself and by Irishmen. <Col N="182" /> And, for us, the beginning of wisdom is the recognition that we are dealing with the Irish Nation of to-day, not with the Irish Nation of before the Milesian invasion or the Danish invasions, or the Reformation, or the Tudor, Stuart, Cromwellian and Williamite confiscations.  So long as you confine your idea of nationality to what is Catholic or what is Gaelic or what is persistently and on principle anti-English, you will not master the elements of the problem and all the hope of a union of the Irish Nation founded on good-will is an idle dream. The more you teach the Ulster Unionists to believe that they cannot claim to be Irishmen at all the more insoluble your problem will become.</P>
    <P>I suggest that some progress in this matter can be achieved immediately if we can get general agreement on certain fundamental principles.  The first of these is that the Irish civilisation of the future ought to embrace all constructive forces amongst us, including the contribution of our non-Gaelic element.  I would commend that principle to the Minister for Education and to Deputy Gibbons.  The second principle is that the Irish political system of the future should be one to command the sympathies of the non-Gaelic as well as of the Gaelic part of the population if it can possibly be managed.  There are many Deputies on the Government Benches to whom I would commend that principle.  The third principle is that pending the realisation of these hopes it should be regarded as a crime against the Irish Nation for any of us here to call each other traitors or tools of England or to stir up class antagonisms.  I would commend that principle to Deputies Kennedy and Maguire and to the Minister for Finance.  The fourth principle is this that in our enthusiasm we should distinguish between what is really worth while and what is not.</P>
    <P>In order to establish Irish unity we have to make some apparent sacrifices, but I suggest that we do not really have to sacrifice anything fundamental. After all, geography and economics are fighting on our side.  The Border is an artificial product of artificial passions.  Read the Ulster Unionist <Col N="183" /> newspapers and see how those passions are kept alive.  It does not really serve any useful purpose to claim a monopoly of patriotism or a monopoly of Nationality for the men of 1916 and their successors.  It does not serve any useful purpose to make people who do not know the Irish language pretend that they do know it.  It does not serve any useful purpose to have a cheap music-hall jingle instead of some splendid and moving Gaelic melody as a national anthem.  It does not serve any useful purpose to attack the house of a parish priest because he was a chaplain to Irish troops in the European War, or to desecrate the grave of Bryan Cooper, or to hoot and groan at ex-Ministers as they come out of Church.  These things are made the most of by the Orange Press.  I have a leading article in my pocket of the &ldquo;Belfast Newsletter&rdquo; on the Straide demonstration against the parish priest but I will not trouble the House with it.  It is thoroughly typical of the way in which these things are taken up and made the most of against Irish unity.  It is not the constructive side of Irish Nationalism that stands in the way of reunion; it is the side that, even if the North did not exist, we should be better without&mdash;jingoism, bitterness, intolerance, narrow-mindedness and love of what is tawdry and superficial. Fanatics on both sides of the Border have much the same mentality, but we are the people who want reunion and it is for us to give the lead in propagating charity and common sense.</P>
    <P>Let this be the test of a good Irishman&mdash;that, whether he prefers Commonwealth or Republic, he puts Ireland first, and remembers that Ireland is more, infinitely more, than any section of her sons and daughters.  On this basis we shall soon turn even our minorities in Southern Ireland into missionaries for the reunion of the Irish Nation.  And then perhaps the forecast of Edmund Burke, that I have already quoted in this House, will be realised: that when the thing called a country is once formed in Ireland quite other things will be done from what <Col N="184" /> were done when the minds of men were turned to the interests of a Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion proposed by Deputy MacDermot and elect to reserve my right to speak later.  [<i>No Deputy rose.</i>]  As it apparently is not the intention of any member of the Government Party to enlighten us as to their view on the motion which has been laid before the House by Deputy MacDermot, and which I have now seconded, I propose to add a very few words to what Deputy MacDermot has already said. The House will have noticed that we have invited the Dáil to express the opinion that &ldquo; a re-union of the Irish Nation founded on good-will should be the primary object of our Government policy and that every other constitutional issue should be subordinated thereto.&rdquo;  My reason for feeling that this motion should come before the House is that I think it would be well for all of us to realise and publicly proclaim that no form of political liberty, of political freedom, is of much value for Ireland except as an Irish Nation.  Personally, I make no disguise of the fact that I believe the truest form of freedom for our people can be secured as a united and independent country in association with the other countries of the Commonwealth of Nations.  But I am equally clear that that association can never prosper, that association can never have the advantage for us that it should have, or the advantage for the other members of the Commonwealth that it should have, unless and until partition ceases to exist in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent a Border constituency; a constituency in which a large number of the people belong to a political school of thought which used to be described as Unionist in this country. I have been deeply impressed by the fact that a great many of these men and women, who in the past believed with almost fanatical zeal that this country should remain in the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, are coming to realise now with their Nationalist fellow-countrymen that the Union was not a good proposition, that it was much better for the Irish people to control their own destines; and though <Col N="185" /> they reached that conclusion, a great many of them preserved the belief that it was better for the Six Counties to remain out.  Now, I believe there is spreading amongst these people, or there was spreading amongst them, the growing conviction that partition was in the interests neither of ex-Unionists or anybody else in this country.  But, unhappily, the practice of keeping on foot in this country a violent and acrimonious agitation for a Republic has resulted, in my opinion, in turning that tide of reconciliation, which, I believe, was flowing, and which, I believe, was about to affect very vital Unionist elements in the Six Counties, in the opposite direction, and has created a feeling of insecurity and doubt, which has thrust back into the much greater distance the hope of reunion and re-establishment of the Irish Nation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy MacDermot that rather than maintain a continual agitation in which expletives have been used of &ldquo;traitor&rdquo; and such like it would be better to pass through the stage of declaring a Republic for the Twenty-Six Counties and let us make up our minds if a Republic on that basis is worth having.  I would prefer that we in this country should come to realise that the feeling and outlook of every element in the country is worthy of consideration, and that before Ireland should come to a conclusion of a finite kind on the political status she wishes to occupy she should first provide that in making that conclusion she makes it as a united nation, and that she should resolve that her first objective should be the bringing back into Ireland of the Six Counties which have gone away, and that with their counsel and consent the future constitutional status of this country should be decided.</P>
    <P>I do think that nothing is more to be deplored than the practice which has obtained in Irish politics for some time of continually holding out before the younger generations of our people the lure of an Irish Republic; continually telling them that we are advancing towards the goal of a Republic and that to turn aside or think of anything else is the act of a traitor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> The very people who are telling them that know that it is not true.  The very people who tell the younger generations to-day that they are on the road to a Republic for the thirty-two counties know that it is not true; but, by lending their names and their prestige to that allegation they can deceive the younger generations of our people into regarding every political issue from that point of view and persuade our young people that to examine any proposal dispassionately is treachery and the act of a traitor.  To my mind that is profoundly wrong.  The true objective that we should set before our young people is that the first necessity for Ireland is the reconciliation of every section of its people, based upon good-will and fair understanding of the difficulties of one another.  Having achieved that reunion, based on that good-will, it will then be the duty of the Irish people to take into consideration the wider constitutional issues and to decide upon them without acrimony or without a feeling of bitterness one for the other.</P>
    <P>I believe that unless we proceed on those lines the reunion of this country is something that we need not hope to see in our lifetime.  I believe that unless we proceed along those lines we shall, in our time, precipitate a situation which will bring endless suffering on our people in the North of Ireland.  I would urge on the President and his Party to remember that, when they forget the obligation of promoting good-will amongst all sections of our people and when they allow inflammatory politics of the character to which we have listened in recent months to go on here in the Twenty-Six Counties, they are in danger of creating a situation in the North which will result in our people in the North having to bear the burden while our people in the South kick up all the row.  If the general tone is adopted which has been adopted here&mdash;breathing coercion, breathing violence&mdash;that is bound to have reactions in the Six Counties.  I beg of members of this House to remember that if these reactions occur in the Six Counties it is the defenceless nationalists of the North who will <Col N="187" /> have to bear the brunt of what may ensue, and the people who will be largely responsible for anything that may happen in the North will be able to do very little to assist them.</P>
    <P>Our people in the North are entitled to look to us for help and encouragement. The most valuable help and encouragement that we can give them is the promotion of the reunion of this country based upon good-will. I believe that is a possibility in our lifetime.  It is a possibility to persuade the Unionists of the Twenty-Six Counties and the Unionists of the Six Counties that their interests and our interests are best served by coming together again.  It is a big job.  We all know the immensity of the prejudices that we have got to overcome: the deep prejudice still to be found in the Six Counties.  It is, however, work that I believe with courage and resolution we can carry through.  It is work which is well worth doing and it is work which this motion calls upon the Dáil to sanction, to encourage and to promote amongst our people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the past. I did not think any of us desire to dwell upon the differences that parted us during the last fifteen or sixteen years.  On more than one occasion we have all been able to join in paying tribute to the men who laid down their lives in the Great War for Ireland, in Easter Week for Ireland or in the Civil War for Ireland.  The men who sealed the sincerity of their purpose with their blood command nothing but respect from their opponents.  Their memory should be an inspiration.  Their example is something to look back to though we may have differed from them.  We can look back upon them as brave men who did not lack the physical courage to do what they deemed it their duty to do.  So should we in this generation have the moral courage to do what it is our duty to do now.  If we have, I believe that we should come out now and say, that the President should say, that Deputy Cosgrave should say and that every section should say that we are prepared to work first for the reunion of this <Col N="188" /> country; that having achieved that, we are prepared to examine solely from the point of view of Ireland what our ultimate aim will be in regard to our political status: that until we have achieved reunion, and reunion based upon good-will, constitutional changes of another character hold little attraction or little hope for the nation as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to see the motion put without saying a word or two.  It is very difficult to speak on this motion, particularly after the speeches that have been made because neither the motion itself nor the speeches I have listened to give any material whatever for comment.  Everybody knows that we all desire the unity of our country.  Everybody knows that the members of this Party, speaking time after time, said that they regarded partition as the greatest crime that had ever been committed against this country; but has there come from anybody a suggestion as to how this crime is to be undone?  Does anybody show us how we are going to achieve the unity of this country?  I see no suggestion in this motion as to how it is to be done.  The motion speaks of &ldquo;a reunion of the Irish Nation founded on good-will.&rdquo;  I claim that we have shown goodwill: that as far as we are concerned and our brethren in the North on every possible occasion we have shown that we want them to enjoy the advantages of a free Ireland on the same terms as everybody else.  We want no privilege for anybody in this country, and we are denying no equality to anybody.  No matter what section of the people our citizens may belong to, they are entitled to get in this country of ours equal treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as we are concerned, at no time have we said, or by our actions indicated, that that equality of treatment would be denied.  Partition has taken place against our will.  If there is anybody in this House that can claim to have opposed it those at present sitting on these benches can make that claim.  When negotiations were <Col N="189" /> entered into with the British in 1921 we put it first and foremost as the basis of any settlement between the two peoples.  One of the principal reasons why those of us who opposed the Treaty did so was because we saw that the Treaty ultimately did mean partition. We saw how the clauses of it were drawn up: we saw that they were designed to secure partition.  On every occasion that we had contact with British Ministers, that contact convinced us that the fundamental aim of British policy was to partition this country.</P>
    <P>What, then, can we achieve by good-will so far as we are concerned?  We have indicated time after time that a policy of force, of coercion, against the North is not our policy.  We indicated that from the start in our negotiations with the British in 1921.  What does Deputy MacDermot or Deputy Dillon suggest can be done?  They have made no suggestion.  They have tried to suggest that we, in this part of Ireland, are doing something which gives the people in the North the right to remain out, or gives to our opponents across the water a reason for using their power and their influence to make partition, so far as they can, permanent in this country.</P>
    <P>The whole suggestion behind this motion is that there was need for it in this House.  I say that there was no need for it.  I believe that in this one instance there is a united House, that everyone of us here would do everything that is humanly possible to end partition, if there was any solution put forward, but there is no solution put forward.  We say that we cannot coerce them&mdash;we will not coerce them, even if we could.  That is not our purpose.</P>
    <P>What inducement can we hold out to them?  That we go back into the Union again, is it?  It is suggested here that every constitutional issue should be subordinated to that desire.  How can you subordinate anything to a mere desire when you do not see when that desire is going to come to fruition?  If there is put up to us a definite, clear proposition by which the unity of this country can be secured, then we will <Col N="190" /> have something to talk about and then we will have some standard by which we can test whether we are properly subordinating what should be subordinate issues to a major issue.  But there is nothing of the sort here.  We are talking in the air and really we are only wasting our time, except in so far as some members may wish to give us a lecture on national good behaviour.  Perhaps it is needed.  If it is, well and good; we will suffer nothing by listening to it, but, from the practical point of view of trying to put an end to this crime, I have heard nothing to-night and I do not expect that if I were listening to speeches until to-morrow morning I would hear from any member of this House any practical suggestion as to how, with all the good-will in the world, we are going to bring about the end of partition. Personally, I think that every Deputy on this side of the House feels that this is purely a pious expression of opinion and that nothing is going to be gained either by passing it or by not passing it, that it leaves us exactly where we were and, consequently, I feel that I, too, am wasting my time talking about it.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is meant when it is said that every other constitutional issue is to be subordinated. Subordinated to what?  &mdash;Subordinated to this object which should be the primary object of Governmental policy, the securing of the unity of the country.  I have said that we cannot subordinate because there is no definite road by which anybody can show how the unity of the country can be secured.  If there is no way to secure it, why should we not make an advance in the direction in which we know we are advancing and why should we slacken, for one moment, in the move that is going to give greater freedom and security here in this part of Ireland.  I know that it is suggested that if we do this or if we do that, it will give offence to the North.  &ldquo;It will give offence to the North.&rdquo;  and we are being blackmailed, so to speak, constantly, by this cry &ldquo;Do not do this or do not do that because if you do, you are going to give offence to the North.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Those who, at every effort, say, when you are going to advance in a direction in which you can advance, in which a definite policy is obvious, &ldquo;Do not go along that road because if you do, this unity of Ireland which nobody can see how to bring about at the moment is going to be put further off.&rdquo;  It is up to the people who make claims like that to show us how it is going to come, if we refrain from the other action.  We here to-day, in the matter of the Oath, are providing for internal peace in this part of Ireland&mdash;at least, I hope we are.  It was one of the main intentions behind the passing of that Bill. I did not reply to-day because I had made replies formerly in which I said that the passing of that Bill is in accordance with the Treaty, perfectly in accordance with the Treaty, but we are told that if we do not take an Oath which we think, in the first place, is unnecessary, and, in the second place, is causing disunion in this part of Ireland, if we do not continue taking an Oath that we do not want to take, we are going, in some way or other, to put still further off this infinitely distant day on which by good-will we are going to bring about the union of these two parts of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I say that those who want to use that argument must show us a practical way by which it can be secured.  There is no lack of good-will so far as we are concerned, no lack whatever, and when we have a motion of this kind, there is a suggestion that there is a lack of good-will.  If there is good-will lacking, then, it is not on our part and we cannot induce good-will except by continuing our present attitude to those who are opposed to the union of the country at the present time.  I do not think, as I have said, anything is to be gained either by voting for or voting against the motion. If it is a mere demonstration of our <Col N="192" /> desire for the unity of the country, we are willing to vote for it, but, apart from that, I do not see any real purpose that is going to be served.</P>

      <P>The only policy for abolishing partition that I can see is for us, in this part of Ireland, to use such freedom as we can secure to get for the people in this part of Ireland such conditions as will make the people in the other part of Ireland wish to belong to this part.</P>

      <P>I intend to reply only very briefly and in very few words. I am quite unable to follow the President's reasoning when he appears to suggest that it is useless for the Government to have in its mind as a guiding principle the union of Ireland founded on good-will.  It seems to me that if that motive is constantly present to their minds and to the minds of their supporters it must be of enormous value in gradually bringing about that reunion.  I did not bring in this motion for the purpose of casting blame on anybody.  It was not intended to be a challenging or offensive motion in any way, but there is no use shutting our eyes to this, that there are a number of speeches made, leaving aside, now, questions of acts committed in the past, every day which, if any one of us were an Ulster Unionist, would harden us in our determination not to be incorporated in the same country as the Irish Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an exclusiveness of outlook with regard to what Irish civilisation should consist of, and there is a lack of the spirit of compromise, or of conciliation, with regard to the political system under which this country has to live, which forms a desperate barrier to the getting rid of partition.  If I could think that this motion was accepted sincerely by members of the Parties in this House, and would constitute a guide for future Governments in the measures they put before the House, I honestly believe we should be <Col N="193" /> accomplishing a very great deal to secure the reunion of the Irish Nation and good-will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the economic policy of the Executive Council has in its results so impoverished a majority of the farmers of this State that they do not possess the capital requisite for the carrying on of their industry and that in consequence the Executive Council should now take the necessary steps to supply to these farmers free of charge an adequate quantity of artificial manures, agricultural seeds and spraying material so as to enable them fully to utilise the resources of their farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is necessitated by the present condition of agriculture in this country.  Personally I am not in favour, in normal times, of encouraging any individual, or any sets of individuals to look too much to the State, or when they are in difficulties to turn immediately to the State saying: &ldquo;Extricate us from these difficulties.&rdquo; My view is that the best thing you can do to any industry is to make that industry self-reliant; the best you can do to any individual working in any industry is to encourage that individual to look first, and as far as <Col N="194" /> possible all the time, to his own labours, to his own energies and exertions, and not to seek for external help.  Those are the general principles which, I think, should animate a Government in dealing with individuals, and animate individuals when dealing with a Government.  But there comes certain times, certain grave crises in the history of a country when that which would normally be most desirable cannot be achieved, and when to avoid disaster it is necessary for us to depart from what ought to be the practice in normal times.  Nobody at the present moment can question the truth of the proposition that Irish agriculture is reeling under the effects of a blow more heavy than it has received in the lifetime of this generation, or indeed in the lifetime of many generations.  I sincerely hope that the Executive Council, in dealing with the present state of affairs and in considering the condition to which agriculture has been reduced, will not content themselves with taking any very short or narrow view, that they will look not to what is likely to happen within the next month, the next three months, the next six months, or the next year, but will take a broad and long view, and that they will visualise what is likely to come upon this State; that they will take now all the steps which will avoid as far as they are avoidable, the consequences of the policy which they have pursued.</P>
    <P>I said a few moments ago that agriculture was staggering under a blow more serious than it had received in our time.  I would like the House to consider the condition to which agriculture has been reduced.  If you take our live-stock alone, and the capital value of that live-stock, I am perfectly certain that the capital loss which farmers have sustained is something closer to £20,000,000 than to £15,000,000.  That is an enormous capital loss, an enormous weakening of the agricultural resources of our country.  I am perfectly well aware that that vast sum is not being withdrawn at the present moment from agriculture, because a great deal of that capital, which has been so reduced, will remain in the form of capital.  As far as cash dealings <Col N="195" /> are concerned, the loss will not be felt immediately.  Let me give an example.  If a man has got a cow which was worth say £20, if this economic war were not on, and which is now worth only about £14, no doubt that is no direct loss to the man financially, if he does not intend to sell the cow. Therefore, the entire sum I mentioned as being the capital loss is is not capital lost, when you come to consider cash dealings.  But it is a capital loss when you come to consider credit dealings, because a person who has got a well-stocked farm, having saleable cattle on the farm, and saleable at a good price, is a man who can get as much credit as he reasonably requires.  On the other hand, if a man has a well-stocked farm, and if that farm is stocked with cattle which are unsaleable, or saleable only at a very low price indeed, then that man's credit is gone, and the loss which has been already sustained by a farmer in the loss of actual capital, in the sale of the animals that he had been compelled to sell below what ought to have been their normal price, is supplemented by the loss of credit from which farmers are also suffering at present. The result is that in this State you have now a farming community which has not got the necessary ready money to purchase what it requires, and which, at the same time, has lost its credit.  Because this is a matter of the very gravest economic importance I want the Government to visualise for themselves, as far as they can, what the condition of this country is going to be next summer, what the condition of the small working farmer is going to be next July or August, what it is going to be after the fruits of the present harvest have been exhausted and when he can support himself only upon such stuff as he can get either for cash or credit.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that even if things do not get worse than they are, we are going to have the condition of our working farmers next July and next August very much worse than it has been in human memory.  I see no hope, and if there is hope I sincerely <Col N="196" /> desire that the Government will encourage that hope, that this economic war may be brought to a termination within a reasonably short time.  At the present moment I cannot see any signs that that eventuality is likely to take place.  In consequence I must consider the condition of the farmers, the working farmers especially, and what that condition will be when they are receiving the wretched prices which they are bound to receive for their live-stock and for their live-stock products from now until, let me say, next Christmas.  There was never amongst small working farmers of this State, except during the abnormal period of the Great War, a very large margin between comfort and poverty and that margin has now been swept away.  If you come to consider what the position of these people will be next July, next August and next September, before the fruits of the next harvest will be available for them and when they have no cash and when they will get no credit from the shopkeepers, you will see that their condition will be deplorable.</P>
    <P>If, and I am sure it is the prayer of every single Deputy that it will not occur, we happen to have a bad harvest then it seems to me that this State will be faced with famine.  I do not see what else can happen.  Of course you may say that there will be always a certain amount of live-stock which can be eaten but man cannot be completely carnivorous.  He must have something else as well as live-stock. The mere devouring of live-stock will not keep your population alive.  You will want more.  If there is going to be a bad harvest this year it does seem that there is a danger, a very grave danger of famine in this State.  That is why I am pressing on the Executive Council as earnestly as I can to look forward to the future, to see what may happen and to take steps now to prevent as far as they can prevent, worse happening.</P>
    <P>It is pretty obvious that there must be a bad harvest this year, no matter what kind of weather is coming, unless the crops are properly sown and properly manured.  I think that in a <Col N="197" /> country like ours it will be impossible for the land to yield profitable and good crops unless that land is properly manured with artificial fertilisers.  I say, no matter how good the weather may be, you cannot have a satisfactory crop if you put down an unmanured crop, but the majority of the working farmers of this State have not got, at the present moment, the ready money or the credit by which they would be able to purchase an adequate supply of fertilisers.  Some of them have not got enough money to purchase any fertilisers at all.  That means that there will be almost for a certainty a bad harvest this year if the crops go down improperly manured.  I should like to press upon the Executive Council, as urgently and as strongly as I can, that they should now take all steps that they can to see that the necessary potatoes at any rate are properly manured and properly sprayed and that persons will not have bad crops this year solely because of the fact that they were unable to afford the price of the necessary artificial manure or the necessary spraying stuffs.  This, to my mind, is a very grave matter and I should like the Executive Council to look forward and to consider what will be the effect upon the next harvest if the working farmer is not in a position properly to manure his crops.  That will mean, as I have said, a bad harvest and what will be the result of a bad harvest upon a population which has got no money to buy any feeding stuffs for itself?</P>
    <P>There is another way of looking at this.  You are going to have relief grants.  You have got relief grants already and you are going to have more next year and the year after.  You are going to give employment out of these relief grants to men who are idle. Would it not be far better and far cheaper for the State if you engaged these men as far as you could to work profitably on their own land?  Though it may cost the State some money, so will relief grants cost the State money and is it not far better for the man and the State, for the working farmers who must be helped at the present moment that they should be helped in <Col N="198" /> a manner which will enable them to help themselves in the working of their farms and in the production of proper crops?  Remember you are not dealing in this matter with mere pawns.  These persons are suffering as a result of the economic war.  They are not mere pawns.  They are men of flesh and blood.  They have a right to their lives and the enjoyment of their lives and they have got the right to demand that no unnecessary suffering shall be brought upon them.  They have got a right to expect that the Government which is engaged in this economic war will have sufficient foresight and that that Government will take every single step to ensure that the consequences of the economic war will press as lightly as possible on those who have to suffer.</P>
    <P>There will be&mdash;there must be&mdash; suffering.  There is suffering now. There must be suffering in the future far greater than the suffering that there is now.  You have entailed that upon the people, but, for goodness sake, see that that suffering is made as little as possible and, therefore, help in a practical way the agricultural industry, and especially the small farmers, who are the main people to suffer from the effects of this economic war.  You have already, of course given very large sums in bounties. There is a bounty upon cattle exported to England, but that bounty is not going back to the producer.  That is going to the exporters, but it does not help the price of cattle in the market. I should be very interested if the Minister for Agriculture will manage to produce any figures which show that those bounties have improved the prices in the fairs and markets, because I hold that they have not, and anybody who knows anything about the condition of the sales of Irish cattle, will know that the bounties have been of no value to the person who has bred the stock and brought the stock to the fair to sell.  If they really did come down and help the actual producer the cattle upon which the bounties are being paid, then the Minister for Agriculture stands condemned out of his own mouth, because he has refused to put these bounties on sheep on the <Col N="199" /> ground that they would be of no value to the owners of sheep.</P>
    <P>You are spending money now upon bounties to help the farmers and that it is necessary that you should give them help I quite agree, but I suggest that the most practical way in which you can help the farmers, and especially the working farmers, and I have in my mind naturally the farmers of my own constituency principally, the best way you can help them is by seeing that their land is properly manured and properly seeded this year.  It will not be unless something is done.  Remember, that not only will you have bad crops this year but at the same time the quality of your land will be very much reduced and if you put down a bad class of seeds&mdash;a bad class of hayseeds let me say,&mdash;and you have got to put down a cheap and worthless mixture or let your land tumble into grass because you have not the money to buy seeds, that land is going to suffer for very many years to come.  I should like to ask the Executive Council to consider if there is any more practical way in which they can help the working farmers than by seeing that they get these necessary things free of charge this year.  They have not the money to pay for them.  It is very little use giving them facilities to buy. I would very much rather see them getting these seeds and these manures free of charge this particular year than to have them borrow money to purchase these necessities with the hope, and even perhaps the intention, of never having to pay that money back. In my opinion, that is the most demoralising thing that can happen to anybody&mdash;to enter into contracts and borrow money with the hope that he will never be asked to pay.</P>
    <P>This situation, as I see it at any rate, is one which does call for the giving of assistance.  These people require assistance.  If you are going to avoid something very close to a famine, and if you have something approximating to a famine, remember that it is quite clear that the resources of the Poor Law will not be able to deal with anything approaching a famine because the ratepayers are the farmers <Col N="200" /> and the farmers are the very persons who will be in the position of not being able to pay rates.  Even the whole resources of the State may be exhausted in endeavouring to keep people alive if a famine, of which there is a real danger, does come upon this State.  I should like to ask the Executive Council, as I have said already, to look at this matter seriously and gravely and to take a long view of the present condition to see what may happen and to take steps to ensure that whatever does happen will do the least possible amount of damage to the people of this State.</P>

      <P>That extremely melancholy Deputy opposite has painted a positively dreadful picture of the condition of the farmers. What the Deputy has got to recognise &mdash;assuming that it is true, and he is the witness&mdash;is that he is also a witness to the fact that the people of this country preferred that condition of affairs to a Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  That is on his own testimony. All these dreadful things are there for about three millions of people, who are just as intelligent as the Deputy, to see them, and yet the free electorate of this country actually preferred that state of affairs to a Cumann na nGaedheal Government. What must a Cumann na nGaedheal Government be like if the people preferred that dreadful condition, which the Deputy has painted, to a Cumann na nGaedheal Government? You must remember that the Deputy is his own witness.  He is not going to tell us that the people of this country are unintelligent or that the people of the West of Ireland do not know the circumstances just as well as the Deputy does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What amazing degree of expert knowledge on the sale of cattle has that lawyer on the opposite benches that is not possessed also by the ordinary farming member of this Irish community? They know all that and yet they prefer that that condition of affairs should continue rather than that <Col N="201" /> Government shall come here.  All I can say is that if I was Cumann na nGaedheal I should say &ldquo;A plague upon such backing.&rdquo;  I certainly should not choose that advocate even in a running down case.  Last June the bottom was to fall out of things. Now it is next June.  And then it is next August, and then next September, and then, &ldquo;Please God, let us have a bad harvest and it will come true.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If it is a good harvest, his prophecy does not come true. The Deputy was elected as a T.D., not as a prophet.  If only some of these terribly bad things would come so true that some other person than the Deputy would recognise the disaster come upon the country because the Fianna Fáil Government had come in twice and had come in to stay!  Last time, we were caretakers.  We were in on an 11 months' tenancy.  All you had got to do, Jimmy Thomas, was put the pressure upon them, when the people would squeal and the caretakers would be thrown out.  Everybody was taught that.  We were treated as if they were just waiting for us to go. They would not have a by-election.  No &mdash;they would not have two by-elections. No&mdash;they would not have three by-elections. No&mdash;they were waiting for the critical moment, when they would lift their little finger and give to the people of this country permission to throw out the caretakers and put in a Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  That was the first time.  Now, we are here with a lease.  We are here to stay and the people who knew everything that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney pretends to know were the people who put us in &mdash;put us here with a lease to carry on as we were carrying on.  &ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that the economic policy of the Executive Council has in its results so impoverished a majority of the farmers of this State....&rdquo; If they believed that the policy of the Executive Government had permanently impoverished the people of this State, would they have put us back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> Is the Deputy's case that the whole of the electorate of the Free State are fools?  That is the only case he can have.  The plain English of it is that the people of the country who made the Dáil who made the Executive Council, were of opinion that whatever sacrifice they were temporarily asked to stand was good value for money, was good value for nationality&mdash;that whatever sacrifices they made in the present was a good investment for the future.  They have put this Government back to go on doing what it did before&mdash;to wage an economic war to keep a nation's ransom at home. That is what is impoverishing the people&mdash;the keeping of a nation's ransom at home.  Poor Jimmy may be impoverished but we are not impoverished by keeping a nation's ransom at home.  The policy of the Executive Government has impoverished the people!  Why and how?  Because they have set their feet upon a path which leads to the development and building up of industries that will absorb not merely present unemployment but which will face up to the absolutely unescapable fact that we have got 25,000 more per year to absorb into employment.  Two hundred and fifty thousand young men and women went out while the Opposition was in power.  That was the cheap way of employing them.  We have not got that way.  We are impoverishing them, apparently, by providing a policy under which there will be industry in the country, under which the people will manufacture the things they use instead of importing them.  That is the sort of impoverishment that the Irish people approved at at the last General Election.</P>
    <P>You have got to watch what is happening. Look back a few years.  The representatives on this side, which has constituted that Executive Government, were only 36.  They became 44. They became 57.  They became 72.  They became 77.  And they became that while the people were living in the <Col N="204" /> experience of the methods of making the country prosperous under Cumann na nGaedheal.  Recognise that slow growth, that steady and inexorable growth of public opinion behind the Executive which that bright young man opposite says has impoverished the majority of the farmers of the State. If we did that, how is it that there is not a party here now that even pretends to call itself a Farmers' Party which is opposed to us?  What were the majority of the farmers doing when they would not even call themselves farmers?  Assume for a moment&mdash;it is an amazingly impudent assumption&mdash; that what is called the Centre Party represents the farmers&mdash;eight per cent. of this House, 8 per cent. of the country.  Are those the impoverished farmers?  Are those ten men, most of whom have been filched from under the fostering wing of Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;are they the farmers?</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. The reopening and development of quarries is primarily a matter for private enterprise, but I shall be glad to give any assistance in my power if responsible people in the district give evidence of a practical desire to undertake the reopening and development of the quarries to which the Deputy refers.</P>

      <P>Robert T. Forrest was returned as a tenant of a holding in Shane Upper and Shane Lower on the estate of Sir G.O. Colthurst, County Cork, at a rent of £324 6s. 6d.

The tenant having objected to the said standard purchase annuity, the standard purchase annuity will be fixed by the Land Commission under Part 2 of the First Schedule to the Land Act, 1923, as soon as possible. This annuity will be retrospective to the Appointed Day, 1st May, 1931.  The tenant states that this holding has been held on the terms of an <Col N="64" /> English managed estate and that since 1923 the former landlord has carried out no improvements.
