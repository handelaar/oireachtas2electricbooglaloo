      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The earliest of the Public Charitable Hospitals Acts, all of which it is now proposed to repeal, was passed in June, 1930, and was to remain in force until July, 1934.  The object of the original Act, which authorised the holding of sweepstakes to raise money for hospitals, was to help voluntary hospitals.  The Act laid down three conditions which these institutions had to satisfy if they desired to participate in sweepstake moneys.  These conditions were that the hospital had to be in the Saorstát and in receipt of voluntary subscriptions from the public, and during the year prior to the passing of the Act had used 25 per cent. of its accommodation for free patients or patients paying ten shillings or less per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hospitals that could satisfy these conditions and wished to organise a sweepstake were required to appoint a committee for the submission of a scheme to the Minister for Justice and give particulars of the prizes, the prices of tickets, the amount or maximum amount of expenses in connection with the sale of tickets and <Col N="320" /> the manner in which the money was to be applied.  When the scheme was sanctioned, the committee could arrange with others to promote the sweepstake and the Act contained provisions regulating the expenses of holding the sweepstake.</P>
    <P>The immediate object of the promoters of the original Act was the relief of a few Dublin hospitals from their financial embarrassments.  In the post-war period a high cost of maintenance was not counterbalanced by an increased flow of subscriptions from the charitable public, and some of the hospitals had fallen into a precarious financial condition as they had not then fully developed a system of charging patients for their maintenance. Only six hospitals, all in Dublin City, participated in the first sweepstake on the Manchester November Handicap, 1930.  It has been said that the six hospitals hoped to be able to divide £20,000 as a result of that sweepstake.  If that were so, we now see that their expectations were not pitched very high.  As things turned out, the six hospitals, one of them a dental hospital, received £131,671 from the first sweepstake alone.  The tremendous success that attended the sweepstakes falsified all predictions. In June, 1930, when the first temporary Act was passed, no one reckoned that in less than three years the proceeds of sweepstakes available for hospitals would be reckoned not in tens of thousands but in millions of pounds, and that not only would a few Dublin hospitals benefit but almost every hospital in the country, whether voluntary or rate-aided.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say now that we have seen what is possible in the way of raising money by sweepstakes, that it would have been more prudent to have taken the long view at the beginning and to have provided in a more deliberate and systematic way for the distribution of sweepstake moneys.  It must be conceded that the magnificent success of the sweepstakes could not reasonably have been anticipated.  The arrangements embodied in the Acts which this Bill will repeal were of a temporary and somewhat experimental nature and have been signally successful <Col N="321" /> in fulfilling their purpose.  The promoters, the Hospitals Committee and the Trustees are to be congratulated. They have laid the governing bodies of the hospitals under a deep debt of gratitude.</P>
    <P>We must now address ourselves to the problems of administration and organisation arising out of the rapid and unprecedented financial success which has attended the plan adopted a few years ago.  The administrative proposals contained in the Bill are intended as a basis for the rationalisation of expenditure of the moneys placed at our disposal for the care of the sick, and the suffering, and the improvement of the conditions under which they are treated.  The extent to which the perfecting of our hospital system can be carried out will eventually depend on the continuance of the success of the sweepstakes, but even within the limits of the funds which have already been obtained, it is obvious that the country has a unique opportunity of tackling the question of hospital organisation in a comprehensive way.  The position of the State in the matter is that it simply recognises the existence of a condition of affairs which is making millions of money available for hospital and nursing facilities.  It is not intervening in the control or conduct of the methods by which these moneys are being raised, but once the funds are available, the State conceives itself to have a responsibility in seeing that such funds are expended to the best possible advantage, with prudence and foresight and with due knowledge of the condition of the sick and their hospital needs throughout the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The original Act was amended by several Acts passed in 1931.  It was found that certain hospitals could not participate by reason of the conditions laid down with regard to free patients and voluntary subscriptions.  A number of such were specifically exempted from complying with the conditions. The Principal Act did not contemplate any of the proceeds of sweepstakes going to county or district hospitals or other rate-supported institutions.  But the success of the sweepstakes soon brought forward claims on behalf of <Col N="322" /> these institutions.  In 1931 the Oireachtas made a radical amendment in the method of dividing the money available. Theretofore, the Hospitals Committee fixed, with the approval of the Minister for Justice, the proportion of the surplus that each of the participating hospitals would receive.  In substitution of this arrangement it was enacted that the surplus was to be divided into two parts, two-thirds to be divided amongst the participating hospitals and one-third to be paid to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to be applied by him to meeting expenses in or towards the provision, improvement or equipment of institutions for the prevention, treatment or cure of physical or mental disease or injuries to human beings, including institutions wholly or partly maintained by a local authority. It was subsequently provided that 1-25th of the share paid to the Minister was to be applied for the benefit of nursing associations.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1931 also made provision for the appointment by the Minister for Justice of a Committee of Reference of three members.  This Committee's function was to report to the Minister on the proportions in which the two-thirds part of the surplus should be divided between the governing bodies of the hospitals entitled to participate.  The Committee have already presented three reports.  In their report on the Manchester November Handicap Sweepstake, 1931, the Committee of Reference cogently illustrate the dangers of a piecemeal and uncontrolled development along those lines.  They state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Considered in its national aspect, the Irish hospital system reveals a condition which is open to certain criticisms.  Evidence of this was furnished by the manner in which the claims made by the participating hospitals were presented to us.  Many of these showed an acute lack of appreciation of the proper lines of hospital development in relation to the social and community needs.  The main features of the majority of the claims were variously related to a single anxiety, namely, to obtain the largest possible award from sweepstake funds.  In justification to this <Col N="323" /> anxiety, a programme of building was in most cases hastily considered, generally with a view to increasing the existing accommodation without regard either to the needs of the community served or to any scheme which would extend hospital facilities to classes of patients for whom inadequate provision at present exists.  In few cases was it attempted to co-ordinate claims with those of other hospitals, or to investigate the advantages which a unified policy of development would ensure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This kind of reaction on the part of individual institutions to the knowledge that money was available for them if they only pressed their claim is the kind of reaction that we wish to avoid. Wise and delicate administration will be required to secure well-balanced and harmonious development.  Too many institutions must not be allowed to specialise along the same lines to the neglect of other less popular branches of curative medicine.  The central specialised hospitals must be made available for all, and the poor must get the use of them free.  The local hospitals must be developed to afford the maximum of utility without a high degree of specialisation and their geographical organisation must be carefully planned.</P>
    <P>It will accordingly be seen that a plan of hospital organisation is not a thing that can be improvised between one sweepstake and another.  It involves numerous problems, some of them novel and complex, that demand careful and continuous consideration. Schemes of piecemeal organisation would also defeat their purpose and give rise to anomalies and overlapping. There must be first-hand investigations covering the whole of the State, and the needs of the community must be determined by somebody in a position to determine what is the best form of hospital organisation for the area and what part the different types of hospitals are to play in meeting the needs of the community.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the essential unity of the institutional problem as a whole, both as regards the voluntary hospitals <Col N="324" /> and the poor law hospitals, and having regard also to his position in relation to rate-aided institutions, the Minister must accept the responsibility for supervising and controlling the reorganisation scheme as a whole. But there will be no additions to or extensions of the existing statutory powers of the Minister.  As regards legal control, the Minister does not propose to invade the domain of voluntary effort.  It is, however, expected that the power of affording or withholding financial assistance which the Bill proposes to give him will enable him to get all voluntary institutions to work in harmony with the general aims of the national scheme of reorganisation.  I may say here that the chief aim of that scheme will be to secure from the moneys now made available that the sick poor throughout the country shall be given every facility of treatment and nursing that their richer brethren can afford to obtain.  I say, moreover, that this aim will be embodied as a condition of every allocation from the funds placed at the Minister's disposal, whether such allocations are made to the poor law bodies over which the Minister already exercises a certain control, or to those in charge of the voluntary institutions with regard to whom the Minister has up to the present suffered from a certain detachment.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there is need for a complete survey of the hospital system of the country as a whole.  If the distribution of sweepstake moneys proceeded on existing lines until the needs of the voluntary hospitals, which the Committee assess at seven million pounds, are met, it was clear that an unprecedented opportunity of dealing with the question of organisation in a comprehensive way would have been missed.  The present position is that we have several systems working side by side.  First we have what for convenience is called the voluntary system, though some of these institutions lack what would be regarded as the main characteristics of a voluntary hospital, inasmuch as they are not supported mainly by voluntary gifts or endowments and all contributions from patients are not voluntary offerings. <Col N="325" /> I am using the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; in a wide sense to cover public hospitals which are not a direct charge on the rates or mainly supported out of public funds.  These voluntary hospitals are supported in varying proportions by endowments, subscriptions, and fees received from patients able to pay. They include the large clinical hospitals which the medical schools recognise as teaching centres and they also include numerous smaller establishments, some of them special hospitals dealing with particular diseases or with particular classes of patients.  Then we have the county infirmaries and county fever hospitals.  Their purpose is recited in the Act of 1765.  They were to be &ldquo;receptacles for the poor, who are infirm and diseased.&rdquo;  When the Poor Relief Act of 1838, which created the workhouse system, was passed it was intended that the Poor Law Commissioners would examine into the state of the &ldquo;several fever hospitals, dispensaries or institutions for the relief of the sick or convalescent poor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Commissioners were instructed by the Statute to set forth the number of hospitals or dispensaries which ought to be provided in addition to the workhouse.  In 1841 the Commissioners reported, and in their report suggested that there should be a Medical Charities Board established, and charged with the duty of suggesting and advising the necessary arrangements for the provision of dispensaries and hospitals and infirmaries, and for their regulation.  The Board was never established, but to-day, when we are proposing to establish an advisory body of the character then suggested, it is worth recalling that close on a century ago it was seen that an expert body was needed to ensure that provision made should be properly distributed without inadequacy or overlapping.  Thirteen years ago, on the break-up of the workhouse system, many of the infirmaries were absorbed into the new county hospitals system.  Some of the county schemes provided for the abolition of the committees of management of the county infirmaries, and the handing over of the infirmary to the board of health; others made no change and the committees <Col N="326" /> were allowed to continue as they were.  About two-thirds of the county infirmaries had ceased to exist in 1921.  Finally we have the hospitals that are under the control of the boards of health&mdash;the county, district and fever hospitals.  These have mostly developed out of the old workhouse infirmaries.  In some counties there is a county hospital only; in others there is a county hospital, supplemented by district or cottage hospitals, and in a few counties there are district hospitals only.</P>
    <P>We have these three systems that I have described working side by side. Arrangements exist between some of the hospitals, but generally it may be said that each group carries on its work in isolation.  There is no co-ordinating authority.  The haphazard development has resulted in some areas being well served, other areas being less well served, and others again not served at all.  No one could seriously contemplate this system, or rather want of system, continuing indefinitely.  We have no general hospital system in the strict sense.  The pressure of circumstances, illustrated in the case of the county infirmaries, has tended to break it down and to compel amalgamations.  The Government cannot stand idly by and see millions of money poured into a system obviously unorganised and insufficient. To do that would be to stereotype all the existing defects for generations to come.  Like other countries we must work to some plan.  Elsewhere amalgamations and working arrangements are the order of the day.  The advances in medicine, with its greater specialisation, make it imperative not only that old and small institutions scattered here and there should be extended and enlarged, but that the best means possible should be devised to bring together in convenient centres the expert personnel, equipped with all the means that science has placed at our disposal for combating disease. I am of one mind with the Committee of Reference when they deplore the misguided loyalties which seek to preserve existing interests, to the detriment of reforms that are so obviously called for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> I observed recently that in Stockholm, in drawing up a hospital plan they propose to discard a number of old and out-of-date hospitals, and replace them by three central hospitals, one for each borough; and that one of these central hospitals will accommodate 1,500 patients&mdash;a number which is more than three times the bed-accommodation of the largest of our voluntary hospitals.  In Copenhagen also the National Hospital, which occupies a special place amongst the hospitals, has close on 1,000 beds, and receives patients from all over the kingdom.  I mention these two to illustrate the trend away from the small hospitals.  Whatever the resources the sweepstakes place at our disposal we cannot afford to fritter them away on obsolete or unnecessary institutions. The problem requires study by an authority whose business it will be to link up the different systems.  A plan of hospital organisation is not a thing that can be improvised between one sweepstake and another.  It involves numerous problems, some of them novel and complex, that demand careful consideration.  The needs of the community must be determined, the form of hospital organisation best fitted to meet those needs must be clearly visualised, and the adaptation of our existing hospitals with the least avoidable disturbance to fit into a complete scheme must be tackled and dealt with.  It is not a question of finding out the needs of this or that institution, and adding a wing here or a new storey there.  We must have investigation at first-hand of the needs of the community, and the relative degree of urgency of whatever new measures are necessary must be determined. When grants are made they must be made for some purpose consistent with a complete plan.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to establish such an authority, to be called the Hospitals Commission.  The Commission will have power to survey the existing hospital facilities in each area, and to bring together all the data that throw light on the health of the people&mdash;the death rates, the incidence of disease, and so on.  Every application made <Col N="328" /> for a grant out of sweepstake funds will be referred to the Commission for report.  They will be entitled to inspect any hospital, and to examine all accounts of receipts and expenditure. The existence of the Hospitals Commission will render the continuance of the Committee of Reference unnecessary. The number of ordinary members of the Commission will be not less than three.  Provision has been made for temporary additions to the Commission. It will, we think, be found useful that when some particular questions affecting the county, district or mental hospitals are under consideration the Commission should have the advantage of such help as the Department of Local Government can give.</P>
    <P>The division of the surplus in two parts&mdash;one going to the participating hospitals, and one to the Minister for distribution&mdash;it is proposed to bring to an end.  There will be no obligation to divide the proceeds of each sweepstake in proportions to be determined afresh each time a sweepstake is held. All sweepstake moneys will go into a single fund, to be called the Hospital Trust Fund, to be held by National Hospital Trustees, who will have power to invest what is not immediately required for making disbursements. There will be three trustees, who will be appointed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  All the existing undistributed surpluses, and any money paid over to the Minister that is not required by him in respect of arrangements which he has made, will be payable to the Hospitals Fund.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Hospitals Fund, and the setting up of the Hospitals Commission, are the two main departures from the law as it stands at present.  There are one or two minor amendments to which reference must be made.  The definition of hospital has been extended.  Institutions for carrying on medical research will now be brought in.  I do not think anyone will find fault with our proposal under this head.  The acquisition of new knowledge through research is very necessary medical work, and those engaged on it in this country cannot, <Col N="329" /> to the same extent as elsewhere, look to the generosity of private benefactors for financial assistance.  It is proposed to abolish all the conditions laid down in the original Act as to the percentage of free beds and the receipt of voluntary subscriptions.  The Hospital Commission will be in a position to examine the claim of each hospital, and to see to what extent it is serving the poor.  The fact that a hospital joins in the organisation of a sweep will not give it a claim to a share in the proceeds. The claim will have to be based on the services the hospital is rendering to the community, and be established to the satisfaction of the Hospitals Commission, and of the Minister. All types of institutions which cater for persons suffering from physical or mental disorder or infirmity will be eligible for grants.  These will include the infirmaries of the county homes, in which numbers of the sick are accommodated, and also a new type of home (which usually includes a maternity ward) intended for expectant mothers who would otherwise have to remain in the county home.  Nursing organisations will still remain eligible for grants.</P>
    <P>The sections of the Bill relating to the initiation of a sweepstake and the conditions under which sweepstakes can be promoted follow substantially the existing Acts.  It will still be necessary to appoint a Sweepstake Committee to prepare a scheme for submission to the Minister for Justice, and to make the necessary deposit to secure payment of prizes.  It is not proposed to give power to boards of health or the governing bodies of county infirmaries to initiate sweepstakes.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to repeat what was said to a deputation from the Hospitals Committee recently. Our purpose is to help the hospitals, to provide a means by which the public needs will be studied, and to create a body that will be able to bring experience to bear on local problems. Rumours gained currency that caused anxiety to the friends of the hospitals. The Bill shows how baseless many of these rumours were.  There is no intention of diverting sweepstakes money <Col N="330" /> from the hospitals to housing and slum clearance and other purposes, many of them excellent in themselves.  Very large sums have been raised, and the purpose of the Bill is to ensure they are spent wisely and to the best advantage, and for the purposes for which they were intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like this Bill, and as it stands before us I think it will probably turn out to be practically an unworkable measure. There is a good deal in what the Parliamentary Secretary said with which I find myself in complete agreement. At the inauguration of the schemes, if it had been known that they were going to be so successful as in fact they turned out, probably from the beginning a Committee of Reference would have been in existence, and some little difficulties as to the division of the proceeds of the sweep would have been obviated.  When I look at this Bill it certainly seems to me that it has been designed for the purpose, and will have the effect, of sounding the death knell of all voluntary hospitals in this country.  I think that is very much to be deplored.  The Parliamentary Secretary has told us a good deal about what he would like. He would like to have more co-ordination and more specialisation in hospitals.  As far as I gathered from him, he would have a smaller number of hospitals working in country districts and a larger number in the big centres, in the cities, in which specialisation could be gone in for.  I agree that there are certain diseases which require specialised treatment by persons who have given to these diseases particular study.  But there are a great number of diseases from which I venture to say an overwhelming number of patients suffer which could be completely treated by the ordinary general practitioner.  I do not see why patients should not receive in the proximity of their homes careful and adequate treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked in this Bill to deal with a large sum of money, and we have to place that money at the complete and absolute disposition of a single Minister, and we are not told, and we <Col N="331" /> are now even given an outline, of the method by which this money is to be divided.  I do not think that this House should place on the shoulders of any one individual, no matter how competent that individual may be, the responsibility, entirely free from control of any kind, and entirely free from parliamentary control, because the Minister is not bound to report to this House a single thing he does under the Bill.  Any scheme which he wishes to draw up for what the Parliamentary Secretary says is a matter of great importance, he will draw up in the quiet and sanctity of his office and this House or the Oireachtas will never be consulted about it.</P>
    <P>I turn to some of the provisions of the Bill.  I notice that now and for the future hospitals that do not make any provision&mdash;as was necessary, and which the Minister himself was very strong about when the original Hospitals Bill was under discussion&mdash;for a certain number of free beds for the sick poor, can receive the entire benefit of the moneys available under this scheme, while hospitals whose aim and object is in the provision of benefits for the sick who are entirely poor under this Bill need not benefit at all.  We are told that the sick poor are to receive every facility, and that that is going to be one of the objects of the Bill. I looked through the Bill and I find nowhere in it one single line which helps out that desire, or which shows that the desire is that the sick poor will receive as good nursing and as good and as attractive care as persons in better circumstances.  I find that what was put in as a safeguard for the sick poor in future Hospitals Sweeps has been taken out and that not a single safeguard has been put in.  If the main object was that the sick poor should benefit, I want to know why the main object has been left out of the Bill.  I see some extraordinary things in the Bill.  Hospitals promoted sweepstakes on various races from time to time.  The provisions of these sweepstakes were made public and were known to every single purchaser of a ticket.  Certain hospitals were to benefit under the sweepstakes and, on <Col N="332" /> the face of that, tickets were sold and vast sums of money became available. What do we discover here?  As I read Section 4&mdash;and I do not think there can be the slightest doubt about the meaning of the section&mdash;that money which was collected on one pretence is now going to be diverted to other aims.  This is a most extraordinary Bill.  It is retrospective.  It deals with money which has been collected, and which has been pledged to the persons from whose tickets the money was taken, that it would be spent in a particular way.  It is taken away and is now going to be spent in a completely different way.</P>
    <P>That is not keeping faith with the purchasers of the tickets or with the promoters of the schemes.  That money was, according to the particular scheme sanctioned by the Minister for Justice, whoever he was, to be collected and disbursed under the provisions of that scheme.  Now when the money has been collected and the work done you proceed to tear up the scheme under which the money was collected and say: &ldquo;We do not care a button about any single one of these schemes; we are going to appropriate the money and put it into a completely different fund under the absolute and unfettered charge of the Minister for Local Government, who need not give one single halfpenny of it to any single one of the participating hospitals which under the scheme were to benefit.&rdquo; That certainly is an extraordinary departure in legislation.  I do not think it will make for public confidence in the sweepstakes or amongst the persons who purchase tickets if a retrospective policy of dealing with the money collected is going to be inaugurated here.</P>
    <P>We have it now in the definition section that it is to go to hospitals, but what is to prevent a statute coming in in six or twelve months' time which will provide that the money is to go for a completely different object altogether?  You started the principle of dealing retrospectively with the sweepstakes' money.  To my mind it was a terrible principle to start.  If you say now that certain moneys will go into this new fund, what is to prevent <Col N="333" /> you bringing in in six or twelve months' time, if once you start retrospective legislation, a Bill saying that the object of that fund is to be completely enlarged?  If you remain faithful to your original contracts and stand over the schemes sanctioned by the administration in this country, then people will have faith and confidence in you, but if you proceed to deal retrospectively with money, then nobody who purchases a ticket can know where the retrospective dealing with the money will end; nobody can tell to what limits it will be pushed.</P>
    <P>Already in this House I have protested against moneys collected on the understanding that they were going to be paid to the hospitals being appropriated by the State.  Twenty-five per cent. of the original moneys were to go to the hospitals, but the State came along and said: &ldquo;No, for the future only 18¾ per cent. is to go to the hospitals and 6¼ per cent. is to go into the general exchequer.&rdquo;  That principle you have already started.  You have already appropriated for State purposes moneys which were subscribed by means of the sale of sweepstakes tickets for a completely different purpose.  The procedure you have already adopted in connection with the sweepstakes has been as to three-quarters in aid of the hospitals and one-quarter in aid of the general finances of the State.  I believe that by adopting that procedure the Government, to some extent, are shaking public confidence.  They come around now and say that money which under certain schemes was to be expended in a certain way is, for the future, going to be expended in a different way.  I ask the Minister carefully to consider whether any advantages he can get out of Section 4 will in any way make up for the shake he must give to public confidence by a section of that nature.</P>
    <P>There are other things in this Bill which strike me as being very strange.  Hitherto the schemes started worked extraordinarily well.  The Government have carried on the machinery but are leaving out entirely the motive power which makes the machinery work.  For instance, gentlemen who <Col N="334" /> were associated with public hospitals gave a considerable amount of their time to thinking out schemes.  I happen to know that a very considerable amount of work was done by the original promoters of these schemes. They were working not for themselves but for their hospitals.  They saw the terrible need that a great number of Dublin hospitals were in.  These gentlemen were directors, governors or managers of these hospitals and they put in a great deal of labour formulating schemes.  They saw to the accurate and skilful working out of the schemes for the benefit of their particular hospitals.  But who is going to start a scheme now?  Take any hospital or any collection of hospitals you like, and what motive is there for governors or managers of them to start a scheme?  Why, for instance, should the persons connected with any three hospitals that you like to take in Dublin go to the trouble of working out a scheme?  They are aware of the needs of these hospitals.  There is, for instance, insufficient accommodation in them and because of that they have to turn away patients; they want more beds; the operating theatre is not in a satisfactory condition or it may be that there are not adequate baths. These are some of the things which I know operated in the mind of one of the promoters of one of the biggest hospitals in Dublin.  Why should they start a scheme, put it on foot and work it when they know that in all human probability the hospitals they represent will not gain one single penny from it?</P>
    <P>The original Bill that came before this House was a private member's Bill.  It was introduced by Deputy Sir James Craig.  It contemplated that there might be a considerable number of different sweeps.  To begin with it was contemplated that various hospitals would start sweeps of their own.  I took it upon myself to administer the Bill on a particular interpretation which I thought I was entitled to put on it, and though I had to resist tremendously strong pressure from several sources I decided that I would only sanction one particular sweepstake.  I did that <Col N="335" /> because I considered that if you had a sweepstake in Dublin, one in Cork, in Waterford, and in Galway&mdash;four or five competing sweepstakes&mdash;the result would be that a lesser sum of money would be available than if the hospital authorities in these various places clubbed together in one great sweep which would catch the world imagination.  Looking back upon it now I think that the view I took in the administration of the Bill was the right, correct and the proper view, and I think I may venture to say that it was crowned with success.  In this Bill I see that old principle is gone back to and that in this Bill again it is clearly contemplated that there are going to be more sweepstakes than one, that there are evidently going to be, because otherwise these provisions would not be kept on, various sweepstakes in opposition one to the other. At least I do not see why the singular is not used instead of the plural in this Bill if that be not the case.  I also notice that in one of the subsections mention is made that there may be prizes other than money prizes, so it is obviously contemplated in this Bill that there is going to be more than one sweepstake, that our present sweepstake scheme is going to be abandoned, that there are going to be sweepstakes some of which will have money prizes and some of which will have stakes which are not in money.  I should like to know if that is the intention of the Minister and if not if there is really to be only one sweepstake run at a time.  I should like to know why that should not be made clear in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are to have set up here two new bodies.  I do not mind if the money is going to be kept in a suspense account, whether that suspense account is to be kept in the name of the trustees who have hitherto held it, the trustees for the voluntary hospitals.  As to whether the money is to lie in their names or in the names of persons nominated by the Government I do not think matters in the slightest, but I come to this question of the Hospitals Commission.  I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary is quite right in what he told <Col N="336" /> the House about the relationship between the Hospitals Commission and the Minister.  The Hospitals Commission can investigate and examine into the condition of hospitals, nursing institutions, etc., and it can report to the Minister.  If the Minister asks it, it can do a considerable number of things&mdash;put forward a scheme for the improvement and co-ordination of hospitals, of nursing organisations, etc., or investigate any other matter which the Minister asks.  It may do any of these things, but when I turn to the section for the distribution of funds, I do not see that there is any necessity for the Minister also to consult with the Hospitals Commission.</P>
    <P>The governing body of a hospital makes application to the Minister and the Minister without any consultation with anybody, as far as I can see&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;can ignore this Commission, can ignore its findings and need not ask a single question from it and can proceed, not according to any general scheme.  No general scheme need be formulated by him.  There is nothing in the Bill which says that the Minister can formulate a scheme or even contemplates the formulation of a scheme.  The Minister in a haphazard manner hands out to any hospital he likes, and in any proportion he likes, any sum of money he happens to think of.  I wonder if, under this Bill, anything of what we were told might happen, is likely to be brought about&mdash; the establishment of some new general hospital such as the Copenhagen or the Stockholm hospital, or whether anything of that kind is possible or can be legally effected by the Minister.</P>
    <P>When I look at the definition of &ldquo;governing body&rdquo; I see that it means &ldquo;the council, board, committee or other body having the control and management of the hospital or nursing organisation in relation to which the expression is used.&rdquo;  It seems to me that the body that can make application to the Minister is the committee of some existing hospital and it is only existing hospitals that can benefit under this Bill.  No new hospitals board can be established.  The Minister can give an old board authority to build a new building but he cannot <Col N="337" /> under this Bill establish any board.  It must be a going board of a going hospital before the Minister can make any grant under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are some other things which I must confess are very puzzling to me. For instance when I turn to sub-section (4) (e) of Section 24 I find that one of the purposes for which the Minister can make a grant under the Hospitals Trust Fund is for the endowment of the grantee&mdash;that is the governing body making application for a sum of money &mdash;or any part of the activities of the grantee including, in the case of a hospital, the endowment of a bed or beds in the hospital.  Then I come to sub-section (5) which states that &ldquo;no grant out of the Hospitals Trust Fund shall be made or applied for, or towards, the future maintenance of the grantee.&rdquo;  I should like to know taking paragraph (e) of sub-section (4) and sub-section (5) how you are going to reconcile these provisions or what meaning you wish to express.  Surely if you endow a bed you are making provision for the future maintenance of the bed and surely it is making provision for the maintenance of the grantee.  If you endow a bed in a certain hospital you are making an allowance for the maintenance of the hospital, not for the entire maintenance certainly but a partial allowance. A hospital let us say has got 300 beds.  You can endow the whole 300 beds.  You are endowing the hospital for future maintenance and yet in the next sub-section you say that you shall not make any allowance for the future maintenance of the grantee.  I should like to know what is the meaning of sub-section (5).</P>
    <P>Personally I think that one thing that should be done, one thing that should be clearly seen to, is that an allowance should be made for the future maintenance of hospitals.  If one thing is clear it is that the Hospitals Bills have killed voluntary contributions towards the hospitals. If they have not killed voluntary contributions towards the hospitals you certainly have done your very best to say to people outside: &ldquo;For the future never give a penny towards the hospitals.&rdquo;  You do not say to them <Col N="338" /> that they cannot solicit or send out begging letters.  You say that they are to be ready with open hands to receive any voluntary contributions they can get, but this is a direct suggestion to persons who have been paying voluntary contributions for the upkeep of these hospitals: &ldquo;Do not give one single penny to a voluntary hospital. If you want to make provision for the sick poor pay every single penny into our hands.&rdquo;  In other words, you want to have no more voluntary hospitals. What this Bill is aiming at is complete control by the State of the financing of the hospitals.</P>
    <P>There are other things I should like to know about.  I know that there are certain hospitals when I was connected with the administration of this Act which had considered the question of large buildings.  That those buildings, or some of them, at any rate, were absolutely necessary, I think it would appear from the report of the Committee of Reference.  Anybody going around the Dublin streets at the present moment must see that the maternity hospital in Holles Street has gone on very far with its building. Has that hospital&mdash;taking it as an instance because it is the one that strikes the public eye and on which most work is being done&mdash;received sufficient money to carry out its present building scheme?  I know that it received substantial sums of money which have already been distributed, but I should like to know whether it, and the other hospitals which have been building, have received the full amount of money which will enable them to carry out their existent and practically sanctioned building schemes, because it would appear to me that, unless a hospital of that nature and other hospitals of a similar nature, which have done building, get the funds necessary for the carrying out of their building, and which, in my judgment, they are entitled to as of right, because the schemes have already been sanctioned and should not be gone back on, they will be in a most impossible position and the Hospital Sweepstakes Bill, having become law, will be not a source of benefit but a terrible burden to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> I should like also to know how it is considered that, unless you endow these hospitals and see that some of the vast sum of money now available goes for future endowment to put these hospitals on a sound financial footing, these hospitals are going to carry on.  You are killing voluntary effort.  You are preventing the ordinary man in the street from paying to a hospital and I believe you are making the task of governor of a hospital such an ungracious and unpleasant task that you will not get the ordinary man in the street to accept that position.  I think that this Bill is not a good Bill.  There is a great deal in it that I would go so far as to say is positively bad and some of it positively wrong and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider seriously whether he will not withdraw this Bill and would suggest that, when he comes to the House with any improvement on the existing scheme, he will come with a definite, clear and thought-out scheme and not with something which may happen in the future, something which is completely nebulous, and not with a request for unfettered control of these large sums of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrPatrickJODowd" hpid="Dr. O'Dowd Dr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, said that central specialised hospitals must be available for all and that the poor must get the use of them free.  He also said that one of the ends that this Bill sought to achieve was that the sick poor should get equal treatment with those who could afford to pay for specialised treatment in any of these hospitals.  If the Bill does anything to secure that this is the case, the Bill certainly will have done a very good thing for the hospitals and for the sick poor of the country.  I think that this Bill is a distinct improvement on the other Bills.  It makes provision for the abolition of the clause in the original Hospitals Bill by which hospitals which derived benefit from the Sweepstakes Funds should retain 25 per cent. of the accommodation available for the sick poor.  That, at the time, was a safeguard, <Col N="340" /> and an essential safeguard, perhaps, to prevent hospitals which did not cater for the sick poor from participating in the funds available from the sweepstakes, but, no matter what has been said on the subject, for and against, in various quarters, my own personal opinion and my own personal experience is that it was never harder for the sick poor to obtain admission to the Dublin hospitals than it is at present and there need be no misgivings whatever that the moneys will be abused.  Provision is made in this Bill by which the hospitals that cater most for the sick poor will benefit most from the Bill.</P>

      <P>The provision, I submit, is made by the abolition of the clause providing for the reserving of the 25 per cent. of the accommodation. The hospitals that provide the greatest accommodation for the sick poor, naturally, will secure the greatest benefit and they are entitled to it.  Let me quote a case that came under my own notice recently.  I saw here in Dublin, on a Saturday, a case of diphtheria. I rang up four Dublin hospitals and could not obtain a bed in any single one of them for the patient.  I had to keep the patient at home and isolate him in his own home, where there were six other children, and wait until the following Monday morning when I communicated with the Public Health Department before the patient could secure a bed in any of the Dublin hospitals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrPatrickJODowd" hpid="Dr. O'Dowd Dr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to suggest that one way out of the difficulty would be the provision of a large central hospital in Dublin in which specialised treatment would be available for the poor and a hospital that the poor could call their own and a hospital in respect of which any dispensary doctor in the City or County of Dublin, who is primarily responsible for the care of the sick poor, could issue an order for admission, as obtains in the county homes and county infirmaries.  The <Col N="341" /> need for such a hospital is growing every day.  I am not finding fault with the voluntary hospitals which have stood the test of time and done great work but the population of Dublin is growing and it is becoming increasingly difficult to find proper accommodation for the sick poor.  Such a hospital will never be a success so long as it is either built or remodelled within the walls of the Union.  Union hospitals have always been a failure because a certain stigma attached to them and patients were reluctant to go into them for treatment and I would advocate that one of the best staffed and best equipped central hospitals in the whole country should be established here for the treatment of the poor.</P>
      <P>I would also like to point out that so far as previous Acts go the provision was made for county hospitals, county infirmaries and district hospitals.  These county hospitals were entitled to get 33? per cent. from the volume of sweepstakes.  That was the basis, and the matter was under the control of the Minister for Local Government.  Boards of health in the country were rather slow, up to this, in taking advantage of that.  The result is the country districts have not got the hospitals they need at the moment.  Now this money is pooled and I hope that due recognition will be made of the fact that these districts have got nothing so far.  Some of them have building schemes ready, and I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government for his efforts to secure for every country district the best hospitals available.  I hope he will not lose sight of the fact that these districts have got practically nothing up to the present and that provision will be made for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad, also, to know that provision is to be made for nursing organisations.  Some nursing organisations benefited from previous sweepstakes. But there are a considerable body of nurses of whom it might be said that they are nobody's children. They have given all their lives to the nursing of the sick poor, and to nursing private patients for very small fees. The sums they earned during the years <Col N="342" /> they worked were very small, and, in the majority of cases, they have not been able to put anything by for old age.  I can state from personal knowledge that there are several nurses practically in a state of destitution throughout the whole country.  I would like to see some provision made for nurses who have given their whole lives to the service of the community, now that they are no longer able to work. I hope when this is done that all nurses, as well as the Jubilee nurses, will be included and that provision will be made for them.  I have no more to say upon this Bill except that I think there is nothing that charitable hospitals or voluntary hospitals, that have done their work efficiently in the past, need fear; they will lose nothing in the future.  They have the assurance of the Parliamentary Secretary that none of the money will be diverted from the purposes for which it was originally intended.</P>
    <P>I do not find fault with, or complain in any way, of the voluntary hospitals, which have established a reputation for clinical teaching which is European and indeed world-wide.  I do not find fault with them for that, but the population of Dublin is growing to such an extent that, perhaps, these hospitals are no longer able to cater for the sick poor as in the past.  That is why I advocate the establishment of a central hospital which should be built entirely detached from any stigma, and built outside the walls of any union or workhouse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not desire to intervene for any length in this debate, and would not have intervened at all except for the observations of Deputy O'Dowd.  However, I would like to say that if what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney stated is true, and if his interpretation of the Bill is correct, that it is to have a retrospective effect, calculated to interfere with the schemes on which hospitals have already embarked, then, I think the Minister is doing a dangerous thing.  You have no right to invite charitable bodies to embark upon building schemes, or upon any other schemes which will involve them in definite liability, and cut the ground from under their feet when they are <Col N="343" /> inevitably committed to these liabilities. I think Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asks for no more than is reasonable when he asks, if this course is to be pursued, very specific guarantees should be given to the charitable institutions that have undertaken these commitments that they will be fully indemnified against further expenditure.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dowd has raised a very important question and one that I think should be definitely disposed of.  Does Deputy O'Dowd allege that any charitable hospital in this City refused admission to a sick poor person when that person ought to have been admitted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrPatrickJODowd" hpid="Dr. O'Dowd Dr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make such an allegation.  I said it was my personal experience that I found it impossible to obtain admission to hospital for a particular type of patient.  I rang up four different types of hospitals and they were unable to admit the patient. My contention is that there should be some place to which that patient could be admitted.  That is my contention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want this thing cleared up.  If there is a scandal in this matter let it be ventilated and rectified.  But there is a lot of irresponsible correspondence going on in the Press, charging public hospitals virtually with throwing poor people out and refusing to take them in when charity and humanity so demand.  Deputy Dr. O'Dowd speaks with authority.  He is a member of the Dáil, a medical man of high standing, and occupies a high position in the country.  He occupies a position of distinction in the medical world of this country, and he mentioned, in this debate, that a patient of his suffering from diphtheria was obliged to be left at home where the doctor was obliged to take whatever isolation precautions he could in the home because the patient could not be admitted to hospital.  I think that should not arise.  But it is the experience, I think, that diphtheria, at the moment, is somewhat rife in the country.  Ordinary accommodation for this type of disease cannot be found in the wards of a general hospital. We have other hospitals with special <Col N="344" /> facilities for dealing with that disease. But that does not seem to be relevant to this discussion when, momentarily, an occasion has arisen when it is not possible to provide accommodation for every case of diphtheria that occurs. I appeal to Deputy O'Dowd and ask if he will not confirm me, and say that the circumstance of which he complained may not arise again in ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrPatrickJODowd" hpid="Dr. O'Dowd Dr. O'Dowd">

      <P>Epidemics should not occur, but through the providence of God they do.  All we can say is that when the obligation comes we will meet it.  You cannot possibly decide on hospital accommodation that will always be adequate to deal with sudden and unexpected emergencies.  I submit that at this stage, and particularly in view of what Deputy Dr. O'Dowd said, it should be clearly stated&mdash;and anyone who wants to contradict it can do so now&mdash;that no poor person in urgent need of hospital treatment has ever been turned from the door of a Dublin hospital.  If there is anybody who can controvert that statement that neither one nor many poor persons were refused hospital treatment that charity and humanity required should be given, let him controvert that now, or else give up the business of aspersing the reputation of the Dublin hospitals.</P>
      <P>If it be true, then let the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister know that anything they come to this House to ask for to help them to remedy that situation will be readily granted, as I believe it will be granted, by every Party in the House.  If it is not true, and I do not believe it is true, let it be finally and definitely scotched with the authority of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and let the Deputy come before the House now and say he has no reason to believe such a situation exists.</P>

      <P>It has been published in the Press and, lest any word that any Deputy might use here should be connected up with that correspondence and interpreted as agreeing with that allegation, it should be controverted. I am prepared to say that no poor person, for whom humanity and charity demanded admission, has been refused.  If there is anybody here prepared to controvert that, it is his public duty to do so openly now.</P>
      <P>So far as the technical question of hospital accommodation arises, I do not propose to say anything.  I am not qualified to speak.  I think, however, that the ordinary businessman's point of view should be given voice to; and that is that, when you are building great hospitals and adding greatly to the accommodation already existing, you must bear in mind that every addition will require, in the future, funds to maintain it.  I do not suggest, for a moment, that we should check the growth of hospital amenities in this country.  The more of such amenities we have, and the wider the benefits and accommodations provided for the sick, the better.  But let us not provide white elephants.  Let us be sure that every ward we build and every operating theatre and every department installed will be efficiently run and that we will not have the figment of effective treatment without the means of applying it to the patients who require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Careful consideration and prudent foresight should be used.  I should imagine that the Parliamentary Secretary is highly qualified in that direction.  I have little doubt that he will turn for advice and counsel to those who have already advised in this matter most effectively in the past.  I have no doubt that Deputy Sir James Craig, and those who have co-operated with him in the past, hold themselves at the Parliamentary Secretary's disposal, now as heretofore, and I have every hope that the Parliamentary <Col N="346" /> Secretary will consult them all along the line and will meet fully the difficulties propounded by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney here to-day, and that he will reassure the charitable institutions that they will not be allowed to sink into any commitments without being adequately indemnified out of the funds at the Parliamentary Secretary's disposal.</P>

      <P>I know very little about the Dublin hospitals, but I am closely in touch with the hospitals in my own city.  There was a Committee of Reference appointed about a year and a half ago which made a very exhaustive examination of the needs of the hospitals in our City of Cork and we were allocated a certain sum of money by that Committee.  On the strength of that, a good many of the hospitals started building operations, improved their hospitals, and entered into many commitments which now they find they may not be able to meet.  The buildings had to be stopped and the rather peculiar situation has arisen now that after spending a great deal of money they will be worse off, I think, than ever they were before because their private subscriptions have dropped off, and evidently they will not get this money that was allotted to them because this Bill is retrospective and going back to last March twelve months.  I am afraid that it will leave the hospitals, and especially the provincial hospitals, in a worse position than before the sweepstakes started because they cannot carry out their large commitments and building operations now.</P>

      <P>Though I agree with very much that the Parliamentary Secretary said in his opening remarks, and with many of the clauses of the Bill that are there to meet the reasons that were in his mind, I think it would be a pity if this Bill went through the House without somebody taking on himself the unpleasant task of saying that he disapproves of the Bill altogether and of the whole matter, and that is what I do.  I regret very much two or three things about the Bill. First, I regret that the Bill comes from the Government Benches at all; secondly, that we now have a permanent <Col N="347" /> Bill, instead of a temporary Bill, likely to come on the Statute Book; and thirdly, the retrospective character of the clauses which the Minister has put into the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am not going to take any very strict attitude as to the rightness or the wrongness of taking sweep tickets. I think that it is more of a foolish thing than a wrong thing to do.  I would not myself be prepared to give ten shillings for the thrill of knowing that I have won or have not won, and I never have done so.  I think, however, that it is quite a different thing when one takes account of a matter of this kind which has come to be of such magnitude.  One cannot help saying that a gamble here and there matters very little, perhaps nothing; but when it becomes a big, wide thing, permeating the whole nation, it becomes a serious thing.  To my mind, the whole thing is beneath the dignity of and discreditable to our country, and I think this is an occasion upon which our feelings of sensitiveness as to national independence might well make us pause.  If hospitals want money for their necessities, as they do, to my mind it is a thing that we ought to be independent enough to do for ourselves.  We should not go about trading on the weaknesses and foolishness of the people of other countries in order to provide for our necessities.  I think that the whole thing has brought us into a discreditable position with regard to other countries of the world. I protest against the whole thing.  I think it is harmful to ourselves and harmful generally and that the day will come when not alone the hospitals but we ourselves will regret that we ever brought forward and took part in a measure of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely sympathise with the Minister's wish and desire that he should have some scheme of co-operative working amongst the hospitals of the State.  I think there is a great deal to be done for improvement in that respect and, if the Bill is to be there, I sympathise with many of its provisions, but I agree completely with what has been said of the dangerous character of the retrospective <Col N="348" /> clauses of the Bill.  I feel that they put many hospitals that have undertaken work on the strength of their hopes for the future into an extremely difficult and doubtful position.  I hope the retrospective clauses will be very much modified before the Bill goes through.  I regret exceedingly that a permanent measure of this kind should be brought before us by the present Government.</P>

      <P>My point is that one day we have those Deputies putting down a motion and pointing out that the losses suffered by farmers total over £6,000,000, and on another occasion we have them admitting that the total loss of the farmers is scarcely two per cent. of that figure.  The savings estimated under the Economies Bill will come to £280,000 or two per cent. of the total salaries paid.  The Centre Party, by not putting in an amendment to the Economies Bill, give an indication that they are quite satisfied that the farmers' losses could not be more than that two per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had Deputy MacDermot talking here about the Empire.  He said England was quite satisfied to give us a Republic, yet she insists on making us pay because we are looking for a Republic or for an independent status. Deputy MacDermot also said that the Government consented to a 50 per cent. relief in land annuities, not because <Col N="351" /> it was just but because the whole thing was forced on them.  There was never a more nonsensical statement made in the House.  The Deputies in that Party are not doing their duty by the farmers.  They had not a word to say on the Land Commission Vote last night.  Such a statement is foolish and it is not true.  That guarantee of 50 per cent. reduction was given months before the Dáil dissolved last year; it was given publicly by me in the presence of members of the Centre Party who were on the same platform with me then.  Those are facts that are very well known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot could not help going back and making a further appeal for the Party to which apparently he has given his heart, the old landlords who have no annuities to pay.  His heart goes back to these men who still remain in this country in their large estates and who do it because they love Ireland!  It was because they loved the country that they drew the rack rents that they drew out of it and it was because of that that the Deputies opposite insisted in the Land Act in keeping safe for these men the couple of thousand acres of demesne land, as they call it, that some of them held.  These are facts that cannot be contradicted.  The claim in this motion is a definite claim for £6,000,000 that they say the farmers have lost owing to the economic war.  That £6,000,000 would represent the total relief of rates and annuities.  That is their claim. But the total amount collected by Great Britain up to the present, according to the figures issued yesterday, is 2½ millions.  That is very far below the £6,000,000 that the motion is claiming.  I would wish if I could to get some bit of sense into those Deputies opposite and get them to look at things in a reasonable fashion.  I would be anxious to give them all the help I could.</P>

That is a fair proposition and then the farmers could not deny that they would be getting the money.  If we are to relieve the farmers we could thus relieve them straight off.</P>

Deputy O'Donovan said that at a meeting held in Cork I had stated that the farmers were going to get a reduction of 50 per cent. in their annuities and in addition to that complete de-rating.  That statement is not true.  I was definitely in favour of complete de-rating but when we came to consider which of the two would be the better for the farmers a reduction <Col N="353" /> of 50 per cent. in their annuities or complete de-rating as it is understood in Northern Ireland and across the Channel, I certainly saw that the farmers would gain more by the 50 per cent. in their annuities than by de-rating.</P>

      <P>Does Deputy MacDermot deny that the farmers will gain more by the 50 per cent. reduction in their annuities than they would by de-rating? I am speaking of the ordinary working farmers who have an annuity to pay. I do not allude to the particular class that Deputy MacDermot spoke about last night, and it was principally because of the amount of money that that class gained out of the £750,000 relief in rates that was given here last year that I plumped for the reduction of 50 per cent. in the annuities.  I did that because I did not want to see the Lord Barrymores of this country drawing more from this country than they are drawing already.</P>

The point I made was that after full consideration the Fianna Fáil Party decided at the time of the General Election in 1932 that the farmers were to be given relief in their rates.  I have expressed no opinion as to whether it was better <Col N="354" /> or worse.  My suggestion is that the real reason they changed their minds was because they saw they were not able to collect the annuities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and those associated with him were going to take legal action against the Government for daring to collect the land annuities.  They would take legal action if the Government dared to collect them for anyone else but for John Bull.  In that event the Government were to be brought into court.

When it came to getting England to disgorge money, they were not successful.  When they asked for a paltry £280,000 relief, they were refused.  I do not know what successful negotiations they carried out last December or January.  They must have had some kind of successful negotiation or they would not have embarked on the wildest game of bluff any party ever embarked upon.  They guaranteed that the farmers would not be asked to pay any annuities until 1934 and that then they would get a 50 per cent. reduction.  Under what agreement with those to whom they claim the annuities were due was that guarantee given?  The people of this State are entitled to that knowledge and I think that every Deputy, no <Col N="356" /> matter to what Party he belongs, realises that a copy of that agreement would be of great assistance to our President in fighting his case.</P>

      <P>That is what happens here.  We have Deputies who preach the most daring kind of humbug and who cast burden after burden on the farmers.  They vote against every proposal brought here for the assistance of the farmers and, on the other hand, they say the poor farmers are &ldquo;broke.&rdquo; We are sick of that kind of thing and it is time it was ended.  Deputies opposite have played that game all along.  If they carry out the same action this year as they carried out last year, I have pointed out what the farmer will lose.  I pointed out already what the farmers would lose if Deputies opposite succeeded in their endeavour to prevent the passing of the Second Reading of the Economies Bill.  I pointed out what losses that would cause to the farmers&mdash;losses directly due to their action.  I admit that the farmers are badly off. Nobody can deny that.  As I pointed out on several occasions here, the farmer's income from his exportable produce fell in the years 1924 to 1931 by £13,000,000 odd.  Taking what Deputies opposite would call the two last normal years, we find that there is a drop of £6,000,000 between what the farmer got for his exportable produce in 1931 and what he got in 1930.  That is double the amount of the land annuities.</P>

      <P>These are facts that nobody can contradict.  We are giving allowances to the farmers.  The farmers are getting a reduction of 50 per cent. in their annuities.  They are getting a subsidy of £800,000 on butter this year. They are getting a subsidy of £140,000 on their wheat.  I represent as many farmers as any Deputy on the other benches.  (Interruptions.)  Any time I go back to them, they will put me in. I admit I did not get the class of votes that Deputies opposite got and I do not want them.  If I saw that class of people going in to vote for me, I would examine my conscience and wonder what was wrong with me.  I am anxious that the farmer should get all the benefit we can give him.  We have heard arguments from all quarters that the farmer has not been getting the benefit of the cattle bounties.  From my knowledge, I admit that there is a great deal of truth in that.  I examined the problem for myself and I am prepared to go with Deputies opposite, or with any Deputy in this House, to the Minister for Agriculture or the Executive Council and endeavour to induce them, instead of giving that bounty on cattle, to give the money in direct relief of rates so that the farmer will know he is getting it.  I do not want to see any middleman or well-to-do cattle dealer collaring the cattle bounty and sticking to 50 per cent. of it, as I know he is doing.  The farmer should get the full benefit of all we can give him.  But this business is all humbug.  If ever there was an insincere motion brought before this House, it is the motion at present being discussed&mdash;a motion for relief amounting to £6,000,000.  There is no denying it.  We are prepared to give the farmers all the relief possible.  The farmers, as I pointed out, have got a sum of £2,000,000 in relief by subsidies, etc., and in addition to that a reduction <Col N="359" /> of 50 per cent. in their annuities (Interruption).  Nothing is any good to the rancher I admit.  There is no good in giving him a butter bounty when he keeps no cow.</P>

      <P>Come down and have a look at mine.  To return to the motion, I have pointed out that the benefit we are conferring upon farmers amounts this year to something like £4,000,000 not counting the agricultural grant.  There is the 50 per cent. <Col N="361" /> deduction in annuities and a sum of £2,000,000 in subsidies, and if you add to that the agricultural grant it will come somewhere near the £6,000,000 for which Deputies are looking. These are reliefs given directly to the farmers.  If Deputies opposite will apply their minds to finding out the manner in which those reliefs are not reaching the farmer and if they come along with their case they will get all the assistance I can give them.  I can promise them that.  We are sick hearing howls from all quarters of the House.  We had a dog fight recently between Deputy Keating and some other Deputies as to whether the farmers were getting the benefit of the cattle bounty or not.  I believe the farmer is not getting the full benefit of that bounty and that he should get it.  If the amount is set aside for the benefit of the farmers the farmers should get it into their hands.  I am prepared to help Deputies opposite in that.  This motion is brought in by Deputies who have given in this House full proof, if we are to take their own actions, that the total amount of the loss to the farmers owing to the economic war amounts only to two per cent.  That is what I gather from their action here.  I have not yet seen any amendment by the Centre Party to increase that two per cent., which is the total of the savings made by the Economies Bill.  As I have said already, every Party in this House has admitted that the President is honest.</P>

      <P>We shall take no notice of you.  That accent of yours cannot be understood.  The President has made a statement here that he is anxious to have equality of sacrifice.  I am just testing the bona fides of the motion.  I would expect that the Centre Party would jump at that and, if they thought the farmers were losing a terrible amount of money by the economic war, that they would state in flat terms what that amounted to and that they would see that the other services of the State suffered an equal sacrifice and that they would keep the President to his word.  The Vice-President <Col N="362" /> also stated that.  According to the actions of the Centre Party in this House, the total losses of the farmers in this economic war amount only to two per cent.  That is the amount of the savings in salaries&mdash;two per cent.  That is their position.  I would be very anxious to see some honesty of purpose amongst them.  If there were some honesty of purpose perhaps we would get much further in helping out the farming community.  I should like these Deputies to remember that we here represent at least three times as many farmers as they do. There are 77 members in this Party and each of them represents a certain number of farmers.  There are Deputies on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches who also represent farmers.  I would be sorry to think that the total number of representatives of the agricultural community in this House should be the number in the Centre Party.</P>

I wish Deputies opposite would stop the bluff and the humbug they are trying to carry on here.  Let them try to be honest for once and they will do better.  What complaints have they to make?

I will not say anything about <Col N="363" /> the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, because my idea is that if they claim to represent any percentage of the people they would be honest in one thing.  They would either admit that at the last General Election here they tried to carry out a gigantic bluff in giving a guarantee which they could not stand over, or else they would give to the President and the Executive Council the benefit of a copy of the agreement under which they were able to guarantee to the farmer that he need not pay any annuities until 1934, and that then he would get a reduction of fifty per cent.  Their knowledge of the British Government, unless they had some late agreement with them, would not bear out that statement. Their knowledge that the British Government had refused them a paltry £250,000 the year before would not bear out giving any guarantee whatever of a reduction in annuities; therefore they must have had some agreement.  If they have that agreement it is their duty to put it down here or else clear out and not try to bluff the people.</P>

      <P>It is amusing to sit here and listen to Deputies opposite appealing for a little honesty from the Opposition Benches after the gigantic fraud and plunder which has been perpetrated on the only industry in this country that could, in normal times, stand on its own feet.  We heard quoted in the last few minutes all the types of facts that ever any man heard quoted before.  We were told about the subsidising of butter.  Should not the fact that it was necessary to subsidise butter, that one of the key sections of the agricultural industry wanted a subsidy, be sufficient warning to the Government to hasten slowly?  When that key industry wanted a subsidy, wanted artificial respiration so to speak, was that the time to bring it out and throw it on the economic bayonets of the British Empire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All kinds of apologies are being made for this economic war.  We are told that looking over the last ten years tillage went down in the country and that agricultural prices went down. <Col N="364" /> They did, the world over.  The index figures show that the price of all products went down in the last ten years, but the price of agricultural products went down more than any other.  They did not tell us that during that ten years the Party opposite put 6d. in the £ malicious damage to property tax on the agricultural ratepayers of this country, and in the present session introduced a Bill to pension the people who did that malicious damage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to get to the real position of the case, and see the offer that was made to England, which was withheld from the farming community of this country.  What were the commitments on foot of the land annuities prior to the 1923 Act, and rates payable out of agricultural land in the financial year 1932-33?  Approximately&mdash;the figures are substantially correct&mdash;there were three million pounds on foot of annuities, and one and a half million pounds is an overestimate for the rates on agricultural land during the year ended 31st March last.  That makes a total liability on agriculture of four and a half million pounds for those two items.  During that period our Government said to England: &ldquo;The old arrangement under which we were to pay you five million pounds a year will not continue.&rdquo;  I am not going into the rights or wrongs of the attitude taken by the Government in that matter, but they said to England: &ldquo;We will not pay you that five million pounds unless you can prove you are entitled to it.  While waiting for you to prove your title we will put that five million pounds into a Suspense Account.&rdquo;  That money stayed there. If England can prove her claim to it she can get it.  That was the authoritative statement of the President on behalf of his Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> I hope that the President and his Government will be at least as accommodating, and give the same measure &mdash;and only the same measure&mdash;of fair play to the farmers as was offered to England; in other words, that if we can prove that the moneys that were in the Suspense Account belong of right to the farmers of this country we should get them.  We ask no charity in that; we ask no privilege beyond the privilege that the President offered to the British Government.  That is the kernel of the whole thing. We need not run away on butter subsidies; we need not run away on wheat subsidies; there was an alternative which I drafted for the Fianna Fáil Party when I was a member of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had time to think, and I thought it out while the Minister was chasing the rainbows.  Those little quips are not going to divert the argument from its sequence or its logical ending.  We claim that the same previleges, or the same rights, be extended to us as were extended to the British Government.  All the moneys were put into a Suspense Account, and an offer made to England that if she accepted arbitration on our terms&mdash;it does not matter about the terms&mdash;and the arbitration court decided that those moneys in the Suspense Account should be handed over to the British Government, we were committed in all honour to hand them over.  If such an arbitration were held, and the decision was to hand these moneys over to the British Government, I am quite satisfied that no member of this House would honour the bond more than President de Valera himself.  I say that in all fairness to him.  That arbitration was not held.  England did not exactly ignore it, but, for the sake of argument, it is immaterial what England did.  In effect, we can assume that England said: &ldquo;We will not bother about arbitration on your <Col N="366" /> terms, but we shall proceed to collect these moneys in our own way.&rdquo;  She proceeded to do so.</P>
      <P>It is for the Government to prove that England has not collected the annuities, plus the pensions and the Local Loans.  Instead of collecting three millions from the farmers on foot of the annuities, England proceeded to collect five millions from their produce. When our Government would not pay England she put in the bailiffs and is now in the act of seizing produce value for five millions.  It is time to throw off the mask and to tell the country the truth, instead of the bogies and the misrepresentation that won the last elections, plus intimidation and personation; to tell the truth that the annuities which were not paid directly are now being paid by the seizure of our produce at the British ports to which they are sent.  The farmers are paying five millions.  The Suspense Account, which was not to meet any Budget commitment, but to satisfy England's claim if the matter went to arbitration, was not touched.  England got her money from the 40 per cent. duties on the exportable produce.  The farmers or agriculture paid that, yet the moneys in the Suspense Account were collected.  The farmers lost three millions that they had undertaken to pay, plus two millions that the Government had undertaken to pay.  In all honesty, and in all fair play the moneys in the Suspense Account should have gone in globo to help agriculture as it belongs by right to the farmers. If those on the opposite benches claim to be working for the interests of this country&mdash;after not working for it for a long time&mdash;we should have a little of the elements of honest trading.  When the goods of a section of the community are seized, and when the Government is not able to protect them from seizure for debt, surely it is the duty of the Government to pay the debt, when they built up a fund to do so.  That fund was not used to discharge the debt.  The money in that fund should have been given to the section of the people whose produce was seized to discharge that debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally the annuities under the Land Acts prior to 1923 amounted to <Col N="367" /> three millions which, with rates amounting to £1,500,000, made the liability £4,500,000 with which farmers were confronted 12 months ago. Then came the economic war&mdash;the other round with England.  When we got to grips we found that instead of paying £3,000,000 for annuities, our produce to the value of £5,000,000 was seized to satisfy England's claim.  In addition, thousands of civil bills went out from the Land Commission in order to compel farmers to pay the annuities, despite the fact that their produce was being seized at the British ports on foot of the very same annuities.  We were told here by the President, and also outside this House, that farmers should pay their annuities to the Land Commission. Occupants of the Opposition Benches were taunted by the last speaker. He inquired where were proceedings instituted by his Party.  Where are the writs for annuities that were sent out by the Land Commission before Christmas?  They have been all withdrawn because when the President, the Ministers, and their back-benchers went before the country they found that the farmers were beginning to remove the scales from their eyes.  Then another crop of lies and misrepresentations were &ldquo;put-over&rdquo; on the farmers, and especially on the small farmers.</P>

      <P>During the last year the farmers had to meet the £5,000,000 that was seized by England, had to pay £3,000,000 in annuities to the Land Commission, and had to accept the promise that is now being held out that <Col N="368" /> they will be funded.  Whether the farmers paid or did not pay, the liability is there.  For the sake of this argument, and as a matter of bookkeeping, we can say that the farmers have paid £8,000,000 on foot of annuities alone.  Taking the annuities at £3,000,000, rates to the county councils amounting to £1,500,000, had also to be paid.  Let us deduct what farmers should pay from what they actually paid or were liable for.  Taking £4,500,000 from £9,500,000 leaves £5,000,000 that the farmers were overcharged in the last year.  Roughly, in the present year, there is the same commitment on foot of the total annuities and rates and we may look forward to £5,000,000, being the value of exportable produce being again seized.  Owing to the reduction in the Agricultural Grant by £500,000, there is a sum of £5,550,000 on the wrong side.  We will have to pay to the Suspense Account half the annuities&mdash;the whole up to November&mdash; and we get&mdash;is it an ex gratia grant or conscience money&mdash;£2,000,000 off the annuities.  That leaves us in the position of having to pay the full amount without any reduction, and of having to pay the rates, leaving a net overcharge of £2,000,000.</P>
      <P>These figures do not take into account the losses we have sustained by the depression in prices here, caused by the effect of the penal tariffs in throwing back produce worth £15,000,000 or £16,000,000 that normally would be exportable.  That is thrown back on the Free State market and depresses prices exactly to the exportable value of that produce.  I am not taking that into account at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, after all, the worm must turn some time.  As Deputies are aware the Dublin County Council found it necessary to take a stand on this: that the ratepayers paid last year and would pay this year through the operation of the tariffs and the action of the Land Commission in collecting even half the annuities considerably more than the total annuities that the farmers of the country had contracted to pay, plus a rate necessary to meet the requirements of the local services of the <Col N="369" /> county.  The County Council, in common with many other county councils, refused to strike a rate for the current year.  As a result we have got an ultimatum from the members of the front bench opposite who were to do so much for the farmers&mdash;to give them complete de-rating.  Instead of complete de-rating, we find, in the ultimatum we received this: &ldquo;The grants provided this year come to £1,750,000 or only £198,022 less than the maximum release given in one year (in 1931) by the previous Government.&rdquo;  In that year the wholesale price index was 52½.  It is now 51½.  General prices have come down without any interference in trade, and on that reduced price of one per cent. we have piled on to our price level here this 40 per cent. which we must face.</P>
    <P>The Government when out of office promised to give the farmers complete de-rating, but in office their action has been responsible for confiscating 40 per cent. of the prices that the farmers would normally receive and the apologia they make for that is that they are only reducing the 1931 grants by £198,022.  They have threatened mandamus proceedings against the Dublin County Council, and also I see by this morning's paper, against the farmers of the County Tipperary for laying claim to a fund that beyond a shadow of doubt belongs to the farmers, the very same fund that they have offered to the British Government if it could prove title to it.  Will the Government agree to stay proceedings? I am not asking for any mercy or for delay in the matter.  The Government can go on as hard as they like; we will be ready to meet them, but I take it that they ought to be prepared to give fair play all round.  We do not want any special treatment, but the farmers want to get the same offer as was made to the British Government&mdash;that is, that if they can prove their title to the Suspense Account and the £5,000,000 they will get it.</P>
    <P>I want to know if the Government are prepared to delay these threatened mandamus proceedings against the County Dublin and the County Tipperary.  I think Kilkenny County Council is in it, too, and I <Col N="370" /> suppose Cork, Donegal and a few others will also follow.  I want to know if these mandamus proceedings will be delayed until we have an opportunity of making our case as to our title to that sum of £5,000,000. We are only asking the Government to make the same offer to us as they have made to the British Government. If they do not give us that equal chance, then it will be easy to see that they are playing and have played England's game.  We only want an equal chance with the foreigner and it is up to our Government to give it to us.  I doubt if they will give it.</P>

      <P>And there is none asked for.  Do not think for a moment that the white feather will be shown to you, but we see the sense of national justice in the attitude of the two Ministers.  The Government are giving England the right to lay her claim to that fund, but there is to be no mercy given to the Irishman to lay a claim to it.  Now, who is playing England's game?  In connection with the refusal of the Dublin County Council to strike a rate, we were given this reminder in the ultimatum: &ldquo;I am to point out that it is a most important duty of the council to ensure that there shall be no interruption in the conduct of the civic services with whose administration they are entrusted, or for which they are obliged by statute to supply the required funds, and the Minister for his part is obliged to take steps to see that such duty is properly <Col N="371" /> performed.  He could not acquiesce in the inaction of the council and so far as his powers admit, he must see that the local services are properly maintained, and that the sick, the poor, the mentally infirm and the general community should not be called upon to suffer avoidable hardships.&rdquo;  We have paid the money that should be there to cover the cost of these services and the Government have squandered it.  We only want the boot put on the right foot.  I had not the pleasure, or the pain, of hearing the Minister for Industry and Commerce on this motion the other evening, but, like the Minister for Agriculture, he fell back on the last trench.  &ldquo;We went before the country a few months ago and they returned us; therefore, we are right.&rdquo; Will the two Ministers opposite meet two men from this Party in any constituency in the Free State and see what the farmers think of their policy now?</P>

      <P>The country will find out bit by bit how you just got 50 per cent. of the seats at the last election.  Do not be claiming the election result as a mandate for the continuance of the economic war.  If you were to separate and segregate the economic war from all other high falutin' promises that were made you would not get 30 per cent. of the Dáil returned as your supporters, and well you know it.  The Minister also stated in speaking on this motion that &ldquo;if the penal duties of the British were imposed to ensure that they would only have the status that the British wished for them, then it was the old fight that had been going on for hundreds of years.  If they had gone into the fight for the purpose of getting concessions, he was prepared to admit that they had mismanaged the whole thing but there was no question of concessions; they simply claimed that they had a right to retain certain that had been paid out.&rdquo;  That is a Press report of the Minister's speech.  He said that we did not go into this fight for concessions. What did we go in for?  For the love of a fight, is it?  I did not know the Minister was such a scrapper. He was spoiling for a fight.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he has got enough of it now.  He told us that it gave us an opportunity of developing the industrial arm.  I think before the Minister was in swaddling clothes many of us here were drinking in the teachings of the one-arm and the two-arm nation in this country from a distinguished Irishman.  The ambition of that Irishman was a two-arm nation. The late Government tried to have a one-and-a-half-arm nation.  England wanted us to have only one arm. Fianna Fáil has gone one better and cut off the only arm we had and left us without any arm at all.  Our distinguished Minister for Agriculture and his colleague, Deputy Corry, just now charged Deputies on this side of the House with having opposed the butter <Col N="375" /> subsidy last year, and said it was a crime against the farmers and against agriculture, the most important arm of agriculture.  There was a time, when the present Minister for Agriculture was trying to find out something about agriculture, when he staked his hopes upon the plough but he has swung round now and he is apparently staking them on the cow.</P>
      <P>Is it not a very unhealthy sign that a subsidy has to be given to the dairying industry and is it not a very peculiar situation that, at the present time, our butter is going at 75/- or 76/- in the British market while it is 136/- here, artificially kept up?  With all the penal tariffs and all the other tariffs that we have on here, the working man in this country has to pay very nearly twice as much for Irish butter as the British working man has to pay for it.  What are we getting?  We are not getting 75/- but 60 per cent. of 75/-.  We are getting 47/- and we are sending our butter over to England&mdash;and the Minister for Agriculture stands over that as sound national policy.  He has to pay commission and transit charges as well and all he is getting is 47/- a cwt. while he will not let a cwt. of Irish butter out to the public here, let them be poor or rich, under 136/- a cwt. and, mind you, we are at war with these people and an economic war at that.  All my reading of history and of war shows that, if you are at war with a country, it should be treason to trade with that country but, instead, we call it a war.  We glory in it and we glorify it as a war but we are taxing the people in order to give our produce to England cheaper than we give it to our own people and, then, they are not playing England's game! No, we are playing England's game.</P>

See the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; for the 15th or the 16th September of last year.  Deputy Curran, at the instigation of Deputy MacDermot, moved a direct negative to this motion when I put it up at a conference of farmers and ratepayers in the Dublin Mansion House.  I am sympathetic to the motion and I shall continue to be sympathetic to it.  I am glad that my friends on the right have seen the error of their ways and I am glad they have put this motion before the House.  I am sure that they will stand by it now when they have fathered it.  If the Cumann na nGaedheal Party had fathered it, we would not know whether they would go to this side or that side or not vote at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seconding this motion in the hope of being able to convince this House and the Government of the exact position of the farmers.  I do not intend to follow the line on which previous speakers have spoken and I will just refer to Deputy Corry's speech by saying that I was <Col N="377" /> unable to find anything in it which had any particular bearing on the motion before the House.  With regard to Deputy Belton's speech, I will say that I do not feel equal to talking in millions as he has talked but I shall try to point out to the Minister and to the House the inability of the farmer to meet rates and annuities under present conditions.  Under the system of farming which has been carried on, rightly or wrongly, in this country, the farmer has depended on his livestock to meet his ordinary obligations, even apart from rents and rates and so on.  I am sure that everybody will agree with that.  I know that the Government do not see eye to eye with that policy. They want to change it but I say that no Government can change, even with the greatest co-operation from the farming community, the agricultural policy of this country in a month or a year and I also say that no Government, present or future, can devise a suitable or profitable substitute for the livestock of this country.  It had to be the main industry and the main wealth of the farmer.</P>
      <P>What is the present position?  I will be told, I know, by the Minister in his reply, that the British markets are declining.  I realise that.  I realise that the British market is not what it was but I would tell the Minister that the present policy of the Government has compelled us farmers to take half a price in a bad market.  That is exactly what we are getting.  He said, recently, that the economic war was responsible only for 18/- per head on cattle.  I can produce at this moment a document for the Minister which shows that on thirteen cattle sold in England there was paid to His Majesty's customs a sum of £66 4/7, that is, over £5 a head.  Of course, I know that there was a subsidy or bounty given in connection with that. So much for the cattle industry.  I do not believe that it is necessary to go at length into all the details which I have heard talked about here to-day, extending over the past ten years.  I want to face facts as we know them at the present moment, whoever is responsible for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want the Government and the House to realise is the exact position <Col N="378" /> of the farming community at present, no matter who is responsible for it.  We have had, as I said, a moment ago, a system of farming in this country for a good while.  I do not want to be taken as saying that a change in the agricultural policy of this country might not be desirable and that more tillage would not be necessary. I do not want to say anything against that but I want to try to impress the present position on the Minister for Agriculture.  The position with regard to horses is the same as that which applies to cattle.  The forty per cent. is absolutely the ruination of the industry.  Stud farming has been carried on in this country, and a good deal of employment in that industry has been closed down with very bad results indeed.  Stud farmers were responsible for bringing a very big amount of money into the country year after year.  That is no longer the position.</P>
    <P>The pig breeding industry was a source of very great income to many small farmers.  These small farmers were the greatest pig producers in the country.  I think that is realised by everybody.  That industry has now gone off a good deal and the farmers have given up pig production for two reasons.  One of these is the old story of the economic war, and the other legislation which has been introduced into this House in connection with the Cereals Bill.  I tell the Minister that this is having a very serious effect in different parts of the country and I shall explain the reason why.  Maize meal delivered in the creamery of which I happen to be a member costs 12/9 per 20 stone.  Barley meal delivered in the same creamery costs 20/- per 20 stone.  Must it not be apparent to everybody that there we have a great increase in the price of the raw material?  I know it suits certain districts, and constituencies, such as the Minister for Agriculture represents, but is it not a big hardship on those who are unable to grow barley and never will?  I do not say anything against the quality of the barley.  I know that barley meal is good feeding, but it is the price I complain of, and I hope the Minister will take note of that fact.  Pig production has practically <Col N="379" /> gone out of existence owing to that very fact.  Now take the egg industry.  Eggs are sold in the country for 3d. per dozen.  That is the price although when one comes to Dublin one is charged much more right enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>One of your Deputies said that the hens are on strike.  If they hear what is being said about them here they will lay no more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the price anyway that eggs are fetching in the country.  Now with regard to the dairy industry about which we heard so much previous to, and during, the general election.  I am not one of those people who want to criticise everything and who can see no virtue in anything that the present Government may do.  I want to say here and now that that is the one thing that has met with the approval of the vast majority of the farmers of the country. At the same time I would like to remind the Minister of a statement of his when he said that it cost 5½d. to produce a gallon of milk when the Commission was set up.  Taking that statement as substantially correct, the Minister knows well the average price of milk last year.  It was less than 4½d. per gallon and, even with the help the Government gives, we are still not getting the cost of production despite what Deputy Belton said.  I took the trouble to find out exactly what the charge per gallon meant upon the Central Fund for last year.  I found that the amount was anywhere in the neighbourhood of .48d. and that was the benefit the Central Fund contributed to the creameries last year.  I wonder would the Minister accept that figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government mentioned, recently, the benefits the farmers now enjoy in respect of rates. I am not to be taken as saying that farmers should not pay rates or anything else.  I do not develop that line of argument at all, but I say that under present circumstances the farmers are not able to pay rates.  The Minister <Col N="380" /> mentioned the benefits the farming community derived from social services. He mentioned particularly medical benefit, sewerage, and water works.  I fail to see how the Minister can imagine such things as that.  The farmers do not derive these benefits. I take my own case as a fair example, and I am neither a big farmer nor a rancher, and the only benefit I seem to derive from the rates is in regard to the road I travel on.  It is a fallacy to say that the farmers derive these benefits.  I take this particular case which I put to the Minister.  There is a rural and an urban area in my district.  The valuation of the urban area is £8,000, that of the rural area £16,000.  The amount of home assistance paid is £100 per week in the urban area and £20 per week in the rural area.  That is one item alone as an example of how the rates hit the farmers in the rural areas.  He also mentioned about small farmers with a £10 valuation and under.  I know that the farmers in my county of £10 valuation do not derive their means of livelihood from their farms.  They derive their means of livelihood mainly or solely by working on the roads for the county councils, and from the grants sent down by the Government to the local councils.  That is what they derive their livelihood from, and a good job, too.  With a horse or a jennet they could earn from 48/- to 50/- a week at that class of work and anybody will tell you that they would starve if they had to derive their means of livelihood from the small farms they possess.  I have gone into these matters very briefly, and I do not want to delay the House any longer, but I hope the Minister for Agriculture, whose duty it is to look after the farming community, will be impressed by the statements I have made which are not those of a politician but of a practical farmer.  I ask the Minister to tell me any article or commodity which a farmer could produce last winter that would have paid for the cost of production and leave any profit. Now, that is fair.  That is general.  I am not talking now about farmers like, probably, Deputy Belton and Deputy Corry, who live in close proximity to large towns and cities.  I am excluding <Col N="381" /> these.  I am talking about the general run of farmers round the country.  What article can he produce that would pay for the cost of production for the last six or eight months and leave him anything to live on? That is a fair question.</P>

Will the Minister answer that question?  He cannot answer it.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House talking what I consider is not relevant to the motion before the House.  But that is the position as I see the whole thing before me as a practical farmer.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, the Ceann Comhairle would just allow me to depart from what is strictly the motion.  I will not depart very much from it and I will not ask much latitude&mdash;not anything like the latitude taken by some of the Deputies who spoke before me.  There is a story being told down the country about a farmer who had bullocks to sell.  He happened to meet a Fianna Fáil Deputy who was also a farmer, and he asked him would he buy the bullocks. He said he would not.  So the farmer said to him: &ldquo;I wonder what I had best do with them?&rdquo;  The Fianna Fáil Deputy said: &ldquo;The best thing you can do with them is to run them at such and such a point-to-point meeting coming off in the country in the near future.&rdquo;  Now, that is a new idea, and it might commend itself to some of the enterprising point-to-point committees; but it should be one of the conditions that the bullocks should be ridden on the occasion by some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies.  Just imagine 15 or 16 bullocks charging down the course with Deputy Corry in the front!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The last Deputy's speech just shows how impossible it is to please everybody, and I think that the question put by Deputy Corry should illustrate that well.  Deputy Curran, being from a creamery district, congratulates the Government on what is being done for the creameries and, I think, he has not made any objection to the price of butter going up here and not going up in Britain.  I think Deputy Curran objected to Deputy Belton's attacking us on that, and that he would defend the price of 135/- here, even though it is not that much in Great Britain. He would defend it all the more if it were in Britain as well as here.  He does not object to the subsidy in any way.  But when it comes to a matter of paying a little more to the grain producer, there is a very serious objection raised.  I am quite certain <Col N="383" /> that if we took a Deputy from the Midlands, from Leix-Offaly, say, or Longford-Westmeath, some of those counties that go in for cereals more than for creameries, they would favour the cereals rather than the butter.  The unfortunate thing is that we have to try to do our best to be just to the farmer no matter what he produces, whether it be butter, grain, cattle, tobacco or anything else.</P>
      <P>Deputy Curran mentioned the pig industry and said that they were not paying.  I am very sorry that I did not attend to my own business a day sooner, and I could, perhaps, give better information.  But I did send pigs in to-day, and I am absolutely certain that those pigs will pay, because I am getting somewhere between 59/- and 65/- according to whether they are lean or fat.  The feeding-stuffs used for these pigs were bought at an average of £6 6/- per ton.  My usual experience is that about a quarter of a ton will fatten a pig.  I expect to get at least £3 15/- per pig.  That leaves a fair amount for labour, the price of a small pig, rent, rates and so on.  If other things were as favourable as that&mdash;I do not say they are&mdash;but if other things were as favourable as that, farmers would be quite satisfied.  That is one instance of a product that is paying at the present time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Curran also mentioned eggs. How has the economic war interfered with eggs?  The Deputy says they are 3d. per dozen down the country.  Some people here, I am sure, know something about that.  Let us put 50 per cent. on them before they are exported. That means they are exported at 4½d. 40 per cent. on that is almost 2d.  We are giving a bounty of 2d. on the eggs, so that the economic war cannot be held to be responsible for the low price.  If eggs are being sold at 3d., the bounty amounts to as much as the tariff; so the economic war cannot be blamed for the low price.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say those figures are <Col N="384" /> correct.  If the price is more than 3d., the tariff is higher than the bounty, but if they are only 3d. it is equal to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy also raised the question of butter and, I think, he made the complaint that we were not doing, perhaps, enough for butter, because I stated that the cost of milk production is 5½d. per gallon.  That was the last figure for the cost of milk production from the Department of Agriculture.  It is the only theoretical figure I have.  I think the figure I have given is right and the cost of production is 5½d. per gallon.  What are we doing in regard to milk?  The world price of butter is 72/-.  Let us assume that there is no economic war and that we are selling our butter in England just the same as the New Zealanders and Australians and can get 72/-.  On an average it costs the creamery 20/- in expenses and 3/- or 4/- for freight and selling costs.  If you take 23/- from 72/- you get 49/-.  That is what they have to distribute to the milk suppliers and that works out at 2¼d. a gallon. With existing prices, bounties and subsidies milk would be 4d. a gallon, so that the difference of 1¾d. would come out of the pool or the Government subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton's speech contained a lot of figures which were hard to follow.  The main point was that the Government is playing England's game.  He said that because the Government would not give the farmers the same chance as they did give England.  We said to England: &ldquo;We will put this money in a suspense account and if you prove it is yours we will give it to you,&rdquo; and the Deputy asked why we should not say the same <Col N="385" /> to the farmers.  I like that argument because it represents an advance from Cumann na nGaedheal.  They want us to give the farmers time to prove that the money is theirs.  Before the last election Cumann na nGaedheal wanted us to prove why the money should not go to John Bull.  We would much prefer that the money should go to the Irish farmer rather than to John Bull. At any rate, we did not wait until the farmers proved that the money should go to them.  We gave it to them.</P>
    <P>The Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain in his Budget statement the other day said that he was going to collect three and a half millions on tariffs on Irish products going into England.  Let us take it that there is a sum of £2,000,000 a year for all time to give a reduction in annuities&mdash;£3,000,000 this year.  While the economic war is on we are doing a lot of other things. Export bounties this year will amount to £2,500,000 not to speak of other interim bounties such as on wheat and tobacco, which will amount to £250,000. In that way the farmer gets £2,000,000 in the matter of land annuities; £2,500,000 in respect of export bounties and £250,000 in respect of other bounties, or a total of £4,750,000 as against £3,500,000 which the Chancellor of the Exchequer will collect.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to annuities for all years to come.  Does that mean that the annuities are to be made permanent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  It was made very plain at the last election by Cumann na nGaedheal that we were going to impose a land tax for all time. It was made clear by us that we were not, and that the farmers could trust us.  The farmers did trust us.  We were asked by Deputy MacDermot why we changed from total de-rating to a remission of the land annuities.  We changed because it was much better for the farmer.  The total rates remission for the farmers for the year would be £1,450,000, or roughly £1,500,000.  In the case of the land annuities the remission would amount to £2,000,000. The only section that might object to the dropping of the de-rating proposal <Col N="386" /> would be the townspeople.  They might object because we are giving the farmers more than we ever promised them.  With regard to the motion, if we could afford it we should relieve the townspeople also of rates.  The whole point is that we cannot afford it.</P>

      <P>Where would we get the money?  We would have to reduce our expenditure or increase taxation. Does anyone suggest that we should reduce old age pensions or any of the other payments that are being made? When we try to make economies by way of cutting higher salaries we are met with the greatest opposition by some Deputies here.  No suggestion is made as to where we can get the money. If we did not collect these annuities and rates and taxes where would we get the money to keep Government services going?</P>
