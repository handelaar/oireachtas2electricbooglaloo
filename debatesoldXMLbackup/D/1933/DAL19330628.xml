      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that there is a steady increase of admission of &ldquo;Casuals&rdquo; to the Dublin Board of Assistance, averaging 25 daily; that these &ldquo;Casuals&rdquo; are mostly young men of the ages of 15 and 25 years, and whether having regard to the enormous cost of relief he intends to take any steps to alleviate the increasing cost in the Dublin Union Area.</P>

      <P>The general question of the cost of relief in the Dublin Union was fully discussed with a deputation from the Dublin Board of Assistance on the 9th March last.  The members of the deputation were informed that the State could not be expected to assume any financial responsibility in this matter.  There is nothing to add at present to the outcome of these discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes (for Tadhg O Murchadha)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has yet made the necessary regulations to give effect to the promise contained in the official statement issued from his Department on the occasion of the publication of the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill, 1933, to the effect that lay teachers in Convent and Monastery Schools, and junior assistant mistresses were to be admitted to full pensions rights, and whether he is in a position to mention the date from which pensions will be payable to these teachers.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to mention the date from which pensions will be payable to junior assistant mistresses and lay assistant teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have already decided in principle that the teachers in these classes are to be given the benefit of pensionability.  The terms, however, upon which pensions may be granted are part of the general question of the future pension position of the National School teachers as a whole.  That general question still remains unsettled.  In April last the President, while Acting Minister for Finance, informed the Irish National Teachers' Organisation that the Government were willing to discuss with them the final settlement of the question of making solvent the Teachers' Pension Fund and the terms on which future pensions should be payable if the organisation sent plenipotentiaries with whom a settlement could be arrived at.  That invitation has not been accepted and the Government have consequently not been in a position to settle the matter by agreement. Meantime the insolvency of the pension fund is growing.  The Government are still willing to discuss the matter with the teachers, as already intimated.  The delay in settlement of the general question necessarily postpones the date from which pensions can begin to be payable to the two classes referred to in the question. Unless the teachers' organisation is prepared to respond to the invitation already given, the Government will be <Col N="1387" /> obliged themselves, without further delay, to determine the matters outstanding, including that of the terms on which the pensions will be payable to the lay assistant teachers and junior assistant mistresses.</P>

      <P>The position of the creamery industry in County Sligo has been discussed between my Department and the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, and the Organisation Society have been invited to arrange a comprehensive scheme for the reorganisation of the industry in the area in question.  No such scheme has yet been submitted to me because it has not, so far, been found possible to secure the co-operation of the several local societies concerned whose concurrence would be necessary to the success of the project.</P>

The whole problem of the reorganisation of the dairy industry in County Sligo is one of very considerable importance to the farmers concerned.  On that account, I think sufficient time should be given to the Minister to reply and, in order to facilitate him in the matter, I beg to give notice that I will raise the question on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the purpose of this Bill is to reopen the whole land question in Ireland, I submit that we ought to have more than four days to consider it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new Land Bill.  We have had various prognostications as to what its provisions are and I think the time allotted for its consideration is insufficient.  On a previous occasion when a much simpler measure than this was introduced, Deputies opposite asked for a fortnight for its consideration and they got a fortnight.  I see no reason why a fortnight should not be given for consideration of this measure.  This measure is a departure from, whereas the previous measure was an extension or modification of, existing legislation. If one takes what is proposed together with what Ministers have said as to what is included in the Bill, I think that a longer period than three days is necessary for its consideration.</P>

I submit respectfully that the important time is not between the Second Stage and the Committee Stage but between the First Stage and the Second Reading when the full implications of the Bill will have to be studied in all their meanings.

      <P>If one is to judge by the title of this Bill, it is of a much more comprehensive character than the Bill of 1931.  When the Fianna Fáil Party were in Opposition they insisted on getting a fortnight between the introduction of the Bill and the Second Reading Stage in order to have adequate time for its consideration. Surely, the Minister, chiefly because of the revolutionary character of this Bill which he is about to introduce, should give Deputies at least a fortnight to master the different sections of the Bill. It will take at least a fortnight to do it, and the Minister knows that perfectly well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 19, before Section 37; to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Any person owning (whether beneficially or in a fiduciary capacity) a trade or business in respect of which excess profits duty is or may be charged or chargeable or having a power of sale over any such trade or business may apply to the Revenue Commissioners for such certificate as is hereinafter mentioned, and, if the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that such person has agreed to sell such trade or business but has not completed such sale or that such person bona fide intends as soon as conveniently may be to sell such trade or business and the Revenue Commissioners are also satisfied that the facts in relation to the charge and payment of excess profits duty in respect of such trade or business for every accounting period justify them in so doing, the Revenue Commissioners shall issue to such person a certificate signed by an officer of the Revenue Commissioners duly authorised in that behalf by them, certifying either (as the case may require) that no excess profits duty is chargeable in respect of such trade or business or that all excess profits duty chargeable in respect of such trade or business has been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  A certificate issued under this section shall discharge any purchaser for valuable consideration in money or money's worth of the trade or business to which such certificate relates from the person to whom such certificate was issued and all persons deriving title to such trade or business from or through such purchaser from all claims for excess profits duty in respect of such trade or business, and shall (save in case of fraud by the person to whom such certificate was issued or failure by him to disclose material facts) also discharge such person and all persons deriving title to such trade or business from or through him otherwise than for valuable consideration in money or money's worth from (as the case may be) all claims or any further claim <Col N="1397" /> for excess profits duty in respect of such trade or business.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to the certificate of discharge which has been asked for during the course of the debate on those portions of the Bill which deal with the liability for excess profits duty.  The amendment, as will be seen from the face of it, contemplates the issue of a certificate only in a case in which a sale is in contemplation, or in which there has been actual agreement to sell, but the sale has not been completed.  Under the amendment the person to make the application for the certificate will be the vendor, and it will be for him to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that there is no outstanding liability for excess profits duty.  Once the certificate has been issued it will have the effect of discharging a bona fide purchaser for valuable consideration from any claim in respect of excess profits duty, even though there was fraud or failure to disclose material facts on the part of the vendor.  The certificate also discharges the vendor from liability except in cases of fraud or failure to disclose material facts.</P>
    <P>In connection with the proposed new section it is to be noted that an owner in a fiduciary capacity, for instance an executor, who contemplates selling a business, may apply for a certificate under this section instead of applying for a certificate under the old Section 37, which will now become Section 38. A certificate issued under the latter section would have the effect only of discharging the executor from excess profits duty.  It would not have the effect of discharging a person who purchased from the executor, or otherwise derived title from him.  I think that the proposed amendment goes far to meet the various points of view which were expressed in the debates on the Committee Stage of the Bill. It represents to the mind of the Revenue Commissioners and to the mind of the Minister for Finance, the extreme limit of practical concession in this matter.  As I have already said, in view of the considerable opportunities for securing full discharge which it will afford to those people who own property and have the bona fide intention of selling it, <Col N="1398" /> whether there is an immediate purchaser in view or not, I think it ought to meet with the acceptance of the Dáil, and I believe will go far to remove many of the objections which were raised with regard to the policy the Government were pursuing in relation to excess profits duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, to my mind, does nothing to meet the objections that were raised on the Committee Stage.  As was prognosticated on that occasion, the Revenue Commissioners have become active, and proportionately as the Revenue Commissioners have become active the Minister has become passive.  The result of it is that this saving clause is introduced into the amendment, that &ldquo;the Revenue Commissioners shall issue to such person a certificate&rdquo; if the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied &ldquo;that such person has agreed to sell, and are also satisfied that the facts in relation to the charge and payment of excess profits duty in respect of such trade or business for every accounting period justify them in so doing.&rdquo;  There is no reason whatever why the Revenue Commissioners should not put their heels on the ground and simply say: &ldquo;We are not satisfied,&rdquo; whereupon the vendor has no means whatever of compelling them to arrive at a finale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I suggest to the Minister, and suggested on the Committee Stage also, is that this amendment should have given the vendor the right to go to the Revenue Commissioners and say: &ldquo;I want, within, say, two or three months, a certificate of discharge, or in the alternative an assessment for total liability so that I can go before the appropriate tribunal and challenge it and, if necessary, upset it.&rdquo;  That gives the vendor some security that at some appointed date he can force a conclusion on the Revenue Commissioners.  As the amendment stands at present, I think the Minister will agree that he has no such guarantee at all.  The Revenue Commissioners can stand fast, say they are not satisfied, refuse to make a final assessment, and at the same time refuse to give him a certificate of discharge.  He is no better off than he was.  Is not that so?  As the <Col N="1399" /> amendment at present stands, so it seems to me, and, unless a time limit is put in there and an opportunity given to the vendor to do what I suggest, in my opinion the amendment introduced by the Minister is of very little value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this amendment and the section generally are concerned there is at least this limit of concession which the Minister has mentioned, that if a person wants definitely to be sure that he is not going to be charged excess profits duty his only possible course now is to sell his business.  Again, if he does intend to sell his business there is, as Deputy Dillon has pointed out, delay.  There is no period in which the Revenue Commissioners are bound to give a discharge or an account&mdash;one or the other.  It is 18 years since this tax was imposed.  It is some ten or 11 years since it ceased to be operative, and we are spreading this over that period.  At this moment anybody in business who has either discharged his obligations in connection with excess profits duty, or who, perhaps, was never assessed, is in doubt as to whether or not there is any charge. What is the limit of concession?  The limit of concession leaves us practically as we were, that when the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied then they shall issue a discharge; not until they are satisfied.  Normally, a person is selling a business; he has paid his excess profits duty during whatever period he was liable; he must now go to the Revenue Commissioners to get a discharge in order to satisfy the person who is going to purchase. He has had no dealings with them for eight, nine or ten years, but as long as that section or that amendment of the Minister's stands he is bound to go to the Revenue Commissioners to get this discharge to qualify for sale to the person who is going to purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to direct his attention to that particular aspect of his amendment, that even in the case of persons who have not had an excess profits duty assessment for ten years, who discharged it ten years <Col N="1400" /> ago, when about to sell now, the person who is to purchase may say: &ldquo;You must go to the Revenue Commissioners to get a discharge.&rdquo;  If he does not go to the Revenue Commissioners there is no sale, unless there is an insurance or something of that sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no point in the amendment except that the person who purchases property has this guarantee, that he will not purchase until he gets a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.  It would not be tolerated anywhere, if a levy were due and had to be made, that it should not be made within some fixed period. This does not get us anywhere.  The vendor cannot do anything.  The Revenue Commissioners say: &ldquo;No, we will not give it to you.&rdquo;  We know perfectly well they will not give it. Theoretically it is there, but the vendor cannot get it; he has no compulsory power.  There should be some provision in the Bill to cover that point.  During the period when negotiations are proceeding between the vendor and purchaser, and before the sale is completed, the Revenue Commissioners should make their assessment or else withdraw their claim.  This merely protects the purchaser when he has actually purchased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The genesis of this amendment was the suggestion made when Section 36 was originally being considered by the House, that it would be unfair, not to vendors, but to purchasers, if the assessment were to be made, in accordance with the practice hitherto existing, on the person for the time being the owner of the business.  Deputy Dillon said in that connection that quite obviously the purchaser may know nothing about the assessment; he may know nothing about the liability of this business for excess profits duty, and some provision should be made to safeguard the purchaser.  That was the genesis of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsequent discussions the position of the vendor was brought in <Col N="1401" /> and, in order to advance some way to meet the criticism which had been made here&mdash;and, in view of the past record of those who now constitute the chief Opposition, that criticism was not very consistent&mdash;I agreed that in a case where a bona fide sale was in contemplation the person who had a business which, in his opinion, might be liable to excess profits duty, might go to the Revenue Commissioners and secure from them a certificate which would be a full discharge in every case in which there had not been a fraud on the part of the vendor or a failure to disclose material facts.  Quite obviously if this business was, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, likely to be liable for excess profits duty, they could not give a certificate until they were fully satisfied that it was not in fact so liable.</P>
    <P>The principle adopted in this amendment is not a new principle.  It is the basis upon which, in a similar case in the year 1928, the then Minister for Finance acted in regard to the payment of income tax under Schedules A and B.  Section 6 of the Finance Act of 1928 relates to the case of a landlord or immediate lessor or the occupier of any property charged or chargeable under Schedule A or Schedule B of the Income Tax Act, 1918, and gives him the right to apply to the inspector of taxes for the district in which such property is situated for a certificate that all income tax charged under the said Schedules for all the years of assessment ending prior to the 6th day of April preceding the date of the application has been paid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If there are no 400-gallon storage cisterns made in this country, we may find a very effective substitute for them.  Where it is not possible to secure an effective substitute it is the intention of the Minister to sympathetically consider any application for a licence to import this article if it cannot be made at home.  I would not at all take up the position that these tanks are in any way analogous to Staffordshire blue bricks, but I submit again to Deputy Dillon that quite effective substitutes in the way of home made bricks are to be had in this country: that is, if a person's artistic eye will consider bricks which are made at home out of Staffordshire clay. They are not fire grate bricks.</P>

The fact that you can use two smaller ones would only mean that the fittings for their connection would make the cost prohibitive. I suggest to the Minister that there is no one at the present time going to manufacture these cisterns in this country.  When anyone comes along able to do so, the concession to import can be immediately withdrawn. I would not for a moment suggest that it should not be withdrawn when the output of works in this country is enlarged and able to meet the demand. I suggest to the Minister that under present conditions this is only one of the many things that is absolutely helping to slow down industry and production. I do not for a moment suggest that the Minister will not sympathetically consider an application for a four, five or six hundred storage gallon cistern to be imported into this country. I suggest that there are so many permits, licences, etc., necessary in carrying out any undertaking in provisional schemes which are drawn up by business people from time to time, as to make the rendering of accurate estimates impossible.  A person has to make a calculation as to some work in the country, and that means applying for provisional licences to see whether the scheme is going to work.  I suggest to the Minister that he should re-consider all these matters.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Dockrell in his plea with regard to licences.  It is extremely difficult to carry on business at the present time.  In any general business carried on to-day I suppose in connection with 20 or 30 per cent. of the invoices of merchandise you have to apply for a licence.  I am not overstating the case, about 70 per cent. would be clear but for the remaining 20 or 30 per cent., licences have to be applied for.  It is very difficult for people not in business to understand the enormous burden of work that places on the shoulders of people who are in business.  Take the packing business. We get a licence to import a certain class of bottles at present.  If a packet comes to you you may find you have to pay 33? on some of the bottles in that package, perhaps two or three dozen. At present I know a case in which a merchant was served with notice that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had decided to give him a licence to import a certain class of glass bottles, amounting to the number of bottles he imported in the 12 months ending March 1933 divided by five.  That merchant looked up his invoices for all classes of bottles imported from three or four firms. The information obtained had to be put into a Schedule, copies of which had to be sent to the Revenue Commissioners.  They are with the Revenue Commissioners for the last three or four weeks.  I am sure the Revenue Commissioners are doing all they can to hurry matters up but doubtless they have many similar applications to occupy their attention at the same time.  So that you see this business of putting a tariff on something and saying, &ldquo;We will give a permit if you cannot get it,&rdquo; means enormous trouble to the businessman and, virtually, that it is impossible to carry on.</P>

      <P>On previous occasions I gave what I consider fairly good reasons against this Bill. The Bill merely proposes to shorten the length of time during which the Seanad can hold a Bill in suspense.  I pointed out before that with the Constitutional conditions in this country it is desirable that there should be power of delay and considerable delay.  By this Bill we are removing the last shadow of control that there is over the Executive Council.  I know that the President considers as a personal affront to himself any suggestion that a Government of which he is the head could be otherwise than perfect.  But we are legislating here to decide how legislation shall take place in this country and how control of the country shall operate.  As I pointed out before, this country, almost unique in the world, can have its fundamental law changed by an ordinary act of legislation.  The courts can be abolished to-morrow by a Fianna Fáil majority.  Deputy MacDermot, speaking on this Bill, said there were two countries in Europe, Spain and Turkey &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and Bulgaria. There are three countries in Europe that have not a Second Chamber.  We are evidently not going to have a Second House, but Deputy MacDermot realises that that does not really make an analogy in this case.  He and other Deputies in the House will remember that in Spain when a Bill was brought in a short time ago which was recognised as being detrimental to the welfare of the Spanish people, there was a general hope felt not only in Spain but outside Spain that the Spanish President would recognise his power to refuse his signature to that Bill.  In this country we have no such equivalent as the President of Spain. The equivalent here would be the Governor-General and the Governor-General has no power to refuse his <Col N="1410" /> signature to a Bill.  We have a Government in this House with a majority of one at the moment.  This is a Bill not for the present time but for the future as well.  The Government can bring in any Bill it likes.  With that majority of one there is no power to check that Government elected at a hectic moment, by people without much experience and who were prepared to believe any lies told them, a Government elected on the cry that they should be given a chance.  To such a Government this Bill is now proposing that all this power should be given. There is no monarch and no Government in Europe to-day as sovereign as the Executive Council here.  I admit that that was so before this Bill was brought in but the Seanad could, if they thought it was for the welfare of the people to do so, hold up a Bill for a year and a half.  That period is now being reduced to three months.</P>
      <P>It is urged of course that the people in this country do not want the Seanad. As I pointed out here already, there is not one man in one hundred who has given a thought to the Seanad.  The people in this country have not had a long experience of control of their State.  They only see what is obvious. The idea of a Second House was not a bright idea that anybody thought out. It came from a long process of evolution. It was found by people that the monarch himself should be controlled to some extent by Parliament.  The power then moved into the hands of the Executive Council and it was recognised that the people should be defended, in so far as one could take precautions, against any possible law that could be made against them by the Executive Council or anybody else. Now we have the position here that the members of the Government have no check on them.  I do not think that they will take it as an insult if I say that during many years they cultivated a subversive organisation in this country. They now refuse to take the action that every law, human and otherwise, demands that they should take to protect the people against that organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is to prevent this Government from suddenly declaring that the Army of this country should be the I.R.A.? <Col N="1411" /> It is very hard to get any strong movement going in the country, to get any movement crystallised so that it would affect a Government in three months. But if a Government should have to stand over that for 18 months it would be more difficult.  If the proposal is beneficial one may be quite certain that 18 months will serve to convince the people and to convert opponents to the beneficial things in the Bill.  But here once the Government makes up its mind that a thing should become law no power is there to withhold them.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill to extend the power of the Executive Council.  There was a time when people denounced Czars and absolute monarchs but I should like to be told what absolute monarch was ever in the world with more power than the Executive Council in this State?  It was generally recognised by philosophers and people who theorised about Governments that the whims of the people should not be given immediate effect and that fundamental law should operate; that Governments and even monarchs must rule or govern according to the law.  Here we have a Government governing according to the fundamental law of the Constitution but we have power to change that Constitution at any moment that the Government sees fit to do so.  Kings, when they really fulfilled the complete kingly function, were themselves bound by law.  The old Greeks considered that even the gods had to be bound by justice; but here we have a Government that can change the very foundations of law in this country at any moment that it suits them to do so, and the most that can be done, when this Bill is passed, is that the Seanad can hold it up for three months.  Of course, in a short time we may have a Bill introduced to abolish the Seanad altogether.  For instance, take the case of the President of Spain, elected under different circumstances from the Government, not being a symbol of the same whim that elected a government; when he sees that a thing is clearly not in the public interest he can stop it and refuse to give his signature to it.  Here in this country, however, there is nothing that can stand against <Col N="1412" /> the Government as long as it has got that machine majority which it got as a result of the elections.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this Government should get away from the idea that they are perfect and from the idea that somehow or another the people who voted for the last ten years for one thing really wanted another and that now they have voted for this Government they will continue to vote for it for ever.  The President himself would wish and would acknowledge that it is right and proper that there should be some protection for the people against irresponsible action by the Executive Council, but here we are not going to have it.  The Government in this country, and I admit, it was true of the late Government, has more power than any Government in the world that I know of.  From time to time we changed the Constitution and I am prepared to stand and assert that we never changed the Constitution in any point where it was not abundantly clear that it was for the benefit of the people of this country.  We never sought to subvert the fundamental law of this country and, if we did, there was dissent, and dissent, as members who have been here from 1922 up to the present know, representing the various phases of public opinion during the period who did not represent the mood of the country at any one moment but the mood of the country over a fairly protracted period.  It is right to assume that although the people may be wrong and unbalanced for a short time they are less likely to be wrong and unbalanced over a period of years. Consequently, I think that this Bill has no purpose&mdash;and I do not want to be unfair to anyone&mdash;except a slight vindictiveness against the Seanad.  The Seanad did hold up the Oath Bill. There was no urgency whatever about the Oath Bill.  The people had voted for Governments that approved of the Oath for a period of ten years.  Consequently, one must assume that there could be no really strong objection to the Oath or, if there was, it was of recent and sudden growth and it would be only fair to allow a certain amount of time to elapse in order to let the people see whether they still held the same point of view after 18 months <Col N="1413" /> which they held at the time of the election.  The Seanad has not been what one might call a wrecking body. Occasionally they have held up Bills, but there has never been any Bill, to my knowledge, which they have held up or delayed which was necessarily and clearly for the public good.  There was never a case where a Bill was for the benefit of the public when the Seanad did otherwise than what is normal.  Deputies talk about the way the Seanad passed the Bills of the late Government.  It is somehow or other assumed by the members of the opposite side that no right-minded person should approve of anything brought in by the late Government; and the mere fact that the Seanad passed Bills is taken to mean that the Seanad was only influenced by the desire to approve of whatever the late Government did. There is no ground for that assumption. The people voted for the late Government and voted for them over a long period of years.</P>
    <P>I would again urge on this House&mdash; I know it does not amount to anything while they have the majority&mdash;that they are moving in a completely wrong direction, the direction of complete dictatorship.  There is no country in Europe to-day with a more complete and absolute dictatorship than has the Government of this country with, perhaps, the exception of Russia.  In Italy you have a Fascist Government and a king, whose functions are extremely limited but who has functions nevertheless.  The King is part of our Constitution here but we know that the Constitution demands that the King must act according to the advice of the Executive Council.  Consequently, the Executive Council here is supreme, as no monarch has been or no government in Europe is and yet our present Government is not satisfied. They want even greater powers than our predecessors had, and they kick against even the suggestion that what they want to have done might be delayed a little by another body.  It makes them impatient.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, it is no good arguing against this thing, but it is clear to everybody that there does require to be an elaborate machinery of Government to protect the people <Col N="1414" /> from themselves.  When this Bill is passed this Government is going to have an absolute and supreme power and we know that the Fianna Fáil majority is going to support it because their own Party is in power now; but who knows what Party will be in power in the future?  Some of us are convinced that the whole policy of this Government is to create here a mentality which means inevitably a revolutionary outlook which may result in the putting in of a government here of which no right-minded person could approve.  We are preparing the ground to make things easy for that. The conscious self-righteousness of the President is only effective as long as he remains President.  He may conceivably go out of office and in this country then we are going to be in the position that any Party which at any given moment is able by its catch-cries to get the support of a large majority of the people of this country can get complete control of the Government of this country without any power to delay or hold them.  I admit that it existed very largely before the President came into power.  He was not satisfied. According to him, we were only acting on orders from outside.  I notice the President has not said that since he came into office, because he knows it was not true.  But having held up the bogey to the people of this country that there was a power outside this country that was affecting the people here, he is using that now to get all the power into his own hands on the assumption that whatever he does is perfect.  The President said yesterday that, when large sums of money were put into his own hands for his heirs and assigns, we must assume that it would be an affront to him to suggest it would go into his own pocket.</P>

      <P>I agree, and withdraw that.  The President proposes this now because he is satisfied in his own heart that he knows what the Irish people want, but he will agree that it is at least possible that somebody may succeed him who may not have a heart of such a photo graphic nature as to be able to say <Col N="1415" /> that.  He is proposing a complete Fianna Fáil dictatorship without any restraint or trammel upon it and that is what European history reacts, and has always reacted against.  That is what he proposes for the Free State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of prominence has been given to the argument of the President, in support of this Bill, to the effect that the existence of proportional representation in this country has made it less necessary for us to have a strong Second Chamber.  I feel disposed to recur to that point just for a moment.  My opinion about proportional representation is that it has the effect of putting the country more at the mercy of party machines than the previous electoral system.  The arrangement, for instance, at elections under which the constituency is divided up into strips and the people are ordered to vote 1, 2, 3 in such and such an order for the candidates of a particular party, and the whole basis of party organisation that springs from the proportional representation system, has the effect of minimising personal relationship between a member and his constituency. It seems to me that the machine has tended more and more to thrust out the individual in politics as a result of proportional representation.  So far from that being something which makes a Second Chamber less necessary, I doubt very much if it is not something that makes a Second Chamber more necessary.  When added to that you have the existence of a system in this country, which I believe to be very unusual, where in the big Parties&mdash;in fact, I think, in all the Parties but our own&mdash;each individual member takes a specific pledge never to vote against his Party, it means that the discussions in this House, as Deputy Fitzgerald has just remarked, and as I have often heard remarked here before, become to a large extent make-believe because they cannot affect a vote.  They might conceivably affect the vote of a whole Party, but an individual will never vote against his Party.  We had an extreme instance of it on the Economies <Col N="1416" /> Bill, for example, when Deputy Breathnach made very strong speeches on one side and yet was unable to give effect to his views with his vote.  It appears to me that the existence of that system within the Dáil and of the proportional representation system in the country tend to make a Second Chamber more desirable rather than less desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue raised by this Bill, however, is not really whether we ought to have a Second Chamber or not.  If the Second Chamber were being completely abolished I could see some considerable compensations.  There would be the compensation of the saving of expense, in the first place.  In the second place, there are a number of able men in the Seanad who might perhaps come into this House if the Seanad were abolished.  There are a number of able men in the Seanad who would be perfectly capable of weathering the storm of an election and getting in here, but they shrink from it.  Most of us, I suppose, dislike elections, and it appears a pleasanter and more dignified course to go into a Chamber where you have not to face the hardships of a popular election.  I think that those men would be capable of doing far greater service to the country if they were in this Chamber than they are doing at present in the Seanad.  If this Bill is passed, the Seanad becomes something which I cannot understand anybody being in favour of.  It becomes a sham safeguard, and not a real safeguard. I agree with Senator O'Farrell when he says that whatever people's views may be about having a Seanad, he cannot understand anybody being in favour of a make-believe Seanad.  A sham safeguard is extremely dangerous in politics, in business or anywhere, because is gives people a false confidence that they ought not to have.  It is very bad for people to think a safeguard exists when it does not exist.  The inevitable effect of this Bill, coupled especially with the system of election which tends to make members of the Seanad depend upon the goodwill of the leaders of the different Parties in this House, must necessarily degrade the Seanad into something which is simply not worth while.  I do not understand how any unprejudiced <Col N="1417" /> or reasonable person can think this a good Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is worth making any reply to the speeches which have just been made.  They are simply a repetition of the statements made on the Second Reading.</P>
      <P>I must say I do not at all agree with the last speaker with regard to proportional representation.  Deputy Fitzgerald talked about what people might do in a hectic moment.  I do not think it is possible, under proportional representation, to get a swing over of public opinion which would require the Seanad to save the public from itself, in the circumstances we have heard I think that one of the supposed safeguards which the Seanad supplies is not needed in our case precisely because we have proportional representation.  A person would be very hard set to make a case that this House, for instance, constituted as it is, is not a fair reflex of public opinion, that is assuming that elections are held without intimidation and without force.  It is from something of that sort I imagine we need protection rather than protection by such means as we have in the case of the Seanad.  It was precisely because the preceding Executive held elections at times when it was obvious that there was no freedom that we have had a good deal of the difficulty which existed over a considerable period.  I still hold to my view that the existence of a system of proportional representation does offer a more effective safeguard against violent changes of public opinion, and any evil consequences that may follow from it, than a Second Chamber, particularly a Second Chamber of the character we have here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point is with regard to the real purpose of this Bill.  Again, we have to ask ourselves whether the Second Chamber is to be a controlling body or not.  If you give it delaying powers to such an extent that it is in fact able to make futile the aims and objects of the constitutionally elected Executive, then it is in fact a controlling body.  When it is considered that a period of 20 months is practically one half of what we may expect to be the <Col N="1418" /> normal period of office of Governments here it will be seen you are giving to the Second House a power of control which is quite in opposition to any theory of democratic Government.  We do know of course that Governments are not perfect, and we do know that there is no machine which can be devised that would give a perfect Government.  We are keeping to democracy simply because we believe that on the whole it is a more suitable, more definite and more satisfactory form of Government than any other. If we are going to have democracy we must accept its implications.  One of its implications is that when the people have voted for a certain policy, and put in an Executive to carry out that policy, they are really in favour of it, and that those who oppose it are opposing the will of the majority for the time being.  For instance, as happened here when a subject like the Oath had been discussed for years and had definitely been one of the principal matters at a general election, and when it was held by the majority Party that the removal of that Oath was very important from the point of view of domestic peace, I do think that it was assuming powers of control for a Second Chamber under such circumstances to hold up the Bill and insist on holding it up for the period of 20 months.</P>
    <P>I think I indicated to the House that the question of whether there should be a Second Chamber or not lies this way in my mind, that if I could see devised, if I could devise myself, or get suggestions for devising a Second Chamber which would have functions of a definite character differentiating it from this Chamber, I would be prepared, for one, to favour such a Chamber provided the members were relatively small in number, and that the powers of control over this Chamber were definitely limited.  There is no doubt whatever about it, the power of delay is, for the time being at any rate, an effective power of control.  The period I have mentioned in this Bill, five months, is a reasonable period.  It is a considerable fraction of the time which an Executive Council has normally at its disposal for the <Col N="1419" /> purpose of putting its policy through. The period of five months appears to me to be a fairly reasonable period.</P>
    <P>I tried to get members of the Dáil to believe that that was so by pointing out to them that Constitution Committees which were set up in 1922, not by us but in quite a different set of circumstances, and consisting of people who might be regarded in a sense as experts on the matter, had severally sent up reports, and in these reports the period indicated was a period of 180 days. That period was later, I understand, increased to 270 days as the result of certain negotiations or conversations that took place between a minority and the representative of the Executive at the time.  I admit it was not a very big increase.  That is the history of the matter, as I am informed.  I have seen the draft reports, and in two of these reports 180 days are specified as the period of delay.  I submit our five months period is a close approximation to that.  If you like, we are narrowing the period still further, but I think the period to which we are narrowing it is justified, considering that the Chamber, as it is elected in its present political way, is tending to become more and more, and will become more and more as time goes on, a mere reflection of this House.</P>
    <P>The question mentioned by the Deputy, the complete question as to whether we will or will not have a Second House, is not being determined. The period of five months might possibly be changed.  If there were a committee sitting on this whole question, a recommendation might be made for a somewhat longer period, but personally, I think this period is sufficiently long as a period of delay. It gives the members of the Second House ample opportunity of criticising any measure that comes before them. It gives an opportunity for the submission of suggestions, and it gives any body in the country which might be affected by measures submitted to the Seanad an opportunity of pressing their views upon their representatives or upon the Executive of the day.  If there are any hardships likely to be <Col N="1420" /> inflicted on persons, and if amendments proposed by the Seanad would alleviate those hardships in any way, then the bodies affected will have sufficient time in which to make their representations to the Executive Council or to their representatives.</P>
    <P>I think it is not necessary to go back on the history of the matter.  When this extension of the period of 270 days was originally under discussion I protested that the extended period would be used for political purposes, and that it would be used to obstruct a new Government with different ideas from those of the Government that was in office for ten years.  I am now convinced that it has been so used and we are determined that what we regard as abuses of that particular type will not be permitted indefinitely.  We are not necessarily determining, although I would stand for it if the matter came up even now, that this should be the delaying period if the Constitution of the Second House is altered.  We say, at any rate, that pending the abolition of the present Chamber or the substitution of it by another, its powers of delay shall not be longer than the period in the Bill. For those reasons I press for the passing of this measure.</P>

      <P>The idea that this Oath business should receive final consideration now is, I am afraid, very optimistic.  The cat has come home again.  This Bill will not put an end to the Oath any more than the last Bill put an end to the Oath.  I look forward to many happy introductions of further Bills by the Government to endeavour to drown this cat which refuses to be drowned.  I do not think the efforts made by the Government to attempt to drown this cat have been successful or are likely to be successful for many years to come.  The President, who has been in the last couple of days in a bad temper, has endeavoured repeatedly to put an end to the Oath which has to be taken by members of the Oireachtas.  I remember <Col N="1425" /> some years ago the Minister for Agriculture and, I think, the Minister for Defence coming down this gangway carrying something which looked like one of the great pyramids of Egypt&mdash;a great pile of documents appealing for the abolition of the Oath.  That did not work.  The many efforts of the Government since then to abolish the Oath have not been successful, and this will not be successful.  There are further provisions in the Constitution and in the Treaty which have not been repealed and, I think, as time goes on, the Government will find that they will have to bring in further legislation.  It is unfortunate that the Government will not realise that this cat, which is a boomerang cat, is really a weapon, not in the hands of our enemies, but in the hands of the Irish nation.  As it stands, the Oath which we are supposed to take is obviously an anachronism&mdash;actually a lie.  We are asked to swear that Ireland is a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  That is not true.  The Vice-President might as well hang up on Nelson Pillar every time a new Dáil meets a notice to the effect that &ldquo;England expects that every Irishman this day shall swear a lie,&rdquo; because the Oath as it stands is untrue.  That being so, it is obvious that the retention of this Oath is not to our disadvantage, but to the disadvantage of the neighbouring country.  I foresee the day when the British Government will be very anxious to persuade us at all costs not to take this Oath. Unfortunately, the Government do not realise that fact, and they continue to try to drown the cat.  The cat comes back, and I shall have pleasure in speaking on the next occasion when the cat comes back again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, I think that, the Vice-President, speaking on this, obviously&mdash;again I do not want to misrepresent him&mdash;misunderstood the situation which would exist if this Bill was passed.  Section 2, I think it is, provides that the deposit shall be paid back.  The Vice-President regarded the withholding of the deposit as a sort of political test.  The phrase, &ldquo;political test,&rdquo; as used by <Col N="1426" /> the present Government, is a thing which has either no meaning at all, or some meaning the words do not simply. As was pointed out to him yesterday, when this Bill passes anyone can go up for election who can hand in a deposit of £100, and if elected he can claim the £100 and £360 per year and does not need to be in this country at all.  The Vice-President regards it as something unfair and in the nature of a political test to say that a man should not get the £100 back merely because he refuses to recognise the right of the Irish people to elect a Government.  At the same time, in order that this pure-minded patriot should not have to pay for his patriotism, we take every precaution to see that he does not lose his £100, and as a result of our taking that precaution he is to get £360 from the Irish people, whose right to have a Government, he refuses to recognise I should like to know from the Vice-President is that an unfair interpretation of the position that is going to exist when the Bill passes.  That seems to me to be the case.  I do not see what there is in the way of a political test.  The man goes up; there is no oath to be taken; he can go up and claim the right to come in here to legislate and to make laws binding on the conscience of the Irish people, but the Government thinks it would be a scandalous thing that his own conscience should be in any way bound. He must not risk losing £100 if he puts down a deposit.  Consequently, we change the law to decide that such a man should draw £360 a year for the five years or whatever time the Dáil may last.  It seems to me a perfectly ridiculous situation.</P>

      <P>This Bill is consequential on the passage of the Bill by the Oireachtas abolishing what was known as the Oath or test.  This simply seeks to make operative, so far as the necessary procedure is concerned, the consequences of the passage of that previous measure.  This Bill is not a Bill, as Deputy Esmonde suggested, to put an end to the Oath or test.  It is merely the implementing <Col N="1427" /> of the Act already passed by the Oireachtas abolishing the test imposed by the Constitution.

I do not see any point in Deputy Esmonde's speech so far as this Bill is concerned.  This Bill is merely implementing an Act already passed. If it be found necessary at any time to introduce further measures for this purpose such Bills will be introduced.  If it is at any time found that there is any flaw that will be done, and Deputy Esmonde has not suggested that any flaw is likely to be found in that Act.  It is quite possible that in some future time somebody may propose a further test, and further changes of the nature of what I had the privilege of introducing here may have to be made.  All this particular Bill is doing is merely giving practical effect to and implementing an Act which has already been passed by this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I shall have to repeat myself to some extent.  I regard this Bill as wrong.  It is a proposal that the present register, which is limited to rated occupiers, should be extended to give adult franchise.  The responsibilities of local government are different from those of the Dáil, because the Dáil legislates, and its legislation affects the lives, safety and conduct of the people of the country.  Local bodies assess and collect rates and spend rates.  There is another little point of difference.  That is that the whole mass of the people elect Deputies, and these Deputies themselves become almost an electoral college for electing the President and Executive Council.  The real power is centred in the Executive Council, of which the President is merely the senior member.  With regard to these local elections, the people elect a body of men who are to assess, collect and spend the rates, and that body of men is actually to be the executive for that purpose.  Everybody who pays rates, whether living in a small room or whether he owns a mansion, has the right to vote.  If the father and mother of a family have a son or daughter living with them over 21 years of age, the vote does not extend to the son or daughter.  Under this Bill everybody, men and women, over 21 years of age will have a vote.  What is the purpose of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must recognise that in the management of local government you do want responsibility, and you want care, so as to ensure that the people who have to provide the money for the rates should get good value for that money which is provided.  The best way to secure that is to see that the <Col N="1429" /> people who pay the money shall have the power to vote.  That right has in no way varied according to the sum they pay.  It means that the people voting have merely an interest great or small in the spending of the rates. In modern countries there has been a great development of that thing so dear to Labour parties&mdash;social services. In this country there is a tendency towards providing greater social services at the moment.  I do not say that there is anything wrong about that.  If the Government consider the moral well-being of the people, I cannot see what the purpose of this Bill is except to hand over the power to a very large number&mdash;an enormous addition to the register&mdash;many of whose interest in the rates is that they are potential beneficiaries.  It means that these new voters will not have much consideration as to how great the rate will be.  Voting will largely be a scramble to get a share of the money to be collected from the people who have to pay the rates.  I say that the attempt to create that spirit is one of the unfortunate results of a mentality where you have everybody hoping to have the machinery of local government used for the purpose of taking money out of other people's pockets and putting it into the pockets of those people who pay no rates.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said about universal suffrage for the Dáil, as far as these local government electors are concerned there is a limit to the power and control of the people they elected. Their power is limited to collecting and paying out the rates.  There is really no principle behind this Bill at all.  It is a suggestion that the power over the rates shall actually be put into the hands of people who are not themselves going to be affected by the payment of the rates.  I know that a whole lot of people think this is quite a splendid thing.  On examination anyone will see that there is a large element of inequity in the proposal that another body of people will come along, a body of irresponsible outsiders, and that while others will have to pay the rates, they will have no feeling of responsibility so as to see that the spending of these rates is done economically <Col N="1430" /> and that the services will be economically run, and the work well done.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this is a definite retrograde step, and the only purpose is, as everyone knows, to secure that the present Government, who are not satisfied to be the most supremely powerful Government in the world in so far as their control of the country is concerned, should also have power over those intermediate associations like local government bodies.  They want to have control in each individual area through the local bodies.  It seems to me most extraordinary the Government has come out openly to say that it is necessary for them that they should have their own creatures controlling those bodies, men who when the Government sing will dance, and when the Government cry will appropriately weep.  This is the policy pursued. This Government is going to be all-powerful, and the people in this country are to have no power except they belong to certain classes, because everybody knows now that we have in this country a Government who make their appeal to one class, and that the basis of their appeal to that class is that it is most numerous.  Now here having done the thing in general, they are really extending it to the particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to let this Bill pass its Final Stage without saying a word as to what I think the consequences will be.  I listened with attention to the discussion that took place on the Second Stage.  But defenders of this Bill throughout all its stages have sought to create an antagonism between old and young and to constitute themselves the defenders of youth and idealism. Fianna Fáil is going to trust the young people!  As I said before, that is all eyewash&mdash;pure eyewash.  The question at issue here is a question of ratepayers as against non-ratepayers and the contents of this Bill provides that a large body of persons in the country, who have no liability for rates at all, are going to have a final say as to what those rates are going to be.  I pointed out before, and I do so <Col N="1431" /> again, that if any charge could be made that the local authorities had defaulted seriously on social services, there might be some defence made for the final passage of this Bill.  No such charge, however, is made or has been made throughout the whole discussion. I think it is only right at this stage to consider this aspect of the question, that this Bill is going to regulate for the future the way in which the rates will be struck.</P>
      <P>I cannot but remember that one of the promises that the Fianna Fáil Government made at the last election was that there would be complete derating of land.  They have defaulted on that promise and they have, in substitution for it, undertaken to remit half of the land annuities.  Agricultural land remains liable for rates and what I apprehend is that the result of this Bill is going to be this, that whatever the people have been spared by the reduction of their land annuities will be taken from them, and probably a great deal more, in the rates that will be imposed by local authorities elected on the new franchise.  To my mind, that is wholly wrong because, as I pointed out before, if at any time a local authority, under existing circumstances, made up its mind that it could not afford to provide some desirable social service, it was open to the representative of that area in this House to put it up to the Government that, where the local authority was not able to afford the services, it was the duty of the Central Government to step in and fill the gap; and this House has repeatedly done that.  The Agricultural Grant was largely made for that very reason.  Its purpose was to make it possible for local authorities to provide social services they otherwise could not afford.  That was right. If a particular district, owing to exceptional circumstances such as agricultural depression as it exists at the present time, feels that it cannot afford to do all that it would like to do in the way of social services.  It is up to the Central Government, if they feel that this service ought to be provided, to provide for it out of national taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> There is another point which I do not think has been sufficiently considered. What difference is there between the authority of these local bodies and Dáil Eireann once they are both elected on universal suffrage? Suppose you have a body administering the affairs of County Kerry to-morrow, elected on the suffrage laid down in this Bill, and it comes into violent collision with the Minister for Local Government in respect of some matter relating to local affairs in County Kerry, what better authority vests in this House with reference to the particular conditions in County Kerry than vests in the local bodies? They are elected by the same electorate.  There is as much solemnity attaching to their election as there is to ours and I think that before many years have passed you will have a situation arising in which you will have 26 rival authorities to the authority of this House and will have people putting themselves forward with a very good show of reason for it.  I do not think that is a desirable situation.</P>
    <P>The last objection that has not been countered is that the result of this new Bill will be that every county council in the country will be turned into a museum for rodomontade&mdash;a museum because there will be more nonsense poured out on the county councils of this country than will be heard in any other country in the world.  The raiment of Caitleen Ni Houlihan will be torn into flitters by the Tipperary and Cork and Kerry and other county councils.  Robert Emmet, Wolfe Tone, the Fenians and everybody else will be required to form fours for the edification of the ratepayers of this country and it will be found before very long that the supreme qualification for election to a local body in this country will be the candidate's efficiency in thumping a tub at some street corner.  We had a good deal of that in the past and as I said, on another stage of this Bill, it is one thing to the credit of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government that by their influence they very largely put an end to that kind of claptrap in local bodies and the local <Col N="1433" /> bodies addressed themselves to the bread and butter business of administering local affairs to the best of their ability.  In my opinion, this Bill is going to bring us back to the same old stage and when Fianna Fáil is beginning to totter they will start passing resolutions of confidence in Eamonn de Valera.  All the same old worthless rubbish will be revived by this Bill, and, mind you, when it comes to adopting that course they will be adopting the right course because where you have men who have no interest whatever in the size of the rate their interest will be in the men who will make the most noise and we all know that perfectly well.  Any man who has had any experience in the public life of this country knows the weight that any person pulls who can go out and make a fine rousing speech at the cross-roads.</P>

      <P>I always hate opposing the Vice-President, who is always so polite and nice that it is almost a pleasure to co-operate with him in passing a Bill in this House.  As a matter of fact when the Vice-President stands up <Col N="1434" /> you can almost hear: &ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me now to distribute the prizes.&rdquo;  You feel the very homely atmosphere he introduces into the House.  I even think that some other Ministers might take a leaf out of his copybook.</P>
      <P>The difficulty I see is purely from the Vice-President's own position in this affair, and that is the question of responsibility.  It is to give responsibility I presume to the youth and, therefore keep them quiet, but it may react very considerably against the Vice-President as Minister for Local Government, because as he knows the local authority can hardly dot an &ldquo;i&rdquo; or cross a &ldquo;t&rdquo; without his sanction. The point I do not understand is that the Vice-President stated that he would like to apologise to the House and to his own Party for not introducing this a year ago.  Therefore it must have been very much uppermost in his mind prior to the general election, but we heard nothing at the general election about universal suffrage for local authorities.  We can do nothing here to prevent this becoming law.  I think it was 90 years ago that a speech turned a vote in the House of Commons in England.  It would never do it here.  At the same time I must congratulate the Vice-President on the wonderful way in which he introduced this whole measure.  As a matter of fact he is getting away with it nice and quietly, and smiling along gaily.</P>

      <P>I have only been tempted to intervene in this debate by the two speeches I have listened to from Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Dillon.  I do not think Deputy Fitzgerald claims to be a democrat.  I think many of his utterances in this House have displayed what one might describe as a contempt for democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Or that if the Deputy is democratic he is one of that peevish kind of democrats who believe in democracy so long as they are always getting their own way.  The other day we had the Deputy making a speech for the retention of the Seanad as a means of guarding the liberties of the people. <Col N="1435" /> Here we have the Deputy making a speech to-day for the retention of an outworn system of local election based upon a property franchise.  The sole purpose of the Deputy's case in that particular matter is the same as his case for the retention of the Seanad, namely that the Deputy's Party draws support from the property classes in the community, from the elements well endowed with this world's goods, and the Deputy wants to keep out of the democratic arena in this country all those people who do not come from the elements of the population that have not yet found out the Deputy's Party in the realm of political, social and economic activity, or who, if they know the Deputy's Party's policy in those respects, like it because it is one out of tune and out of step with the desires of the plain people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From Deputy Dillon one might have expected some different kind of speech. However, he was less enthusiastic about his federalism to-day than he was on the Second Reading of the Bill. Deputy Dillon speaks about Caitlín Ni Houlihan being torn to shreds and made to form fours with some other characters, real and legendary, in our history.  The Deputy is surely not telling us anything new from the point of view of the extent to which one can have political raméis in local authorities.  The Deputy knows or ought to know perfectly well the kind of resolutions that were passed by those local authorities when the Irish Parliamentary Party were in front of the footlights from 1888 or 1890 to 1914, 1915 and 1916.  There was an opportunity then for seeing the kind of snowballing resolutions that went around from one local authority to another, and there were many more local authorities then than there are now.  The Deputy abhors now the suggestion that a certain majority of a certain political colour on the local authority might pass a resolution of confidence in their President.  Perhaps they might spend their time doing something of more practical value to the local people, but Deputy Dillon ought to be the last in the world to complain about local authorities affirming their faith in certain <Col N="1436" /> political headmen in this country, because we can all remember the time when local authorities used to meet specially when any prominent member of the old Irish Parliamentary Party died; used to adjourn for quite a considerable period after his death, and the poor man was almost taken out of his coffin for 12 months after his death by the efforts to recall his magnificent service to his own particular political Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>He probably did give good service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, quite.  The Deputy is entitled, and Deputy Dillon is entitled to recall those services, but if it was right in the days of the old Irish Parliamentary Party what I want to ask Deputy Dillon is&mdash;what is wrong with it now?  I can see a good deal wrong with it, but I want Deputy Dillon to say whether it was right when the Irish Parliamentary Party used to do it and wrong when another Party proposes to do it.  Deputy Dillon's speech, as I said the last day, and Deputy Fitzgerald's speech too, contained the kind of case that was made against the extension of the adult franchise to the population of the country in respect of Dáil elections, the kind of speech that was urged in favour of the retention of the urban borough system as it existed in this country a hundred years ago.  You had then, apparently, as we must have now, Deputies such as Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Dillon standing up and saying that this question of electing representatives to Parliament is the kind of job that ought to be left to the property squire.  Keep on electing the squires was the viewpoint of many people then and Deputy Fitzgerald, while he does not make such an open case for the squire by name is, in fact, to-day backing a system of local government which is calculated to give an undue advantage to the propertied elements of the population, putting in an adverse position in relation to that propertied section of the population those who are not qualified to vote in local elections under the present system of franchise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated on the Second Reading, I could understand certain kinds of <Col N="1437" /> tests being applied to persons as a condition of voting.  I could understand, for instance, the worthiness of the citizen might be taken into consideration; I could understand his intelligence being taken into consideration; I could understand the general trustworthiness and integrity of the person being taken into consideration; but under the present system of local government we are not concerned about his worthiness, about his intelligence, about his trustworthiness or his integrity.  We are concerned apparently with only one matter, and that is that he has a property upon which he is entitled to cast a vote.  None of the other conditions enters into the matter.  He may have acquired his property in any manner, no matter how disreputable, and still the Legislature will give him a vote. That is the only condition they require fulfilled for the purpose of giving him a vote, namely, that he has sufficient property.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald says this is a case for giving the youth of the country, who pay no local rates or local taxation, a voice in the spending of public money.  Take the case of a family, a man with his wife and two sons.  Suppose the sons are 30 years and 35 years of age.  They live as a small community.  Perhaps the father is the ratepayer.  The mother votes in local elections on the strength of the father's vote.  Suppose the father and mother do not work because of infirmity.  Clearly in that case the sons are maintaining the household and it is out of their earnings the rates are being paid.  But Deputy Fitzgerald wants to give the father the vote, simply because his name happens to be in the rate-book. He proposes to disfranchise completely the person who earns the wherewithal to pay the rates.  Every family lives as a group, as a community, in a particular homestead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a head to the group perhaps it is a good reason for saying that the head of the group <Col N="1438" /> ought to be the lord of appeal in the house if there is any domestic feud. But why the head of the group ought to be treated as expressing all the views of the group in a matter in which the group might have very diverse views, I do not quite understand. The Deputy knows that in this country, especially in the last ten years, whole families have been sundered on social, economic and political issues.  In the last election one family in a certain constituency provided one member who stood as a Cumann na nGaedheal candidate and one who stood as a Fianna Fáil candidate.  What happened the head of the group in that case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, from the political aspect, the Party managers must not have been very careful.  As a rule, the whole family pay the rates.  The total income of the family is utilised in one way or another so as to make provision for the payment of the rates.  In my opinion, every member of the family ought to be entitled to cast a vote on the strength of his or her contribution towards the rates.  Deputy Fitzgerald would allow only one person to express a view on a matter of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the objection to allowing every member of a family over a certain age to express an opinion on local matters?  There is only one explanation of the Deputy's objection to a scheme of that kind, and that is that the Deputy's Party is appealing to a portion of the population which is numerically weak, and the Deputy believes that the more restricted the franchise the better the prospect he has of getting a bigger proportion of the votes.  That may be <Col N="1439" /> a very strong reason from the point of view of the Deputy's Party for opposing this Bill, but it is not a sufficient reason why people of 30, 40 or 50 years, who help to provide local rates, should be deprived of the right to express a view on matters of local administration.</P>
      <P>I think the case for widening the franchise in the matter of local elections is overwhelmingly strong.  Listening to this case being discussed in the House on its merits by the Minister and the complete failure of the Opposition to make any effective case against the Bill, one must be forced to vote for it because of the sheer inability of the Cumann na nGaedheal or the Centre Party to submit any convincing argument.  I believe if democratic government is to be strengthened against all the attacks made against it, you can save it in this and other countries by the widest possible diffusion of responsibility over the widest possible number of our citizens.  If this measure helps to diffuse responsibility, if it helps to impart a new sense of responsibility and a feeling of consciousness to those who have no votes in local affairs at the moment, it will be good from the point of view of the State as a whole and it will tend to healthier and perhaps cleaner administration.  It will help to introduce a better spirit in local administration than is possible under the restricted franchise which exists to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to confess that I am not, perhaps, 100 per cent. orthodox as an opponent of this Bill. If I were to look at the thing from a purely theoretical point of view, the Bill would rather attract me.  I dislike property qualification in principle and I dislike anything that postpones the imposing of responsibility on the young people once they come of age. It is not so much for the theory of the thing that I oppose this Bill, it is because of its probable practical effects.  Deputy Norton has just said that there is going to be a great advantage in developing a sense of responsibility in young people by <Col N="1440" /> giving them this franchise.  But can it be honestly said that there has been anything in the experience we have had of adult suffrage in Parliamentary elections to make us think that that argument carries much weight, to make us think there is any great deepening of the sense of responsibility in young people because they happen to get the vote?  My feeling about this Bill is that it is going to enfranchise people who have, in fact, however it happened, less regard for economy than the people who at present have got the franchise.  I say this is not the moment to make an experiment which is likely to lead to increased expenditure.  Moreover, the class that is likely to be enfranchised is more likely to be subject to political influence than those already enfranchised. However that state of things came about, or whether it is likely to be permanent, is another matter.  Very likely the aim of the Bill is to assist in turning the county councils of the country into what might be called political bodies, mixing themselves up in political matters, and passing flaming resolutions on things which do not concern them at all, instead of conducting their affairs in a businesslike way.</P>
      <P>I think that Deputy Norton has overstated, altogether, the alleged injustice to the younger members of families in the present state of things.  I very much doubt if Deputy Norton would allow his own sons or daughters an equal say with himself in the expenditure necessary on household matters.  I do not know that there is anything outrageous in the suggestion that the head of the family should have more say in the fixing of the rates than the junior members of the family. Deputy Norton has spoken of divisions which often occur in the family when one member is of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and the other of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Such an incident occurred in connection with our own Party, when Deputy Belton stood as a Cumann na nGaedheal candidate and his brother stood as a Centre Party candidate.  I do not see that an illustration of that sort carries us much further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> I want to make clear in opposing this Bill that I do not do so because I am opposed, in principle, to extending responsibility to youth, or that in principle I am attached to a property qualification.  As a matter of fact, the qualification for the municipal franchise is not a property qualification. That is proved to be true in my own case.  Deputy Norton is fond of contemptuously alluding to me as a man of property.  As a matter of fact, I have no vote in the municipal elections because I have not got the right kind of property.  The qualification is not properly a property qualification. I think this Bill should be resisted, because I think the effects of it will be bad and also for other reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The speeches delivered upon the Final Stages of this Bill have been very largely repetitions of speeches delivered particularly on the Second Stage.  Deputy Fitzgerald, indeed, said that he could not find anything new to say on this occasion and, therefore, I think, I need not take up too much time in replying.  I want, however, to emphasise one or two points I made on the Second Reading.  One was that Deputies sitting on the opposite side of the House never lost an opportunity of impressing upon everybody when they were in power how anxious they were to trust the people and to give them every opportunity of exercising the franchise and showing what confidence they had in them when they did what they thought was the right thing. They seem, however, since they changed from these benches to the other side of the House, to look at this matter from a different point of view.  They no longer trust the people. People are not only to be refused the local government franchise but Deputy Fitzgerald thinks that they should lose the remaining franchise, which proves a trouble to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Norton is right when he says that he has doubts of the democratic views of Deputy Fitzgerald. So far as we are concerned, we are quite content to trust the people even to a further extent so far as the franchise is concerned.  I certainly am strongly of that opinion.  I am prepared to put <Col N="1442" /> my experience against that of Deputy MacDermot, who cannot claim to have the same knowledge of local government affairs as I have.  I say, from my experience, that young people are more inclined to practise, and to be out for, economy in administration than probably 75 per cent. of the older men &mdash;men of 60 years of age and older that I have known.  I have known some men of that age to be the greatest squanderers of public money, and to have less regard for the pockets of the ratepayers, especially when it came to paying unduly large and generous salaries to officials, than the younger people would have.  My experience is that the younger element set themselves more against the spending of money in a wasteful way, in the views of the people who elected them, than do men of the older type.  Another reason why I am in favour of the extension of the franchise is that possibly now that we have our own parliamentary legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister passes away from that, is it not possible that the reason for his experience is that under the existing system only exceptional and virtuous young men like himself were elected?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there was any exceptional virtue or ability responsible for my selection.  I was dragged into public life, through membership of the Dublin Corporation, by the merest fluke, because they could not get anybody else to come forward that would satisfy them.  So I was very much pressed into the service, and that is what is responsible, for my miserable fate, and possibly for my remaining so long in public life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of people have tried to undo it at elections.  I do not know how many municipal and Parliamentary elections I have been through but I have survived them all&mdash;for my sins, I suppose.  I am not speaking to-night merely from my experience of municipal life and local authorities.  I am speaking of what I watched happening <Col N="1443" /> since I became a Minister and I think I can say with truth that the younger people are more practical and less liable than older people to pass flaming, flamboyant, rodomontade resolutions, of which Deputy Dillon spoke. Deputy Dillon is associated with that influence in his family for generations. He was brought up on it.  He is more familiar with it, very much more so, than I am; and so if there is to be rodomontade it will come from those who carry on the old Parliamentary tradition and from nobody else.  The young people to-day have got away from all that kind of sentiment and feeling; they are far more practical and sensible.  They have not time nowadays on local bodies for that kind of thing.  Deputy Dillon also thanked Cumann na nGaedheal for having, I think he said, ended political discussions and that kind of rodomontade resolutions at public boards.  They ended them by ending the public boards&mdash;that was their method of ending them.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>My belief is that with the older generation the flaming resolutions and the rodomontade will have died out; that the younger people have so many practical problems relating to public health and the management of the big and responsible affairs associated with local government to-day, there is no time for them, generally speaking.  There is a fair proportion of the older people who have been on public boards for 25 or 30 years still on them, and it is from those that these long-winded resolutions usually emanate.  Talking about rodomontade during the last week or <Col N="1444" /> two, and even in the last two days, we have had exhibitions from the other side of the House which even the days of the old Parliamentary Party could not beat, and that is saying a good deal.  Another point made against this Bill is that we are giving the franchise to a section that does not pay the piper.  All the people, young and old, whom we propose to enfranchise under this Bill, whether they pay directly as holders of property or not, pay rates. Whether they are earning or whether they have an income they have to pay rates.  If they only pay rent for a room they have to pay a certain proportion of the rates.  It comes out of their pockets in some form, directly or indirectly.  It is no longer true to say that it is only the man who hands over the cheque to the rate collector who pays rates.  Everybody pays rates. Young people are bound to have as much interest as any other person in the community in what happens inside these local authorities.  The local authorities in their own way legislate for them, and have a very vital part to play in the life of every member of the community.  Whatever age they are, once they are sensible enough to take an interest in local affairs, it is my belief that they ought to be entitled to the franchise and, at any rate, entitled to take an interest in and be elected on a local authority.</P>
      <P>I am very dissatisfied, indeed, that those who have the franchise at present do not exercise it to a greater extent.  We have had discussions in this House which were published in the daily press with reference to the franchise and to the necessity for people using the franchise.  These discussions do not seem to have had any good effect in urging those who have the franchise at present in Dublin City or Cork City to use it.  That is a very bad thing.  I hope that when this reform is put into operation there will be a much greater interest taken in local affairs; that there will be a livening up of interest in the whole matter, and that the activities of the young people will encourage and induce people to make greater use of the franchise.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim Bhreise ná raghaidh thar £800,000 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1934, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig Choimisiún Talmhan na hEireann (44 agus 45 Vict., c. 49, a. 46, agus c. 71, a. 4; 48 agus 49 Vict., c. 73, a. 17, 18 agus 20; 53 agus 54 Vict., c. 49, a. 2; agus 55 Vict., c. 48; 3.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £800,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1934, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Irish Land Commission (44 and 45 Vict., c. 49, s. 46 and c. 71, s. 4; 48 and 49 Vict., c. 73, ss. 17, 18 and 20; 53 and 54 Vict., c. 49, s. 2; 54 and 55 Vict., c. 48; 3 Edw. 7, c. 37; 7 Edw. 7, c. 38 and c. 56; 9 Edw. 7, c. 42; Nos 27 and 42 of 1923, 25 of 1925, 11 of 1926, 19 of 1927, 31 of 1929, and 11 of 1931).</P>
    <P>This Estimate is necessitated by the decision of the Government to grant a moratorium to annuity payers for the first gale of the present year and substantial reductions in the annuities for the second gale.  The annuities payable under the Land Acts 1923 to 1931 are paid into the Land Bond Fund and constitute the source of the half-yearly payments of interest on the Land Bonds issued for the purchase moneys of estates under these Acts.  The Estimate is for the purpose of enabling the Land Bond Fund to meet the half-yearly payments of interest on Land Bonds due on the first of July next and on the first of January, 1934, and consequently the only annuities taken account of in the Estimate are those under the Land Acts 1923 to 1931.</P>
    <P>The moratorium for the annuities payable on 1st May this year is estimated to amount to £535,000.  The full amount collectible for the gale is £557,300, but of this sum not more than 4 per cent. (i.e. £22,300) is expected to be collected&mdash;the balance having to be contributed by the Exchequer.  This sum will, however, not be lost as the Government propose to recover the amount with interest at 4½ per cent. by charging the tenant-purchasers Funding Annuities to repay same over 50 years from 1st May, last.</P>
    <P>The reduction of annuities for the second gale of this year is estimated to cost the Exchequer the sum of £283,580.  The full amount payable for that gale is £557,300 which by the <Col N="1448" /> Government proposals in new Land Bill will be reduced to £273,720.  The deficiencies arising in the Land Bond Fund in the complete year ending 31st March, 1934, are arrived at by adding the estimated cost of the moratorium for the first gale of 1933 (say £535,000) and the reductions for the second gale (say £283,580) making a total deficiency for the year of £818,580. The excess over the amount of the estimate (i.e. £18,580) will be met out of the sum provided under sub-head J of the original Land Commission Vote advance to meet deficiency of income from Untenanted Lands purchased under the Land Acts 1923-31.</P>
    <P>It should be clearly borne in mind that this Estimate does not involve any ultimate demand on the taxpayer as it will be more than off-set by the receipt in November and December next of 50 per cent. of the annuities under the Land Acts prior to 1923 formerly paid to Great Britain and of the first half-yearly instalment of the Funding Annuities estimated to amount in all to £1,165,000.  If this sum of £800,000 were not provided the deficiencies arising from the funding of arrears and revision of annuities would, under existing legislation, fall to be met out of the Guarantee Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given notice to move: &ldquo;That the Supplementary Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; The principle that is involved in this Estimate raises, perhaps, the biggest issue which will come before the Dáil in connection with the Estimates.  It is presented to us in the form of a concession to the farmers. While agriculture remains, and it must remain in present world conditions, the main source of productive employment and wealth, this Vote may be said to represent the opinion of the Executive Council as to the capacity of agriculture in so far as its overhead charges are concerned; but it must be borne in mind that this concession to farmers is being made at a time when a very big reduction is made in the amount of the grant which is voted in relief of rates.  If we allow, for the sake of argument, that this particular concession meets the necessities of the <Col N="1449" /> case, all agriculturists are not land annuitants.  Consequently, one would expect that the Government would make some provision for those who are not in the position of getting any advantages from this particular concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why I propose to send this Vote back is that in our view what is demanded in this case is in excess of the capacity of farmers or of agriculturists to make at the present time out of their industry.  The very fact that the Government considers that agriculture should bear the whole of the cost of the annuities up to May and June of this year, that is, the May and June annuities of last year, the November and December annuities of last year, and the May and June annuities of this year, forces us to the conclusion that the Executive Government considers that agriculture is in a prosperous condition.  Funding these annuities up to date and starting the concession which the Government proposes to grant in new legislation is only a temporary relief.  It could be justified if there were prospects in the immediate future of a restoration of the prices which agriculturists were accustomed to receive during the past few years.  It must be remembered also that during those years the protagonists of the present Government in power and the Government when it was in Opposition, were continually, here in the House and outside on the hustings, focussing public attention on the difficulties of agriculture, on the necessity of relieving the industry of agriculture of every possible burden, and pointing out that taxation, land annuities and rates, at the then standard of charges which prevailed, were beyond the means and the subsistence which could be got from land in this country.  In the short space of 12 months conditions have worsened very considerably for agriculture.  The other day, here in the House, the Minister for Agriculture informed us of a question which had been put in the British House of Commons regarding the price of fat cattle for some period in May&mdash;the 25th of May&mdash;and the price per cent. live weight of first quality fat cattle was announced for <Col N="1450" /> the 17th of May as 40/10 as compared with 49/10 per cwt. for the corresponding week in 1932.  That is very interesting; but of much more moment to agriculturists here in this country is what the price of fat cattle was in the Dublin market on an equivalent date. On the 18th of May, 1933, as reported in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; of the 19th of May, the average price was 27/6 per cwt., that is approximately 33? per cent. less than the British price.</P>
    <P>As far as this Estimate is concerned, the mere funding of the May and June annuities shows clearly that the Government considers that this industry is capable of bearing, having regard to those prices, the burden of the annuities up to date, because the so-called concession does not run and will not run until the Bill which was introduced this evening is passed into law and then it would only operate as and from November and December next. The price of fat cattle at corresponding dates in previous years should be taken into account.  In 1932 it was 44/- on the Dublin market and, while the Minister was at pains to emphasise the big drop of 9/- from 49/-, we have to consider here the drop of 16/6 from 44/- and, at the same time, to bear in mind the fact that in the opinion of the Executive Council the annuities can be paid in full because the mere funding of them is only a temporary relief and they are going to be paid and must be paid according to law if this estimate and the Bill that the Minister introduced this evening passes into law.  Consequently, I move that this Estimate be referred back for further consideration.</P>
    <P>Here in the House within the last week references were made to what were called doleful speeches contributed by certain members from these benches.  I should say that a statement by the Minister for Agriculture would be taken as a fair sample of an optimistic statement on the other side of the House.  Here are some of his remarks as reported in the &ldquo;Sligo Independent&rdquo; of the 3rd of June of this year:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to assure you,&rdquo; declared Dr. Ryan in conclusion, &ldquo;that the Government is not unaware of the <Col N="1451" /> condition of the people.  We know that times are bad; that the farmer finds it hard to make ends meet; that the labourer finds it hard to get work, and that the shopkeeper finds it hard to get his money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not a very optimistic statement&mdash;a statement of fact, a statement which, taken in conjunction with this Vote, means that the annuities for the current time are going to be paid, if not to-day on some other day, because they are to be added to the future payments which will fall to be made by tenant purchasers and they are made at a time when the price of one particular article sold in the Dublin market&mdash;probably the most important article we produce&mdash;has gone down from 44/- per cwt. to 27/6 in 12 months.  Going through the list of the exports of agricultural produce in this country, that is not the only indication of a reduction either in output or in price.  This morning I was given figures which showed that for ten months the export of horses amounted to 3,565.  For the year 1931, which was a bad year, the exports amounted to 10,000.  The figures in respect of the various other items show either a contraction or a huge reduction in price.  Let us take a particular item which is of consequence to the families of farmers, the families of labourers and of the smallholders throughout the country&mdash;the raising of poultry and the export of poultry.  For the month of April this year the exports amounted to £225 as against £3,568 last year.  Those figures, which are compiled and published by the Government, indicate a state of affairs which would justify a reconsideration of this Estimate.  We increased the exports of fat cattle in the month of April from almost 9,000 which we exported last year to over 11,000 this year.  The price received last year for the 9,000 was £168,000 approximately.  The price received this year for the 11,000 was slightly under £150,000.  Store cattle show a reduction in receipts of £100,000; milch cows from £377,000 to £277,000; milch cows and springers from £77,000 last year to £17,000 this year.  Calves are <Col N="1452" /> up from £43,000 to £68,000.  There is a lesson to be learned from that.  If we are going to give other people the opportunity of rearing the stock which was formerly reared, and out of which money was raised, in this country, it is going to be serious for the main industry of the country.  The export of horses for the month of April last year was £63,000: this year it is £35,000.</P>
    <P>Assuming for the moment that a certain majority of the people in this country want the Government's policy, want to do what the Government wishes to carry out in connection with this whole scheme, surely there has been time in the course of 12 months to consider what further efforts might be made in respect of the industry of agriculture.  No class of the community, no order of the community, has suffered as agriculturists have suffered during the last 12 months.  Their losses are not confined to themselves.  The losses which are borne by agriculture affect other classes of the community, because if there is an interruption in the circulation of money in the main industry there must be a reduction in the money in circulation in the secondary industries of the country.  In consequence, I say there is now attempted to be imposed upon this industry in the country burdens beyond its capacity to bear, burdens which will result in making the condition of a certain number of men and women hopeless, and which will place whole families in a position from which it will ultimately be impossible to rescue them.  The losses are not confined to any one class or one order.  The losses will not be equated as between the different individuals in a certain order in the community.  If by reason of these imposts people are driven to the wall&mdash; or to the lunatic asylum&mdash;a very serious responsibility will rest on the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>I move to send back this Estimate for reconsideration, because all the facts, all the figures, all the information that we can get about the home and export trade, are such as to convince us that the agricultural <Col N="1453" /> industry cannot bear any land annuities during this year, and that in fact if the Government were wise, far-seeing and had a comprehensive policy, they would relieve them even of rates.  Accordingly I move that the Estimate be sent back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting Deputy Cosgrave in proposing that this Estimate be referred back.  I do not think it will be at all necessary to make a very long speech in support of that intention.  We have had at various times in this House within the last ten or 12 months the difficulties of the farmers put in various shapes and forms.  One does not have to rely on figures to demonstrate the farmers' losses.  Statistics and figures are altogether unnecessary to the ordinary farmer to verify his losses.  One has only to take a short holiday in any country district, and the most unenlightened member of the community will get sufficient evidence to satisfy him that the conditions in agriculture are more than depressed.  Deputy Cosgrave a moment ago read some statistics proving a loss in cattle.  The loss as represented by statistics does not at all show the losses that the ordinary farmer has suffered.  The loss is anywhere from £4 to £8 a head, possibly more in some cases.  In Kerry certain classes of cattle are I should say not practically but altogether unsaleable.  Certain classes of smaller cattle in districts like Kerry are absolutely unsaleable.  This Estimate proposes to fund certain moieties of the annuities in such a manner that the farmer will have to pay.  A certain number of us on this side of the House have always advocated during the last 12 months that during the continuance of this economic war the farmers should not be asked to pay any annuities at all; that it is an injustice to make the farmers pay an annuity under present circumstances.  Conditions have got much worse since we made that proposition last year and early this year. The Minister for Agriculture himself, speaking last November when there was only a 20 per cent. imposition of duty by the British, estimated the all-round loss on cattle by farmers at £4 <Col N="1454" /> a head.  That was before the imposition of the 40 per cent. duty. It does not need any great effort in mathematics to calculate what their loss is now when there is a 40 per cent. duty.  One does not need to elaborate the loss on sheep and other animals, and other agricultural products, to demonstrate that the conditions of the farmer are such at the moment that if an effort were made to collect the annuities from them it would lamentably fail.  That being so, it is unjust that the Government should ask for these annuities at all.  There is another reason which makes the farmer's position even more deplorable than it was.  Not alone has the price of his produce gone down but his local rates are higher this year than they were the previous year.  There is a considerable addition to the local rates of the farmer by the lessening of a certain grant.  Altogether his conditions are such that it would be impossible for him to, in any circumstances, meet the annuities if asked for them, and we consider that it is unjust for the Government to ask an impossibility of the farmers.  We have advocated, and we advocate now, that no annuities should be asked of the farmer during the continuance of the economic war.  We reiterate that.  We maintain that we find it impossible to support this Estimate and we have to demand that it be reconsidered.</P>

      <P>On similar Estimates and Supplementary Estimates in this House I have frequently attempted to relate the position of the townsman to the position of the agriculturist.  I do not intend to do so now, but I would like to stress particularly the plight in which the agriculturists find themselves. In my constituency there are about 5,000 farmers.  I have on many occasions had complaints from my constituents as to their position since the present Government took office. The Minister read so rapidly that I was unable to take any notes of his statement, but I gathered from him that there is a considerable deficiency, or an anticipated deficit, of something like £283,500.  If my figures are wrong, that is due to the rapidity with which the Minister read his statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an asset&mdash; there is £800,000 of a deficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>He suggests that this deficit will be made up by the Exchequer. The Exchequer is a very comprehensive term.  The Exchequer derives all of its revenue from the ordinary taxpayer.  In this instance, the balance is to be made up by the Exchequer and a very considerable sum of money is involved.  This Government promised us, before they took office, that they would reduce taxation by at least £2,000,000 without inflicting&mdash;to quote their own words&mdash; hardship on any section of the community. It certainly cannot be suggested now that hardship has not been inflicted on every section of the community. We have the farmers telling us every other day that they are unable to pay their rates.  We have local bodies, county councils and others, protesting that they cannot collect the rates.  In some cases a mandamus has been issued against local bodies to compel them to strike the rates.  When these councils refused to strike the rates they were not actuated by any dishonest motives; they felt that the people they represented were unable to pay those rates.</P>
      <P>The Government, before they took office, placarded the country with leaflets and pamphlets declaring that if and when they got into power they would give farmers full de-rating. According to the view expressed to me by agriculturists in County Cork, they would prefer to be fully derated and, under present circumstances, they would prefer particularly to be put on a level with their northern neighbours rather than be called upon to pay rates which they cannot afford to pay and which the industry is not capable of paying.  In that connection, the Cork County Committee of Agriculture wrote to me a couple of weeks ago asking me to bring before the House a resolution which they passed unanimously, and which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That we, the Cork County Committee of Agriculture, having invited the members of the Cattle Trade Association and agricultural organisations in the county, as well as <Col N="1456" /> others interested in the industry, to discuss the present deplorable position which has arisen since the imposition of tariffs, after careful consideration are of opinion the time has fully arrived to ask the Minister for Agriculture and the members of the Dáil in the City and County to use influence with our Government to take up negotiations with the British Government for the reopening of the markets by the removal of tariffs, for the disposal of our surplus produce at present on hands, with a view to enabling the people to meet their liabilities in the present depression and to help to retain the services of the farm labourer so as to enable him to maintain his family, thereby reducing the unemployment list, which is a most serious issue for the Government and State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the face of the last dozen words of that motion we have a suggestion coming from a Government official that the farmer should substitute his relatively well-paid male labour by female labour at a cheaper price.</P>
    <P>We are told that one of the first interests, almost the paramount interest, that this Government has at heart is the interest of the agriculturist. It must be regarded as a truism that increased expenditure by this or any other Government will mean increased taxation.  The money that goes into the Exchequer is paid by the ordinary taxpayer.  The Minister for Finance has not an inexhaustible well from which to draw capital for this and every other kind of State expenditure.  It is time we called a halt to this kind of legislation in which with one hand we almost cripple an industry and, with the other hand, we attempt to succour it by this method of supplementary estimate.  The farmer has suffered many losses that possibly may not be known to many members of the House.  We know that many small farmers around the western seaboard combine fishing with farming.  This year has been a very disastrous year for fishing.  On some portions of the coast around Cork County, where farmers used to derive some small revenue from fishing, the receipts are absolutely nil this year. <Col N="1457" /> On the inland fisheries, largely because of the fact that these fisheries are, in the main, particularly in my county&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the main body of citizens, whether they are small wage-earners or salaried earners, find that because of the stress of economic circumstances they are getting into debt or are in debt, then, whether you call this country Saorstát Eireann or a Republic, the fact of the matter is there is no liberty for anybody.  If the Minister listens to Deputies on his own back benches, if he listens to the advice <Col N="1458" /> he will get in the different Departments, it must be brought home to him that the conditions of the country at the present time cannot last.  There is nothing but hardship crawling through front doors and back doors.  Whether one occupies a mansion in the country or a stores, or a retail shop in a town, there is nothing but economic desolation; and this is the time that the sum of £800,000 is to be borrowed. Borrowed on what?  Borrowed on bankruptcy.  How this is to be reconciled with raising the actual money afterwards is going to be a problem that will tax even the Executive Council.  Everywhere one goes, and has the privilege of seeing confidential returns kept by those who keep their business in a scrupulous and businesslike way, knows there is nothing but loss&mdash;real loss.</P>

That is the condition in which one finds people in the country, whether engaged in agriculture or in ordinary business, living.  I presume at a later stage we will have a full-dress debate on this question.  I honestly and sincerely say that in speaking here to-night I have no desire to make a Party speech.  My desire is to help people through their distress and hardship. My action is taken not with the intention of weakening the economic war from a national point of view, or to suggest that the knee should be bowed in surrender to any nation or people in the world.  My object is to bring to home to the House what is not fully known in Dublin and that is the terrible distress existing in the country. In this, as in everything else, the Government are becoming subject to the influence of officialdom and bureaucracy. They are living only in a Dublin atmosphere and forgetting altogether about the rural atmosphere.  £800,000 is to be borrowed on bankruptey.  The farming community, on whom the towns exist, are contributing hardly anything to the towns now.  The <Col N="1459" /> towns which in the past contributed to a very large extent to the advancement both politically and economically of this country are anæic and in decay.  Nothing seems to be done; no hope seems to be held out.  Sense seems to be cast aside.  At one time I read in the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; a leading article which stated that the economic war was going to bring back nationality to this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I confess to being a little puzzled by Deputy Cosgrave's motion with regard to this Estimate. I do not know whether it is due to inexperience, or to my being dense, but I feel in need of further elucidation as to the logic of this motion and also, as to its practical effect.  I understand this motion is rendered necessary by the decision of the Government to give an amount of relief, to the farmers which consists in funding annuities not due to economic war, but before the economic war.  If support of Deputy Cosgrave's motion means that one is declaring one's belief that this sum is absolutely insufficient I would certainly support it.  I stated, all along, ever since the economic war began, that there should be no exacting of annuities in any shape or form whether arrears or current annuities so long as it continued. In point of fact, we will have on the Land Bill, I presume, an opportunity of going into this question in all its aspects and proposing such amendments as may be deemed proper.  Meanwhile, as regards this Estimate, would not referring it back be rather in the direction of stopping the relief proposed even though it is insufficient and only partial relief.  Is it logical to do that? <Col N="1460" /> I may be mistaken in my outlook and I am open to conviction.  At present I do not see what is the sense of referring the Estimate back for reconsideration and I should be glad of some enlightenment on this subject.</P>

      <P>The reason for sending back the motion is that we consider £800,000 insufficient as matters stand. The Government propose to collect in November and December next half of the annuities in respect of the Act of 1923 because this refers to that Act. Our contention is they should not be collected and that that sum of £260,000 should be added to his Estimate.  For that reason we propose to send it back for reconsideration.</P>

Possibly if the Minister read the figures a little more slowly and clearly, if Deputy MacDermot will allow me to say so, he would not have fallen into the pardonable error that he has fallen into. Our object in bringing forward this motion is that the farmers shall not be asked to pay any portion of the annuities during the current year, whether funded or non-funded or in any other fashion.  This motion does not deal with annuities before the economic war; it deals with the gale of annuities which became due in June of this year.</P>

      <P>I look upon this matter really as part and parcel of the whole Government policy.  You bring the condition of affairs in this country into a desperately bad state. You find that people cannot pay their debts and that the Government itself cannot, out of its current revenue, carry on.  Then you go and you adopt, <Col N="1461" /> and you urge other people to adopt, the very cheapest and worst of all methods of getting out of a difficulty. You say: &ldquo;You have a little credit left, go and borrow&rdquo;.  That is the position into which farmers are by force being put at present by the Government. They are in effect being forced to borrow to pay their debts. The Government say that the farmers owe them this last gale of annuities. They admit that the farmers are not in a position to pay the amount due under the last gale.  Then they say: &ldquo;Go and borrow; we will lend the money&rdquo;, because that is what it comes to.  The farmers are going to have these annuities, as they had other annuities before, like a millstone tied round their necks for many years to come.  Personally, I am not quite clear as to how many years are going to be taken to pay off the principal, interest and sinking fund on this current gale of annuities which is in effect a borrowed sum of money.  Whether the time be long or short the persons who owe the annuities are compelled to borrow the money from the State at 4½ per cent. for the purpose of paying them.  The object of the motion is that they should not be asked to pay this sum at all, certainly not asked during the currency of the economic war and during the currency of the economic conditions in this State which the policy of the present Government has brought about.  The Government have taken from the farmers in the shape of annuities something like £1,600,000 this year and put it into the Exchequer.  That is money which, in my opinion at any rate, the Government have absolutely no right to take and that is an opinion which I hold as confidently as I can hold any opinion.  It seems to me that, if one thing is perfectly clear, it is that no Government has any right to the land annuities.  The Government of this State has no right to them; the Government of Great Britain has no right to them.  Neither the Government of this State nor the Government of Great Britain, who are merely in the position of agents, have got a right to intercept the payment of annuities going from the person who owes the <Col N="1462" /> annuities to the holder of the stock, who represents the person who lent him the money which he is repaying.</P>

I submit that that is a relevant argument.

This gale of annuities should not be funded.  It is admitted that it cannot be paid.  It is admitted that the Government have reduced the agricultural population to such a state <Col N="1463" /> that they cannot pay their way.  It is admitted that the Government have reduced agriculturists to a state of penury.  Now they come to this House under these conditions and say, in effect: &ldquo;It is quite true we have ruined these men; we have prevented them paying their debts; now we are going to fasten round their necks this load of debt which is to remain for many years upon them.&rdquo;  That is a position which we say the Government should not take up, which we say no Deputy who takes the slightest interest in the welfare of the farming community should support, and, at any rate, we intend to oppose it.</P>

      <P>The Government, in my opinion, would be well-advised to make other provision for the annuities besides asking the farmers to pay them, because the farmers are unable to pay.  There may be some who can pay their annuities out of the reserves of former years, but there is not one farmer who can pay them out of the earnings of the past year.  There were no profits made in the past year; there were only losses.  Even if the Government did not collect the annuities that would not remove the hardships of the farmers in my constituency, but it would help to lessen their sufferings.  The complete abandonment of the collection of rates, taxes and annuities would not compensate any farmer for the loss he has incurred in the economic war.  There is not one farmer that I know of but would gladly pay all these if old prices could be restored.  We are told that prices are bad in Great Britain.  The prices there rule the prices in this country, but before we get these prices we have to pay a 50 per cent. tariff on our stock.  It leaves us 50 per cent. worse off than the British farmer.  For every £1 the British farmer pays us for our cattle we only receive 10/- Therefore farming in every sphere is, as I pointed out, being carried on at a loss. You cannot have it otherwise with these high tariffs against all our agricultural produce.  Therefore I wish to support the sending back of <Col N="1464" /> this Estimate to the Government so as to increase the amount of relief to the farmer who is fighting this economic war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind I think it outrageous for the Government to ask the farmers to pay annuities under present circumstances.  Before the last election the members of the Government went around telling the people that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power we would not have to pay any annuities.  Then they modified that by saying that the farmers would have to pay the annuities but that the Government would keep them.  Then the economic war started and the farmers have been suffering severely since.  My annuity for my holding is £27 16/2.  On the 20th June I shipped 13 cattle off my farm.  I was charged as a tariff on these 13 cattle a sum of £56.  How many times have I paid my annuities in the matter of these 13 cattle alone? The present Government wants, they say, to make this country prosperous but what they really are doing is killing the people who want to work. The people are being ruined by these tariffs.  The more the farmer produces the more he has to pay.  Then they tell you about the home market.  As long as we have a surplus to sell that the home market cannot absorb, the home market is very little use to us because the home market price is governed by the price that we get for our exports.  I submit that any man who is trying to live out of farming at the present time is paying his annuities three times over in tariffs. It is very unfair for the Government to ask the farmers to pay annuities pending the end of the economic war. The Government say they will not surrender. They will not surrender while the principal industry in the country is being ruined.  How will you build up a nation if you bankrupt the farmers?</P>

The townsmen want the farmers' money and trade.  If the farming industry, the principal industry in the country, is not prosperous the towns cannot be prosperous.  If you carry on the economic war you will bankrupt the farmer and the people in the towns will be bankrupt when the farmers have no money to pay them.  There is not one bit of use in the Government's saying &ldquo;we will collect the annuities.&rdquo;  Because of the inability of the farmers to pay it will be impossible to collect them; the money will not be there.  The Government talks about funding the annuities of November and December, and May and June at 4½ per cent.  That is only tightening the millstone around the farmer's neck for he is not able to pay and it is up to the Government to relieve him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been just a little mystified by this Estimate introduced by the Minister.  The Minister told Deputy Haslett to-day in reply to a question that for the year ending 31st March, 1933, the total amount of land annuities collected under the Land Acts, 1923 to 1931, was £448,603.  In that case why is he asking for £800,000 now?  Is he acting on the assumption that no annuities will be paid, under the Acts 1923 to 1931, on the second gale this year?  I think the Minister stated also that the total annuities collected under the Acts up to 1923 was £1,165,000.  If you deduct £448,000 from that £1,165,000 you have over £700,000 left.  I was not able to follow the Minister because he read the figures so quickly and I was not able to get them clearly.  I certainly do not understand how he arrives at the figure of £800,000.  I think he also stated that a moratorium was granted in respect of annuities for the first gale this year.  Notwithstanding that there is a moratorium in existence, his Department is sending out demands for annuities during that period.  Within the last fortnight I saw numbers of such demands and it was only to-day that I saw others.  I cannot at all understand why these demands are being sent out during the period when the moratorium was supposed to be operating.  Apparently it is the Minister's intention to fund this £800,000 at 4½ per cent., plus, I assume, a half per cent. for sinking fund, so that the unfortunate farmer will have to be paying that annuity with 5 per cent. in <Col N="1467" /> respect of this £800,000 which is to be funded.  In other words he will have to pay a higher annuity than was ever paid under any Land Act so far.  That annuity of 5 per cent. is enormous, considering the present state of the money market. The Minister by virtue of the arrangement he is making in connection with the Vote on this annuity proposes to enhance the annuity.  This arrangement is in every sense inequitable because the annuitant will be asked to contribute £800,000 for the purpose of funding the arrears of money due by the farmers over certain periods and the farmers themselves who are not annuitants and who are paying, some of them, very high rents at present, will have to make their contribution for the purpose of assisting other farmers.  There are many farmers whose holdings are not at all covered by any existing Land Acts and yet these farmers, notwithstanding the loss they have suffered up to the present, will be asked to contribute still more in order to enable the Minister to carry out this funding arrangement for the purpose of assisting a certain limited small number of farmers who purchased under the Land Acts of 1923 to 1931.  The arrangement on the face of it seems rather an extraordinary one and I feel that it is an arrangement that it will be very difficult to administer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister for what period he proposes to fund these arrears.  Is the period to be 50 years?  I think he did mention 50 years on one occasion in this Dáil. Is it to be for 50 years or 60 years or 80 years?  If it is to be the full period to which the Land Act of 1923 is to run, then it should be possible under existing circumstances to fix a very much lower rate of interest.  I agree with Deputies who have spoken that under existing circumstances the farmers are unable to meet even the half annuities plus whatever additional annuity will be fixed under this funding. As it is, in many counties the collectors find considerable difficulty in gathering in the rates and in many counties the collectors are unable to <Col N="1468" /> get the rates from many farmers because of the losses they have suffered so far in consequence of this unfortunate dispute between ourselves and Great Britain.  It seems to me that a very strong case has been made for increasing the amount asked for in this Estimate to £1,000,000 in existing circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister also in his reply to clarify the position in regard to the payment of the annuities under the Land Act of 1923. Demands have been sent out to a certain number of people to pay these annuities, but there are many other people who acquired land under the Act of 1923 who have not been asked to pay either rents or annuities.  I cannot understand why such a discrimination has been made, and I should like the Minister to indicate in his reply if it is his desire that those people who did acquire land under the Act of 1923 should pay their annuities even for the period in respect of which a moratorium was supposed to be in existence.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister in his reply to state if he is aware that the Land Commission have sent out within the last fortnight quite a number of demand notes all over the country.  Down in Mayo, hundreds of receivable orders have been received within the last 14 days from the Land Commission asking the people to pay their rents.  Assuming that they have paid their rents, I should like to know what is the intention of the Minister.  Does he propose to refund that money to the tenants?  I think he should make that quite clear in his reply.</P>

      <P>It was not a bit if wonder that Deputy MacDermot was somewhat hazy about the discussion after listening to Deputy Cosgrave and <Col N="1469" /> Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, because, I suppose, he has a right to suppose that two gentlemen who were in the Government for ten years should know at least a little as to what they were talking about.  One would think that we propose to collect £800,000 from the farmers instead of making arrangements not to collect £800,000 from them.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney can plead that he is a little deaf and did not hear me rightly, but at least he is able to read, and he should have been able to read the note that was passed round to all the members of the Dáil setting out the terms of the Supplementary Estimate.  It reads quite plainly, at any rate, in the copy which I have, that £800,000 is provided to meet deficiencies in the collection of annuities payable under the Land Acts from 1923 to 1931 and to enable payments to be made to the Land Bond Fund under Section 6 of the Land Bond Act of 1925.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was talking about bondholders and that we should be meticulous in passing on the money to England in order that the bondholders should be repaid.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Roddy at least should know what the Land Bond Act of 1925 is.  If there is a deficiency in that Land Bond Fund the bondholders, who advanced the money to the Free State Government to purchase the lands from 1923 to 1931, cannot be paid. They should also know that care was taken at that time to ensure that that situation could never arise and that, if it threatened to arise, the deficiency in the Land Bond Fund was to be met out of the Guarantee Fund.  Again, any deficiency in the Guarantee Fund is met out of the grants which the Government give in relief of local rates.  So that, in effect, refusal to allow the passage of this sum of money means that the Deputies who vote for its refusal want one or other of two things; either they do not want the bondholders who advanced the money to the Free State Government for the purchase of the land to be paid, or they want the money to be paid out of the grants that usually go to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" /> It is no wonder that Deputy MacDermot was a bit amazed.  I was amazed myself when I heard all the rubbish that Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney talked about this matter.  It is as plain as a pike-staff to anybody.  Deputy Roddy referred to the moneys that were collected.  Replying to Deputy Haslett this morning I gave him the figures of the moneys collected under the Acts prior to the Treaty&mdash;the moneys that came in under the old British Land Acts.  We are speaking here of the deficiency that will arise in the payments under the Land Acts from 1923 to 1931.  That deficiency, when you take in the whole of the gales of May and June&mdash;or the funding of that&mdash;plus half the gale due in November and December, will amount roughly to £800,000. That has to be met.</P>

      <P>This Bill is the outcome of representations that have been made by the Cork Corporation and by a large number of Cork citizens generally that some steps should be taken to provide compensation for a number of tramway employees who were disemployed in the year 1931, indirectly as a result of the operations of the Electricity Supply Board.  The House will remember that the provisions for the granting of compensation in respect of disemployment as a result of the operations of the Electricity Supply Board were very limited.  They were limited to cases in which the employees who were disengaged as a result of the work of the Board were actually engaged in the generation of electricity in generating stations.</P>

      <P>The tramway system in Cork city was worked and operated as a part of the undertaking of the Cork Electric Supply Co., Ltd., which owned and operated both a tramway undertaking and the business of generating electricity for consumers in the City of Cork.  While the company, as a whole, operated successfully up to the time of the acquisition of its electricity undertaking by the Electricity Supply Board, the tramway, which was not operated by the Electricity Supply Board, did not prove correspondingly successful from the financial <Col N="1472" /> point of view, and had, in fact, been carried on to some extent out of the resources provided by the lighting side of the business.  Consequently, on the taking over of the lighting undertaking by the Electricity Supply Board the tramway undertaking would have been closed down had not the Irish Omnibus Co., Ltd., made arrangements to operate the tramway system for a period of six months to the 30th September, 1931.  It was the intention of the Irish Omnibus Co., Ltd., to acquire in the meantime an adequate fleet of omnibuses to provide the necessary services on the withdrawal of the trams.  The trams ceased to run on the 30th September, 1931, and since then omnibus services have been provided by the Irish Omnibus Co,. Ltd.  At a meeting held on the 23rd August, 1932, the Cork Borough Council opposed a resolution which proposed, amongst other things, that the Council should be authorised, for the purpose of providing a moiety of the compensation, to levy a special rate to produce a sum not exceeding £1,500 per annum for 20 years.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health did not raise any objection, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce was satisfied that in the exceptional circumstances of the case special consideration should be given to the question of endeavouring to provide compensation for those men.  It was accordingly decided that compensation should be granted, the amount necessary to provide compensation to be borrowed from the Central Fund and to be repaid in annual instalments over a period of 20 years, one half by the Cork City Council and the other half by the Electricity Supply Board.  The arrangement that was come to was that those who were not less than 50 years of age or who had not less than 15 years continuous service on the 30th September, 1931, should be granted compensation.  If any question should arise as to the allocation of the compensation within these terms it is provided that an advisory committee be set up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce consisting of three members to be nominated by the <Col N="1473" /> Minister, two members of the Cork Borough Council and two members of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>It is necessary, therefore, to provide for legislation to enable the funds to be advanced, to authorise the Cork Borough Council and the Electricity Supply Board respectively to provide for the repayment of any moneys so advanced, and for other objects of an incidental character.  It is estimated the amount required to provide for compensation on the foregoing basis will be about £36,000.  A contribution of, roughly, £1,500 per year from the Cork Corporation and the same sum from the Electricity Supply Board will cover the required amount.  I should explain that originally the intention of the Minister was that this compensation should be given only to employees who had over 15 years completed service, but subsequently, owing to further representations being made, the number of years was reduced to 12.  I think that is the limit to which we ought to be asked to go in this matter, because the case is quite exceptional.  No other class of persons who were disemployed indirectly as a result of the operations of the Electricity Supply Board have been given compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compensation has been restricted under statutory conditions to persons who were employed directly in the generation of electricity and whose undertakings were taken over by the Electricity Supply Board.  Although the Cork tramways services were run under a local electricity company, to a certain extent the business was separate and there is the point which I have indicated that in any event the service would probably have closed down.  The point which appealed to the Minister and the Executive Council in providing compensation in these special cases was that these tramway employees, after a long period of service, often find themselves in a position that they cannot obtain other employment.  What is more serious, they are not, if they have spent a long period of service on the trams, able to undertake the ordinary work which they would get.  The Cork Corporation and Cork citizens generally, having asked that we should get the Electricity <Col N="1474" /> Supply Board to make this contribution, it was that consideration that prompted us to make this arrangement.  The total number of employees of the Cork tram service was 184.  The number over 50, or with 12 years' service and upwards, is 109. There is still a small number outside.</P>

      <P>The question is, are we justified in assuming that a man of 40 years of age and with a service of, say four or five years, would be entitled to compensation?  In the first place, if he were employed in any other undertaking where he lost his employment under similar conditions, as individuals have lost employment through the operations of the E.S. Board, he would not have got any compensation.  In the second place, the question arises whether that man, as a result of his length of service, is in any way incapacitated, whether he is too old or is at that stage that he is not adaptable for other employment. The Minister went into the question very fully with the representatives of the tramway men and with the representatives of the Cork Corporation and, having first agreed to make these provisions for people who had 15 years' service, he ultimately reduced it to 12 years' service.  I do not think the Government would be justified in going to the E.S. Board, which is an independent statutory body and which has its own obligations, and requesting it to go further than it has already consented to go in this particular case.</P>
      <P>This is a special case and I think that, taking all the circumstances into consideration, the Government have prepared a fairly satisfactory scheme. It may not be perfect, but on the other hand when one considers the scale of compensation that has been given generally by the E.S. Board and the fact that a large number of these ex-employees of the Cork Tramways Company must be in a position to find employment&mdash;they are not too old and their length of service has not precluded them from taking up other work&mdash;I think the scheme is fairly satisfactory and I will ask the House to accept the principle of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have had some representations from the secretary of the tramwaymen in Cork about this matter.  I asked for particulars regarding the length of service and the ages of the various men, but I have not got them yet.  The Minister has given us a fair outline of the situation so far as 109 men are concerned.  I would like to know whether he has made any estimate of what the cost would be of making provision for the other 75 men.  I was informed quite recently that one man had over 11 years' service.  You always got that sort of case where a line is drawn.  It does appear, on the face of it, to be a peculiar sort of situation in which the Government has acted very generously, not providing any of the money nor acting in any capacity except as intermediary.  If I have interpreted the Minister's statement correctly, the costs of this compensation are to be paid by the Corporation of Cork and by the E.S. Board.  I would like to know if that is correct.</P>

      <P>Some time ago in a moment of spiritual exaltation, and financial megalomania, the Minister for Finance said that he could borrow at a price we could not borrow at when in office.  The statement is quite correct, but the Minister did not give all the facts.  When he was speaking the interest in the British money market was one-half per cent.  When we were in office it was five or six per cent.  First-class paper could be had in London for a half per cent. this <Col N="1476" /> year and sometimes for a quarter per cent.  The man who gets up and says, under these circumstances, that he can borrow cheaper than his predecessors must think he is dealing with children, or else he is a child himself.  What does the Government want to make out of this transaction?  They are asking five and one-half per cent. for their money at the present moment. The banks would not charge such a figure.  I presume some Ministers have overdrafts.  I suggest that they should have an interview with their bank manager as many people have to have, and then they could find out if they were being charged five and one-half per cent. on their overdrafts. Yet we have the Minister for Finance telling us that he can borrow money cheaper than we could when we were in office, when the interest is a half per cent. to-day as compared with five and one-half per cent. when we were in office.  And that is what he now proposes to charge the unfortunate tram men.  The Minister has given no information how he proposes to amortise this sum.</P>

      <P>The Electricity Supply Board are paying £1,500, the Cork Corporation £1,500, that is £3,000 to discharge this £1,980.  Apparently the Cork Corporation took the big view and wanted to settle.  Let us put the full sum at £6,000.  We would, then, have £42,000 and that at five and one-half per cent. is £2,310 per annum. Is there any objection to that figure of £2,310 to do the whole lot?  I suggest that in all decency the Ministry ought to act in this matter in a manner fair to all persons concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no necessity to go into the history of the legislation of the last few years in connection with the <Col N="1477" /> acquisition of the trams under the Electricity Supply Act of 1927.  At that time it would be possible if the acquisition of the Cork undertaking had been then undertaken to have got it at a very much cheaper price.  It had not been envisaged that the tramway company concerned would be taken over.  The shares then on the market were at a discount.  If it had been envisaged that such a situation would arise, then provision would have been made, and ought to have been made, for those men.  It is not open to any member of the House to increase expenditure, but if this sum of £1,980 is not sufficient to relieve 75 persons and their families of their grievance, then, in all the circumstances, as there is sufficient money to provide for it, allow that to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some information from the Minister.  Is the Minister's final view expressed in what is contained in section Part III of the Bill?  that the employee must be not less than 50 years of age, at the critical date or must have been employed in the tramway for a continuous period of not less than 12 years.  I want to know from the Minister has any representation been made to him, in the last week or two, or if any conversation took place between him and representatives of the 75 persons not provided for under this Bill?  I have been led to believe that if, and when, the Cork Corporation increased their grant the Department of Industry and Commerce were prepared, also, to suggest to the Electricity Supply Board, or other contributory body, to increase their grant in order to compensate the 75 persons not provided for under the Bill.  If that is so, I think there would be little difficulty and the Minister would be able to get his Bill as an agreed measure through the House.  I quite appreciate the Minister's point that there must be some finality, whether it be ten, 11, 12 or five or six years of service, because if it were six years you would always find some person who had five years, 11 months service that would be cut out of the provisions of the Act.  Still there must <Col N="1478" /> be finality.  I pressed the Minister on this because in a letter in the Cork Press it was stated that the Cork Corporation were agreeable to increase their contribution, that is to increase it to £1,500 per annum for 20 years. But in doing so, they insisted that the Government should use their good offices in the direction of finding the money to compensate all persons who would be displaced.  The understanding, as far as I can gather was, that those men should be compensated at so much per head per year according to the services of the men.  A man of one year's service would, of course, not get as much as a man with two years and a man of two years' service would not get as much as a man of three years and so on.  I would like some information from the Minister on that point.  If that is not made clear I would have to put some amendments down for the Committee Stage.  There would be no necessity for that, and there could be no objection raised, if the other course was adopted and the whole 184 persons benefited under the Bill.  They are all members of a union which proclaims to the four winds of Eireann: &ldquo;All for each and each for all.&rdquo;  It is the principle of those persons who will benefit under the Act that they should help their weaker brethren not provided for under the Bill.  So I ask the Minister, before offering any further criticism, will he state if any conversation took place within the last week or two with him, or officers of his Department, and if any understanding was arrived at with the Cork Corporation, to the effect that if and when the Cork Corporation would place further money at his disposal, he would be prepared to secure compensation for the 75 persons who are not provided for under the Bill.  I should like the Minister to answer because I have some other criticisms to offer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared now, in view of the action of <Col N="1479" /> the Cork Corporation last evening, to do this?  I think the Minister must agree that the citizens of Cork have been very generous indeed because when everything is said and done, there was no onus on the Cork ratepayers to pay anything.  There was certainly an onus on the Government and certainly some onus on the Electricity Supply Board and, to an extent, a good deal of onus on the old Cork Company.  It was through Governmental action that these men lost their employment.  It was because the Cork Electric Lighting and Tramways Company's system was taken over by the Electricity Supply Board that these men were discharged.  The Minister must know the whole history of the matter. I think he will agree, and that the House will agree, that that was very generous on the part of the Cork citizens, who have no responsibility whatever but who felt that these men had been unjustly treated. They have decided to levy themselves for the next 20 years to compensate these men.  I think there should be some gesture on the part of the Government, in view of the attitude taken up by the Cork ratepayers to go a little further.  Deputy Cosgrave has already pointed out that the sum necessary is a mere bagatelle compared with what the ratepayers and others are prepared to do.  I would urge the Minister, as the sum is a relatively small one, to go the whole hog and compensate these men.</P>

      <P>That hypothesis is just as good as the other.  The scheme put forward is very satisfactory, the Minister says.  When you come to find out who are the architects of the satisfaction, you find the Minister and the Government delightfully conspicuous by their absence.  The Cork Corporation is asked to put up £1,500 per annum; the Electricity Supply Board is to be asked to put up an equal sum.  The Government's contribution to this financial marriage between the Cork Corporation and the Electricity Supply Board is to the extent of the Minister's speech delivered on the Second Reading of the Bill.  That is the amount of the Minister's presentation to this financial marriage between the Electricity Supply Board and the Cork Corporation in order to provide some compensation for the ex-employees of the Cork Tramways Company who have lost their employment directly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tries to argue that it is indirectly.  They have lost their employment directly as a result of State action in taking over the Cork Electric Lighting and Tramways undertaking.  Recently there was a Bill going through the House known as the Railways Bill, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce told me, in reply to a speech which I made on the Second Reading, that the Government were giving, or rather forgiving, the railways company a sum of £280,000, or over a quarter of a million, legally and morally due by the railways company; that they were permitting that sum to remain with the railways company as the Government's presentation to the railways company on entering what the Minister described as a new era. The Government were prepared to give £280,000 to the railways company as a good start for the Railways Bill, but the Government are not prepared to give what I am assured amounts <Col N="1481" /> only to £6,500, in order to provide compensation for the 75 ex-employees of the Cork Tramways Company, who will not get compensation under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis of compensation, as set out in Section 9 seems to me to be the product of a very curious mind.  It is proposed that a person of 50 years of age with one year's service will get compensation, while compensation is to be denied to a man of 49 years of age who has 11 years and ten months' service.  That is not taking an extreme case, because in fact there is a man who was in the employment of the Cork Tramways Company and who had 11 years and ten months' service.  That man is going to get no compensation, but an employee of over 50 years of age with one-tenth of his service is going to get compensation.  I put it to the Minister that it is quite impossible, if any kind of reason or logic is going to be depended upon for a defence, to justify a scheme of compensation which denies a man of over 40 years of age compensation, although he has 11 years and ten months' service, while giving compensation to a man a few years older who had only a fraction of his service.  I should like to hear the Minister upon that particular conception of justice in relation to the actual facts of these cases, as I am sure they are known to the Minister.  As Deputy Cosgrave stated, there is sufficient money provided by the E.S.B. and the Cork Corporation to pay compensation to all the persons who lost their employment as the result of the closing down of the Cork Tramways.  But the Minister gives no contribution whatever and, apparently, his only purpose in connection with this Bill is to introduce it in this House, defend it in the Seanad, secure its signature by the Governor-General and charge five and a half per cent. on the money advanced to pay this compensation.  I say with Deputy Cosgrave that five and a half per cent. on the money advanced to these two bodies is an outrageous rate of interest to charge.  Last year the publicity managers of the Department of Finance and the &ldquo;Irish Press,&rdquo; the Party newspaper, came out with <Col N="1482" /> streamer headings and leaded type to show what the credit of the State was. They told us that the Minister for Finance had been able to float bills to the extent of £2,000,000 and that they were subscribed at a rate of interest of approximately two per cent.  Of course, they were subscribed at a rate of interest of two per cent. as the banks were only giving one-half per cent. to their depositors.</P>

He says it himself, and his newspaper says it for him in language that seems to me very like the flowery silver-tongued language used by the Minister himself.  There is a definite admission on the part of the Government that they can get money at two per cent.  Everybody knows that it can be got even cheaper than two per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which are very interesting documents, I think he will find that so far as the Minister for Finance is concerned he is a sort of financial magnet.  He can attract money at almost any rate of interest but he proposes to charge 5½ per cent. on the money advanced to pay compensation in these cases.  That is an outrageous proceeding.  That rate of interest is going to be paid by the Cork Corporation or <Col N="1483" /> by the Electricity Supply Board.  The 75 men could get compensation under this Bill if anything like a reasonable rate of interest were charged by the Minister for Finance to the Cork Corporation and the Electricity Supply Board.  If the Government were open to be satisfied with a reasonable rate of interest instead of the usury which is manifest in this 5½ per cent. interest then the people who have lost their employment could get compensation. As the Minister admitted, he was putting up this money at 5½ per cent.  He said so quite proudly. If the Minister is entitled to feel a public benefactor in extracting 5½ per cent. for the money advanced under this Bill, then every rapacious moneylender in town is entitled to have a monument erected to him on the same principle, namely, that he can squeeze interest out of people who are unfortunate enough to borrow from him.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the Cork Corporation have been generous in this matter.  The Electricity Supply Board have come into the matter and have acted in an exceptionally generous way when you consider the niggardly way in which the Government are looking at the problem.  Each of these bodies has put up £1,500 for 15 years but the Government have done nothing as a contribution to it One thing they might do is to put up a sufficient sum estimated at £6,500, which would provide compensation for the 75 people who will not get compensation under this Bill.  If the Minister is not prepared to advance this £6,500 for the purpose of securing a satisfactory settlement for these people, then I suggest that he should drop this tax-gatherer role, charge a reasonable rate of interest and not the 5½ per cent. which he announced his intention of charging these people in order to provide compensation for the persons affected by this Bill.  That is not an unreasonable request to the Minister.  I am sure that request will be supported by all Parties in this House and by the Deputies in his own Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that he should look into it, reduce the rate of <Col N="1484" /> interest and make it possible to compensate these 75 people.  The Minister says this will last 20 years.  He could not hope to borrow at two per cent. during the whole of the 20 years.  But if the speeches of the Minister himself mean anything, the period that we are passing through just now is one of the most trying periods in the next 20 years.  Judging from the Minister's speeches, the problem in the future years will be to keep one's self from being drowned by the milk and honey that will be plentiful everywhere. The problem in the future will be a problem of plenty.  One thing that is to happen to this country in the future, again interpreting the speech of the Minister for Finance, is the terrible prospect of a deluge of milk and honey drowning everybody and wiping out the historic Irish nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add my plea to what has been said by Deputies Cosgrave and Norton in this matter?  I had the pleasure of accompanying the deputation to the Minister and I want to say that what he said here this evening is quite correct.  The Minister gave us no undertaking.  He said that if the Cork Corporation would look into the matter again, and if they were prepared to show their faith in the case of the men by putting up an additional sum of money, then the Government would be prepared to look into the matter again.  That is what the Minister said while definitely stating that no undertaking would be given. The Cork Corporation has taken the course suggested.  In view of that new situation I suggest that the Minister ought to be in a position between now and the Report Stage to consider the matter sympathetically.  A great deal of the case that could be made for the inclusion of 70 odd men who are out was made by the Minister himself in his statement when he pointed out that a very large number of the men concerned would not, in any event, be suitable for ordinary work.  I think that was fairly clearly demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Minister. Certainly, more than one or two of <Col N="1485" /> them are men who are not fitted for heavy work They are not in good healthy condition.</P>
      <P>While I realise that it is very difficult to adjust a matter of this kind and know that when a rule is made and line drawn there are bound to be hard cases, still I think that the case of a man who has given 12 years' service, with the exception of one or two weeks, is really a hard case.  The Cork Corporation has agreed to provide this money for a period of 20 years.  In times like the present when rates and taxes press rather heavily on every section of the people I think that it is a fairly clear indication of what the people of Cork desire should be done in this matter.  Deputy Norton has suggested that the Minister might put up the £6,500 necessary to complete the compensation.  That would be a solution of the matter.  As an alternative he might, by a rearrangement of the terms under which the advance has been made, enable compensation to be paid to the men.  If he finds that impossible, perhaps he might consider doing this in the event of there being any difficulty on the part of the E.S.B. in providing the money.  I think it would not be too much to ask the Minister to prevail on his colleagues to accept responsibility for the sum that would be necessary to provide compensation to the men.  I put that point to the Minister.  In the Cork Corporation there are very many interests and yet this proposal was passed unanimously last night.  The Corporation have put on the backs of the people a heavy burden.  They have accepted that burden, willingly, in order to make it clear that the people there are prepared to end this matter satisfactorily by providing the necessary sum to clear up the whole matter.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Murphy has stated, I met the tramwaymen.  I did not give them any undertaking that I would do anything in this matter.  I found out subsequently that when Deputy Lemass was dealing with the Corporation he got a definite <Col N="1486" /> undertaking that when this bargain was made it was to finish the matter and that there was to be nothing more about it.  The original proposal was to give compensation to those who had 15 years' service. Then it was reduced to 12 years' service.  There was a definite understanding between the Minister and the Corporation that that was a bargain and that it was to be implemented here.  One would imagine, from the tone of some of the speeches, that the Government were inflicting some hardship on these men and giving them particularly bad terms. It must be remembered that no other individual or body of individuals who lost their employment indirectly and who are employed otherwise than in a generating station have got compensation.  The former Minister for Industry and Commerce stated quite definitely from these benches that the Electricity Supply Board could not possibly carry on its operations and pay compensation to all the interests which were involved in one or other of its operations.  That was admitted in the House and on two separate occasions Bills were passed to regulate the position regarding compensation.  In none of these two Bills was there any advertence whatever to the position of persons in the same position as the Cork tramway employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should know that the Cork case was a very unique case.  There was no other case handled by the Electricity Supply Board with the same features as the Cork case.  It was the only case in which they were catering for both lighting and traction and it was demonstrated that, whilst the traction side was run at a small loss, the lighting undertaking made up for that loss, and the two combined were a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Anthony and his colleagues had every opportunity of getting that stated in the Bill or Bills at the time they were passing through the House.  He speaks of a special case.  There are hundreds of special cases all through the country.  The <Col N="1487" /> position taken up by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce was agreed upon, that the undertaking could not possibly afford to pay compensation in all cases and, even in the cases where the House considered that compensation should be paid, we know that it was very meagre indeed.  In many very deserving cases it was very meagre indeed.  Therefore, Deputies should remember that, were it not for the sympathy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, these proposals would never have come before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>It has also been suggested that the Cork Corporation had no responsibility at all in this matter.  These people were employees of a certain company and if there were any obligation to the employees it should be on their normal employers, I suggest, and not on the Electricity Supply Board, who were able to show quite clearly that these employees had no legal rights whatever and no statutory claim whatever to compensation or pension.  We recognise that the case was exceptional, but I doubt whether it is a good principle.  This debate shows clearly that it is extremely foolish for a Minister to take up a special case and bring it before the Dáil, because, when he has achieved a certain amount of agreement outside, and secured agreement between the two parties that a certain proposal will come before the House and that that will complete the matter, every Party in the House thinks it fitting and well to get up and say that more should have been done.  The Electricity Supply Board would never have done this had not the Government intervened.  The Cork Corporation, as I say, through the Lord Mayor, seemed to have given a definite undertaking that nothing further would be asked.  That is the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot hold out any hope at this stage that the Government can go back a second time and give further concessions.  Deputy Norton has wasted a lot of time, a Chinn Comhairle, and I do not propose to follow him into his discursions about the Minister for Finance, who seems to be the Deputy's particular <i>bête <Col N="1488" /> noir.</i>  I only wish to say that the position is somewhat different in the case of an annuity repayable at five and one-half per cent. over a period of 20 years from the financial transactions over a few months, to which the Deputy has referred.  I have no doubt whatever but that the annuity over 20 years at five and one-half per cent. is reasonable in all the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  The Deputy also dragged in, quite irrelevantly, the question of the railway company.  The railway companies are in the position that they are a very substantial undertaking on which, apart altogether from the capital invested in them, as the manager recently pointed out, 12,000 men are depending for their existence.  If the railway companies go out of business it means that 12,000 men lose their employment.  It is of some consequence to the State that these men should continue to be employed.  In the case of the Cork tramways, they were closing down.  They had closed down, in any event, and were not going to carry on.  The tramway company themselves had no obligations to the men and did nothing about it.  If there were obligations, ethical or otherwise, it is the proprietors of the tramway company, I think, who had these obligations in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need delay the House further.  I cannot hold out any hope of a reconsideration of these terms.  I have not described them as generous but as a settlement into which the Government, somewhat reluctantly, entered in view of the very strong representations made to them from Cork City and of a definite proposal from the Cork Corporation. When it is assumed in this House that the Government has some further responsibility in the matter, I should like to point out that we had no responsibility at all.  It was simply through the sympathy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that this <Col N="1489" /> Bill has ever reached the light of day. Were it not for his intervention in the matter, and the approaches of the Cork Corporation to him, the Bill would never have come to pass.  In the circumstances, I think we should be grateful for what has been done and that we should remember that other people have been definitely disemployed as a result of the operations of the Electricity Supply Board and that the House on two occasions definitely decided that it could not allow these people to get compensation. When, therefore, we make a definite agreement, I think the House might be expected to accept it in that spirit.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That for carrying out the provisions of any Act of the present Session to amend and extend the Damage to Property (Compensation) Acts, 1923 to 1926, it is expedient:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of the compensation and costs awarded in respect of certain injuries to property which occurred in Saorstát Eireann within certain periods, save in so <Col N="1490" /> far as such compensation is payable by the issue of securities; and</P>
    <P>(b) to authorise the creation of securities to be issued in lieu of cash in payment of compensation in certain cases, and to charge on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof the principal and interest of such securities and the expenses incurred in connection with the issue thereof.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to point out that on the Second Reading I stated that the cost of the Bill would be £150,000.  I meant that it was anticipated that the cost of the Bill in the current financial year would be about £150,000.  It is estimated that the total cost of the Bill will be in the neighbourhood of £350,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say. £150,000 may not, in fact, be spent this year.  The Bill has been somewhat delayed, and the possibilities are that the courts will not be able to determine a considerable number of applications by the end of the year. There is one definite figure which I am able to give, and that is an expenditure which will immediately arise because of the repeal of Sections 9 and 15 of the original Act.  Those were sections, as the House will remember, which debarred persons of Republican sympathies from securing compensation for damage done to their property.  Under those sections my predecessor withheld payment in a number of cases in which the court had reported in favour of the applicants. The amount of the payments so withheld is £50,000.  That £50,000 will be immediately discharged, the court having already heard the cases, and the judge having reported that compensation to that amount should be paid.</P>

    <P>(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other Act, no payment shall be made after the 30th day of September, 1934, in respect of any compensation awarded by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission or by a decree made under the Principal Act, and any such compensation or part of such compensation not claimed and paid before that date shall be irrecoverable.</P>
    <P>(2) No payment shall be made by the Minister for Finance after the 30th day of September, 1934, in respect of any loss or damage which was the subject of a report made before the passing of this Act under Section 15 of the Principal Act or under Section 5 of the Indemnity Act, 1924 (No. 40 of 1924).</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 9, to delete the figures &ldquo;1934&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;1939 or after three years from the date of the death of a person to whom such compensation was awarded, whichever of these dates is the earlier.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The date in respect of which it is proposed to stop any payment for compensation or any part of compensation as mentioned in the Act is 30th September, <Col N="1493" /> 1934.  I take it that this Bill will not become law before 1st August, possibly later even than 1st August, so that normally when we are considering a question of reconstruction, restoration of damaged property or anything of that sort, that leaves very little over 12 months for the getting of plans, specifications and tenders, and the acceptance of contracts.  I should say that not much more than half an ordinary building would be constructed in that time, except in the case of the smaller house.  In the case of any fairly considerable dwelling house or other property of that sort it is unlikely that it would be possible to reconstruct it within the period, so that the date as it stands is not a fair date if it be simply a question of giving notice.  I have had some experience of that myself, and I should say that it would take 18 months, from the time of giving instructions, to construct and go into the house.  It sometimes happens that there is a lapse of time between the issue of the last certificate and the date for payment of it, and if we take that into account I should say that the period might run very close into two years. It may not absorb the whole of it, but it would certainly take 18 months to give even fair notice.  If that be the intention that date is rather early.</P>
    <P>That is not so much the subject of my amendment as the fact that in certain cases persons who own property at present may have no immediate intention of reconstruction or anything of that sort, but their heirs or successors might; or, if we were to take a more extreme case, the present conditions do not lend themselves to people making up their minds about buildings.  I have put down the year 1939, which gives five years from this date.  No mention has been made of any limitation during the last ten years since the first Act was passed. A limitation of time ought to be put in and I put in a period of half that which has run.  The section says:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in any other Act, no payment shall be made after the 30th day of September, 1934, in respect of any compensation awarded by the compensation <Col N="1494" /> (Ireland) Commission or by a decree made under the Principal Act, ...</P>
    <P>This is an extension of the original Act and, so far as the necessity for reconstruction is concerned, the same principle does not run through this Act as ran through the Compensation (Ireland) Commission or the previous Act.  It is not mandatory now upon reconstruction.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the first day that reconstruction was not an essential feature.  While we are giving generously with one hand, it is not good form to say in respect of other people who have been without these dwelling-houses for so long that we will only allow them to get compensation up to, but not after, the 30th September, 1934, or even part of the compensation. The other portion of the amendment deals with a case where compensation was awarded to an individual and a successor enters into possession of the property.  In that case the period is limited to three years so that the successor would make up his mind within three years as to whether or not he would reconstruct the property.  I think the amendment is reasonable. It is much on the lines of the suggestion I made on a previous stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is quite correct in saying this is the first time on which any mention of a definite date for the completion of reconstruction was made in the Dáil, because on 9th November, 1928, the Minister for Finance said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Since that date no interest has been paid, and as it has been decided by the Supreme Court that the awards are discretionary, we are considering whether it would not be proper to intimate to those who have obtained them that unless reconstruction is begun by, say, the 31st March next some proportionate deduction will be made from the amount of the award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the decrease appearing under sub-head B, for post-Truce damage, is concerned it is not possible to apply that pressure, but I think we will ultimately have to <Col N="1495" /> intimate that if those who hold the awards will not begin the work of reconstruction at some reasonable date it may be necessary to ask the Dáil to authorise some penalty.&rdquo; (Official Report, Vol. 26, cols. 1838-9).</P>
    <P>I quite appreciate the circumstances of the case which Deputy Cosgrave is endeavouring to meet and I must say I have, personally, a good deal of sympathy with those circumstances; but at the same time, I think 1939 is much too remote a date to fix.  I suggest that we might fix June of 1936, making that as the ultimate date.  I would be prepared to go so far as that to meet the Deputy.  It scems to me that the next successor in a case like this will have to take some steps on his own initiative to compel the reinstatement to be begun if he wishes to secure the benefit of the compensation award.</P>
    <P>I think there is some fault with the manner in which the amendment has been drafted.  As it reads, I am advised, it would make it impossible for us to pay any compensation to the successor of a person who died in 1926 or 1927.  If the Deputy is satisfied to fix, say, 30th June, 1936, and if he withdraws this amendment I will bring in an amendment on the Report Stage which will include that as the ultimate date and I will endeavour to meet the position which I think he wishes to cover in the last part of the amendment. I am not certain that it is going to be easy to meet that position.</P>

      <P>I have not disclosed to the Minister what I really had in mind.  I am not certain that no matter what is done it will meet one of the cases I have in mind.  The date the Minister mentioned gives 18 months in which to make up one's mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will understand that preparing plans, specifications and all these things will take at least 18 months; that is, from the date of the order to the architect until the last certificate is paid.  These <Col N="1496" /> certificates are paid regularly on the instruction of the architect, but I cannot remember the exact date upon which the last certificate is payable, whether it is issued when the building is completed or alternatively it may not be issued for some two or three months after the building is completed. I think that is the usual form in the case of some contracts.  The person giving the order for the building runs some little risk.  I think 1936 is a very early date; it really gives only 18 months.  I suggest it might be extended for a year or two years.  I do not think there are many cases.  I think the number of cases is comparatively few.</P>
      <P>There is one case that came under my own notice.  It has reference to an insurance company.  Nobody has sympathy for an insurance company, but in this particular case the insurance company, directly the damage was done&mdash;and it was done during the Black-and-Tan war&mdash;paid at once in cash.  They entered into possession of the claim, went before the Commission and were awarded something like £100 less than they had paid, but with the condition of reinstatement attached.  The first person who got the money built elsewhere than on the spot and up to a couple of years ago the insurance company had not got paid.  I always thought that that was a very great injustice and I suggest to the Minister that if it is not settled, and I am sure he has heard of it, it ought to be settled in all decency.  It is one of these cases in which it was alleged if one were to depart from strict precedent one would open the door, but in my opinion there was no precedent being established in that instance.</P>

      <P>I know of one very substantial case which the Deputy possibly has in mind.  It was referred to here in a general way.  I do say the circumstances in that case deserve sympathetic consideration.  We all know what the circumstances are.  I am not certain that in the other case there is the same ground for sympathy. As to the particular cases, there are 84 of them.  In 18 of these reinstatement has already commenced.  In the remaining 66 nothing so far has been done.  The amount of money involved is considerable&mdash;over £90,000.  As the Minister for Finance indicated in 1928 a considerable time has elapsed since the awards were made to those persons. Involved in that is that the contemplated reinstatement must be on the plan made some time ago, and consequently, the extension I now propose to meet, the position the Deputy has put before the House would represent a concession of nearly three years.</P>

      <P>Possibly the present terms of the section might be amended to make the three years the nett time at the disposal of the persons compelled to build.  As the section stands at present, it would mean three years would have to cover claiming of the payment of the award.  I think that is as far as I can go to meet the Deputy <Col N="1498" /> and I feel that I am even straining the position to do that.  If the Deputy withdraws the amendment I will bring in an amendment that will extend the time to three years and make it really available to the claimants for reinstatement and endeavour to meet the situation which is covered in the last point of the amendment.</P>

      <P>There is a point that ought not to be overlooked in connection with this sum of money.  If it were 66 cases it would mean £65,000 or less.  If by reason of that investment people are induced to remain here spending several hundred pounds a year it would be a good investment. That was a part of these reinstatement conditions.  That seems to be harsh.  Even if these large sums have to be insured the spending of that money, apart altogether from income tax, is a sound proposition.</P>

      <P>Again the Deputy says that the one thing that is going to ensure the spending of the money is the fear that if it is not spent in a definite period the claimant would lose the title to it altogether.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was first introduced as a private measure in 1929.  It was considered on Second Reading and referred to a Select Committee.  The Select Committee held a number of sittings and heard a great deal of evidence and in December, 1931, that Select Committee reported back to the House.  The Dáil was dissolved shortly afterwards, and that necessitated the Bill being reintroduced. Before very much progress was made the Dáil was again dissolved, and the Bill had to be reintroduced.  Subsequently, in order to get the measure perhaps a quicker passage, as it was fairly agreeable to all sides, it was thought that it might be made a Government measure and that is the reason it is now on the Order Paper as a Government measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody reading the Report of the Select Committee, and the evidence given before it, will be satisfied that such a Bill as the present one is necessary. Moneylending, so far as this country is concerned, is based upon legislation passed in the year 1900. The Moneylenders Act of 1900 was an Act which under present circumstances is not suitable to the needs of the community.  It made certain provisions with regard to the registration of moneylenders.  The regulations made under that Act were such that registration could not be refused for reasons for which it must be refused under this Bill.  When registration was applied for the Revenue authorities, on the payment of the necessary fee of £1, were bound to grant that licence provided, of course, minor qualifications existed. Another defect of the 1900 Moneylenders Act was that unless a court was satisfied that the interest charged <Col N="1500" /> was excessive, or that the transaction was harsh and unconscionable, it had no power to intervene.  Leaving the position in that vague way has resulted in various judges and various courts giving different interpretations as to what interest is excessive and unconscionable.  Under Section 13 of the Bill the maximum amount of interest is set out at 39 per cent.  I may say that an Act similar to this Bill was passed in England in 1927 in which the interest was fixed at 48 per cent. However, the Select Committee was satisfied that 39 per cent. was a sufficient margin.  That does not mean that in any transaction 39 per cent. cannot be held to be excessive, but it gives, at any rate, some idea to the courts as to the line on which they are to go.  Where the rate of interest is not stated in the transaction, the First Schedule provides the method of calculation in assessing interest.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill, apart from the interest, are concerned with the methods by which registration can be secured by moneylenders. Provision is made in the Finance Act as to the fees to be paid: £15 for a full year and £10 for part of a year, where the licence is taken out some time before 31st July and does not cover a full yearly period.  It has to be renewed each year.  Under the 1900 Act it had only to be renewed every three years.  Under that Act also, as a matter of fact, the Revenue Commissioners could not refuse registration if certain qualifications existed. According to the provisions of this Bill, the moneylender cannot get a certificate from the District Justice unless he conforms to certain things. Objection can be taken to his application by a Superintendent of the Gárda or by a resident in the locality. The grounds upon which a certificate can be refused are set out in Section 4.  When the certificate has been granted, it is taken by the moneylender to the Revenue Commissioners and the necessary fees are paid.  I might point out, however, that if the moneylender is dissatisfied or if the opposing party is dissatisfied with the <Col N="1501" /> decision of the District Justice, there is an appeal to the Circuit Court Judge and that is the final appeal.  While the appeal is pending, the Revenue Commissioners have power to issue an interim or temporary licence and they can impose any conditions they think necessary.</P>
    <P>Sections 6, 7 and 8 deal with advertising and the issuing of circulars by moneylenders, touting, as it is called, or canvassing.  Prior to the introduction of the Private Member's Bill dealing directly with moneylending, in 1929 a Private Member's Bill had been introduced dealing with canvassing and advertising.  These sections deal with the restrictions imposed with regard to it.  Section 9 deals with the form of contract and sets out the memorandum which must be signed by the parties, the moneylender and the borrower.  In the case of a married woman solely dependent upon her husband, the husband must also sign the contract.  In the evidence tendered to the Select Committee cases were brought to their notice where great hardship was entailed and the suggestion was made that blackmail had been resorted to in cases of married women borrowing. Section 10 deals with the question of compound interest.  Section 11 imposes on the moneylender an obligation to supply information as to the state of the loan and any other information which the borrower thinks necessary.  On payment of a fee of 1/-, the moneylender is bound to supply the necessary information as to the position with regard to the interest and principal that may be due at that particular time and also particulars of payments previously made.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with the position with regard to bankruptcy proceedings for moneylenders' loans.  It sets out a rate of 5 per cent. and enables the court, should the assets permit, to take into account a higher rate of interest if they think it advisable.  I have already referred to Section 13, which sets out the rate of interest at 39 per cent.  Section 14 deals with the charging of expenses and the charging of negotiation fees and preliminary expenses with regard to borrowing.  A considerable amount of evidence on <Col N="1502" /> that aspect of the question was brought before the Select Committee.  Cases were mentioned where certain people had been circularised and, after having their cases examined, were told that if they paid a certain fee the loan would be considered.  After paying the fee, however, they did not get the loan they were seeking.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with the limitation of time for proceedings in respect of money lent by moneylenders.  The section sets out broadly that proceedings must be taken within three years from the time the money accrues due. There are certain qualifications inserted to protect people who might in the ordinary way have difficulty in taking proceedings; where, for instance, a person who had borrowed money was <i>non compos mentis,</i> or had gone overseas, and so on.  In these cases it is provided that the time should not begin to run until the person had become sane or, in the other instance, had returned from overseas.  Section 17 prohibits moneylending on Sundays, Christmas Day, Good Friday, and St. Patrick's Day.  Section 19 deals with assignees.  That matter was dealt with in 1911 in a short Act consisting of three sections.  That Act set out that if a <i>bona fide</i> assignee or holder for value was not aware of a previous transaction he should not be prejudiced. The First Schedule sets out the method of computation of interest where a rate has not been agreed upon which is a rate not exceeding 39 per cent.  These are the main provisions of the Bill.  It goes no farther and seeks to secure no less than was agreed upon by the Select Committee and, having been agreed upon to that extent, I anticipate that the Bill will receive the unanimous approval of the House.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £529,991 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1934, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health including Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing, Grants to Local Authorities and Sundry Grants-in-Aid, and certain charges connected with Hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this Estimate, there is a net increase of £229,980 as compared with the total provision made for the financial year 1932-33, including the Supplementary Votes of £100,000 for free milk for children of persons in receipt of home assistance, and £140,000 for housing grants.  The main increase in the present year's Vote is in respect of grants under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.  For this purpose an additional sum of £220,000 is required. The other main increases are in connection with the essential public health services which we desire to see maintained and extended.  The reduction in the amount included for child welfare will not involve any curtailment of that service.  It has been decided to transfer to the sanitary authorities the administration of the grant for free milk for necessitous children.  In the areas where child welfare centres are established, the two services can be <Col N="1504" /> readily co-ordinated.  In Dublin City there has already been close co-operation between the Child Welfare Committee and the Board of Assistance with beneficial results.  On the transfer of the grant to sanitary authorities, free milk may be supplied to children of parents in necessitous circumstances, irrespective of whether they are in receipt of home assistance or not.  Any tendency there has been up to the present for persons to seek home assistance with the object of qualifying for the grant of free milk will no longer exist.  The grant has been of real benefit to the poor, and I am particularly desirous of seeing it distributed in the manner best suited to their needs.</P>
    <P>The available statistics in regard to public health relate to the year 1931. In some respects they are less favourable than those for the year 1930. The number of deaths from typhus increased from four to 11.  For typhoid fever, the number of recorded deaths in 1931 was 68, or two less than the previous year.  There was a decrease of eight in the three Ulster counties, but this was offset by an increase of six in the Province of Leinster.  Typhoid fever is a dangerous disease.  Persons who have made a good recovery may continue to be a source of infection to others.  The public health services administered through local bodies should, therefore, be directed to the necessary preventive measures by providing pure water supplies, enforcing proper sanitary conditions in populous areas and arranging for adequate supervision over milk supplies.  In the past year there was every inducement given to local bodies to carry out essential public health works by the aid of contributions from relief funds, and the response made was encouraging.  Fifty-two local authorities prepared schemes to which grants amounting to £130,000 were allocated.  Most of the works are still in progress and apart from the lasting advantage which will accrue to public health, the execution of the works at the present time has been the means of affording employment to considerable numbers of men.  In the present year, out of funds provided for <Col N="1505" /> relief works, we hope to make further grants towards the cost of carrying out essential public health schemes.</P>
    <P>As regards the incidence of diphtheria, there has been a decrease of 69 in the number of deaths in 1931, as compared with 1930.  The disease was very prevalent in the County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork and Limerick and in the Counties of Tipperary (S.R.), Cork, Galway, Limerick, Louth and Wexford.  Immunisation campaigns against the disease have been carried out in Dublin and Cork county boroughs, and in the Counties of Cork, Galway and Wexford.  Striking results have already been obtained in reducing the mortality of the disease in Cork City, where 6,436 children had been inoculated with toxin-anti-toxin up to the end of 1931.  The number of cases of diphtheria in that year fell from 626 in 1930 to 282 in 1931.  It is hoped that equally favourable results will ensue in the other areas where immunisation is being carried out.  In Dundalk urban district, where an immunisation scheme was carried out a few years ago with favourable results, there has been an upward tendency in the incidence of the disease. To combat the disease successfully, immunisation schemes must be repeated periodically as the young children grow up.  It is better, however, for local bodies to incur the expenditure of preventive measures so as to avoid the heavy toll of sickness connected with the disease and the premature wastage of human life.</P>
    <P>The mortality amongst infants for the year 1931 was slightly higher than for the previous year, being 69 per 1,000 as compared with 68 for the previous years.  There is also a slight upward tendency in the death rate from tuberculosis, the actual number of deaths from the disease in 1931 being 77 more than in 1930.</P>
    <P>The schemes for maternity and child welfare and for the prevention of tuberculosis have been well maintained.</P>
    <P>In the case of child welfare there has been a large addition to the number of voluntary associations engaged in this work, due mainly to the provision of funds under the Public Charitable Hospitals Act of 1931 for the training and maintenance of district nurses. <Col N="1506" /> Approved schemes for school medical inspection are in operation in the four county boroughs and in 18 counties.  In some of the counties the schemes are only in the initial stages and full development is not expected for another year.  In the year 1931, which is the latest year for which complete figures are available, the total number of children on the rolls in schools in which schemes were in operation was 331,087 of whom 85,513 were inspected during the year.  The principal defects ascertained were:&mdash;(a) dental; (b) tonsils and adenoids; and (c) defective vision and other eye defects.  The percentage of dental defects was 35.9; of tonsils and adenoids 26.8 and of defective vision 16.9.  In the county boroughs the percentage of dental defects is higher than in the rural areas but the incidence of defective nose and throat conditions appears to be higher in children in rural areas.  Until more progress has been made in the development of the schemes and statistics are available over a series of years it will not be possible to make reliable comparisons between the health of school children resident in urban and rural areas.  In the earlier stages it is to be expected that children requiring urgent treatment obtain priority and the numbers in whom defects have been ascertained may be relatively high to the total number of school children.</P>
    <P>School meals in urban areas are in operation in four county boroughs, 35 urban districts and two towns under town commissioners. The average number of children provided daily with school meals during the year ended 31st March, 1932, was 19,225.  The total number of meals supplied was 3,261,220 of which 1,580,869 were supplied in Dublin City.</P>
    <P>In the areas in the Gaeltacht in which school meals are provided the schemes were in full force in the Counties of Galway, Kerry and Donegal and most of the eligible schools in Mayo.  In Cork County the scheme is applied to five of the eight eligible schools.  The average attendance at all the eligible schools at which school meals may be supplied was 17,974.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1507" /> Schemes for the welfare of the blind are in operation in all counties, except Cork and Roscommon and in the County Borough of Limerick, Amended schemes were framed to meet the altered conditions consequent on the passing of the Old Age Pensions Act of 1932 and the local authorities have been requested to deal as sympathetically as possible with the necessitous blind in their area so as to lighten the affliction under which they labour.</P>
    <P>I have already alluded to the need for preventive measures to safeguard the public health.  Most diseases have their origin and propagation in insanitary conditions and our efforts to uplift the standard of public health will not meet with success unless accompanied by improved housing conditions for the working classes. The provision for grants for the building and reconstruction of houses in the present year's Estimates amounts to £370,000 and there are being made available, by way of loan, sums of £1,000,000 for housing schemes in urban areas, exclusive of the County Boroughs of Dublin and Cork where the local authorities raise funds locally by issues of stock; £500,000 for labourers' cottages, and £200,000 for loans to local bodies making advances under the Small Dwellings Acts.</P>
    <P>Up to the end of May the number of houses included in approved schemes of local authorities amounted to 5,010 of which 1,167 had already been completed; 2,975 were in course of construction and 868 about to be commenced.  Schemes at present under consideration contemplate the provision of 19,801 additional houses.  The number of houses being built by private persons or public utility societies up to end of May was 4,411, of which 2,479 are in urban districts and 1,932 in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Of the 23,644 houses included in schemes in progress or in course of preparation by local bodies 11,041 are in urban areas and 12,603 in rural districts.  In the urban areas the new houses are almost entirely for the rehousing of persons at present living in slums or condemned houses. <Col N="1508" /> Slum clearance orders have been made for a number of unhealthy areas in Dublin City, and also in Dún Laoghaire Borough, Clonmel Borough, Thurles Urban District, and Edenderry Town.  Orders are being prepared for the clearance of similar areas in the County Boroughs of Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and preliminary steps have been taken for the clearance of unhealthy areas in a number of the smaller towns. In Dublin and Cork the local authorities are acquiring the clearance areas for rebuilding, but the tendency in the smaller urban areas is to rehouse the slum dwellers on virgin sites.</P>
    <P>In Dublin 830 houses are in course of construction.  Schemes for the building of 2,051 further houses are well advanced.  In Cork a scheme for 252 houses for slum clearance is in progress.  The scheme is being carried out adjoining an unhealthy area and when the houses have been built this area will be cleared and acquired for further building.  The entire scheme will comprise 600 houses. Schemes for the building of 188 additional houses are in hands.</P>
    <P>In Limerick progress has been slow&mdash;partly due to the difficulty of obtaining suitable sites within the city boundary.  The Corporation have in hands a scheme for the reconstruction of the Castle Barracks into 32 dwellings and they are in negotiation for the acquisition of a site for the building of 257 houses.  All these houses will be for the rehousing of persons in slum areas.  In Waterford the Corporation have 45 houses in progress and tenders are being invited for 132 houses.</P>
    <P>In regard to road administration there has been close co-operation between the Department and the local authorities and the county surveyors. Apart from the carrying out of the works under the usual road fund grants which amounted to about £850,000, additional works under the million road grant were undertaken by county councils at a cost of about £600,000, the balance of the grant being allocated to the urban areas.  A substantial portion of the money allotted to county councils under the <Col N="1509" /> special relief scheme was expended on the strengthening, re-grading and widening as well as the re-surfacing of country roads.</P>
    <P>The usual 40 per cent. grant to county councils towards the cost of upkeep of main roads is being provided in the present year.  This grant will amount to, approximately, £350,000, while a sum of £500,000 will be available for improvement works.</P>
    <P>The estimates for county councils for the repair and maintenance of roads in the present year show a slight decrease in respect of main roads, and a slight increase in respect of county roads.  The net amount to be provided after allowing for the grant towards the upkeep of main roads is estimated at £1,163,500 or a sum of approximately £11,000 in excess of the amount provided in the previous year.  Increased attention is being given by councils to the surface dressing of county roads.  Last year 15 counties provided for surface dressing of 282 miles of county roads at a cost of £33,623.  In this year 19 counties are providing similar treatment to 381 miles of county roads at a cost of £60,870.  The counties where no provision is made under this head are Galway, Kerry, Leitrim. Mayo, Tipperary N.R., Wexford and Wicklow. The provision for the surface dressing of main roads in the present year is in respect of 1,633 miles at a cost of £225,245 as against 1,877 miles in the previous year at a cost of £269,114.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the importance of the matters that have been dealt with and all that lies behind them, the most important thing in connection with the very important work of local government at the present time is the matter of the general relations between the Ministry and local bodies.  In the beginning of the year, when the Estimates were produced, it was pointed out here that there was implied in the Estimates that the central Government here was proposing to shed on to the shoulders of local bodies large burdens and, in the very beginning of the year, local bodies were allowed to face their responsibilities and to face the examination of the work they would have to do and <Col N="1510" /> the moneys they would have to raise, unaware that they were going to receive from the Minister for Local Government £448,000 less in relief of rates on agricultural lands than they got last year.  So that local bodies, in a very difficult period, find themselves starting out on their year's work with the whole financial outlook on their work rather messed up and the whole spirit between, particularly, county councils and the Ministry soured and with full co-operation endangered.  We have the Ministerial Press, writing on the 27th of June, regarding certain county councils and representations they have made to the Ministry and actions they had taken, and charging these bodies with sheer obstructionism.  Local bodies, particularly county councils, derive a very large amount of money from the ratepayers in rural areas.  The Minister is aware that general world conditions are such that there is an International Conference sitting in London and the main object that they seem to have in front of them is to bring about a better state of prices in respect of primary products.  When we see what some of the principal writers and some of the principal speakers have to say on this matter, they seem to think that it would be a most desirable thing and would certainly be the crowning of their efforts at the present moment if, in respect of the main and primary products, they could restore world prices to the level of prices in 1930.  That is a rather meagre hope as far as we can see at the present moment, and certainly, comparing 1930 prices with prices for a few years before that, a rather meagre result considering the amount of effort they are prepared to put into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position here is that we are dependent on the prices of agricultural produce for a very considerable amount of our income and, when we look at the 1930 prices that we are offered as a kind of hope that with a certain amount of work we might get back to, and comparing that price with the prices of to-day, we are impressed by a very striking fact, that in the first five months of 1930 the value of our cattle reaching the British <Col N="1511" /> market was £5,750,000 and that in the first five months of this year the value of our cattle reaching the British market was £2,250,000.  The total rates raised by our county councils particularly, but practically by all our rating bodies outside Dublin, is £3,000,000.  So that the difference in receipts as between the cattle prices to-day in the British market and those in 1930 for the first five months of this year and the first five months of 1930 would pay the whole cost of our local government so far as the cost is borne on the rates outside the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is in circumstances like that they are accepting responsibility for carrying on the work of county councils. They find themselves in the beginning of this year, first touching how they are going to carry out their work and what rate they will have to strike to get the necessary amount of money from the ratepayers and then finding themselves entirely and unexpectedly deprived of £500,000.  On top of that, they find the whole spirit of local government brought to this, that added to that irritation on the part of local bodies, the Minister is now charging a lot of them, through his press, with sheer obstructionism.  On top of that again, we have Ministerial pronouncements putting down on local bodies tremendous other general responsibilities of which, I am sure, none of them were aware until these Ministerial pronouncements were made.  For instance, down on top of the administration of all these matters the Minister speaks about local bodies and we are told to-day that an enormous amount can be done by local councils to win this economic war.  We are told by the President, in a speech made in connection with the local elections in the City of Dublin, and reported on the 24th of this month, that, in connection with the war our ability to make more rapid progress will be determined to no small extent by the results of these municipal elections.  In fairness to local bodies, now at the beginning of their year's administration, because they are only practically launched on it now, if there are things that local <Col N="1512" /> bodies can do to assist this country out of its difficulties at the present moment, I think, if there is not going to be further misunderstanding and further friction as between the Ministry and local bodies, they ought to be told more explicitly what are the things that they can do to help this country in the difficulties that are mentioned there.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the very great necessity of developing this country industrially.  Local bodies also have been addressed recently in connection with this matter.  For instance, speaking in Kilkenny, where the President received the freedom of the city, he is reported in the Press of the 25th of June as addressing the citizens of the City of Kilkenny with regard to the industrialisation of our towns. The President said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In a few years we shall have all the factories in hand and the towns that neglect their opportunities now will find it is too late for them to enter the industrial field.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Coupled with that, we have a statement issued on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, again in connection with the local elections in Dublin.  The statement is to this effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In other cities and towns Fianna Fáil councils and mayors, working in co-operation with the Departments of State, are offering facilities and advantages to industrialists to erect or extend their factories. Already many firms which might have erected factories in Dublin have been induced to go elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, if urban authorities have powers that will enable them to induce manufacturers to come in and set up and develop industry in a more diffused way throughout the country, then many local bodies are utterly unaware of what these powers are.  We ought to hear from the Minister, if there is this very great and important part that urban authorities can play in the present scheme of industrial development in the country, what that part is, and we ought to be fully informed here as to what the powers of these <Col N="1513" /> urban authorities are.  The House, I am sure, would be glad and local authorities would be glad to get some examples from the Minister as to what has been done in those urban areas referred to which enabled them to get industries started.  The Minister for Finance in his Budget speech said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While the Government is not yet in a position to announce detailed proposals in regard to the provision of maintenance, the way can be seen clear to permit of the introduction of a measure to deal with this problem before the close of the present calendar year.  The new proposals will go far to relieve the local authorities of burdens which many of them now find onerous and will properly organise and fairly distribute the duty and responsibility of providing assistance for the unemployed. In order to initiate them, however, a considerable sum, amounting to £450,000 net, will be required.  We propose, as I have indicated, to launch the scheme and to provide for this initial expenditure this year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have been informed that one county council, at least, had occasion to summon its officials on Friday and point out to them that it had not been able to get accommodation from the bank, that it was not in a position to spend more money at the moment and that employment would have to cease.  If my information is correct, the Minister cannot complain that a majority of the county councils in question are unfriendly or opposed to the present Government.  People who talk in terms of Cumann na nGaedheal and Fianna Fail would call it a &ldquo;Fianna Fáil County Council.&rdquo;  The Minister may have more definite information than I have about that case but he knows what the general situation is.  I ask the Minister to tell us, for the information of those councils, what exactly he proposes to do with the £450,000 which, it has been stated, will go far to relieve local authorities of burdens which many of them now find onerous. All the local authorities are up against a very serious situation.  They fear they have been forced to strike rates <Col N="1514" /> which are above the capacity of the ratepayer to pay.  They now find themselves burdened with additional, wide responsibilities and it is suggested that they have wide powers which a number of them never heard of before. They are all interested in serving the country in any way they can and they are all anxious to get the country out of the difficulties that the economic war has brought upon it.  They are anxious to serve in the development of industry and they would be very glad to know exactly what burdens the Ministry are going to take on their shoulders when the plan for spending £450,000 is brought forward.  The Minister started off the year very badly.  It would help him to make amends and to improve the spirit of administration between himself and the local bodies for the rest of the year if he could make clearer to them what responsibilities are supposed to lie upon them arising out of the general statements to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not the privilege of hearing the whole of the Minister's statement but I listened carefully to that portion which referred to housing and, particularly, to slums.  I am sure the Minister is aware of a problem which is presenting itself in the case of those urban councils which embarked on large housing schemes. These houses were built to relieve the slums and the problem is how to get the people in the slums to move into the new houses.  The great deterrent is the rent.  In many of the laneways in our country towns, rents of 9d. and 1/3 are charged for what I admit are most unhygienic and scandalous houses. The wages these people can earn are so bad that they cannot, in present circumstances, be got to move into the new houses.  It would take the crowbar to induce them to do it.  In a certain town in Kildare, a housing scheme was completed but very few of the local people occupied the new houses.  The occupants came from Northern Ireland and other parts of the country.  They were either pensioners or persons with guaranteed weekly incomes.  Some of them stayed for a time and then passed on to other places.  There is great danger in <Col N="1515" /> over-building, in the excitement of the moment, without care being taken that the houses will be used for the purpose for which they are being built&mdash;to relieve the people living in bad conditions. But how are you going to reconcile a rent of 1/3 or 1/6 with a rent of 4/6 per week?  I do not know how it is to be done.</P>
      <P>There is only one way to help and that is by the starting of industries in the country towns instead of in the city.  I was interested in reading the speech of the President at Kilkenny, to which Deputy Mulcahy has referred.  To start new industries in the country, we would require a brain trust.  Those in commercial life who possess capital and who are anxious to start industry in country towns come up against a wall right away. There is no article the production of which at the moment could, with the existing demand, be economically undertaken in these centres.  The purchasing power of the people has been greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the conditions of world commerce now demand and insist that anything in the form of new factories or new industries must be at the ports, or in cities near the landing of raw material, or the best point of distribution. The question of building new houses, being able to pay rent for them, and give employment will considerably depend on the rejuvenation and resurgence of the country towns, which at the present moment are, to use a mild word, in a state of decay. On numerous occasions I have sought information, and others have sought information, looked for advice, and been ready to act on and investigate suggestions with a view to having industries started if possible.  There is no county, I should think, that is worse off or more in need of industry than the County Kildare.  You have Newbridge, Naas, Monasterevan, Celbridge, Athy and several large villages in which unemployment and depressed conditions are eating into every house and home.  One would think that, with local labour available and local sites easily obtainable, the question of establishing industries, whether it be in a small way or in a large way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister who is responsible, as far as I know, for industrial development, so far as it can be done by a Government, is the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and it is on his Estimate that the Deputy should have made this statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully submit to your ruling on the matter.  At the present moment when local authorities assemble, or shortly before they assemble, they receive most voluminous correspondence, agenda, rules, regulations, new legislation, and highly specialised work, which are constantly being added to, with the result that when quarterly meetings are convened it would take a county councillor with a secretariat to know his job in such a way as to be able to administer it properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, and am honestly convinced from the little experience I may have had, that we are surely about to face the time when the local authorities will be incapable of administering the enormous responsibilities which are now being thrown on them.  The staffs, whether the general secretary's or the county surveyor's or other office staffs, are at the present moment faced with a huge amount of highly specialised work, involving a tremendous amount of concentration and huge sums of money. Each year the work is increasing, with the result that the members of county councils, who naturally have not got the specialised knowledge, must be almost entirely in the hands of the professional and trained permanent staffs.  Hence it is that sooner or later some new method of running local administration will have to be <Col N="1517" /> adopted.  It is only honest and fair to state that there are very few county councillors to-day who have the knowledge necessary to administer the extra legislation which they are faced with.  Two-thirds of the county councillors are not able and could not be asked to give a deliberate and timely opinion on many of the problems that come up for solution, by reason of their ramifications and the multitude of those problems.  Some people suggest that local authorities should be smaller in number.  I do not think that it would make any difference.  There is a suggestion that it would be better to have a manager, with about five or six members on a county council, the manager to administer and the five or six others to be responsible for policy. At the present moment I am quite satisfied that those in this House who are members of local authorities, or members of county councils, are not and could not be in a position to control in a business-like and commercial way the work which they should control if they had the time, and if its volume were not so enormous.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay this House on that matter any further, except to say that the work involved in the local administration of counties has developed so rapidly that sooner or later it will become so top heavy that local administration must suffer, and it cannot be said to be the fault of the local authorities.  At each meeting there is a new rule or regulation, or some new order, with the result that the work suffers.  It is almost a whole-time job now.  It is not a question of being able to seek out the weak points or develop the strong ones.  Everybody, as far as I can see, is to a large extent groping in the dark until the meeting is nearly two-thirds on the way.  Then they begin to wake up to what it is all about.  It is not their fault.  It is due to the fact that they have too much to do, and by degrees the central authority is sinking more and more, until, as I said before, the time will come when the whole local authority will collapse, purely because there is too much business to be done in the short time at their disposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On more than one occasion when this Vote formerly came up for discussion I drew the attention of the Minister to the need for a drastic reform in connection with county homes all over the country.  My experience of some institutions of that kind is that the buildings are very unsatisfactory, the whole surroundings are very cheerless and desolate, and the amount of comfort that people who are unfortunate enough to end their days in institutions of that kind are able to get within the walls is very little indeed. A very valuable experiment was made in another part of the county from which I come.  The Local Government Department has actively interested itself with the North Cork Board of Health in having a mansion in the locality taken over under the control of a religious order and the inmates of the county home are boarded out with that religious order.  I suggest to the Minister that that is a policy that might be strongly pressed on local authorities whom, I am sure, he will find quite willing to listen to his advice.</P>
      <P>I desire to make particular reference to the conditions in West Cork where, as the Minister will be able to ascertain from the inspector, overcrowding and unsatisfactory conditions prevail to an alarming extent.  In West Cork there is an opportunity of moving along the lines followed by the North Cork Board of Health and I suggest that the Minister should, as far as possible, use his influence for the purpose of enabling similar provision to be made in that area.  The conditions are so bad in the county home in Clonakilty that beds have to be provided on the floors.  The whole position, as I know from personal experience, is very unsatisfactory.  I do not want to advertise the matter unduly.  I merely mention it because I think the Minister will be very sympathetic and I believe his Department also will be sympathetic. I appeal to him to indicate to local authorities generally his earnest desire that a movement of the kind so successfully initiated in North Cork and so likely to turn out successfully should be more generally adopted all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> I would like the Minister, so far as it is possible to have it done, to have decisions on applications for reconstruction grants expedited.  We are steadily moving towards the end of the summer and the Minister is well aware that it will be almost impossible to have work of that kind carried out in a satisfactory manner when we get into the short days and the bad weather.  I want to enlist the Minister's sympathy in respect of the peculiar difficulty experienced by the Cork County Council in relation to the housing question.  The Cork County Council is one of the few local authorities in the Saorstát that adopted, year after year since 1924, as successive Housing Acts were passed here, schemes to provide loans for individuals who obtained State grants for the erection of houses. The amount of the loans was invariably equal to the amount of the grants. Loans were issued to small farmers, artisans and other industrious people who had a little capital of their own and these loans enabled them to bear the cost of erection of houses.  The repayments were made yearly or half-yearly and usually they worked out at far less than the rent of the house ordinarily would be.  Then after a period of years they would be free of all liability.</P>
    <P>There was no provision to enable the county council to adopt a scheme of that kind under the last Housing Act.  Of course the county council had the alternative of adopting the Small Dwellings Act.  They decided to do that, but then they discovered that the legal difficulties and the long delay connected with searches in regard to title, et cetera, would practically nullify their efforts to come to the assistance of individuals requiring loans.  One could hardly ask for any change in policy in that connection where the loan required would be £700 or £800, but in the case of the Cork County Council the loans as a rule do not exceed £150.  Usually the type of house erected will cost about £300 and a loan of £150 plus the State grant enables a person to erect a satisfactory dwelling.  In most cases the average <Col N="1520" /> amount applied for is £60 or £70.  In the case of a person applying for a loan of that sort the delay that I have mentioned is a big factor and, besides, the legal expenses, including searches for title and the arrangement of mortgages and other work of that kind, form a very important consideration. All these formalities have to be gone through if the letter of the law is to be strictly adhered to.  The whole thing presents a difficulty from the financial point of view as well as from the point of view of getting speedy results.  I hope the Minister will examine the position and, if possible, permit the Council to continue their loan scheme to individuals on the security of two solvent persons who would be accepted after the fullest possible investigation as suitable sureties.  If there are any administrative difficulties, I hope the Minister will have them smoothed out as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In another matter also I think the Minister may be able to help local authorities considerably.  Local authorities are engaged in promoting schemes for the erection of labourers' cottages. In one part of my constituency there is a derelict workhouse building with five or six acres of land attached.  In the case of Castletownbere there is a plot of five or six acres attached to the derelict workhouse premises.  These premises have been abandoned by the board of assistance.  I suggest the Minister should accede to the demand of the board of assistance, conveyed through the board of health, that these lands might be made available for the purpose of erecting labourers' cottages. I think the proposal is a very reasonable one.  In that district practically all the landholders have very small holdings.  There will be great difficulty in obtaining suitable land unless there are protracted negotiations and, perhaps, a prolonged public inquiry which, no doubt, will be necessary if the compulsory powers in the Act are to be exercised.  The land I have referred to is quite close to the town and it is very suitable for the erection of cottages.  The Minister knows as well as I do that labourers' cottages erected close to a town are <Col N="1521" /> more likely to attract good tenants and are a more attractive proposition than cottages that have to be erected, for want of a suitable site, in remote places where the prospects of employment are not so good and where the land is not so valuable.</P>
    <P>Another matter I would again like to draw the Minister's attention to is the need for putting forward a fairly general scheme for the improvement of secondary roads in the country. The first-class, or trunk roads, are in excellent condition at the present time and are a credit to the whole country. Last year the Minister made certain sums available out of the relief grants, or the Road Fund, for the improvement of secondary roads here and there.  But in order to relieve unemployment there was no very definite stand taken and with certain sums of money inadequate in themselves the local authorities had to be content.  It was a patchwork scheme.  Now I suggest to the Minister that it would be good business to come to the improvement of the secondary roads, and to set aside a certain sum of money for a scheme to be worked in co-ordination with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand the reasons which actuated the county surveyors in slackening off the maintenance work on the roads.  Large gangs of men, in my own county, are unemployed at the moment and the difficulty of the position seems to be intensified, because during the last ten or twelve months lots of people, who were always employed elsewhere, came to work on the roads.  The county surveyors are keeping back the money for maintenance work, and slacking off the work that could be done at this time of the year.  The Minister may not be aware of it, but it is a fact, that a good many people have left employment on the land because of the poor wages and came to work on the roads.  While I can understand the difficulties of such people I appreciate the fact that many people who, for years had no employment except what they received on the roads, are very discontented because of what is happening in that direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> I hope it is not out of order on this Vote, also, to refer to the action taken by the Minister for Industry and Commerce after, I presume, consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in regard to employment on the roads.  I do not know whether I am interpreting properly the circular that was issued, but according to the circular issued to the county surveyors as to the recruitment of men for work on the roads the policy appears to be&mdash;and I take it the Department of Local Government was consulted&mdash;that the recruiting of labour must be through the labour exchanges.  I have no particular objection to that, but I think the Minister might take more adequate precautions to see that people who have given their whole lives to work on the roads and, perhaps, who are not fit for other employment, should not be pushed aside at the present moment.  While, as I say, I have no objection to recruitment through the labour exchanges, I think the Minister ought to make sure that there is set up in connection with that system some kind of local machinery that will enable the best results to be obtained and that will overcome any strange anomalies that have arisen in connection with the recruitment of men for road work That practically exhausts the items I am desirous of bringing to the notice of the Minister.  I hope I have not mentioned too many things.</P>
    <P>There is one other item that must have struck all of us who are members of local authorities, that is, the alarming increase, consequent upon the general poverty of the country, in the number of people who have to seek home assistance.  I think all of us with experience of local authorities should know what has happened in the last few years to many decent people who have been compelled to seek home assistance.  If we never had a case of that kind brought to our notice we know generally the humiliation and degradation that people forced into that position have to endure.  I have seen in the last few months, and I take it that members of local authorities all over the country have the same experience, a very large number of <Col N="1523" /> people thrown on the world owing to the death of the breadwinner of the family.  I do not know whether it is quite right, technically speaking, to mention the matter here on this Vote, but I hope I am in order in asking the Minister to expedite the consideration by his Department of the report of the committee set up to inquire into the question of pensions for widows and to take what action he considers necessary, arising out of that report, at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Minister for Local Government and Public Health has always manifested a keen interest in such matters as drainage and sewerage schemes.  When he was in opposition he was a strong advocate of these schemes, and since he became a Minister, he has always been a great advocate of them.  That is one of the bouquets I want to throw at him at the moment.  I want, therefore, to draw the Minister's attention to a very serious state of affairs that exists in my constituency.  In the village of Blarney, which is fairly thickly populated, having a relatively large industrial population of somewhere about 900, they are still without a proper or adequate sewerage scheme.  The County Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Condy, who is regarded as a very high authority on sanitation, and sanitary science generally, has made a very comprehensive and detailed report to the County Board of Health in Cork County, in the course of which he pointed out that in a village of the dimensions and population of Blarney a proper sewerage scheme was necessary.  I do not propose to read his report, but only to give one or two excerpts from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report deals, amongst other things, with the drains which can be regularly flushed by tank water by means of stop cocks and discharged into open channels in an adjoining field.  He points out the dangers arising from the rather primitive system that obtains there.  In his report, which I am sure is in the Minister's office, he makes certain recommendations, <Col N="1524" /> and he points out that if the present system is allowed to continue it will prove a danger to the public health.  It was estimated by the local engineer in a report to the local authority that, for the construction of a proper sewerage scheme in Blarney, a sum in the neighbourhood of £5,000 or £6,000 would be required.  The county board of health voted a sum of £2,600 to meet the expenses of that particular scheme, the area of charge being the Cork Rural District.  Subsequent to the voting of the money a further report was received from the engineer and the gem of his report was to this effect, that if the local authority in conjunction with the Local Government Department undertook a sewerage scheme in Blarney one of the immediate effects would be the spoiling of the view from Blarney Castle. If I am to take it that that is the view that carries most weight with the Department I must be mistaken in my estimate of the Minister for Local Government. I feel sure that if the Minister had his way his first consideration would be for the health of the residents of the district.  Of course, the Minister may reply that the local authority should supply at least about 50 per cent. of the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>They have already agreed to contribute £2,600 towards the cost.  In the present state of affairs with which the Minister is fully conversant, I suggest that the health of the people of the area should be his first consideration.  In view of the circumstances, the local authority are not prepared to advance beyond £2,600. I should like to congratulate the Minister and his Department on the wisdom shown in increasing under sub-head K.1 the grants for child welfare and school medical treatment to the extent of £1,000.  I would impress upon the Minister the urgent necessity of seeing that the towns and villages, in connection with which provision has been made by the local authorities to some extent, are adequately provided with the ordinary amenities requisite in civilised life in the shape of proper sanitary accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> There is another matter which comes under the ægis of the Minister for Local Government, namely, the administration of old age and blind pensions.  On two or three occasions I pointed out in this House that many artisans, craftsmen, and ordinary labourers, perhaps, make some kind of provision for their old age by way of weekly contribution to their trade union.  Because of their providence in that direction they are penalised.  If a person attached to a trade union makes provision for old age by way of superannuation there is a corresponding reduction made in the pension paid to him.  If a man makes provision through his trade union for the payment of superannuation to him at the rate of 15/- per week he only gets 1/- per week old age pension.  That is a matter which should be looked into by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that that is not a matter of administration?  As the law stands at present, such provision as a person may make for a pension must be taken into consideration when estimating means.  As the old age pensions law stands, the Minister has no alternative. It would require an amendment of the law, and it is scarcely in order now on this Estimate to advocate amendment of the law.</P>

      <P>I should also like to point out to the Minister that very considerable delay occurs between the time a person is awarded a pension and the time a pension is paid. I have particulars of dozens of cases of applicants for old age and blind pensions whose cases were decided as long ago as last December and who have not yet got their pensions.  I suggest that the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary should expedite these cases.  I am aware that since the passing of the Act making it possible to secure a blind pension at 30 the work of the Department must have been multiplied tenfold. At the same time, it must be obvious to any Deputy who has had to do with these cases that there is considerable delay in dealing with them. Even when decisions are reached, we find in many cases that the person awarded the pension gets about half of the money to which he is entitled. I will give an instance that came under my notice, where a pensioner was awarded 10/- weekly, payable from last December, but only £5 10s. was paid him, leaving a good sum due.  Could the Minister arrange when making payments of that kind to pay the full amount due, so that many of us who are brought into daily contact with pensioners would not have to be writing letters to the Department, and, in some cases, visiting the Department on their behalf?  If so, it would considerably facilitate our business here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to blind pensions, many persons have had to give up their usual occupations because of disability <Col N="1527" /> on account of their eye-sight. The degree of blindness required by the Department may or may not be the right degree.  I have come across cases where persons who applied for blind pensions were unable to follow their usual occupations, because of their disability, but they were not awarded pensions because they had not the degree of blindness required by the Department.  As the Parliamentary Secretary is an authority on these matters, I would like to hear what he has to say.</P>
    <P>In relation to the administration of old age pensions, it would be well if the Department would place at the disposal of local officers some fuller information than they have or that they are prepared to give the applicant. My experience is that when some pensions are awarded there is considerable delay about paying them.  The local officers say they are not responsible and that the matter should be taken up with the Department in Dublin.  I suggest that some fuller authority should be vested in local pensions officers, in so far as it relates to pensions that have been awarded.  I suggest to the Minister and to the Parliamentary Secretary that they should treat with consideration the type of cases I have referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are numbers of housing schemes proceeding throughout the country, some of them being finished daily and the houses being occupied.  I want to refer to the type of grate that is being put into these houses.  I think I am correct in saying that the grates being put in are ones suitable for burning coal. The Government has recently made proposals regarding the burning of turf.  If they do not wish to be accused of inconsistency they ought to make up their minds regarding the types of grates to be installed in houses that are nearing completion, so that these grates will burn turf.  Most people believe that when a supply of turf is made available in certain places the people will say they cannot use turf because the grates are unsuitable. I suggest to the Minister that he could <Col N="1528" /> do away with that complaint, at any rate, in houses that are about to be finished, by installing grates to burn turf.  Otherwise the sooner the turf scheme is given up the better.  I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that he will look into that matter.  I raised it when the Estimate regarding the supply of turf was before the House, but I did not get any answer.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to the need for a Town Planning Bill, which has been promised for a considerable time.  It is inconsistent to be providing houses in places where, according to town planning laws, they should not be erected. When does the Minister propose to introduce the Town Planning Bill?</P>
      <P>I want to refer also to the supply of water in Dublin.  Every house can get a supply, but there is practically no supply of industrial water.  The Government professes to be very anxious to start industries here, yet there are handicaps existing, at which, I think, the Government would be appalled.  One cannot understand why money should be voted for relief schemes, which practically provide no return, while there are other schemes calling out for solution, the work on which would provide a direct return for the money expended on them. Under that heading I refer particularly to the need for a supply of industrial water for Dublin.  By industrial water I mean water under pressure. In many places in Dublin I doubt if the pressure was tested if there would be any more than c.c., but certainly b. could not be obtained in any part of Dublin.</P>
      <P>That affects the taxation of persons requiring industrial water because higher insurance premiums have to be paid.  Work of that class is calling out for completion, and I suggest that as one of the schemes that might be considered. It is absurd to be voting money for relief schemes when there are other schemes to be dealt with which would provide a return for the money expended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated this afternoon that there were a number of supplementary questions which I would like to ask the Minister, arising out of his reply to the question I asked to-day, regarding the reorganisation of the creamery industry in County Sligo.  In raising this matter on the adjournment, I am anxious to afford the Minister an opportunity of indicating to the House the nature of the scheme which he has in mind for the reorganisation of the creamery industry in County Sligo.  As a result of the generous subsidy which the Government has provided in aid of the creamery industry, there has been a very marked increase, during the past 12 months, in the production of milk in Sligo County.  To enable the farmers to obtain the fullest possible benefit, it is very desirable that adequate creamery facilities should be provided. In some parts of Sligo, such facilities are already available.  There are three or four creameries at present in existence that have made a substantial margin of profit during the past two years.  These creameries are provided with up-to-date machinery, they have sufficient capital, and they are quite capable of dealing with a much larger supply of milk.  In other places, the position is not so good.  In some parts of the county, the position is decidedly bad.  There are certain districts in which auxiliary creameries have closed down this year with consequent loss to the farmers concerned. While some parts of the county are, in fact, over supplied with creameries, with the result that there is undesirable competition, there are other areas with no creamery within reach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers are very anxious that the Government should intervene for the purpose of reorganising the industry on an economic basis.  It is very undesirable, as I am sure the Minister will agree, that central creameries should continue in close proximity to each other, with the result <Col N="1530" /> that there is what may be described as uncontrolled competition.  If the industry is to be put on a paying basis, it is essential that the number of central creameries should be limited and competition between them eliminated as far as possible.  Where auxiliary creameries have closed down, it is a matter of extreme urgency that the Government should intervene in the interests of the farmers concerned and have these auxiliaries transferred to some other central creamery.  I believe that, if a general reorganisation of creameries was carried out, overhead charges could be reduced to such an extent as to provide a much better price for milk.  As far as the dairy farmers are concerned, I believe they are anxious to co-operate with the Minister in putting into effect any scheme which would lead to better all-round production and increased profits.  Arising out of the Minister's reply this afternoon, I am anxious that he should indicate the nature of the scheme which he has in contemplation and what benefits this scheme is likely to confer on the farmers if put into operation.  I am also anxious to know what progress has been made by the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society in their negotiations with the local societies concerned.  Is it likely that sufficient co-operation can be secured to enable a reorganisation for the whole county to be carried out? If no general co-operation can be secured, I should like to hear from the Minister whether he is prepared to intervene in particular parts of the county where certain auxiliary creameries have been forced to close down, with the object of having those creameries restarted under new management.  In conclusion, I should like to know if certain societies have been responsible for taking action which has prevented a general reorganisation being carried out and, if so, what action the Minister proposes to take to deal with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not quite know what to make of the Deputy's statement.  I can scarcely imagine that he is unaware of the fact that the original scheme proposed has broken <Col N="1531" /> down for various reasons into which it is quite unnecessary to go at the moment.  I do not know whether a scheme on the lines of the original scheme would ever meet with the approval of the societies in Sligo, and I do not know whether the idea of the I.A.O.S., in embarking on a large-scale scheme of reorganisation of creameries throughout the country, will meet with success and with the co-operation of the societies concerned. I understand that the Minister, at the moment, is engaged in formulating a new scheme for the reorganisation of the creamery industry in County Sligo, but I would suggest to the Minister that, if the new scheme is to succeed, he should prevail on the I.A.O.S. to proceed on more modest lines than formerly.  I think that a scheme drawn up on a more restricted scale would be much more likely to meet with success than the large-scale scheme originally drafted by the I.A.O.S. and approved by the Department of Agriculture.  The Minister, in any event, knows the difficulties which the officials of his own Department and the officials of the I.A.O.S. were faced with in endeavouring to get societies to agree to accept the original scheme. I quite agree with Deputy Carty&mdash; there is no question whatever about it&mdash;that the creamery industry will have to be reorganised in County Sligo. There are a certain limited number of creameries which are financially in a strong position.  There are others that are not in such a strong position, and there are some that are just struggling along from year to year.  Originally, there were too many societies started in the county.  Probably these societies were necessary at the time, because, of course, the cow population was very large some 20 or 25 years ago.  Since then, for various reasons, the cow population has dwindled substantially, with the result that many of the societies are not receiving an economic milk supply to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the societies are to be assured of an economic milk supply in future, some scheme of reorganisation will have to be adopted by the societies in <Col N="1532" /> their own interests, in the interests of self-preservation, but I think the Minister will agree with me that the idea of carrying out a large-scale scheme of reorganisation in Sligo will never meet with the approval of the societies as a whole.  If the Minister is going to succeed in reorganising the creamery industry in that county it will be necessary to proceed on much more modest lines, and I imagine that if he does carry out a scheme on a much smaller scale it is much more likely to meet with success and with the co-operation of the societies concerned. There is one society in which I am primarily interested&mdash;the Collooney society&mdash;and Deputy Carty knows as much about the state of affairs in that society as I do myself.</P>
    <P>On account of the breakdown of the original scheme some of the guarantors of the society are left in a rather peculiar position.  The Minister knows that at one time he made certain arrangements with a bank and, by virtue of that arrangement, the society was relieved of a certain sum of money which otherwise it would have to pay to the bank.  On account of the breakdown of the reorganisation scheme, it may now be that the guarantors will have to shoulder the liability for the full amount due.  I do not know whether the Minister can come to their assistance, but if he could succeed in formulating a scheme within the next two or three months it may be that he will be successful also in preserving intact, in conjunction with the I.A.O.S., the arrangement made with the bank.  Whatever scheme the Minister approves of will have to take into consideration the position of Collooney. That will be more or less the central point in any reorganisation scheme.  The scheme will have to provide for the continuance of the Collooney creamery or the disposal of the creamery to some adjoining creamery, and the disposal of the auxiliary creameries as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Prices Stabilisation Act was going through the Dáil last year, in reply to a question from Deputy Roddy, I said that we had intended to draw up a special scheme <Col N="1533" /> for Sligo.  At that time we included certain creameries in a scheduled list in order to give them special treatment. Unfortunately the creameries in Sligo, which Deputy Roddy had in mind, did not come under that schedule, or did not comply with the rules of the schedule, so that they were left out.  I promised to deal with Sligo in a special way.  In August, since the Bill had gone through, I asked the officers of the Department of Agriculture to survey Sligo and see what could be done to save certain creameries there.  They did so, and I have a report here which is dated for some time in September.  I find from that report that the position at that time was that there were 11 societies in Sligo.  Ten of these were central creameries and there was one independent auxiliary.  Of the central creameries, some had auxiliaries.  One of them had four, two of them had two, and seven had one each.</P>
      <P>Sligo County, although a large county geographically, was not capable of maintaining so many independent societies.  For instance, on making an analysis of those societies we found that there were only two of the whole 11 which could be classed as financially sound, in a good way to carry on and give an economic price to the suppliers.  There were five others which were not embarrassed financially but which were so small that they were unable to pay an economic price.  The overhead charges would be so heavy that the price would be small.  That accounts for seven out of the 11.  Of the remainder, there was one in a rather doubtful position and we found it difficult to get a really exact estimate of how it stood; two were certainly drifting towards insolvency and one was definitely insolvent. We had to consider the method of approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the southern areas, as Deputies and everybody else are aware, there was a very big scheme of reorganisation inaugurated about 1927.  That reorganisation was launched in order to deal with a situation where proprietary creameries were competing against co-operatives and beating the co-operatives.  We could not treat <Col N="1534" /> Sligo in that way because it was not a question of proprietaries competing against co-operatives but rather it was a case of co-operatives competing against one another or trying to carry on against adverse circumstances.  We had another scheme of reorganisation which took place in Clare.  That was a new district entirely for creameries. The Dairy Disposals Board went in there and took over one existing creamery and built a large number of auxiliaries which were attached to the central in order to put it on a good paying basis.  The intention, of course, as soon as that particular society is working well, is to hand it back to the suppliers as a co-operative concern.  I should mention also that in order to do that the Minister at the time had to come before the Dáil and get a special Estimate passed to deal with the situation, because it was not contemplated in the original scheme of reorganisation. Sligo did not fit in with that either.  It was really a case of trying to reorganise a number of co-operative societies.</P>
    <P>We came to the conclusion in the Department that it was really a case for the co-operative movement itself to deal with.  We asked the I.A.O.S. to come in and deal with the matter.  They of course can only deal with it through some system of voluntary reorganisation. In consultation with the officials of my Department a scheme was drawn up which we regarded as an ideal scheme if it could be got through. There were difficulties naturally in the way.  Our intention was, I might say, to try to amalgamate these 11 societies into four strong societies.  In the first place, if a society is itself solvent or has perhaps a slight surplus, it is not in a position to take over an insolvent society and pay the liabilities of the society which it takes over because that would be unfair to the members of the original society.  That was the first difficulty.  The second difficulty was that when reorganisation would take place, the central society which was taking over another society, might have to go in for increased buildings and purchase larger equipment in order to deal with the increased supplies. That would also require finances.  In <Col N="1535" /> the third place the buildings of the society taken over and the equipment there might have to be renewed also. In order to meet that it was stated definitely in the Department to the I.A.O.S., that I was quite prepared to ask for a sum of money from public funds to meet the deficiencies that might arise in the reorganisation as soon as that reorganisation would be agreed to.  I would have to come before the Dáil for a supplementary estimate for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The I.A.O.S. sent representatives to Sligo and the Department of Agriculture sent inspectors also to Sligo on many occasions to try to get some sort of agreement to a scheme such as we had outlined but we got very little encouragement from the societies in Sligo.  With one exception no society was willing to sink its identity.  Where it was proposed, say, to amalgamate three societies, each one of the three wanted to be the parent or the surviving society if you like.  The result was that none of them was prepared to sink its identity either in name or as to the central station so that we could not get anywhere with our scheme. There was as I say one exception. Deputy Carty has put it to me whether we are prepared to allow this thing to proceed or whether we intend using some sort of pressure or compulsion to get the societies to agree.  Of course we have no power to do that.  We have no power to compel agreement in a case such as this.</P>
    <P>In order to get the big reorganisation scheme carried out for the southern counties in which about half a million pounds was spent in buying proprietary and even co-operative creameries there was no compulsion used.  That was all carried out by agreement.  Unless we get voluntary agreement we cannot, under our present powers, do anything.  Deputies who come from the country will understand that each parish or town is very jealous about keeping a creamery or whatever else it may have.  Those concerned are not inclined, as a rule, to become an auxiliary to another town or parish.  Looking at this from the ordinary commercial and economic <Col N="1536" /> point of view, it is difficult to understand why agreement could not be got. If you had agreement, and if there was a reorganisation, naturally the price for milk would be better.  Seeing that the suppliers of the milk are themselves, some of them at any rate, those who compose the managing committees of the creameries, it is very difficult to understand why agreement could not be got.  In addition, if agreement took place no inconvenience would be caused to the farmers, because they would still be supplying their milk to the same station.</P>
    <P>I may say there was a suggestion that two of the auxiliaries might be closed.  No objection was taken on that point.  If there had been it could have been considered, and perhaps without difficulty be got over.  The real objection was taken on the point as to which should be the central creamery and which the auxiliary. Reorganisation would bring another very big advantage to the suppliers in so far as the risk of failure would be entirely removed.  The result, at any rate, was that we got no agreement except from the one society referred to by Deputy Roddy.  I certainly have very great sympathy for a society such as Collooney&mdash;I do not mind mentioning it as it has already been mentioned by Deputy Roddy.  In a case like that where a creamery closes down, the guarantors are called upon to pay.  In all such cases the guarantors are in almost all cases the most public-spirited men in a district.</P>
    <P>Deputies know well that when a co-operative society is being organised you always get four or five or perhaps a dozen men&mdash;usually they are the outstanding people in the district&mdash;who are prepared to risk something for their fellowmen.  They come together and sign a bill in a bank and it is these men who suffer when the crash comes.  It is really very hard that something cannot be done for them. On the other hand, of course, when men go in and sign a guarantee in a bank for an advance of money for a co-operative society that must always be looked upon as a commercial transaction. I do not think I would be justified either in going to the Minister <Col N="1537" /> for Finance, in the first instance, and to the Dáil in the second instance for money to relieve these guarantors of their liabilities.  If, however, there was a general scheme of reorganisation where I could claim that the whole of the County Sligo was going to be benefited: if I could claim, say, that in order to reorganise the whole creamery industry in the County Sligo, to put it on a firm footing so as to avoid the risk of failure in the future and get a better price for the farmers for their milk&mdash;if in order to get a scheme like that going it was necessary to come to the rescue of Collooney, then I think in that case I would be justified in going to the Minister for Finance and to the Dáil.  But in this case where we can get agreement nowhere and where the only thing that could be done in the end would be to come to the rescue of the Collooney Society alone and relieve the guarantors there of their liability, I think, as I have said already, I would hardly be justified in going to the Minister for Finance and the Dáil.  I do not think that I could possibly defend such a procedure in the Dáil particularly if the proposal were objected to by one single member.</P>
    <P>I may say, however, that the reorganisation scheme is by no means dead.  The I.A.O.S. are still very keen on doing something.  They are still willing to reorganise, if they can get any one of the 11 societies to agree to some sort of scheme.  I may say also that the Department of Agriculture is still willing to come to the rescue by way of finance.  I would like to assure Deputy Roddy, in conclusion, that as regards our original scheme to which I have referred&mdash;it is the one we would consider the ideal scheme although perhaps it was a comprehensive one&mdash;that we are not necessarily going to stand on that or nothing.  Even if we could get half our scheme I think we would be satisfied with that for the present, hoping at the same time to get the other societies to reorganise at a later stage.  I do not think that either the inspectors of the I.A.O.S. or of the Department of Agriculture can do anything more at the moment.  They <Col N="1538" /> have used their persuasive powers as far as they possibly could on the various committees in Sligo in their efforts to try and get a voluntary scheme of reorganisation.</P>

      <P>In view of the serious position of the guarantors in the case of the Collooney Society and of the fact that the farmers in parts of that district have no market for their milk at the present time, would the Minister consider the advisability of again asking the members of the I.A.O.S. to visit the societies in Sligo that so far have refused to co-operate with a view to getting them to agree, if not to the original scheme at least to a modified scheme.  I believe it should be possible to get through a more modest scheme, one such as Deputy Roddy suggested, that would apply, say, to one portion of the county and that later would apply generally to the whole county. If we could have as a first instalment <Col N="1539" /> a scheme applying to one part of the county it would, I believe, mark a big advance so far as reorganisation is concerned.</P>
