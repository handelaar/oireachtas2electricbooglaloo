      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state what were the developments <Col N="166" /> which took place in the Athlone Registration Area between the 2nd January and 27th March last and caused the total number of persons registered as unemployed at the local offices in that area to fall from 13,904 to 7,110, i.e., by 6,794 between these two dates.</P>

      <P>Continuous registration involves the renewal of his registration by the unemployed person every week where he resides within three miles of the local office and fortnightly renewal (which can be made through the post) if his place of residence is more distant. On failure of renewal, the registration lapses and the individual is not again included in the Statistical Returns until he re-registers himself.  Registration is voluntary and the person registered can cease to register when he wishes, but would not register after he had entered employment.  When for any reason those who are registered cease to renew their registrations and thus go off the register, it follows that there is a decrease in the number of persons registered unless their places are taken by fresh registrants.  The main cause of the lapsing of registration is that the registered unemployed have found employment.  In the period in question, 3,337 of the persons registered were placed in employment by the local offices situated in the Athlone area and no doubt many others found employment through their own efforts.  It is probable also that many of those registered as unemployed in the winter time, being farmers or farmers' sons, are now engaged in the spring operations and, therefore, are not for the present unemployed nor available for other employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent it might be regarded as seasonal fluctuation, but only to a minor extent.  The decline in the number of registrations is mainly due to the fact that persons formerly registered have got employment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether any special circumstances operated in the Dublin and Dunleary registration areas between the 2nd January and the 27th March to increase the number of persons registered as unemployed at the local offices in these areas by 1,306; and what were the circumstances which caused the number of persons in receipt of unemployment benefit to be reduced by 1,362 between these dates although the number of registered unemployed had increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase of 1,306 in the number of persons registered as unemployed at the Local Offices of my Department in the Dublin and Dunleary areas, which include Arklow, Bray, Wicklow, Athy, Baltinglass, Droichead Nua, Edenderry, Kildare and Trim, is due to normal fluctuation. The personnel of the unemployed changes from day to day.</P>
      <P>The decrease of 1,362 in the number of persons in receipt of benefit in the same areas is due partly to the exhaustion of their rights to unemployment benefit and partly to the normal movements of claimants into employment before their benefit rights were exhausted.  The total number of persons registered as unemployed includes claimants to benefit and claimants who have exhausted their rights to benefit normally continue to register as unemployed if they continue to be unemployed.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the figures for 3rd April, which the Minister made available only <Col N="168" /> on 24th, show in respect of Dublin area alone a further increase of 58 unemployed persons and a further decrease of 154?  Is the Minister aware that the increase in the number of registered unemployed at this time of the year in the area mentioned in the question is unprecedented under any administration other than a Fianna Fáil administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is possibly aware that the situation is in many respects unprecedented.  Persons are now registering for employment at labour exchanges who did not register heretofore.  They are registering now because employment is being made available for them, whereas, heretofore, it would be useless for them to register because employment would not be available in any case.  There are normal fluctuations, but the main reason why the increase in the number of registrants took place over a considerable period of last year was, in the first place, the additional facilities made available for that purpose and, secondly, the definite prospect of getting employment following registration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that he is completely misinterpreting the figures so far as the City of Dublin is concerned; that while he may excuse the figures for the rural areas by the contention he advances and by reason of the fact that the policy of his Department has prevented county surveyors from taking on men direct, as they were able to take them on before, in the City of Dublin, there is not the additional type of registration to which the Minister refers?  These figures, therefore, indicate a definite increase in unemployment which can be found in the streets of Dublin.  That increase is unprecedented and I ask the Minister to go further into the situation.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo; (Minister for Local Government and Public Health.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate last night, I had drawn the attention of the Minister to some of the reasons which I believed were responsible for creating the situation which the Minister is seeking to deal with now.  I expressed the view that unification was not the best way of meeting the situation. I said that we had embarked upon an experiment in unification of which nobody had experience and that the difficulties which had arisen might have been overcome partially by amalgamation and partially by extension of the Old Age Pension Scheme if and when possible, as also by a readjustment, if necessary, of the contributions of insured persons.  Seeing that the Minister has decided to make an experiment in unification, our business is to make such suggestions as may assist him to make unification as successful as it can be made.  The Dáil should bear in mind that, no matter what form unification takes, some of the approved societies are going to suffer.  Certain approved societies, by prudent management, have accumulated satisfactory surpluses and are in a position to give extra benefits by way of dental and optical treatment as well, sometimes, as a higher rate of sickness benefit than their neighbours give. Some societies, by the peculiar character <Col N="170" /> of their membership, have been in an exceptionally favourable position. We must bear in mind that both these classes of society are going to be brought down and not up to the statutory rate of benefit.  That should be constantly present to our minds when examining the details of the scheme which, I have no doubt, the Minister will open more fully in the course of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point that arises is as to how the employees of the approved societies and the national health insurance system, as a whole, are to be dealt with.  The scheme in the Bill is not one of superannuation but of compensation.  In my opinion, that is a mistake.  Some of these men and women have been working for 21 years in the approved societies.  They are so circumstanced now by the lapse of time and by the fact that the best years of their lives have been given to this service that a lump sum in compensation is not an equitable way of meeting their claims.  There is a good precedent in the Railway Acts of 1924 and 1926, in the Blessington Tramway Act and in the Electricity Supply Board Acts.  Superannuation on a much more generous basis was provided under these Acts than the compensation proposed in this Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be well to consider the desirability of changing this part of the Bill in Committee Stage and of accepting the scheme proposed by the approved societies representatives who met and considered this question.  That scheme is, I think, based upon the legislative precedents we had here for superannuation.  The Minister, speaking in 1929 on the Committee Stage of the National Health Insurance Bill, referred to these precedents.  He moved an amendment there in connection with the compensation of secretaries and other officials of not less than five years' service whose income from other employment did not exceed £200 and he based his scale of compensation on the Railways Act of 1924. He approved of that as a fair and reasonable precedent for the scale of compensation that should be adopted in connection with a Bill that Deputy <Col N="171" /> Mulcahy was then steering through the House.</P>
    <P>When we consider compensation we have to consider the classes into which the employees will be divided for the purpose of seeing whether they are eligible and to what extent they shall be eligible for compensation.  It seems to me that they fall broadly into four classes.  One is the whole-time employee who has no other source of income and is in the direct employment of an approved society. The next is the part-time employee of an insurance and approved society. That class can be sub-divided because I think you have men who are directly on the pay roll of the approved societies for part of their time doing national health insurance work and part of their time on the pay roll of the insurance companies.  Then you have another type of employee who is in the employment of insurance companies who are members, for instance, of the Irish Amalgamated, and who are doing the national health insurance work on foot of a contract with the Amalgamated Society, that contract having been approved by the National Health Insurance Commissioners. In that case I think the insurance companies receive a lump sum from the Amalgamated Society and they arrange for the routine national health insurance work to be done by certain members of their staff and these men are part-time.  Part of their wages is paid out of this lump sum that the insurance company gets from the Amalgamated Society for doing the work.  Whether the Minister will consider these men are entitled to compensation, in the event of their suffering as a result of the abolition of the Amalgamated Society, is a question which I would like him to speak about later on.  The next class is the part-time rural agent who derives the greater measure of his income from his work as an agent of a national health insurance approved society and who is provided for in the Bill.  The fourth is the same class of agent whose revenue is not largely composed of earnings as a national health insurance agent.  I understand <Col N="172" /> that these men are not going to get any compensation.  I am not yet quite clear as to who is to be the deciding authority as to whether a rural agent is in fact deriving the bulk of his income from his agency or from some other occupation.  Probably the Minister will take occasion to explain that later on.</P>
    <P>The actual proposal made by the Minister is in Section 21 and I submit to the Minister that that is a departure from precedent for which there can be little justification.  I cannot imagine why the Minister has extended the five years period which he himself sponsored two years ago to ten years under the Bill.  In that regard I sincerely trust that the Minister will hold himself open to an amendment which will involve the national health insurance funds in very little additional cost, and which will set right what would seem to be otherwise something amounting to a grave injustice. In that connection we should also bear constantly in mind that the proposal for a more generous scheme of compensation under this Bill will lay no burden on the taxes or rates of this country.  The compensation or superannuation proposed by the Bill will be borne by the savings anticipated by the Minister under the unification, and in dealing fairly with these men we are not asking people who are gravely embarrassed by other circumstances in the country to contribute anything more by way of taxes or rates.  This is going to be a self-supporting scheme which will be in a position to pay its own superannuation without looking to the Central Fund or any other Government fund for assistance.</P>
    <P>The compensation is to be on the basis of one-eighth of the annual remuneration for every completed year of qualifying service.  I hope the Minister will consent to reduce that period to five years and I do not think he would be going too far if he went on to give a person who had completed five years' service, who was about to be compulsorily retired, to whom he was not prepared to offer any alternative employment, one year's salary in lieu of notice.  I think the equitable proposal would be that the figure there <Col N="173" /> should be reduced to five and that the fraction should be increased to one-fifth.</P>
    <P>In sub-section (2) (b) a very arbitrary restriction is introduced.  I cannot conceive the frame of mind of whoever proposed it for the Minister's consideration. It reads: &ldquo;In case such person has ten or more completed years of qualifying service, a sum not exceeding in any case three times his annual remuneration, and subject to that limitation a sum calculated on the basis of one-sixth of his annual remuneration for every completed year of qualifying service.&rdquo; That means that you are going to give credit for 18 years as the maximum service, that the man who was in this business since the beginning, who did all the spade work, who did the difficult work, who got the machine going, who unravelled the multitudinous complications that existed in the early stages of national health insurance work, is not to be compensated for the three years in which he worked hardest.  My experience, if I might say so with all respect, of the Minister for Local Government in handling legislation in this Dáil gives me encouragement to hope that it is only necessary to draw attention to a matter of that kind to ensure that the point will be met on the Committee Stage and what seems to be a serious injustice removed.</P>
    <P>When I say that, I am advancing arguments on the basis that the Minister will not consider the proposal which I believe to be really the only means of doing full justice to these people and that is by superannuation. The bulk of these employees will not come under this provision at all, because the great majority of them will be taken over.  They will have to be taken over in order to make it possible to work this scheme at all.  But I am suggesting that those who are not taken over should have the option of a fair and even a generous measure of superannuation and I am convinced that if he is prepared to accept that point of view he will remove from his path what is otherwise going to be a serious difficulty and a cause of grave discontent amongst a body of men and women to whom the State owes a <Col N="174" /> material debt for hard and unostentatious work.</P>
    <P>Another question arises which, it may be, is capable of explanation.  My study of the Bill may have been inadequate to get the information I look for here.  I can find no guarantee in the Bill that a person at present employed by an approved society will be offered any degree of permanency in his employment after he is taken over, or that he will be offered a position approximately the same as he had before he was taken over.  I raise the point now in order to give the Minister an opportunity of dealing with it at the conclusion of the Bill.  What consolation is it to a man to be taken over on Monday and dismissed on Saturday?  The Bill as it at present stands entitles the unified society to take over the employees of an approved society and dispose of them in a month's time, thereby depriving them of their rights under the Statute.  I fully appreciate that the unified society would not intentionally or fraudulently deprive men of their rights under this Bill, but at the same time I will suggest a case to the Minister whereunder that very difficulty could arise.  Before doing that I should like to draw his attention to this point.  Under the terms of this Bill, what is to prevent the unified society from notifying the secretary of an approved society that they are going to take him over and give him a job as claims clerk?  What is to prevent the administrators of the unified society from taking over a man who has been 15 or 20 years secretary of an approved society, controlling the activities of dozens of claims clerks and ordinary clerks, and offering him a position on a stool beside one of his most junior officials?  Surely that is not justice.  Surely in drafting a measure of this kind we should ensure that if we take over an official compulsorily&mdash;because if he does not consent to come over he sacrifices his right to compensation&mdash;we should provide that he will get a position in no sense inferior to the position he enjoyed before being taken over, and that if we offer him a position inferior to that which he previously enjoyed he will <Col N="175" /> have a right to compensation or superannuation in accordance with the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I respectfully submit that we should further provide that where we take over an officer from an approved society he should have the right to the compensation or superannuation which is provided in the Bill if he is dispensed with for any reason other than that stated, misconduct, within, say, two years of his being taken over.  A situation may arise in which an officer is taken over by a unified society and after he has been at work for six or twelve months the officials responsible for the unified society may say &ldquo;this man's competency or temperament does not suit the work we have available for him, and in the best interests of everybody it would be better to superannuate him and get in a man who is more fitted for the job.&rdquo; So long as we make fair provision for that, no one can complain; but a situation of the greatest difficulty will arise if the responsible officers in the unified society take over a man in good faith, give him an alternative position, and then discover that while he was suitable for the particular kind of work he had in the approved society the work that they have made available for him in the unified society may be entirely unsuitable to him; they are married to him for the rest of his natural days, or else they must dispense with his services and leave him without any of the benefits available under this Bill.  I feel that a discretion should be given here, unless we are prepared to face the danger of serious injustice arising in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go at length into the superannuation proposals that have been laid before the Minister. I think many Deputies have had copies furnished to them.  They are exceedingly long; it would take me practically half an hour to deal with them exhaustively, and that is quite unnecessary, because the Minister is well aware of the details proposed. Most of the Deputies interested in this legislation have also studied the proposals, and I think will agree that, taking everything into consideration, <Col N="176" /> they are equitable and fair. They are completely supported by precedents which have already been established by this House, notably the Railways Acts of 1924 and 1926, the Blessington Steam Tramway Act which was passed by this Government in 1932, and the Electricity Supply Acts of the relevant years.</P>
    <P>The Minister may rest assured, so far as I and this Party are concerned, that we believe that that scheme is the one calculated to best serve the interests and the purposes he has in mind.  We are, however, in no sense desirous of blocking or hindering him, and any information or co-operation we can give him, we need hardly say, is at his disposal.  We would urge him strongly to accept the superannuation proposals, but in the alternative&mdash;if after mature consideration he feels that that cannot be done&mdash;we ask him to consider favourably the amendments which it is our intention to put down for the purpose of bringing the compensation proposals which he has incorporated in the Bill more into line with what we believe will be equity, not to speak of generosity.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I conclude from some of Deputy Dillon's remarks that while disapproving very definitely of the proposal to have a unified society, he proposes to give a benediction to the Bill, and, I think he said, to give his assistance in every possible way to the Minister to make it a success. When he speaks of the scheme before the Minister, I take it that he refers to an alternative scheme for compensation, rather than to any alternative scheme put up by the association of approved societies for dealing with the difficulties of the approved societies other than by unification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to make that clear.  I said that I regarded unification as an unjustified experiment, and that I would prefer amalgamation, but that if the Minister had made up his mind to that form of Government policy I believed the next best thing was to do everything I could to help him to make as great a success as possible of unification.  The reference I made to the approved societies' proposals was <Col N="177" /> to their superannuation proposals, which, I think, have been submitted to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy then would appear to fall into the frame of mind which Deputy Norton has fallen into when he says: &ldquo;The State, as part of a general policy, have decided on unification.&rdquo; The attitude is that when the State, whoever that is, has so decided, there is no purpose&mdash;even when dealing with the Bill on Second Reading&mdash;in opposing the thing which you consider is not the proper thing. However, I have apparently interpreted the Deputy aright, and I would suggest to him that it is an unreasonable stand to take, because he says that he will assist the Minister in every possible way he can to make the unified society a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill says in Section 4, sub-section (3), that there shall be three men, and in Section 10 it says that they shall scrap the whole present business. Later on it says that they shall hand it over to a committee of 15 members. Those 15 members shall be composed of three persons nominated by the Minister, I think, as trustees, three persons nominated by him as representative of the employers, and nine persons elected by the members of the unified society, that is that having scrapped the original idea of having a Seanad election for the whole country as in the Constitution, we are now to fall back on that for the purpose of electing nine members from an electorate of 491,000 to run this important piece of machinery, which affects the well-being, as Deputy Morrissey pointed out last night, of a tremendous number of people in the country.  The present number affected is 451,399, according to the figures given by the Minister yesterday.  What assistance the Deputy can give the Minister in saying that things are going to be run along the right lines if we give approval to that particular principle, I do not know.  I hope he will be able to give some assistance, as I submit it will be wanted.  I think the House has considerable reason to complain of the small amount of information given it by the Minister in his introductory speech. On an earlier occasion, on the 1929 Bill, the Minister went at length over <Col N="178" /> a considerable amount of ground covered by the Report of the National Health Insurance Commission.  In doing so he rather disclosed that he did not favour either unification or nationalisation, that he simply favoured simplification of the organisation in some way.</P>
    <P>Now, when he comes to present proposals for dealing with the difficulties, he tells us that unification is both feasible and necessary.  We got no information as to the lines upon which the new society is to be organised, so that we may see to what extent it is feasible, with due regard to the necessities of all parties concerned, to carry out the unified scheme that the Minister proposes at the present stage. He tells us it is necessary.  But he does not tell us for what particular object it is necessary, and what are the financial reasons which press him to do it.  The only information he gives us is the necessity, financially, for unifying all the societies, pooling all their resources, and all their prospects. He points out that on the 1923 valuation there were a certain number of societies representing a membership of 378,821, which had a surplus of £626,811, and that there were other societies to the number of seven, with a membership of 29,213, with a deficiency of £13,163, making a net surplus of £613,000 odd for a membership of 407,944.  He informed us that the actual surplus earned in the five years period 1918-1923 was £50,000.  As the Minister stated, when the next valuation came on for the year 1928 there were ten societies, with a membership of 117,000, in deficiency to the extent of £51,000, and 73 societies with a membership of 291,000 which disclosed a surplus of £513,626, and generally that the societies as a whole during that year lost £50,000.  We have no means of knowing what all that means.  It is on that information we are asked to say that the general machinery of the societies should be scrapped and the whole business unified.</P>
    <P>For instance if we look at the Minister's statement that the actual surplus earned in the five years period 1918-1923 was £50,000 and compare it <Col N="179" /> with the Report of the National Health Insurance Commission issued in 1928, we find that it was possible as a result of the five years period to have a disposable surplus that gave increased non-cash benefits to the extent of £162,000, and increased cash benefits to the extent of £145,992.  There was a total capital sum of disposable surplus of £308,000 for the subsequent five years, with which to give additional benefits to the extent of £48,800 a year, out of what the Minister says was the actual surplus in the period of five years 1918-1923 of £50,000.  If the surplus of £50,000, which is the point the Minister lays stress upon, was able to keep the societies generally in the position of spending £48,800 every year for five years in additional benefits who could figure out what the additional benefits after 1928 would be when the £50,000 earned is turned into £50,000 of a loss?  I am completely unable to estimate it.</P>
    <P>That is the information upon which we are asked to base a decision to wipe out all the insured societies, and the further information that, I think, the Minister gave yesterday, that he referred the present position to the actuary and asked him to make a forecast as to what the position would be at the end of the present quinquennial period in 1933.  I think the Minister told us that he got the report.  At any rate he suggested that he asked the actuary to report whether a financial breakdown was not approaching.  My recollection is that he gave some figures and indicated that the actuary thought so.  But although that actuary's report is supposed, in the minds of the Minister and of the Executive Council, to ring the death-knell of these societies, no single paper in the country thought it worth while to print what exactly the death-knell sentence was.  If the Minister has a report from the actuary forecasting what the financial position of the societies is likely to be at the end of 1933, I think we ought to see a copy of that report, or some rather elaborate details from it.  As against the gloomy picture suggested, the Minister made some reply to a question by <Col N="180" /> Deputy Broderick yesterday, and, on the face of the figures quoted by him, I think the House could scarcely of itself come to the conclusion that the whole position with regard to national health insurance was in the position the Minister suggests.  The House would require some gloss on the information the Minister has given and some explanation of it.</P>
    <P>The figures given are an extension of the figures with regard to national health insurance given in Tables 105 and 106, page 93, of the Statistical Abstract, 1932.  We are told that the number of persons actually insured has risen from 436,159 in 1931 to 451,399 in 1932.  We are told that the contribution of employers has risen from £554,110 in 1931 to £610,392 in 1932, or by £56,000; that the State contribution has decreased by about £57,000, but that in spite of that the receipts for the whole year were almost on a level with the receipts last year&mdash;that is, that as against £1,028,927 for 1931 the total receipts were £1,029,110.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the increase in benefits was one of the things that created difficulties for approved societies.  The Minister told us yesterday that the benefits paid during 1932 amounted to £777,916.  That figure is below the average for the last three years.  We are told that at the end of the year 1932 the accumulated funds were £3,416,687, an increase of £155,000 over last year.  In fact, the increase in accumulated funds from 1928, when they were £3,004,375, was approximately £85,000 in 1929, £94,000 in 1930, £76,000 in 1931 and £155,000 in 1932. Deputies will want to know from the Minister what &ldquo;accumulated funds&rdquo; in connection with national health insurance imply with regard to the position of the scheme as a whole, and how an increase of £155,000 last year in the accumulated funds indicates that a financial breakdown is approaching.  Deputies who were members of the House when other national health insurance Bills were going through, Bills which made a considerable amount of improvement in the general scheme itself as well as producing economies, are aware that in the period 1921-22, following the <Col N="181" /> Great War, there was considerable unemployment in what was then the United Kingdom.  Legislation was introduced which gave consideration to the arrears that people were in, in respect of their national health insurance commitments as a result of being unemployed.  Certain arrears were excused, and what was called prolongation was introduced by which persons were kept as a burden on the national health insurance scheme although they had not paid their statutory contributions.  It was not until 1927 or 1928 that both excused arrears and prolongation of insurance were done away with here.  The quinquennial period ending 1928, in which there was this loss of £50,000, was a period in which, in accumulating number, there were up to 90,000 additional persons&mdash;names, at any rate&mdash;on the national health insurance scheme drawing a certain amount of benefit. We would like to hear to what extent the burden that was implied in excused arrears and in the prolongation of insurance was responsible in any way for the £50,000 loss on the quinquennial period ending 1928.  On the financial side alone, I suggest these are matters that must create anxiety in the minds of Deputies.  I am sure they would like to have them dealt with before they assent to a proposal which their own judgment and the experience of a lot of people concerned in this matter must regard as a wrong step to take.</P>
    <P>Then, again, there is the position with regard to the societies.  It is a fact that there are societies in nearly every part of the country that have made good.  There are big societies in a good condition and big societies in a bad condition.  There are small societies in a good condition and small societies in a bad condition.  Probably it would be found that there are more big societies in a bad condition than there are small societies.  This is a very serious problem that is under discussion. We think that the Minister, without pointing to any particular society, should in fairness take a bad small society and a good small society, and give us the benefit of the experience of the National Health Insurance Commission as to what created conditions <Col N="182" /> for the bad society.  In the same way I think he should give the House some information as to how it is that some big societies have flourished and given good benefits, and why some big societies have failed, because it is notorious, I think, that some societies have not been well managed. When deposit contributors as well as exempted persons were done away with, legislation was introduced to prevent societies refusing to accept a person who came forward for membership unless the applicant offended against any of the rules of the society that he claimed to join.  We ought to hear, I think, from the Minister whether the rules that are framed in connection with certain other societies have been the cause of making them flourish and of making other societies fail by driving into them what might be regarded as the less desirable class of applicant.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves what is the intention of this Bill.  Is it to give the ordinary benefits and the extended benefits that some societies have been able to arrange?  For the 1928 quinquennial period it was possible for some societies to give not only additional cash benefits but dental benefits in a dental hospital, medical and surgical appliances, optical benefits, payments in hospitals to nurses and so on.  Deputy Norton spoke of one society that he was connected with that gave very elaborate benefits.  On the subject of societies it has been possible to run societies successfully in the Counties of Sligo, Monaghan, Longford, Westmeath, Galway, Offaly, Tipperary, Limerick, Kildare, Wicklow, Cork.  As a matter of fact there have been outstanding cases of small societies&mdash;as many as three in the City of Cork&mdash;with a membership of 9,000 or 8,000.</P>
    <P>Again in the City of Waterford there is a society with a membership of 8,000 and two in the City of Dublin, one with 11,000 and another with 6,000, that have made, as far as we can tell, an outstanding success of the scheme.  I should like to hear from the Minister whether the three outstanding successes in Cork, as distinct from the successful societies <Col N="183" /> there, were societies who simply took in select classes or whether they were societies that were open to receive every applicant.  If it is possible for societies in Cork and other parts of the country to run their business successfully, I think in making a sweeping change like this, and in doing it in such a drastic way, we should hear something as to why other societies could not have succeeded as well as those which did and that we should particularly hear why those societies which have been well run should now suffer reductions in the benefits their members are going to get, for the purposes of amalgamation which is supposed to bring about efficiency and economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton considers that it is unfair that persons in one society should receive better benefits than those in another.  If you take successful societies or, at any rate, societies that are supposed to be successful, such as the Distributive Workers and Clerks in Dublin, the Tramways and Omnibus Employees in Dublin, the Dublin Typographical Provident Approved Society, the Dublin Operative Plasterers' Society, the National Amalgamated Bakers' National Health Insurance Society, the Irish National Painters' and Decorators' Trade Union, the Great Southern and Western Railway Employees, the Dublin United Brassfounders, I should like to hear from anyone on the Labour Benches whether these societies are to suffer in their benefits, in cash or otherwise, in order to make up for the bad running of the Irish Trade Union Congress Health Insurance Society.  While Deputy Norton may complain about the Minister not giving him information enough to enable him to judge of the financial position, I suggest very definitely to the Deputy that he is able to find what the position of these societies is in the City of Dublin.  The Minister simply having made up his mind that he is going to have a unified society even if he has a majority of one, and possibly that he has the benediction of the Labour Party in the matter, if he does not want to go into the elaborate detail that no <Col N="184" /> doubt would be necessary to make the situation a little plainer to the House, I think in all fairness to the workers in the City of Dublin that Deputy Norton might let us know whether in fact those people in societies in the City of Dublin, whom I have named, are going to be called upon to make sacrifices to make up for the bad running of the health insurance society run in the name of the Irish Trade Union Congress.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Morrissey who asked what exactly was behind this scheme.  I should like to be assured that it is not simply that the Irish Trade Union Congress are getting themselves and their prestige out of a difficulty by using the Labour Party here to support the Minister's sweeping and, for him, no doubt, easiest possible proposal.  On the face of it there is some suggestion like that.  I think the Minister should also tell us why it is that some of the bigger societies are in a bad position.  As I say, the situation is a very complicated one.  No doubt it could be reduced to a certain number of very simple statements with regard to successful societies and failure societies, or a few simple statements with regard to finances.  We should have also some statement from the Minister as to what his objective is in the matter of providing those benefits with which the national health insurance legislation was originally intended to deal.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was dealing with the National Health Insurance Act of 1929, he said, as reported in col. 95, volume 32, of the Official Reports:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Because these two things have been ignored, because the Government for the time being has not thought fit to deal with them, we ask that the amendment be adopted (that is the amendment not to agree to the Second Reading of the Bill) and that the Government be asked to reconsider the Bill, and bring it in later, including in it some scheme of simplification or unification but certainly medical benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister had previously said as reported in column 94:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The two big things that appeal to us, and on which we would like to do all we could to impress on the <Col N="185" /> Ministry the desirability of holding back this Bill for the purpose of reconsideration are the questions of simplification of the organisation&mdash; unification if you like or nationalisation&mdash;but simplification with the reduction of the cost of administration and the inclusion of medical benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The matters of big national import that we think ought to have been dealt with courageously by the Executive are the two I have mentioned. They have been ignored; the Executive for one reason or another decided not to legislate upon them but to ignore the recommendations of the Committee and the clamant demand that I think we have evidence of from insured persons&mdash; the inclusion of medical benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister was not quite convinced at that time as to the desirability or necessity for unification.  He wanted simplification and above all he wanted the inclusion of medical benefits.  Now, we have his Bill before us.  It says that we are to have unification.  He wants powers to say: &ldquo;Let us put three men in charge, let them scrap the whole system and let them put up something else.&rdquo; We are not told anything of the benefit which the Minister anticipates will be available for the general body of members under such a society.  Deputy Norton tells us that the present payments from members themselves, from employers and, I suppose, from the State, are not sufficient to give the present benefits.  We should, therefore, hear from the Minister what benefits are going to be given.  Are they going to be given at the present price?  Above all, I think we should have some explanation as to why the Minister, having changed his mind on the question of unification as against simplification, does not give us any real indication as to why unification is necessary.</P>
    <P>Again, I think we should know why the Minister has dealt with this Bill and said nothing about medical benefits which he thought of the utmost importance, of such great national importance, in 1929.  In view <Col N="186" /> of what the Minister has said and in view of the little information he has given us now and the small analysis of the general situation, as distinct from the effort he made to deal with it on the last occasion on which we were dealing with this measure, it seems to me that the Minister has got tired of the difficulties in front of him and says: &ldquo;For goodness sake, will you get me three men to scrap the lot and put up something else?&rdquo; He is simply taking a leap in the dark and, for all the information he has given us, we are asked to take the same leap in the dark.  I suggest to the House that the interests of 451,000 persons and what national health insurance means to them, are such that the House ought not to take that leap in the dark.  They should get more information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan Mr. P. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): The only thing I learned from Deputy Mulcahy is that the ghosts of his former misdeeds in the Department of Local Government are coming to hand.  That is probably the reason why he objects to amalgamation by unification.  The ghosts of the amalgamation of the public institutions, the effects of which we are trying to repair to the present day, surely haunt the slumbers of the ex-Minister and probably induce him to object to this scheme of unification that is before us.  The great difference I noticed between the two main speeches from the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches in respect of this measure&mdash;the difference between the speech made by Deputy Mulcahy now and the speech made by Deputy Morrissey yesterday evening&mdash;was that Deputy Morrissey plumped for nationalisation and, in that way, he showed his clear understanding of the problem facing insurance in the Free State to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of personal explanation, I said that, as between unification and nationalisation, I should far prefer nationalisation, which is the better of the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little difference.  He plumped as against this for nationalisation.  Deputy Mulcahy did not tell us what he would do at all in the present chaotic state of <Col N="187" /> national health insurance.  He did not tell us whether he was in favour of holding the present societies, of amalgamating them, as, under his own administration, I think, was attempted, or whether he is in favour of nationalisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I said: &ldquo;Tell us about the chaos?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy was long enough in the Department of Local Government to know what is the position of national health insurance at the present time.  If he does not, he cannot expect me to endeavour to inform him at this stage.  There is, and everybody who spoke, including his colleague on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches who spoke yesterday evening, said that there was, a serious problem facing national health insurance to-day, a problem that had to be faced.  The Minister has faced it in this fashion and the one regret I have is that the Minister did not go the whole hog and nationalise national health insurance, which would be the best course, and which, in the end, would solve the problem completely. This measure will not solve it at all.</P>
      <P>I do not know what arguments the Minister would put up against nationalisation but let me put this one argument to him, that, in the matter of unemployment insurance, you have a national scheme dealt with by a Government Department and paying benefits under a Government Department, with officials who are civil servants and with all the advantages that such a system gives to the people who are being paid.  You have 294,847 people affected by that scheme and, in the operation of national health insurance, you have over 450,000 people and, surely, if it is necessary to have nationalisation in order to deal with unemployment insurance for nearly 300,000 people, it ought to be equally good, equally sufficient and equally necessary in order to administer national health insurance properly where there are 450,000 people concerned.  That is an argument that the Minister should sleep on and see if he cannot see the wisdom of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> While everybody admits that there is a financial problem facing national health insurance, I think that very few people have analysed the problem properly and fully.  I said here on several occasions when discussing national health insurance estimates that the actuarial estimate on which national health insurance was based was fallacious and wrong.  I think that when you look at the two accounts presented on all occasions, you will find that, where there is a deficit, the deficit is on the benefit side and that, wherever you find a surplus, the surplus is on the administration side.  That is, so long as the surplus is allowed to stand as a surplus but, human nature being what it is, the administration accounts very rarely present a surplus, so that, therefore, that is one of the reasons why national health insurance at the present time is in the bad financial position it is in.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the position of noncompliance. I hold and I believe that compliance could be furthered much better than it is at the moment.  I believe that sixty per cent. of the people who are liable for national health insurance are not paying national health insurance and when you look at the figure of 300,000 people paying unemployment insurance and realise that there are only 150,000 more paying national health insurance, you realise that there is a discrepancy somewhere which has to be accounted for.  The number of people liable for unemployment insurance in this country is small relative to the number of people liable for national health insurance and the mediæval methods employed by the Department concerned in endeavouring to secure compliance is one of the causes for the chaotic condition of national health insurance at the present time. Sometimes a file six inches thick has to be procured in order to secure a sevenpenny stamp.  These are mediaeval methods, and, if the Minister would look into some of these things, he would possibly find some reason for the present chaotic condition of national health insurance other than in the offices of the approved societies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> This is a very far-reaching measure which involves a good deal for 450,000 people.  We propose in this measure to take 450,000 cards twice a year; we propose to issue 450,000 arrears cards; we propose to pay something like £800,000 a year in benefits; we propose to collect certificates&mdash;I cannot give the exact number of people drawing benefit&mdash;from a large number of insured persons who are drawing insurance and we have to issue record cards and to make 450,000 records in a unified society here in Dublin.  What is going to happen in the interim? What is going to happen to the benefits of the people while this is being brought about?  How are the people who are looking for their 15/- &mdash;even their 15/-, apart altogether from the increased benefits&mdash;and the £2 benefit going to be affected?  I should like to hear the Minister on what is the machinery by which this is going to be brought about.  It is machinery with which, to a great extent, I am concerned.  Certificates come up here to a unified office.  Whom are the cheques going to be sent to? How are they going to be delivered and with what dispatch and how soon are they going to reach the people who are in need of the benefit?</P>
    <P>That is a very important question. I would like the Minister to tell us what is going to happen in that transition period and how he is going to expedite it.  The position at present is this: in the local societies you have payment weekly or fortnightly. You have certificates readily available and the cheques are readily available in a week or a fortnight. What will happen now in the transition period while the unifying of the societies is going on?  There may be very great hardship to the people entitled to sick benefit.  I am anxious to know about that.  I would like the Minister to give us some information with regard to the transition and as to what machinery he proposes to set up to keep the Act in operation during that period.  A good deal has been said with regard to compensation. I think the Minister does not fully realise the hardships he is going to inflict owing to the small compensation <Col N="190" /> to be paid.  The compensation to people of long service should, I think, be based on a pensions scheme.  I hope the Minister will consider that matter fully.  In the case of agents I do not know how it is to be proved whether those people get the greater part of their income from their insurance work.  I know that a great many of them get what is not only a very large portion of their income from the societies, but what is a very large part of their livelihood.  Then as regards officials there are large corporations acting here as approved societies.  They are in reality large insurance companies approved for the purposes of the Act.  Is it supposed that the secretaries of such a corporation, who are nominally the secretaries of an insurance society, are to be compensated while people who have done the spade work of the societies are to be ignored?  Officials of approved societies do practically what is Government work, but with none of the advantages and protection which are extended to Government employment. Now it is proposed to dispense with their services and to give them the minimum amount of compensation, and to some none at all.  I ask the Minister to consider those people who have built up national health insurance without Government help.  I ask him to consider the position of agents who are endeavouring to eke out a precarious existence, as agents, but which meant a good deal to them.  I ask the Minister what is the position of secretaries of those insurance corporations to which I have alluded, which have become approved societies for the purposes of national health insurance.  And again I would ask him to give us full details as to the machinery he proposes to set up in order to secure that no one will suffer in the interval between the coming into operation of the unifying society and the present system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy quoted the Minister as saying that this measure was feasible and necessary. I suppose it is feasible, but I, for one, do not realise the necessity for it.  As <Col N="191" /> to the necessity the Minister says there are 60 or 70 solvent societies with a membership of 200,000 or 300,000 people, and eight or ten insolvent societies with a very much smaller membership to be dissolved, and one society inaugurated from these 80 odd societies good and bad.  That appears to be what the Bill proposes to do.  I should like to ask the Minister this: Is there going to be any guarantee, in the Bill, that the solvent, efficient and well-conducted societies are going to derive any benefits from this measure? I am not concerned with what is to become of the seven or eight insolvent societies.  This Bill seems to me to be a measure not to rob Peter to pay Paul, but to rob Mick, Pat and Bridget, and the rest, in order to pay Paul.  I should like if the Minister could tell us definitely to what extent the solvent well-conducted societies are going to benefit by this Bill.  It is not sufficient to tell me that they will lose nothing and that they will get the benefits they at present receive.  That will not be sufficient for the people down the country; and it is down the country the solvent societies are to be found.  The people in the country will not be satisfied with the Minister's assurance that they are going to lose nothing.  We want it to be proved that they are going to gain something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in the southern portion of Ireland a good number of small and middle-sized societies, which are solvent societies, and some of them giving extra benefits.  Is the Minister going to scrap all these and leave us, not at the mercy of the gods, but at the mercy of 15 or 16 picked men who are to control insurance in this State when this Bill becomes law?  The Minister quoted numerous figures.  He went so far in that direction that I believe the House did not actually follow him. Some Deputies on his own side rather ran away from the Minister's figures, if the Press reports are right to-day. But one can almost prove anything by figures.  An actuary might even undertake to prove that this Bill of the Minister will be successful when it becomes law, but no actuary, and no set of figures are going to prove to the members of the small societies in <Col N="192" /> Limerick, Cork and other places, which at present are paying benefits and doing good work, that they are to gain anything by this Bill.  Those of us who represent counties in which these solvent societies exist must be in opposition to this measure.  Unfortunately, also, in this Bill there is no security for the insured person as regards facilities for looking for his ordinary benefits.  Proximity means a good lot to the ordinary insured person. It means a good deal to the humble insured person, in the country, to know that his society is near at hand.  He will have no trouble in going to the office of his society and he is generally successful in working out his case.</P>
    <P>In a central society he will not have those facilities.  Apart altogether from the argument one might put up against what are the financial benefits that will arise to anybody&mdash;if there are going to be benefits to anybody, and I do not believe that there will be, except to one or two societies which are in danger of breaking up&mdash;there are the benefits of proximity to your society which members of many societies are in possession of at the moment.  These are not light matters. They cannot be disposed of lightly.</P>
    <P>There is also, as Deputy Hogan pointed out, very inadequate provision for the officials of all the societies.  It is unfortunate that officials of societies, and there is a great number of societies which were well and successfully managed, are now to be put on the scrap heap with practically no security for future employment.  My sympathies are wholly with the officials of these solvent societies.  As far as the insolvent societies are concerned, the less said about their officials the better.  They might have managed their societies efficiently and not left to the Minister the necessity for producing this Bill.  But there will be great hardship for the officials of small societies down the State who ran their businesses successfully and who will be, because of the passing of this measure, thrown on the unemployed list without any security of employment and with very inadequate compensation.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say very much <Col N="193" /> more on the measure except to ask the Minister again to give us some assurance that the members of the solvent societies will be guaranteed a benefit&mdash; an increased benefit&mdash;by this amalgamation; not a benefit equal to what they are already receiving, because that would be no case for the scrapping of these societies&mdash;they want and they must get a guarantee from the Minister that their conditions will be improved by this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>To a great extent I find myself in agreement with all the speakers who have dealt with this Bill. It is with regret that I realise the necessity for it because, I think, the Minister has found that the loss on the administration of the societies has got very serious&mdash;so serious, in fact, that it has to be dealt with drastically.  I do not suppose any of us are in favour of centralisation, if it could be avoided, I think we are all in favour of decentralisation. But there are times when decentralisation does not work out economically.  We have to look on this question not from a parochial point of view but from a national point of view. If it is proved to us that the work of health insurance, as a whole, all over the State, is in need of drastic retrenchment, I think that we have to face that fact and to accept any measure which may be taken to meet it.</P>
      <P>I have before me at the moment the report of one of the local societies referred to by Deputy Bennett, and I think it is a great pity that such a society should have to be amalgamated. It is a society that is solvent and, as a result of good management, has been able to increase its benefits enormously. It gives medical benefits, dental benefits and optical benefits.  It provides surgical appliances and hospital and special surgical treatment.  I hope that, in the measure before us, such benefits will be retained for the people.</P>

      <P>It would be a great hardship to the people if they were to be deprived of these benefits.  I am not in favour of centralisation at all but, forced as I am to realise that there <Col N="194" /> has been a very serious loss all over the country, I must admit that there is no other way out of it.  Perhaps a way could have been found if it were possible to have societies such as this one to which I have referred established instead of those which were losing money and badly managed; but apparently that was not possible.</P>
      <P>I would also plead for the officials. I know many officials who made societies such as this solvent and who gave perhaps 20 years of their lives to making these societies solvent. These officials were in close touch with their members.  They knew them all and knew their circumstances, and it is due to the fact that they did know them so well and were so well acquainted with the circumstances of the members that they were able to prevent a lot of fraud and to so administer their societies that they were able to give these increased benefits.  There is always the danger in centralisation that the administration will not be, shall I say, so sympathetic; and that very often hardship will be caused by men who will act merely as officials and who are inclined very often to leave the human element out and to look at everything from a purely official standpoint.  I think that the men who were acting as officials are deserving of consideration and I appeal to the Minister to give them every consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the statements of the Minister leave us rather in a difficulty in understanding what is the necessity for this measure.  I take it that, apparently, the Government have found themselves faced with almost insolvency in certain of the societies and with a very wide range of benefits between the best and worst. When I say the best and the worst, I do not mean necessarily the best and the worst managed; but I mean those that are able to pay the greatest benefits or the least.  How does the Government propose to deal with them?  First of all, they suggest centralisation. Centralisation, for certain things, is very good; but they have been certainly against centralisation in industry and more than once have expressed themselves dissatisfied with <Col N="195" /> the way things were scattered around the ports.  Why should they centralise these societies?  Apparently, the idea is that if unification takes place, the maximum benefits now obtained by some will be replaced by the maximum benefits for all.  In other words, the lesser benefits, which are paid by some of the larger and insolvent societies, will be all that can be paid for the whole country.  Why are the Government carrying out this step and in this way?  There is, apparently, injustice, according to the Government, when people have gone into societies organised according to political opinions or to crafts or to various other matters, which had nothing to do with health insurance, but that have been organised along these lines, should then find widely different benefits paid to their members. But, surely, the members have a right to a say in the matter themselves? Those were the societies they wanted to join and which they contracted to join.  I would suggest to the Minister that the saving that will be made by amalgamating the societies will be more than offset by the difficulty in dealing from a central source with members that are scattered up and down the country through various classes, et cetera, of the community.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made a point about various crafts and Deputy Mulcahy read out a list of the various craft societies that are in Dublin and that are well managed.  Surely everyone knows that when you get together persons of the same class it is much easier to find out opinions and it is much easier to do justice to them.  In such circumstances persons would understand the particular trade with which they were dealing, and injustices would be much less likely to arise when you have an official who has been brought up practically for a generation with the members of a society and who fully understands the particular craft involved or the particular political views that might be expressed by members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that what the Minister is going to gain in economy by centralisation he is going to lose by reason of <Col N="196" /> the discontent that will be engendered when particular people have to deal with a head office at long range and possibly through a person who does not understand the precise complaint that the insured person may have to make. I suggest to the Minister that, people having made their contracts, they will be far more satisfied to be left alone and they will feel disinclined to be arbitrarily switched from an approved society, the members of which they know, to a soulless organisation.  They will dislike being obliged to forward forms to Dublin, endeavouring to get their grievances redressed through the post or on the telephone.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister if he has considered, as a solution of the financial end of the problem, extending the period for the redemption of the reserved values. This has already been done and possibly if it were done again it might do away with the existing financial difficulty.  A point that strikes anyone who has to deal with national health insurance cards and the licking of stamps is why the unemployment card and the unemployment contribution are not used to check each other; in other words, why one card is not used for both, utilising possibly one stamp, a fixed percentage of which would go part to insurance and part to unemployment. I suggest that might solve some of the difficulties that Labour Deputies have in reconciling the numbers that ought to be insured.  All this goes to show that the Government have not deeply considered this matter and have not introduced a scheme calculated to simplify, to economise and to improve the lot of the insured person.</P>
    <P>I have purposely made no reference to the position of the officials of the various societies.  Personally, I do not think they are being fairly treated.  I take it that on the Committee Stage extensive proposals will be made for the Minister's consideration with the object of doing away with the more obvious injustices to officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret that I was not here when the Minister was speaking.  I am always very <Col N="197" /> interested to hear the Minister for Local Government and I would be particularly interested to hear what defence he had to make for this Bill. I was present when Deputy Goulding was defending the Bill.  I was rather interested to hear him, as an opponent of centralisation, defending this Bill. It was rather interesting to see the Deputy standing up to defend centralisation in this instance.  The position was certainly peculiar.  One of the things that makes me curious about this Bill is exactly in what interest it is introduced.  We all can agree that the position of insurance societies in the country is, in spots, in a rather bad way.</P>
      <P>In order to meet the situation we have the proposals contained in this Bill which are more or less to the effect that societies that have made good, societies that are efficiently administered and that have taken pains and generally done well in the financial sense should pool their profits with the other societies that have not done so well and, from the ashes of the whole lot, the good and the bad, one central society should emerge.  I think that is a very bad headline.  I think it is a very unworthy example to set.  It is certainly a bad precedent.  What it means in effect is that consideration every time will be given to the individual or the organisation that goes bad; consideration will be given every time to him or it at the expense of those that have made good.  I consider there is just a little bit too much of that going on and to perpetuate that state of affairs in the insurance life of this country, really at the expense of the solvent and well-managed insurance societies and, in the long run, at the expense of the insured people, is carrying things a little bit too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next consideration is the position of the insured persons, the ordinary two-legged or one-legged individual who goes around the country.  Everybody knows, and particularly the person moving around the country against the ordinary insured people, that the one protection the insured person had up to this was the right of transfer.  If the insured person did not get fair <Col N="198" /> play in one society he could always hold up his head and say: &ldquo;I am not getting fair play.  I will transfer to the next society.&rdquo; That was in fact the only guarantee that the ordinary insured person down the country had that he would get fair play.</P>
    <P>There was the other thing also and that was that they were living close up against the administrators, that they were living close up against the people who managed their county insurance society or the small society functioning in their county.  The human element entered into the matter.  There was a certain knowledge as to the human element in the society.  Now the proposal is to remove that human element, to replace that human element by a great machine.  We will have officialdom in the bottom, we will have officialdom in the middle and officialdom in the top.  We will have no humanity.  We will have a big mass of red tape. We will have official efficiency at the expense of the insured human being. I regard the whole proposal as being monstrous, as being rather inhuman and as being certainly unsuited to the conditions in this country.  That, as far as it strikes me from my point of view, is the position of the insured person and that is how it will strike him.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the official worker, the agent particularly in the districts that have been in competition with others, societies that either have made good or strived to make good, I consider that you have enshrined in this Bill the worst headline that you could put up before big agencies of employers in this country. You have enshrined in this Bill a principle that compensation will only be given to the workers who derive the maximum portion of their income from the work done for their society. If they have only derived 49 per cent. of their income from their efforts and labours for a particular insurance society, then because they derive only 49 per cent. rather than 50½ per cent. of their income they are unworthy of consideration, their efforts are to be forgotten and they are to get nothing <Col N="199" /> by way of compensation.  They are to be deprived merely of that particular source of income and forgotten.</P>
    <P>Those who may be regarded as the privileged classes under this Bill are merely to be entitled to compensation and not continued employment.  I consider that that is a disastrous headline. A person who is making good in his job or work, be it a lowly job or a big job, a person who has been giving satisfaction and doing his work efficiently and laboriously and with success is entitled to a guarantee of continued employment.  Compensation and very modest and meagre compensation is not meeting the case.  If I interpret Deputy Good's remarks properly I agree with him that it would be much better, in face of the fact that certain societies are insolvent and that certain societies are going to be insolvent while other societies are solvent, that the whole situation will be better met by wiping out those insolvent societies and extending the scope of the well-managed and solvent societies.  If that is the proper interpretation of Deputy Good's remarks I heartily endorse his views.  I agree with the plea put forward by Deputy Goulding and I hope that the Minister will consider a plea such as that.  I think it would have been far better if the whole situation had been more extensively explored and the difficulties had been met by a gesture of approval for the societies that are well managed, giving them an opportunity of extending their scope and taking over areas covered by insolvent societies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised that Deputy O'Higgins regretted not having been present when the Minister introduced this Bill.  I believe if the Deputy had read the debates he would know that other Deputies spoke on this question, particularly Deputy Norton.  Deputy Norton, in anticipation, referred to various matters that would have been left outside by Deputy O'Higgins had he been here and listened to the speech.  Deputy O'Higgins started off by saying that this Government put a premium on <Col N="200" /> inefficiency inasmuch as they were forcing this unification measure owing to the insolvency of certain societies; and that that insolvency was bringing about a situation which meant that benefits were better in some cases and worse in other cases where the societies had not been well managed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer to that at all.  I confined my remarks to the wiping out of certain societies and the establishment of a central society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Deputy to argue on the line followed by other Deputies that because certain societies were mismanaged, or had become insolvent, those societies that are well managed were now to be put in a worsened position by this Bill.  I understood the whole argument of the Deputy to mean that we were putting a premium on inefficiency and that we were setting a headline in that respect. I say the Government's duties go further than that.  After all, approved societies are under certain legislative rights and there is the protection to the insured person to be considered. If the Government see a situation arising whereby there is danger of the insured person not being able to get his benefit; if that is becoming a danger surely it is up to the Government to interfere and to prevent such a situation arising, bearing in mind that the first consideration should be to the insured, and not to the country, as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. Deputy O'Higgins by his argument shows how little thought he has given to that matter, because if he had, he would not argue in that way.  The Deputy argued that one of the guarantees to the insured person was that if he did not like a society he could shift into another society.  The view of the Government is that if anybody finds that the company he is in is insolvent he ought to be protected holus bolus from insolvency and from being in an insolvent company or society.  Then, again, if persons in societies that were insolvent were all to walk out and to join another society <Col N="201" /> and make new claims on that society how would that society, being as it would, in the position that it had not built up the necessary resources, be in a position to meet the claims of these transferred persons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask a question? The Deputy says that if everybody suddenly came to the conclusion that a society was insolvent and made up their minds to go into another society so and so would happen. Surely if the whole population made up their minds that the society they were in was insolvent, then there was no other society to move into.  It was a case of a mass move by the whole population of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is taking it a little bit far.  First of all, the Deputy knows that benefits can only be claimed when disability or sickness arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They can transfer whether they are sick or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>They can transfer for the purpose of having better security in the event of disability or sickness. That is what I mean, as the Deputy knows very well.  The Deputy does not seem to realise that unification will mean a step towards greater security and solvency.  Personally, I should be better pleased if I had seen a Bill introduced which would nationalise the whole service and put it on a par with unemployment insurance.  But the scheme under this Bill is better than the present position, so far as the public are concerned.  The Deputy also argued that, from the humanitarian point of view, there was great security for the insured person in being insured in an approved society, which might be a craft society or, as Deputy Dockrell said, a political society, where the insured person's complaints would be better understood. I did not know that political complaints would allow a person to draw benefit but perhaps the Deputies opposite have discovered a new source of illness or complaint which entitles persons to benefit either by way of permanent or temporary incapacity.  The Deputy who <Col N="202" /> has just spoken surely knows that there is a Department of State for the purpose of refereeing as between approved societies and claimants.  When a claimant is certified by a dispensary doctor as being unable to work and entitled to draw health benefit and when that person is turned down by an approved society, as happens in many cases, he has a final appeal to the Department of Local Government, who have a court of referees.  In many cases, the decision is against the approved society and it is instructed to continue to pay benefit, so that the humanitarian consideration of belonging to a society of one's pals in a craft or persons with the same political outlook, as Deputy Dockrell said, does not apply at all.  Unification will secure more uniform working from the point of view as to what is to be reckoned disablement and sickness.</P>
      <P>The Deputy dealt with the section which fixes the compensation to be paid to employees of approved societies who will become disemployed through the instrumentality of this measure. I agree with those who have pleaded for further consideration of this matter.  I was hoping that, as a result of the appeal made by Deputy Norton yesterday, the matter would be left at that and that when we came to the Committee Stage we might hear something in that regard from the Minister. I can understand the plea in the case of Deputy Norton but I cannot understand it in the case of Deputy O'Higgins.  As Deputy Norton pointed out yesterday, if you examine the clauses of the Electricity Supply Acts dealing with compensation, you will find a sad story.  If we were to follow the headline set there, it would be worse than the position of affairs under this Bill because, in that case, the State confiscated the whole system of electrification, took away the livelihood of people, under local authorities in many cases, and yet the scale of compensation allowed was absolutely miserable.</P>

I have not the figures as to persons insured under the national health scheme, but I am sure the Labour Party would be able to give an approximate estimate.  I do not believe that half of those who should be contributing to the national health scheme are contributing.</P>

      <P>I do not get up and volunteer information that I happen to be a member of an approved society.  I do not hold forth as if I were looking for transfers of insured persons. Every Deputy does not get up and tell us what he knows or what he does not know.  Deputy Morrissey can say that I know nothing about this service. That is only his opinion.  I could say that, in my opinion, Deputy Morrissey knows very little about it, but I do not say that.  I leave Deputies to judge for themselves.  As I was saying, I should have liked to have seen nationalisation for the reasons introduced by Deputy Dockrell.  I do not believe that it would mean a very great addition in the way of extra officials or of bookkeeping, because practically the same system would do.  I am, however, very glad to see this unification measure introduced by the Government, because if a time should come when the society under this measure gets into a position where it could not give the standard benefit, the State would have to come to its assistance and contribute what would make it solvent, which is not the position that exists to-day.  For that reason alone I am glad to see the Bill introduced.  I hope some time to see this Government or some other Government nationalise this as one of the essential social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope and believe that the Minister will give the suggestions made by Deputy Norton his consideration.  As Deputy Norton says, it is very hard to expect men who have been carrying on a certain kind of work, even if they do get a few hundred pounds compensation, to feel sure that their future is secure.  I believe that in the present state of affairs some consideration should be given to them either in the shape of alternative employment on the same basis as at present or that some other basis of compensation should be found.  My experience of people who have been put out of employment by Government legislation, whether they received a lump sum in compensation or a small pension, is that they have become useless to the State and to themselves and a burden on their families.  I hope in that connection that the Minister will give <Col N="206" /> serious and sympathetic consideration to the points suggested by Deputy Norton.</P>

      <P>Most of the criticism I desired to make has been dealt with more or less by Deputies who have spoken.  I had the advantage, unlike Deputy Hogan, of listening to the Minister introducing the Bill.  I followed his statement carefully and certainly I failed to see any justification put forward in his speech for the introduction of the Bill.  He quoted no doubt a great many statistics as to finance and so on, and the reason for the introduction of the Bill apparently is, that the financial scheme on which the present system is based has more or less broken down.  If there is any form of national service or activity in which de-centralisation should be the principle on which it would work, I would say that it is this system of national health insurance.  We are losing by centralisation the work of the voluntary workers all through the country on these committees who have given their time free.  We are losing the human touch, which has been referred to in the administration of this branch of national activity.  We are losing all that, and we are substituting for it a machine.  I do not use the expression &ldquo;machine&rdquo; about the Civil Service in any depreciatory sense, but every big Department of our Civil Service as a body, or any big branch of it, necessarily works by routine and, if you like to put it that way, by a system of red tape.  That would be very injurious to the interests of the poor people who are the beneficiaries under the national health insurance scheme.</P>

    <P>There will be necessarily a certain amount of red tape in administration. There will be a lack of the human element, the local touch, the local knowledge as to people's requirements. All claims will have to come to the central office in Dublin to be signed and countersigned; inquiries will have to be made; cases will have to be remitted to the country for further inquiries, and instead of getting relief immediately, as under the present system as worked by the approved societies, there will necessarily be delay.  Instead of getting benefit in a <Col N="207" /> matter of a few days, the people will sometimes have to wait for weeks. These are the defects in the scheme proposed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I would advise the Deputy to do that, and I decline to answer an impertinent and an irrelevant question from the Deputy.  This will result, as I say, in tardy administration.  Deputy Hogan, and I think other speakers, referred to the pooling of the resources of the societies.  Some of these societies are, no doubt, in a bad way financially owing to causes that were alluded to, I think, by Deputy Norton. The personnel of a good many of these societies belongs to a class of people amongst whom unemployment is more or less rife, at least more common than amongst other classes, and also amongst whom sickness is more liable to occur.  These societies, through no fault of their own, owing to that kind of personnel, have become insolvent and not able to give the benefits given by other and more fortunate societies. That is not in itself, I submit, a sufficient justification for levelling down the societies that have been doing good work and giving good benefits to their members.  That is not sufficient ground in itself for levelling down and taking the resources from the prosperous societies and pooling them with the lack of resources of the poorer societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal has been said on the subject of compensation and a good many appeals have been made to the Minister to reconsider his scheme in that respect.  If he decides to go on with this Bill in its present form and to centralise the system of national <Col N="208" /> health insurance, I do join with those others who appealed to him to reconsider the terms of compensation outlined in the Bill.  He will have an opportunity of doing that before the Committee Stage is reached.  I think there is a breach of elementary justice in the proposal that people who are only part-time employees for national health insurance work are to get no compensation whatever.  Deputy Norton referred to the case of a man who was earning £1 a week at one occupation and 15/- at another.  That man is to get no compensation for the loss of three-sevenths of his income. I say that is a breach of elementary natural justice and that it should be seriously reconsidered before the Minister decides to go forward with it. Fifteen shillings per week out of 35/-, as Deputy Norton pointed out, is a very serious matter to a man of that income.  It means reducing him from a position in which he, at all events, can buy food to practically a condition of starvation.  In respect of the rosy views taken by the Minister and his colleagues as to chances of future employment in this country, I suggest that employment for these people will be very difficult to get.  Employment is not becoming easier to get in any country, and certainly not in this country. With our increasing population, even if we have a good deal of the prosperity that some Deputies on the opposite side expect, there will be a largely increased number of young people to be provided every year with employment.  Men who have been a number of years at this national health insurance work are necessarily not very young now, and it will be difficult for them to compete for new employment with the young people growing up.  I submit that a man who spent part of his time, even though it was not his principal occupation, at this work has the same right to compensation for what he loses as the man who loses the whole of his employment.</P>
    <P>Allusion was made to the scales of compensation given under previous Acts.  The Minister for Local Government himself in 1929 when a scheme of this kind was before the House made an appeal to the then Minister to consider <Col N="209" /> more generous terms than were outlined at the time.</P>
    <P>I think that there is practically unanimous feeling on all sides of the House that the Minister, in dealing with compensation under this Bill, should do that too.  Allusion has been made to the terms of compensation in various other Acts.  We had the Railway Act of 1924, and the Railway Act of 1926, which amended the former Act as regards compensation.  Under those statutes, first of all where there was a complete loss of employment, a system of compensation was provided. In the adoption of amalgamation the House made it compulsory on the railway companies that a man should also be compensated if he was required to perform duties not similar to the duties he had formerly performed, or if he had an unreasonable addition made to those duties.  He was to be compensated if he suffered any diminution in wages, or in emoluments, because railway workers apart from wages had other rights and benefits which were of some peculiar advantage to them.  The Government in 1924, in passing that Act, and in the Act of 1926, was so mindful of their rights...</P>

      <P>Any one who was placed in a worse position by reason of the amalgamation scheme was entitled to compensation.  A scale was laid down, and no such limitation was put on the number of years' service as is proposed to be put here.  Here the maximum number of years' service to be taken into consideration is 18.  There was a more generous provision made in the Railway Act of 1924.  I do submit to the Minister that, when he comes to reconsider&mdash;as I hope he will&mdash;the terms of compensation, he should give terms at least as good to the employees of the national health insurance societies as were given by the late Government in 1924 and in 1926.  I think that the Minister should have informed the House as to how he considers that the work of national health insurance will be benefited by the change he proposes to make.  Although he quoted figures and statistics as to the funds and finances of the societies he did not give us any estimate as to what economy was likely to be effected by this scheme.  He did not inform us how many new positions, with salaries attached to them, will be created by reason of the passing of this Act.  I should also like to know whether it is the intention of the Minister to give those appointments to persons who were already engaged and skilled in the work of national health insurance. There are a great many matters of that kind with which I think the House is entitled to expect the Minister to deal when he comes to close this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that might be considered is that under this scheme the collecting agents will disappear, and that they were persons who were extremely useful in carrying on the work of national health insurance.  They were the people who went around and who saw that persons who were insurable were insured.  They did everything that could be done by them to get new members into the societies, and to secure compliance by employers with the provisions of the law.  Those <Col N="211" /> people, who were in close touch with the workings of the societies and with seeing that there was compliance given by the employers, will disappear under this scheme.  They will disappear in the crowd of other people who are not whole-time workers in the national health insurance, or who are not principally employed in that work; they will disappear also without compensation. I hope that the Minister will deal with these various matters when he comes to close the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPatrickKelly" hpid="Mr. P. Kelly Mr. P. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard a good deal this evening about what the unified society will not do for the insured members.  In fact, we are told that the unified society, when it becomes an established fact, will not be able to give any benefits to insured people. We are told that very many societies had surplus valuation, and that as a result of having that surplus they were unable to give extra benefits to their members&mdash;dental benefits, hospital benefits, and so forth.  I should like to point out to the House that those societies had no guarantee that at the end of the next valuation period they would be in the happy position of being able to provide those extra benefits for their members.  Societies that had a surplus in 1923 had no surplus in 1928; other societies who had no surplus in 1923 had a surplus in 1928.  There was no sense of security so far as societies were concerned as to what the future would hold in store for them.  A well-managed society did not necessarily mean a society that was being efficiently run, nor on the other hand did what has been mentioned here as a badly run society necessarily mean a society that was run by inefficient officials.  A wave of illness for a prolonged period over a district, or for one or two years, would make all the difference as to whether a society would be solvent or insolvent, or whether it would be considered an efficient or an inefficient one.  I might say that practically no societies have made good except those which had the opportunity of selecting as their members people who in ordinary <Col N="212" /> life were not open to the same source of infection and sickness as others. Even though extra benefits were paid by societies which are in a good position, there is no guarantee of what will happen at the end of the next valuation period.  As the Minister pointed out in his statement, the increased benefits paid during the last seven or eight years show that in the near future, if matters are allowed to go on as they are, these payments will become so heavy as to result in the bankruptcy of practically all the societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that people should have the opportunity of transferring from one society to another, if they were dissatisfied.  When people transferred heretofore, I take it that they did so mostly for selfish reasons, because a society was in the position that it could pay more benefits than another society, or because they might have been dissatisfied with some decision of the committee.  In Section 30 of the Bill the Minister has power to decide any disputes that may arise between the unified society and its members.  The members will consequently have a greater guarantee of security, and all the unnecessary time, labour, expense, and cumbersome machinery that had to be put into operation in the case of transfers will be unnecessary.  We have been told that payments will be reduced to the level of 15/- per week, the ordinary statutory benefit laid down.  The Minister gave no indication that the amount of the benefits would be reduced.  He stated that the benefits that were being paid would continue up to the next valuation and that societies paying 17/- or 18/- weekly, and giving dental and hospital treatment, would continue to do so.  Can any Deputy guarantee that after the next valuation the societies would be able to do so?  It is quite possible that after the next valuation the unified society, when all the assets and liabilities are taken into consideration, will be in a position to increase the benefits, and that 16/-, 17/- or 18/- a week may then be the standard rate.  I think we may safely take it that dental treatment and <Col N="213" /> hospital treatment will then become universal for all insured people, instead of for five years as was the case heretofore.  Previously people who received dental treatment often found that they were unable to get the full treatment to which they were entitled.  I take it that there is every possibility of the standard rate being increased and of extra benefits being given.  Some Deputies on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches deplored the fact that some small societies are being wiped out.  But amalgamation was the policy to which that Party was favourably disposed a couple of years ago, which would have resulted in smaller societies being swamped by the larger ones.</P>

      <P>It was suggested that part of the difficulties with regard to societies in a bad way could be overcome by allowing them to be amalgamated, leaving 15 or 16 societies. Having 15 or 16 societies necessarily meant that the larger ones would swamp the smaller ones.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Eventually it would turn out in that way.  In this particular service centralisation will not do the same amount of harm that centralisation of other State services could do. If it leads to more efficiency in dealing with the insured people, and if it gives better benefits, there will be no cause for complaint.  We have been told that the insured people in the country districts will be compelled to send their certificates to Dublin, and will have to wait for a fortnight or three weeks for their benefits.  The Minister did not state what machinery would be put into operation, and did not say whether people will be able to get their benefits weekly or fortnightly.  I will withhold judgment in that matter until I hear the Minister's reply.  As to compensation for officials, I will also wait to hear <Col N="214" /> what the Minister has to say regarding the suggestions that have been thrown out.  The unified society will overcome the difficulties experienced hitherto of having a proper collection of the stamped cards, and full compliance with the Acts.  Many large societies and many small societies were operating in each district, and there was overlapping, the result being that it was difficult to get statistics and to know who was insured and who was not insured.  I take it that the unified society will be able to find out the people working in a particular area and see that their cards are stamped. There will be, I hope, a better response in regard to compliance with the Acts, and generally a better appreciation of the merits of insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it more difficult, as the days pass, to understand the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Looking at this Bill from a reasoned point of view, the only future that one can foresee for it is that it will do grave harm to the worker.  Instead of doing what has been suggested, namely, increasing benefits for all, it is bound, as far as one can humanly see, to lead to a general decrease in benefits.  The worker is the person who will be bound to suffer.  It is almost impossible to foresee anything different.  The case made by the Minister rests entirely on this fact, that certain societies, the large ones, show actuarially a deficit; that certain others, the small ones, show considerable surpluses, and that by pooling all he proposes to get rid of the deficit with some and reduce them all to the same level&mdash;those that have been able to meet their liabilities fixed by Act of Parliament at a certain standard, above which the small societies were able to pass and which the larger societies have not been able to pass.  In other words, instead of what we have just been told is likely to occur, the very reverse is likely to occur&mdash;of all being reduced to the one common level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried to argue that the position with regard to the small societies, hitherto, was due to some selective power.  I do not think for a moment that that can be substantiated. <Col N="215" /> Figures show that such selective power as they had has always been exercised to a very small extent.  One society that I happen to know something about &mdash;it happens to be in a favourable position largely because of the prudent manner in which its affairs have been managed and by not using its surpluses to outbid other societies by offering excessive benefits&mdash;has never exercised selective preferences to the extent of refusing anything like one per cent. of the applicants.  Such a refusal could not have affected its funds to any serious extent.  Even if all the applicants had been accepted the final result would not have been very different from what it is.  The real point is this, that the small societies, because of the very valuable voluntary help given in connection with their working, have been able to look after details in a way that a big society cannot do.  That voluntary help has been of the greatest value so far as the finances of the society are concerned. These small societies, by provident and prudent management, were able to establish themselves in a sound financial position before they undertook the giving of extra benefits at all. The Minister is now proceeding by this Bill to wipe away the results of that providence and prudence.  I cannot imagine that he will do anything more than stop for a time the financial difficulties that seem to me to be bound to follow the working of one large society.  It will be impossible in that one large society to look after details as they are looked after at present by valued voluntary workers in the small societies.  To speak quite plainly, it would be impossible to see that cases of applicants for relief, if feigned illness or illness which should not incapacitate a person from working, will not be met by grants, and it is these cases which make all the difference between financial soundness and financial unsoundness.</P>
    <P>I speak on behalf of the worker in this case.  It is the worker who is a member of one of those prudent societies of which I have been speaking who will suffer by this Bill.  The principle that underlies it is that the <Col N="216" /> good are going to be made pay for the bad in order that all may be brought to one common level.  There is no justice and no sense in it, and no improvement is going to come to anyone.  The statutory benefits will be retained for those who are getting them at present. What steps will have to be taken in order to continue those statutory benefits for the societies which are in an unsound financial position is quite another matter, but it is not a reasonable or a just thing to throw the onus of doing that on societies which have hitherto, by their providence and prudence, established themselves in such a position that they are able to promise for the future benefits entirely beyond what the Act demands.  The last speaker said that the benefits given by these societies were going to be continued.  They are going to be continued until the present contracts expire.  After that it will be entirely a matter as to what the unified society will be able to do, and the unified society will only be able to do what its combined funds will enable it to do. It would be a miracle if its combined funds, without outside help, whether from the State or otherwise, enabled it to comply with the statutory demands. I do not suppose there would be much use in making an appeal to the Minister in this matter, but I do not think he quite considered the real meaning of the proposal that he has put before the House.</P>

Some people seem to think that, but it is a misapprehension.  The national health insurance fund as a whole is not insolvent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Big and small.  The Deputy seems to suggest that it is only the big societies that are insolvent. The number of insolvent societies includes some large societies and some very small ones.  It is not because societies are big or because they are small that they are insolvent.  The reason probably is that the demands made on the societies have been excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demands made on certain societies have arisen out of the nature of the societies.  You must remember that this system of health insurance is one that was not set up in this country after consultation with the people here as to what would be the best system of health insurance for the country.  It was set up in the British House of Commons by a British Act and modelled on the British system.  It was designed for a highly industrialised country such as Great Britain was and it would not necessarily follow that that <Col N="218" /> system would be suited to this country. As a matter of fact it was if possible the most unsuitable system of health insurance that could be applied to this country.  Our belief is that that is at the bottom of the trouble in national health insurance to-day.  It was suited to a society that was highly industrialised. Our country was anything but highly industrialised.  It was an agricultural country and the system was very unsuited to us.  At the time that health insurance was adopted in England and put into operation there it was designed to be built upon friendly societies of which there were many in England then, and there are now, some approved societies with a membership not alone of one million but some of them I believe up to 3,000,000 members. Why, the whole insured population under health insurance in this country is little more than 450,000.</P>
    <P>The system adopted here was not one that was best suited to this country. The fact is that the system of allowing people to insure in societies because of association in crafts or in religious societies or professional societies was not a proper basis for insurance purposes and was bound to lead to financial difficulties.  There are societies that have gone through the last 20 years, survived and come out of the trial well.  That can be accounted for by several reasons, one of which is that some of these societies are made up principally of the young and the vigorous people and in the case of others, because they have rules and regulations which enable them to select their entrants.  In some of these societies that rule has been availed of.  It may not be availed of in the society with which Deputy Thrift is acquainted but there are other societies in which it was availed of.  In that way the societies preserved for themselves and selected for themselves good healthy members.  If ordinary life insurance, fire insurance or ordinary insurance of any kind were to be built on the basis that the insurance society would need only to select the very best risks or the moderately good risks, there would be very profitable business but the <Col N="219" /> basis of insurance is that they have to take all and chance that the good risks will outweigh in numbers the bad and that they will make a profit in the end. It is because the system proved a failure in a great number of cases so far as these health insurance societies are concerned, the system having been set up on a wrong basis, that we are in the position to-day that we know ourselves to be in financially so far as a number of the societies are concerned. Some Deputy said last night that it was because of the fact that in the last two or three years economic conditions in this country had not been what they were hitherto, that certain societies were in a bad financial condition but that cannot be true, if we remember that as far back as the 1928 valuation it was shown at the end of that quinquennial period&mdash;and that was not as bad a period economically; the amount of unemployment was not anything like as great as it is now&mdash;by the actuary that the societies as a whole had made a deficit of £50,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, speaking last night, put in a plea for co-ordination of all social services.  That might be a very good thing to adopt.  He desires to have one comprehensive scheme to include not alone health insurance but workmen's compensation, unemployment insurance, perhaps old age pensions, other pensions like widows' and orphans' pensions and matters of that kind.  It is possible that if we were starting entirely on the new in this country, and with resources to enable us to pay all these pensions, that a co-ordinated system of that kind might be adopted, but this Bill is brought forward to deal with what I regard as a crisis that is likely to arise at the end of this year.  A very serious situation, certainly in the national insurance world, is bound to arise, and this Bill is an attempt to forestall or to meet that situation.  It is not an attempt to deal with all the evils and all the grievances that are alleged against the present national health insurance system.  The introduction of a co-ordinated scheme such as Deputy Norton suggested would necessitate a commission or committee of inquiry <Col N="220" /> and a long and elaborate investigation of social and economic conditions here. The national health insurance situation at the moment would not allow us to spend the time that would be necessary on that investigation if it were to be a proper and full investigation.  The situation was such that we had to deal with it knowing, as we did by the actuary's report, that the prospects at the end of this year are anything but good.  Some may say that it ought to have been dealt with earlier, that perhaps it should have been dealt with last year.  At any rate, even if it were dealt with last year, as far as I can see the method of dealing with this special particular difficulty would not be other than is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have this much in favour of the system of unification that we have adopted here that it was recommended to us by the Committee set up by the late Government in 1924, if feasible, and we believe that it is feasible.  That Committee was not set up by this Government; it was set up by the late Government.  It was a Committee of officials, mostly, with, I think, some members of the Dáil.  They were Professor Magennis, then a distinguished member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party; Sir Joseph Glynn, Mr. James Hurson, Mr. James Gray Kyd, actuary; Mr. McElligott, of the Department of Finance; Very Rev. Canon McHugh, P.P., another distinguished supporter of Deputy Mulcahy; Dr. W.J. Maguire, Civil Service Commission; Dr. Rowlette and Dr. Stevenson.  These gentlemen, in so far as they were not officials, were leading members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party when they recommended the adoption of this system.</P>

      <P>I should like also to point out that Deputy Mulcahy himself it was, as Minister for Local Government, who, realising the condition that national health insurance was in and was likely to be in at the end of this quinquennial period, sent urgently for the actuary and asked him to make a special investigation, and that he did in December, 1931.</P>

      <P>That is right.  The Deputy and his Government had so far neglected to deal with the situation that they themselves had to send for the actuary to help to get them out of their difficulty.  The actuary has reported.  We have his report and I agree with Deputy Dillon when he suggests that unification is a <i>pis aller</i> but this, I believe, is not the time when we can set about recasting the social services by measures suggested by some of the Deputies here.  The economic conditions are not such as to help us to arrive at the best conclusion and, as a <i>pis aller</i>, I recommend this unification. I do say this much, in addition, for it, that, if and when this House decides to unify the social services, if the House decides, possibly, after investigation, that it would be a wise thing to unify unemployment insurance, old age pensions and national health insurance, a necessary step would be the unification, first, of the approved societies associated with national health insurance.</P>

It has been stated in various ways that certain policies were pursued and recommended from this side, and none of the statements that have been made on that matter is actually the fact, but the Minister is now telling us that he is recommending unification.  He is pointing out that, in our time, we asked the actuary to report on the general situation, and I have suggested to the Minister that what we want made is some kind of a case for unification, and that we ought to have some details as to what the actuary did report.  I quite accept the Minister's statement that the general finances of national health insurance are fairly sound.  The figures he quoted yesterday, in answer to Deputy Broderick, indicate that, but what we want is the situation that necessitates interfering with the societies that are proceeding <Col N="223" /> satisfactorily now.  If the Minister has any kind of a conclusive statement from the actuary, I think the House ought to get it in the interests of the subject the Minister is dealing with.</P>

But you had surpluses in other societies of £335,000, so that if you joined them up together with a plus surplus of £335,000 you will get a net deficit of £280,000, and that leaves you a net surplus on the whole division of £55,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this final point.  The figures already quoted by the Minister, in reply to Deputy Broderick, show that payments in benefits have not been particularly excessive, and that the accumulations of the national health insurance are well up.  The figures that we got as deficiency for the year 1928 were £50,000.  I submit we want to get some kind of explanation as to where the £510,000 deficiencies in certain societies are going to come from.  It is little information to say, merely, that some societies will show a surplus of £335,000 and others £110,000.  There is nothing in the general figures that give information as to where that deficiency is to come from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the position to be such that if things were put together and you got one united whole it would not be financially unsound, but the last remark of the Minister seems to indicate that the whole thing would be wrong to the extent of £280,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>One other reason as to the cause of the present situation. There has been a steady increase in the annual expenditure and in the benefits.  In 1925 the expenditure was £550,000.  In 1932 it was £778,00.  The contribution income has increased, and is shown in the figures for 1925 when it was £478,000 and in 1932 it was £650,000.  That, certainly, is something that we are pleased with but we think that national health insurance, worked by a unified society, will get better results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister seem to say that it is about time to stop the general increase in benefits?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If we get an increase in clients when the societies are unified the whole society will bear and carry the burden that certain societies have now been carrying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How on earth does the Minister suggest that the approved societies have not acted in compliance with the Act?  Surely that is what inspectors are for.  I never heard of an approved society not in compliance with the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is anxious to get compliance with the Act is he not much more likely to get it if he allowed national health insurance to be conducted, voluntarily, rather than worked as a whole under the central society?  That seems to be elementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not our experience. There are towns in Ireland where there are as many as six different societies.  We would want to send inspectors into every house, and we have not got inspectors in every town in Ireland.  We can have, and will have, one way of knowing all this and that is by putting national health insurance under one unified society. You will then have one record kept for everybody in the town and you <Col N="228" /> will be in a position then to know those who should be contributing to that insurance.  You are not in that position now.  Mr. Morrissey seemed to think that with unification the administration would deteriorate.  We believe that the contrary will be the result and that not alone will the cost be considerably less&mdash;the cost of administration&mdash;with the abolition of the duplication and triplication that is going on all over the country owing to the multiplicity of societies and officials, but that you will get better compliance, better administration, and I, certainly, am satisfied that the officials and agents of the society that will be appointed in every town will act, despite what some people seem to think, as humanely and with as much interest in the individuals and in the health of these individuals as any individual official of a health insurance society has done up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there is a great number of officials&mdash;I do not know how many&mdash;but there must be a number of them to whom such an offer will not be made.  I do not know the number but there must be quite a number of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello, in the course of his speech last night, suggested that there would be injustice to individuals in the working of the unified societies.  I cannot see where the injustice to any individual would arise by reason of the fact that the individuals in national health insurance will be dealt with by the officials of one society rather than by officials of a number of health societies.  It is not, I think, the experience generally that, let us say for example, civil servants are willing knowingly to do injustice to any person in the State.  I have had cases put up to me by members of health insurance societies where they believed they were injured by the officers of health insurance societies. Probably cases of that kind will be brought to the notice of Deputies as a result of the activities of officials of the unified society, but I do not think that there will be any greater percentage of delay or hardship, and certainly no more injustice&mdash;if anything, possibly less&mdash;done to any individual subscriber to health insurance by an official of a unified society any more than by any official of the smaller societies.  There is a suggestion that injustice will be done to the members of societies who have been in the happy position of getting additional benefits.  Well, the Bill provides that up to the end of the actuarial period the full benefits will continue.  After that, it will naturally depend on what the financial position of the unified society is as to what benefits will be granted.  The statutory benefits must be given but I am quite satisfied that the unified society will be in a healthy position and, while it is probably true, as Deputy Thrift and others have said, that some of the very best societies and their members may not have offered to them the full advantages that they are getting now, and have <Col N="231" /> been getting for some time, their loss will be very slight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>But if you take the figures your actuary has quoted, the unified society could give no extra benefits anywhere.  Is not that clear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear.  I am not satisfied that some of the additional benefits will not be available by the unified society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>But the figures show a deficit of £50,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, even with that, possibly some of the advantages will be available.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey seemed to recommend amalgamation rather than unification. We considered the question of amalgamation.  We considered all the suggestions made at different times when the subject of national health insurance was debated here in former years.  When considering amalgamation we were at once brought up against the question of the weaker societies&mdash;who was going to take over their members.  We have had experience of attempts at amalgamation before.  The main point was who was going to take over the membership of the poorer societies.  No organisation with a surplus or in a good condition would be anxious to take them over. They would not like to take them over as a body; they would like to select them; they would like to go through the list of members and select those who they thought would be good lives.  We had no power to force any society to take over their weaker brothers and look after their interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>If this were going to benefit the members of the poorer societies I would not have said what I have said.  The members of the poorer societies must get certain statutory benefits.  Therefore my argument is that no other benefit can accrue to them.  The only thing that must occur is that the workers at present receiving extra benefits will forfeit those benefits and everyone will be brought down to the statutory level.  If what the Minister has <Col N="232" /> suggested is going to benefit the members of the poorer societies I would take up a totally different attitude, but it does not do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. What would happen these societies if, at the end of the quinquennial period, they were all in deficiency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is that course open to them but, after all, this is an insurance and a contributory insurance scheme, and the whole bottom would fall out of the insurance and the contributory insurance scheme if that were allowed to happen.  The other better off societies would be affected.  The whole scheme would have to be recast in all probability and the better-off societies would have to allow their benefits to be reduced as well as the poorer ones; they would all have to be brought to the lower level.</P>

      <P>With Deputy Dillon it would be my ambition, as Minister for Local Government, to bring in a Bill making old age pensions available at 65 years and to co-ordinate a lot of the social services and improve them in general.  I would like to be in a position to do a number of things of that kind that would be for the benefit of the old and infirm.  At the same time we have to take the measure of our own resources.  As with old age pensions and other pensions, so it is with insurance.  You cannot get more out of a pint measure than you put <Col N="233" /> into it.  Our resources are not illimitable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He is very ill.  I think I have covered all the points made except points with regard to the position of officials who will not be taken in under the new scheme, and who will have to be compensated.  There again it is a question of the measure of our possibilities. All this money for compensation has to come out of the administration fund, and there is a limited amount for administration.  You cannot have a new organisation starting off in a semi-bankrupt condition.  We have certain limited funds out of which to pay compensation.  We are trying to be as generous as our limited resources will allow us.  I am not arguing that these suggested measures of compensation are generous, but I do say they are as generous as our resources will permit.</P>
      <P>Many suggestions have been made as to how they could be increased and improved.  Before the Bill was introduced I went into the matter very carefully with the officials.  I saw what our resources are, and I saw the number of officials who will likely have to be compensated, and I tried to measure the compensation accordingly. There is one point on which, perhaps, we can afford to reconsider the matter, and that is the question of the years raised by Deputy Dillon and others. They objected to the limit of eighteen years instead of the full period of service.  We will give consideration to that point.  With regard to the measure of compensation, that is how we are tied up.  We are tied up because the administration fund is limited, and we cannot take more out of it than will leave a balance in the fund sufficient to enable the administration of the new organisation to be carried on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that it has been the practice of a number of men engaged in insurance work, particularly life insurance work, acting for societies having their headquarters outside of this country, to become also agents for some one or other of the national health insurance societies.  They used the national health insurance societies for the purpose of getting into houses and into touch with families merely to purse their own avocations and to help them in their own business.  Some of them used the national health insurance money to keep people in benefit in the industrial and life insurance companies.  That has been often found <Col N="236" /> to be a fact by the officials of the Department and we think it would be very unwise to allow the association of these two interests to continue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 38, at the end of Section 16 (1) to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(f)  prescribing the maximum overhanging length and width of goods carried on mechanically propelled vehicles and on vehicles drawn by mechanically propelled vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> The object of this amendment is to give the Minister power to prescribe regulations dealing with the size of merchandise which can be carried on motor lorries.  As the Minister knows, restrictions are necessary, particularly in areas where the roads are narrow, so that other road users may be facilitated.  All who use the roadways from time to time know that they occasionally meet lorries with merchandise which projects a considerable distance over the side&mdash;so far, in some cases, as to interfere with the rights of other road users.  This amendment is designed to enable the Minister to prescribe regulations to deal with that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy proposes to do can be done under paragraph (b) sub-section (1) of Section 15, which deals with the conditions under which vehicles may be used.  That enables the Minister to make regulations governing the use of mechanically propelled vehicles.  It was left wide in its terms, because we intended that it should be all-embracing, so that we could bring in what the Deputy wants and, perhaps, other things that he may not have in mind.</P>

      <P>In page 22, line 2, Section 40, after the word &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or producing his driving licence at a Gárda Síochána station in pursuance of the next preceding section.</P>
      <P>Section 40, as it stands, only enables a member of the Gárda Síochána to obtain a person's signature while he is in charge of the vehicle.  If he were taken into court or taken to any place where he had not his machine with him, the Gárda would not be in a position to ask for his signature.  We want to alter it in the fashion suggested so that we may be enabled to ask him for his signature in any place or at any time.</P>

      <P>In page 24, line 9, Section 46 (2), (a) (i) to delete the word &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;twenty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is for the purpose of allowing a double-decker to proceed at a rate up to 20 miles per hour.  The rate of 15 miles as at present is, I suggest, too slow.  The Minister has ample power under Section 47, if he finds that the speed of 20 miles for a double-decker is too great, to correct the matter. At present I think to keep a double-decker down to 15 miles per hour speed would almost interfere with cycle traffic on the road.</P>

      <P>In page 25, line 50, Section 50, to delete the words &ldquo;without exercising due care and attention or.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> As the Bill stands, there is some confusion between Sections 50 and 51.  In every case where a person drives a vehicle in a public place without exercising due care and attention we maintain that <i>ipso facto</i> he drives the vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public.  It is thought undesirable that such a case should be allowed to be dealt with as an offence of a less serious character such as Section 50 covers.  With this amendment, therefore, Section 50 will deal with less serious charges, such as driving without due consideration and so on.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The following amendments were agreed to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>5.  In page 25, line 51, Section 50, to delete the words &ldquo;other persons and vehicles&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;persons, vehicles, and other traffic.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In page 33, to add at the end of Section 66 (1), four new paragraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(d)  any person claiming in respect of injury to property sustained while such property was owned by or was in the possession, custody, or control of the insured or the principal debtor in the relevant document, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  any persons claiming in respect of injury to any weighbridge <Col N="242" /> or to any road or to anything in or below the surface of a road due to the weight of or vibration caused by a mechanically propelled vehicle to which the relevant document relates, and</P>
    <P>(f)  any person claiming in respect of injury to property due to an explosion of a boiler forming part of a mechanically propelled vehicle to which the relevant document relates or due to sparks or ashes proceeding from any such vehicle, and</P>
    <P>(g)  any person claiming in respect of an injury to himself or any other person in respect of which he would be entitled to claim and be awarded compensation or other relief under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1906, or any Act (whether passed before or after this Act) extending or amending that Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that under the amendment as it stands if, say, a postman going about his business in a post office yard was injured by a post office van, or if a local authority's ambulance drove over a nurse in an hospital grounds, these cases would not be covered by their insurance under this; that they would be driven back on to the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What we want to secure is that not alone should they have the Workmen's Compensation Act as a safeguard, but they should also be insured.  That is what we are anxious to secure.  I should like to amend sub-section (g) of the amendment by inserting after the word &ldquo;claim&rdquo; on the third line&mdash;&ldquo;any person claiming in respect of an injury to himself or any other person in respect of which he would be entitled to claim&rdquo;&mdash;the words &ldquo;against the insured or the principal debtor in the relevant document.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>15.  In pages 33 and 34 to delete Section 68.</P>
    <P>16.  In page 36, before Section 73, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Whenever an event occurs in relation to a mechanically propelled vehicle in consequence of which the vehicle insurer who issued an approved combined policy and guarantee or the principal debtor under an approved guarantee then in force in respect of such vehicle may become liable to pay money to any person, the person who is the driver of such vehicle when such event happens shall (unless he is himself the owner of such vehicle or the insured under such policy or combined policy and guarantee or the principal debtor under such guarantee or such event occurs in the presence of the owner of such vehicle) give to the owner of such vehicle, within twenty-four hours after the happening of such event, notice of the happening of such event together with full particulars thereof.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any person who, in contravention of this section, fails to give <Col N="244" /> to the owner of a mechanically propelled vehicle within the time specified in this section any notice or any particulars which he is required by this section to give to such owner shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The section as it stands provides that &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for a person on a bicycle or a tricycle in a public place <Col N="247" /> to take or retain hold of any other vehicle (other than a pedal bicycle on which no person is riding) which is in motion or of any person or thing on, in, or attached to any such vehicle&rdquo; without certain penalties.  It has been pointed out that that would prevent a cyclist who found himself with a cycling party, and who, say, broke a chain, from either getting assistance home or getting assistance in any way from a motorist.  It is not, I take it, intended to make it an offence to &ldquo;catch on,&rdquo; but to &ldquo;catch on&rdquo; in circumstances that would be dangerous. I submit to the Minister that the addition of the words here, so that it would not be lawful to do it without the consent of the rider or driver of such other vehicle, provides against hardship.</P>
    <P>Amendment 27 agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to take the ordinary motor car from under this section dealing with the limitations of periods of continuous driving.  I think the Minister explained that it was not so much his amendment as an amendment of Deputy Davin, and I think <Col N="248" /> that the Minister has taken Section 167 as it stands without the consideration that it requires.  The section was taken from the British Act originally, but it is more than that.  It takes a section from the British Act that deals with the continuous driving of a vehicle, say of a commercial nature, or of the public service vehicle type, and it applies those regulations to the chauffeur of an ordinary private person, doing professional work, or I might say domestic work.  Even as the section stands as regards public service vehicles, whether for passengers or merchandise, I think the Minister will find that as regards the five and a half hours in Section 1 (a) amending legislation has been introduced by statutory order or otherwise, in Great Britain, to extend that five and a half hours to eight and a half hours in certain circumstances; I think at the present time that there is an application to have it further extended to nine hours, and that the ten consecutive hours for rest provided for in Section 1 (c) has already been reduced to eight in Great Britain. The section as it stands takes the rather drastic limitation of hours applied in Great Britain to public service vehicles, and places that not only on public service vehicles but on the ordinary domestically occupied chauffeur.  The amendment I have down would exclude from the operation of that section a light motor vehicle, fitted with a body designed and constructed for the carriage of passengers.  I submit that it would be very nonsensical on our part to include vehicles of that particular kind under the regulations that are contemplated in this Section 167.</P>

Through an oversight the amendment was not ready for this stage, and I think we can have it inserted when the Bill is before the Seanad.

    <P>(i)  for every day during which the injured person is so detained the sum of nine shillings, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  for every such day a sum equal to the average daily cost per patient of the upkeep of such hospital with the staff thereof and the maintenance and treatment of the patients therein; and</P>
    <P>(b) where the injured person has received in such hospital in respect of his said injuries (whether detained or not detained in such hospital) treatment with any electrical or other special apparatus or treatment by means of massage, or treatment of any other such special kind, a reasonable sum in respect of such treatment, but not exceeding in any case fifteen pounds;</P>

    <P>On the Committee Stage, Deputy Sir James Craig had an amendment down, and after some discussion it was decided to have an official amendment. As a result we propose this amendment.  Deputies will remember that Deputy Sir James Craig's amendment was designed to put a limitation of £25 on the amount to be paid to hospitals.  On examination of the <Col N="252" /> section it will be seen that in its present form it does not carry out that intention.  Limit is only imposed in so far as a claim is restricted to any sum that can be paid for maintenance, subject only to the patient having spent a certain time in hospital.  In its present form the section is being criticised.</P>
    <P>While there is just ground for providing for patients <i>x</i>-ray apparatus, or some similar abnormal and costly methods of treatment, we do not think the same consideration covers ordinary injuries.  The section in its present form realises that the premium on motors may be increased, owing to the possibility of unreasonable claims by the hospitals.  In order to avoid this possibility this amendment is introduced.  Under the amended section the claim will be limited to £35.  If, however, special treatment or <i>x</i>-ray treatment is given a reasonable additional sum may be claimed not exceeding £15.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think it a prudent thing to authorise an hospital to set up litigation for the purpose of deciding if the price is to be 9/- or a sum based on the following computation:</P>
      <P>(ii) for every such day a sum equal to the average daily cost per patient of the upkeep of such hospital with the staff thereof and the maintenance and treatment of the patients therein;</P>
      <P>There might be 9d. per day at issue. What is the point of having 9/- or 8/- in the section?  What is the use of bringing in a complicated provision of that kind which, as Deputy Mulcahy says, may be seldom availed of and, if it is, would be a nuisance?</P>

How the Minister convinced the mover of the amendment in the Seanad that he was meeting his point by removing a whole lot of paragraphs and leaving the objectionable paragraph in, <Col N="256" /> I do not know, and he has not made any attempt to explain it here.  The Minister's explanation in the Seanad was that it would be better to leave in what he called the permanent, basic characteristics in this part of the Bill, and to deal with matters supposed to apply to this mixture at time of sale in a later paragraph.  My complaint is that the Minister should have taken out paragraph (d) altogether, or alternatively put it in a later section which deals with the requirements at the time of sale.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is difficult to determine whether the cereal was clean and was up to the prescribed standard. The quality varies.  There is no such thing as a standard in commercial use.  It is a matter of personal judgment.  This section is much the same as the one about millable wheat.  If you compel a miller to do anything for what is commercially sound you will want to have a lot of commercial definitions.  The paragraph should be deleted.  This is not for human food, but for feeding <Col N="257" /> for cattle.  No miller will put anything into the mixture except what he can sell.&rdquo;</P>

Certainly I read that as meaning articles which might have the appearance of food.  I never, nor do I believe did anyone else in the Dáil, apprehended that it included medicines of every kind.  It is under the heading of scheduled feeding-stuffs. I would be interested to hear from any other member of the Dáil that he understood that Schedule comprised what is ordinarily known as proprietary medicines in the trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to call attention to this change as being a very serious matter.  The Minister moved this amendment in the Seanad:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Government amendment: After the word &ldquo;stuff,&rdquo; in line 11 to insert the words &ldquo;or medicine.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He explained that in this way:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The provisions in the Bill are mainly to protect the farmer against victimisation by the sale of proprietary and other feeding-stuffs sold at exorbitant prices.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where that comes from I do not know because we were left under the impression that the purport and the aim of the Bill were to increase the growing of certain cereals in this country and it was, if ever explained to us at all, only as an incidental and very much a secondary matter, that the protection of people against exorbitant prices was included.  However that was the Minister's preamble: &ldquo;The provisions in the Bill are mainly to protect the farmer against victimisation by the sale of proprietary and other feeding-stuffs sold at exorbitant prices.  We have <Col N="259" /> come to the conclusion that we may not have included certain articles that might be sold as medicine, as appetisers or as flavouring agents which would not be regarded altogether as feeding stuffs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He is quite precise about this: &ldquo;We desire to have the word medicine included in the section so as to widen it as much as possible.&rdquo; I think he has achieved that last aim but we have got to follow out the repercussions of this.  This is the definition section as to what compound feeding-stuff is and we are told that &ldquo;the expression means any article for consumption by animals which is not a maize meal mixture and which is either&rdquo;&mdash;and then we come to the second paragraph in which the alteration is made&mdash;&ldquo;a feeding-stuff or medicine.&rdquo; Afterwards certain people are prohibited from selling, unless they have a licence, these compound feeding-stuffs.  We have it quite clearly from the Minister that he wants to include such things as drenches.  In the title we are told that it is an Act &ldquo;to make provision for the control and regulation of the businesses of milling wheat and other cereals in Saorstát Eireann with a view to the development of those businesses in the national interest and also to make provision calculated to promote and encourage the growing of certain cereals in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; I think we have wandered very far from that base in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Minister has in his mind.  There was some jade of an itinerant who came over to this country and sold round the country something which he alleged contained a high proportion of cod liver oil.  He got 21/- per cwt. for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Some preposterous figure from some silly people.  However if they were defrauded in the matter of feeding-stuffs they got their money's worth in common sense and experience. They learned once and for all the folly of dealing with tramps who call to sell them a hundredweight of Indian meal. The Minister's request however <Col N="260" /> for power to license the sale of cattle medicines and veterinary medicines seems to be extravagant and to be showing no sense of responsibility at all.  Some official no doubt who had heard of this itinerant merchant wandered up to the Minister and said: &ldquo;Look here, give us some power by which we can have a wallop at him if he comes back.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I did not use it; I sent it back as a matter of fact.  The instance Deputy Dillon has mentioned concerned feeding-stuffs, but you get medicines in liquid or solid form.  I should like to point out that the very day the Bill was introduced cod liver oil was mentioned, so that the point about the thing not being in solid form does not arise at all.  These drenches that are mentioned are supposed to consist of oil.  If we go from cod liver oil to some other form of oil it is very hard to draw the line.  Castor oil may be used in some instances.  That is <Col N="261" /> why I say that necessarily the thing must be wide in order to include all medicines if necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot imagine anybody going to the trouble of manufacturing these things except for sale, but the word &ldquo;sale&rdquo; is not in either of the two sections to which we are <Col N="262" /> referred.  Take the definition which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The expression &ldquo;compound feeding-stuff&rdquo; means any article for consumption by animals which is not a maize meal mixture and which is either (a) a mixture of two or more articles at least one of which is a feeding-stuff; or (b) a feeding-stuff which passes in commerce under the designation of a proprietary or protected trade name.</P>
      <P>Later on, Section 62, sub-section (4) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful for any person to manufacture any compound feeding-stuff unless (a) such person is a registered manufacturer of compound feeding-stuffs and (b) such compound feeding-stuff is manufactured (1) under and in accordance with the licence ... (2) and on premises in respect of which such person is registered in the register of manufacturers of compound feeding-stuffs.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;sale&rdquo; has been left out in all this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the proviso, &ldquo;which passes in commerce under the designation of a proprietary or protected trade name,&rdquo; extends the scope of the Bill far beyond the legitimate purpose of the Bill, and I do not believe for a moment that it would have been allowed to be introduced in this House as an ordinary amendment while the Bill was passing through.  Apparently it can be got in by persuading the Seanad to insert it and then brought in here now.  I suppose that these words &ldquo;under the designation of a protected trade name&rdquo; will protect the veterinary surgeon who compounds a bottle for a sick cow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course.  That would, of course, be an ordinary medicine in the Pharmacopoeia that he uses, and it would not come under the section in any way.  The import of compound feeding-stuffs and patent medicines is controlled, and the manufacture is also controlled but, in any case, the medicine must pass in commerce under the designation of a proprietary or protected trade name <Col N="263" /> before it could come under this section, so that the ordinary farmer compounding his own medicine could not possibly come under it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that this requires further consideration. Is he quite certain that it is not open to the dangers we have indicated?  I do not suppose that he is going to use it that way, but is it not possible that it can be used to prevent the person who is looking after animals and breeding livestock from mixing his own medicines if they are equivalent to what passes in commerce under the designation of a proprietary or protected trade name and to prevent him mixing these in his own premises unless he gets the premises licensed?  I think that the conjunction of the two clauses to which we have been referred indicates that that is the case, and it seems to me that the whole thing could be quite easily met by putting in something about selling.  Section 62 (4) deals only with manufacture, and I do not think there is a definition of manufacture in this as meaning manufacture for sale.  We have to fall back on the etymology of the word.  It is simply a preparation of certain stuffs and, in that event, I think that the amendment widens the scope to a far greater extent than was ever intended.  It is not just sufficient to say, with regard to a Bill going through this House, that it is not going to be used against such people. It may be and there is the danger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that, so far as part of the Bill is concerned, it has been changed in the Seanad from a Cereals Bill into an Apothecaries Supply Bill.  I did not comprehend the original intention of the Minister in prohibiting proprietary articles in the nature of compound foods, which perhaps, contain some little medicinal preparations, but to suggest that a Bill <Col N="264" /> such as this should be so wide in its scope as to include proprietary medicines such as cures for colic, for milk fevers in cows, of which there are a number, and various ailments of cattle, is stretching the credulity of the members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that there is any danger, because a proprietary or protected trade name surely has a definite meaning.  I could not give a definition, I admit, at the moment, but we all know what it is.  A proprietary or protected trade name, I presume, is a well-advertised name, and the person who has made a particular medicine owns that particular name, and has made a claim that it is his product, and so on.  I cannot imagine that the ordinary farmer making medicine for his own cattle is going to trouble to put a trade name on it or have the name protected in any way, and I think it could not possibly apply to such farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to press something which is impossible on the Minister.  I know what a protected trade name is.  It is a name registered in the Industrial and Commercial Property Office in Merrion Square, but whether a proprietary name means that or not, I do not know.  If it does, well and good, but suppose you prepare a dose, the constitution of which is exactly the same as a proprietary medicine.  At the present time, you have the protection societies sending inspectors around trying to trap grocers in the selling of products the sale of which is confined to chemists.  Suppose a man, instead of paying a fancy price for an advertised product, found out what it was made of and made it up himself, I can well imagine that there would be gentlemen going around trying to find out if he were doing that and prosecuting him under this Act for manufacturing medicines which pass in commerce under the designation of a proprietary or protected trade name in an unlicensed premises.  That is the definition of the medicine.  It is the definition of a certain thing and, if you <Col N="265" /> manufacture that on an unlicensed premises, I think that you render yourself liable to the law, and, if a man wants to prevent you doing that, and if he catches you making an exact duplicate of a preparation which has a registered name, can he not make you liable in law for manufacturing it on an unlicensed premises?  I know that that is not what is in the Minister's mind or his intention, but could it not be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume what is in the Minister's mind is to avoid the tinkering with feeding-stuffs to be sold as medicine, and, if that is so, I thoroughly agree with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But that very point is not met, I think.  The Minister has put in this word &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; in order to widen the second paragraph in regard to articles which are sold at exorbitant prices.  The word &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; is put in in paragraph (b) but it is not put in in paragraph (a).  Supposing a man mixes for himself some medicine like that, which possesses no commercial and no proprietary or protected trade name, and adds something to it, is he not out?  I think he is out, so that he completely gets away from what the Minister meant when putting in the word &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; in paragraph (b).  It will be a mixture of two or more articles and  will be a medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not envisaging a question of sale.  I was thinking of the danger it was to the ordinary person making up his own preparation for his own animals.  I think he will be hit under paragraph (b).  But unfortunately the man who wants to sell this deleterious mixture can do so for the future if he adds something to it. He is not caught under paragraph (b) because he adds something more than medicine &ldquo;which passes in commerce&rdquo; and he is not caught under paragraph (a) because he is not mixing two or more articles at least one of which is a feeding stuff, for sale, that is to say, two or more articles one of which is <Col N="266" /> medicine.  So I think the Minister has failed to catch the rogue he wants to, who sells this mixture; and there is a possibility that somebody hereafter may insist upon the Act being rigidly enforced and may prevent a man making up his own stuff on his own premises unless he gets a licence.  I do not think that is what the Minister has in his mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan rather anticipated what I was going to say.  It is because of the danger of an interpretation which the Minister did not intend, that we object to it. If the Minister's intention was, as I believe it was, to protect the ordinary cereals from competition with articles and compound feeding-stuffs which might be called a medicine, we agree. If the Minister meant that, he ought to put in the words that would preclude any possibility of misconception.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the process.  The Minister's argument is that a mixing process is not a <Col N="268" /> manufacturing process, but the process is not changed whether it takes place in a house with intent to sell or on a farm.  The process is the same.  If it is manufactured in a business house for sale that means manufacture; I suggest it must be also manufacture if a man mixes in his own house, and that is declared in the Bill to be unlawful.  I would advise the Minister to think over this matter.</P>

Surely it could not apply to him because, as I said already, he would have to make it a proprietary medicine and also it would have to be passed in commerce as such.  Surely a person mixing medicine on his own farm, if he was only mixing it for his own animals, could hardly pass it in commerce under a proprietary or trade name.</P>

      <P>These amendments are all dealing with the one point.  It would appear that, as the Bill went through the Dáil we overlooked one point with regard to applications for registration.  In the section as it stands it says: &ldquo;Any person who carries on the business of importing flour or wheaten meal or both may, in accordance with this section, apply to the appropriate Minister to be registered in the register of flour importers in respect of any premises at which he carries on such business.&rdquo; This wording is carried on through the various paragraphs of the section.  They all read more or less the same dealing with the registers, but as the Bill stood leaving the Dáil and as it stands still, we would not have any power to admit a new person although permission is given in the Bill.  Under this section as it stands it would appear that we could not admit a person unless he was <Col N="270" /> already in the business.  That is all right for the person in business at the passing of the Act, but if a person wants to come in after three or four years' time we would have to point out to him that under the Act he would have to be in business before he could come in.  Therefore, to obviate this, we will have to have the words inserted &ldquo;or proposes to carry on.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amends sub-section (1) of Section 80.  It deals with the restrictions on the sale of maize.  If the maize importer is also a maize miller under paragraph (a) it shall not be lawful for him to sell maize to any person.  If he is not a registered maize miller, it shall not be lawful for him to sell to any person, other than another registered maize importer, or a registered maize miller or the Minister. That is how it reads in the Bill as it left the Dáil, with the words &ldquo;unless under and in accordance with a licence granted by the Minister.&rdquo; Leaving that as it stood, we would have no great control over the person to whom the maize is sold, and consequently we would be compelled to attach very restrictive conditions to the licence for the sale of maize on the importer.  If a person imports maize and passes it on to a second person, say, a maize dealer, we would have to put restrictions on the maize dealer.  We may find that the maize dealer has been <Col N="273" /> disposing of the maize in a fair and legal way and restrictions may not be necessary.  The amendment is that the words &ldquo;under and in accordance with a licence granted by the Minister&rdquo; be deleted, and this portion of this paragraph would then read: &ldquo;unless such maize is sold under and in accordance with a licence granted to him by the Minister and is so sold to a person to whom a licence to purchase maize has been granted by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We need put no restrictions on the sale of maize if the person who is buying it is licensed to take maize.  If the maize dealer is licensed to take maize then no further restriction is necessary. As we are working the scheme at present, the thing is rather cumbersome. We give a permit to a person to import maize and put on him the burden of seeing that the maize is passed on to a person who will use it in the way we require&mdash;that is, by mixing.  That is rather unfair to the importer, because he has to be responsible to us for the person to whom he sells the maize; he has to see that that person will use the maize in a proper way.  What would be much fairer to the importer would be to say: &ldquo;If you import maize and sell it to a person who has a licence to buy maize, you have no further responsibility.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to argue that this does not bring about any great change, but the Minister's statement in the Seanad would seem to show the point that we have reached.  In the Seanad he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Bill, as it stands, does not give the Minister any control over the subsequent disposal of maize.  The effect of that would be that the Minister would not be likely to give a licence unless he knew exactly beforehand how the maize was going to be disposed of.  If, on the other hand, he had power to put in a condition with regard to the disposal of the maize afterwards he would be freer to issue those licences.</P>
      <P>I do not know that he will.  He will require now the same information from the person purchasing as was previously required from the person selling.</P>
      <P>Certain cases cropped up during the working of this scheme provisionally ... One was that of a person who applied for whole maize for the feeding of pigeons.</P>
      <P>And apparently he could not get it unless he had a licence.  Apparently he could not get it unless the registered importer had a licence to import maize for sale to a person who kept pigeons.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill as it stands we could not grant the application.</P>
      <P>That is where I find great difficulty in following the Minister.  I thought he could, because he could have attached the conditions to the licence.</P>
      <P>Another case arose in connection with damaged maize that was unsuitable for grinding.  A person applied for a permit to dispose of it.  As the Bill stood we could not deal with that either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know where the difficulty existed.  Whatever the Minister can now put in with regard to the person to whom he issues the licence to <Col N="275" /> purchase the maize, he could surely have previously put in in regard to the person to whom, in respect of a certain purchase, he had granted a licence to sell.  I do not see that there is very much difference, but I think the whole thing is very restrictive.</P>

It might possibly be found necessary to include maize meal mixture in compound feeding-stuffs, and in that case it will be necessary to have this amendment inserted.

      <P>This is a matter that was debated at some length on the Committee Stage.  I do not think that the Minister in the Committee Stage really appreciated the situation or really appreciated the burden that he was putting on the poorer classes of the population, especially in the poorer counties, my own included, and several counties in the West of Ireland.  In Kerry we use maize meal for making mixed bread.  We do not use it for porridge but there are counties&mdash;I think Donegal is one of them&mdash;in which it is used extensively for porridge.  In Kerry, undoubtedly it is used for making very palatable bread.  The Minister, in order to meet that situation, allowed the sale of meal in one-stone bags.  I do not think that he has met the case made here that that regulation inflicts a serious hardship and a very severe tax on the people who buy maize meal for human consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody seems to have a different opinion as to what that will mean in extra cost to the consumer.  The Minister has given us no view of his <Col N="278" /> own on the matter but he is rather inclined to quote the lowest figure he has got from anybody opposed to this regulation.  We were told here that it would increase the cost by 2d., 3d. or 4d. per stone, and the Senator who moved the amendment pointed out that the real effect of the packing would amount to 3½d. per stone.  Anyone who has seen the bags in which the meal is packed can well believe that.  The Minister tried to meet that situation in the Seanad. He pointed out that he did not exclude paper bags for that purpose.  It is quite obvious that so far as the bulk of the farmers are concerned paper bags would be quite useless.  The Minister might as well have said that he did not exclude tissue paper bags.  Undoubtedly this is a great tax on people who wish to use maize meal for human food.  The Seanad accepted the principle of the Bill.  I think the Minister will acknowledge that they brought forward no amendments that would in any way cut across the intention of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This amendment was brought forward to allow the Minister to carry out his purpose on the one hand and on the other hand to lighten the burden on the poorer portion of the population.  To farmers with a valuation not exceeding £7 the meal would be sold in 20-stone bags.  That does not go as far as many members in this House would like to have gone.  But it has gone a certain distance.  The Minister is safeguarded there by limiting the amount to be sold to a particular household within a particular period.  That is what the mover of the amendment in the Seanad proposed.  The Minister did not meet the amendment and the result is that he is leaving a very heavy burden on people in particular portions of Ireland.  That is a burden that will press heavily on the people in my particular county.  The Minister said there was practically no row over the matter, but he must know that so far as farmers are concerned, no matter what they suffer from, an organised expression of opinion is not what they are most <Col N="279" /> noted for.  That this is a burden which will press very heavily on the people there can be no doubt.  The Minister cannot say that this regulation will not mean an increase in the price.  He may say that the amendment will mean a difficulty in administration.  I suggest that it is rather late in the day for the author of this Bill to make objections of that kind now.  The whole Bill bristles with complications and I fail to see how the Minister can oppose the amendment on these grounds.  It would seem as if the Minister for Agriculture has become the Minister for Public Health, because one of the arguments used in the Seanad was really that the mixture was more healthy than maize.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Dillon will read what the Minister said in the Seanad he will appreciate what I am saying.  The Minister suggested that the mixture was healthier.  On that question I have only to say that the people desire this particular type of food.  The Minister, possibly in his desire for the public health, may be anxious to force another kind of food on them. The main thing undoubtedly is that by this Bill the Minister is inflicting a very heavy tax on the poorer portion of the population.  The amendment does not go as far as we would like it to go, but it goes some distance, and I trust the Minister will appreciate what it means to the people in a county like Kerry.  I would ask him to give this amendment more favourable consideration than he gave it in the Seanad, and to give the arguments put forward there a little more attention than he then gave them.  He is inflicting a hardship on the people because of the excuse of the complicated machinery that would be necessary to operate this amendment.  That is what the author of the Bill is doing in opposing this amendment.</P>

      <P>When this section was before the House in the Committee Stage the Minister gave me an express <Col N="280" /> undertaking that he would introduce an amendment at a later stage in this House or in the Seanad, providing for the facilitating of persons living in my constituency to purchase pure maize meal for the making of porridge and bread for human consumption. My recollection is that he said pending permanent regulations he would arrange for some temporary expedient that would allow this to continue until he had time to consult his officials and set up a satisfactory mode of distributing pure maize meal amongst the people to whom Deputy O'Sullivan refers.  Deputy McFadden will bear me out when I say that pure maize meal has been for generations a very material part of the diet of people in my constituency as well as in other Gaeltacht parts of the country.  To somebody not accustomed to it, it is not a very palatable food, but there are others who like it, and there is no question of its nutritious quality.  The alternative which the people have is to add meal to the flour so as to make bread.  This commodity, pure maize meal, is now more extensively used.  The Government's policy during the last six months has increased the price of flour in the country by 4/- a sack.  This makes the burden all the heavier on the country people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the excellent purpose of checkmating Joseph Rank, we have engaged in the business of assisting every miller of this country who is at present battening on the consumers and extracting from them illegitimate and scandalous profits, in excess of what he is entitled to, because he is taking advantage of the Government policy. The price of flour on these very people has been advanced from 3/- to 4/- and, some say, to 5/- per sack by the tender millers whom we have been so anxious to protect from the rapacity of Joseph Rank.  The Minister is aware that the economic policy of the Government has pretty well wrecked the market for oats.  It has brought the price of oats down to an unprecedentedly low level, while oatmeal is still a very expensive commodity from the point of view of poor people in the western Gaeltacht. Their alternative was maize meal and, <Col N="281" /> thanks to the slaughter of the cattle-raising industry and the other feeding industries, the price of maize meal is comparatively low.  They are deprived of the advantage that might accrue to them from that state of affairs by the expense that the special form of packing puts upon them.  Surely the Minister will admit that he gave me an undertaking when this Bill was passing through this House that he would deal with the situation that Senator The McGillycuddy's amendment is designed to meet.  Does the Minister remember that?  I strongly urge him to accept the proposal of The McGillycuddy, as he has not produced an alternative himself.  I should like to ask the Ceann Comhairle if, at this juncture, the Minister can propose an amendment to take the place of this amendment or if the time for that is now past.</P>

      <P>But it can go no further than that.  I take it that the Minister has no alternative scheme to propose or he would have mentioned it.  In that event, I urge him most strongly on behalf of the poorest section of the community, a section of the community which is suffering gravely as a result of the added cost of flour which profiteering millers are extracting from them and the comparatively high cost of oatmeal as compared with the cost of maize meal which they were in the habit of using&mdash;I urge him most strongly to accept this proposal and make this comestible available to the people at the cheapest price possible. I remind him that he gave an undertaking to do that when the Bill was passing through here.  It was on the strength of that undertaking that Deputy McMenamin and I withdrew our opposition and allowed that stage of the Bill to pass without further obstruction.  I should like to hear Deputy McFadden, whose knowledge of the Gaeltacht is, of course, particularly exhaustive, confirm me in saying that this article of food is of paramount importance to the people whom he and I represent.  There is no use in looking to the Fianna Fáil Party for a <Col N="282" /> representative of Donegal.  Though they have more members representing Donegal than any other Party in this House, none of them is here.  If they were here, where they ought to be, they would be able to defend their own people's interest in respect of this matter.  Deputy Brady, Deputy Hugh Doherty and Deputy Neal Blaney are in touch with areas in which the people are hard hit by the position which this amendment is designed to correct.</P>

      <P>I do not see the necessity for this amendment at all.  The Bill, as it stands, gives just as much power to the Minister as he would have if the amendment were accepted.  This amendment and the amendments leading up to it make provision for the preparation of a register of maize dealers.  These maize dealers would, according to this amendment, make application to the Minister for the issue of licences for the sale of maize in containers not exceeding 20 stone under certain conditions. I do not want to find fault with the way this amendment is drafted because if I had intimated to the Senator concerned that the amendment was good in principle but that the drafting might be changed, the form could have been made right.  But, apart from the drafting, the amendment would include everybody with a holding under £7 valuation.  Leaving out the towns and having regard only to the rural population, that would mean about 280,000 holders.  If each of them were to get 20 stone of maize every three months, it would mean practically half the entire import of maize.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even that amount could be exceeded, because there would be nothing to prevent a consumer going to the sergeant of a Gárda Síochána barrack and getting a certificate and then going to the next barrack and getting another certificate.  He could then go round and do a very good trade in the selling of this maize meal for other purposes, if necessary.  Leaving these matters aside and assuming that the amendment would work smoothly and well if it were confined, say, to the districts of Kerry and Donegal and those other districts where maize has been used as human food, there is nothing in the amendment to give any more power to the Minister to do what it seeks than there is in the Bill as it stands.  Take Section 81 (1) (b) which says: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person to sell any maize meal unless.. such maize meal is sold wholesale by a registered maize miller and such maize meal is sold under and in accordance with a licence granted by the Minister.&rdquo; That, in itself, gives the Minister power to grant a licence to the dealer to sell an unlimited quantity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you take Section 81 (1) (a) you will find that it shall not be lawful to sell maize meal unless it is intended for human consumption, is sold in a package secured in the prescribed manner and the weight of maize meal in such package does not exceed the prescribed weight.  If we like we can, under this Bill, prescribe that that package of pure maize meal shall be 20 stone.  We could even go further than this amendment would allow us to go because, under this amendment, the consumer would have to go to the Gárda Síochána barracks and buy from a registered maize dealer whereas, as the Bill stands, we can, when we get going, if we find it necessary in a certain district in Kerry or Donegal to make this less restrictive&mdash;we can, if we wish, allow pure maize meal to be sold in eight-stone sacks or 20-stone sacks.  As the Bill stands there is nothing to prevent us doing that and the amendment is altogether unnecessary. In fact, as I say, it is more restrictive than the Bill.  The amendment gives the option to the Minister to do it and the Bill as it stands gives <Col N="284" /> the option to the Minister and the whole thing is whether the Minister will do it or not.  I did say to Deputy Dillon and other Deputies on one stage of the Bill that I would make it possible for the Minister to issue licences for the sale of pure maize meal in larger bags than one stone.  That has been done.  Section 81 (1) (a) (iii), as the Bill was originally introduced, tied us to the one-stone package, but now it says &ldquo;the weight of maize meal in such package does not exceed the prescribed weight or, if no weight is for the time being prescribed, one stone.&rdquo; It will stand at one stone until we make regulations changing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can you make regulations for each district under that or must they be national?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under paragraph (b) we certainly can make differences regionally. I think regulations of the type mentioned in Section 81 (1) (a) (iii) would have to be general.  I am not really sure of that, but under (b) the exceptions can be made.  The whole point anyway is that the amendment is not necessary.  If Deputies want to make the point of having this pure maize meal sold in larger packages it is really a matter to try and impress on whatever Minister may be there that it is necessary.  I tried to find out some time ago through some of our inspectors what the position really was in the County Kerry, because I know that in County Kerry they use mixed meal bread very largely.  It is used, I suppose more largely than any other type of bread in the County, and I was wondering if this maize meal mixture had been a great hardship upon them. The result of my inquiries was that it is very difficult to say whether there is much increase in price, because the big majority of people, at any rate, are buying the mixture.  That is, they are buying maize with oatmeal mixed.</P>

With the eye you could not tell.  People appear to be either deceived or satisfied&mdash;I do not know which&mdash;but they appear to be buying the mixture in the great majority of cases.</P>

The amendment will not get that for them any more than the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious that if the Minister wanted to meet the argument he could have amended this amendment to make it absolutely clear.  I am quite sure that that was in the mind of the mover of the amendment.  I think it was even pointed out in the Seanad in connection with this Bill that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; means &ldquo;shall&rdquo; very often. Whether it means &ldquo;shall&rdquo; here I should not like to say.  It is quite obvious, however, that the idea was to make it in normal cases compulsory on the Minister to do this.  That was the purpose of the amendment.  If the Minister agreed with the case made, he could have seen that that purpose was carried out and got it re-drafted to that effect.  He has not met the case that that is what is behind the amendment.  He may have verbal objections to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience we have had of the Minister makes it all the more necessary for us to press the amendment. He says that all that will be necessary is to impress it on the Minister, whoever he may be.  A certain amount of time has been spent trying to impress this on the Minister, but so far as the experience of Deputies who have dealt with this is concerned I do not know that trying to impress it on the Minister has made him anything but more obstinate in determining to inflict this hardship on the people.  Some people may buy the mixture.  If the mixture is 3½d. cheaper they will naturally buy it, especially at the present time, but that is no proof that they want to do it.  One of the most palatable breads that I know of is the mixed bread and <Col N="287" /> they like it.  Really it is quite obvious from the whole tone of the Minister that this thing cannot be left in the hands of the Minister to use the discretion that he has if he wishes.  Our difficulty is that it is quite clear that the Minister is not going to wish to make this concession.  The Minister says that this amendment practically restricts his liberty to do what we want, but he has shown no inclination to do what we want, or even to appreciate the argument put up against the provisions in the Bill.  It is obvious even from the speech he has now made that putting the case clearly to him in the House has not had any effect.  It is obvious that there is no other method of convincing him to allow the 10-stone or 20-stone bags. The meal is put up in these one-stone bags costing anything from 2d. to 3d. I do not know what it costs, but in the County Kerry, as was pointed out in the Seanad, it meant an increase of 3½d per stone on the same article. That is actually the price there.  Probably in some places it may mean more. When this matter was being debated before some Deputies said that the bags would cost at the rate of 3d.  It is quite obvious that the last thing the House ought to do is to leave it optional to the Minister.  The only thing we can do is press this amendment in the hope of making it compulsory. If the Minister does not accept the amendment but will change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; into &ldquo;shall&rdquo; we will be quite willing to do that, and it will effect our purpose.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give an undertaking now that in the areas of Kerry and Donegal he will give the people the right to purchase by licence cwt. bags?  I would be content if he would give an undertaking that, in those areas where he really does know that the thing was actually an habitual article of human food, he will use the powers he has under the Bill to make available for those people licences to buy pure maize meal in quantities of one cwt.  I think the Deputy might then consider withdrawing his objection to the Minister's attitude on <Col N="288" /> Senator The McGillycuddy's amendment, because I believe if the Minister would say now that he intends to make this meal available under licence in cwt. bags to the people in those areas the real evil of the present situation would be overcome.  I am quite satisfied that if he gives that undertaking regulations will be made at the earliest possible moment.</P>

Deputy Cosgrave asked when did we think we would consider the point.  I think he brought me down to a period of six months hence.  I said that as soon as we got the Bill working, as soon as we got all the regulations going and everything was in full swing so that we could see how the Bill was working in those areas, we would get our agricultural overseers in those areas, particularly in Donegal and Kerry, to give us a very full and impartial report on the whole matter of the consumption of pure maize, and we would then consider the question whether we could in certain areas enlarge the size of the bag.  I can promise to do that.</P>

The cwt. bag is available in the mill; no extra cost will be involved, and the difficulty will be overcome.  No other Deputy is here prepared to state his authority that there is this consumption of Indian meal in any other part of the country. Deputy O'Sullivan is here for Kerry and I am here for Donegal, and the Minister knows that in both those areas there is that consumption.  Surely he could say that in regard to those areas at any rate he will try the experiment for a while at least, and provide permits for people to buy cwt. bags. If the concession embarrasses the administration of the Act he can withdraw it.  I am perfectly certain that if the Minister came to the House and said it would mean the breakdown of the Act neither Deputy O'Sullivan nor myself would find fault with its withdrawal. All we ask is that he would give an undertaking that in those areas he would make this concession, even if it is only an experiment.  He could then survey the whole matter, and make up his mind in respect of the rest of the country at his leisure.</P>

      <P>I think what I have said is the most I can be expected to promise, and that is to get the impartial reports of our own agricultural overseers in those two counties on the working of this scheme&mdash;it has been working in a provisional way for the last six or seven months&mdash;as to what, if any, is the extra cost inflicted on the poor classes in the small holdings, and over what areas the people are affected.  Having got those reports I undertake to act on them, and on whatever general recommendations may be contained in them.</P>

      <P>I presume the Minister has already had reports, and we see the result of them.  I would be quite satisfied if the Minister would give a definite promise&mdash;shall I use his own phrase?&mdash;&ldquo;to think well of the matter.&rdquo; I wish he would think well of the matter, and give a definite promise that cwt. bags would be available in those particular cases.</P>

      <P>Surely it would not jeopardise the success of the Act if the Minister experimented in two restricted areas, gave this facility and tried it out there?  It could not possibly jeopardise the administration of the Act, and would give him the information which he proposes to collect in a hypothetical kind of way from his overseers.  Let him make the experiment in those two areas, and if there is not much demand for the Indian meal, or if he finds that the concession cuts across the wheat policy, then let him withdraw it and give his reasons. I do not believe anybody is going to be unreasonable, or misrepresent the matter.  It would be a gesture towards those people which would be appreciated; it could not do much harm, and might bring very great advantage to those people, who are the least vocal in the whole country.  They are not going to raise a row; if the truth were known, they do not know very well why it is they cannot get Indian meal at the present time.  They are not conversant with the conditions of the Wheat Bill; all they know is that from their customary suppliers their requirements are not to be had.  I suggest to the Minister that he let permits be issued in any manner he likes&mdash;say through the Civic Guards&mdash;which would make them readily available to the people in those restricted areas.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 39:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 82 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>82.&mdash;(1)  It shall not be lawful for any registered maize miller to sell or offer for sale any maize meal mixture unless such maize meal mixture complies with the following specifications, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  oats (if any) included therein is, if an order under sub-section (3) of this section is not <Col N="293" /> then in force, in one or other of the following forms, that is to say, the entire product derived from grinding oats or the entire product derived from grinding the kernels only of oats, or, if any such order is then in force, in the form required by such order,</P>
    <P>(b)  the amount by weight of oats (if any) included therein in the form of the entire product derived from grinding oats does not exceed the prescribed percentage of such maize meal mixture.</P>
    <P>(c)  in case such maize meal mixture does not include any oats or includes any oats in the form of the entire product derived from grinding oats, the amount by weight of the product derived from grinding maize included therein does not exceed the prescribed percentage of such maize meal mixture,</P>
    <P>(d)  in case such maize meal mixture includes any oats in the form of the entire product derived from grinding the kernels only of oats, the amount by weight of the product derived from grinding maize included therein does not exceed the appropriate prescribed percentage of such maize meal mixture.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister in making regulations in relation to the percentage referred to in paragraph (d) of the immediately preceding sub-section as prescribed shall, by reference to the quantity of oats contained in maize meal mixtures to which the said paragraph (d) applies, divide such maize meal mixtures into such and so many classes as he may think proper, and shall prescribe different percentages in respect of different classes, and the percentage so prescribed in respect of any such class shall for the purposes of the said paragraph (d) be the appropriate prescribed percentage in relation to every maize meal mixture which belongs to such class.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may from time to time by order require any oats <Col N="294" /> included in a maize meal mixture to be in the form of the entire product derived from grinding the kernels only of oats.</P>
    <P>(4) The Minister may by order revoke any order previously made by him under the immediately preceding sub-section.</P>
    <P>(5) If any registered maize miller acts in contravention of this section such registered maize miller shall be guilty of an offence under this section and be liable on summary conviction thereof to the penalties mentioned in Part I of the Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>This is the amendment that was referred to earlier when we were discussing amendments 3, 4, and 5. Certain paragraphs that were taken out of Section 7 come back here under this new section.  Paragraph (b) provides that if the kernels of oats are used then they can be used in the proportion by weight that the whole oats would yield.  That is to say, that if we prescribe a 10 per cent. mixture and if we take it that the kernels of the oats would be 70 per cent. of the whole oats, then we would prescribe 10 and 90 of maize, and the kernels would be 7 and 93.  Sub-section (2) of the new section makes provision for classes of mixtures.  If we were to allow the whole oats and kernels to be used in the one mixture it would be very difficult to make regulations following these out.  Power is taken here to take two classes.  Sub-section (3) gives the Minister power to prescribe the kernels only at some future time.  The reason for that is that on expert advice we are told that if a mixture contained more than 20 per cent. whole oats it would not be suitable for the feeding of small pigs or animals with delicate digestions. In the case of cattle whole oats would be quite all right up to a 90 per cent. mixture, but in the case of small pigs it should not be more than 20 per cent.  There is a possibility that means will be found for taking the hulls from the oats at very low cost.  There are machines on the market which are almost perfected. It is claimed that these machines will <Col N="295" /> be able to do the work at low power and at very small cost.  If we find that the millers are satisfied that these machines are successful for the purpose, then at some future time we may prescribe that only kernels will be used.  Sub-section (4) simply gives the Minister power to revoke any Order previously made by him.</P>

      <P>That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendments 40 and 41:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 83, sub-section (1), after the word &ldquo;percentage&rdquo; in line 46 the words &ldquo;(if any)&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>Section 83, sub-section (2), after the word &ldquo;percentage&rdquo; in line 49 the words &ldquo;if any)&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>Section 83 deals with moisture and fibre in maize meal mixture.  During the discussion of the Bill in the Dáil Deputy Dillon was rather keen on the point about the moisture.  After some discussion this new section was put in.  It may not be necessary, we think, to operate this section, at least in the case of fibre, unless we find at some future time that there are some grave abuses under the mixing scheme. It may be necessary to operate perhaps the moisture part at a future date, but the section as it stands would compel us to operate both from the very commencement. Therefore, we are proposing here to insert the words &ldquo;(if any)&rdquo; so that we can operate the Act, when passed, without prescribing the percentage moisture or fibre, at least for some time, until we get the necessary experience to say what the percentage should be.</P>

      <Col N="296" /> Section 90.  A new sub-section added at the end of the section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) Each of the articles specified in sub-paragraphs (b) to (w), both inclusive, of paragraph 7 of the Third Schedule to this Act shall be an excepted article for the purposes of this section, but if the Minister makes an order declaring that any of the said articles shall be a scheduled feeding-stuff for the purposes of this Part of this Act, the article to which such order relates shall cease to be an excepted article for the purposes of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An &ldquo;excepted article&rdquo; is defined in amendment 43.  If we did not bring in amendment 43 the restrictions on the importation of stall feeding-stuffs would apply to cotton seed in grain because cotton seed in grain would be used for, say, the manufacture of cotton seed meal.

      <NameTxt>Acting Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission Estimate for the financial year 1933-34 is being introduced in very exceptional circumstances.  In accordance with the Government's policy of relieving tenant-purchasers, actual and prospective, of a substantial portion of their liabilities to the Land Commission, legislation is in contemplation which will materially affect the Estimates of the Department for the coming year.  A new Land Bill is at present being drafted and will be introduced in the Oireachtas at an early date, but on principle its enactment cannot be anticipated at this stage, and consequently the Estimates now submitted have been prepared on the normal basis, that is to say, no provision has been made for any additional charges which the measures in contemplation may involve.  It is not yet possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy to what extent or in what manner the Vote will be affected, and any additional sums required must be provided by way of Supplementary Estimates or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate for the year 1933-34 is £446,254.  The normal Estimate for the year 1932-33 was £588,102, apart from the Supplementary Estimate of £48,635 which was required to meet exceptional circumstances and which was approved by the Dáil last months.  A comparison of the two &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Estimates shows a reduction of £141,848, but the greater part of this is accounted for by the deletion of the contribution of £134,500 towards the <Col N="300" /> charge for Excess Stock, which disappears as a corollary of the Government policy in regard to the land annuities.  Apart from this, the changes under the various sub-heads of the Vote are comparatively trifling, and it seems necessary to call attention to a few only of the principal items.  It will be noticed that the figures for the year 1932-33 as printed in the Estimates now in the hands of Deputies have been amended from those set out in last year's Estimates to show the combined effect, both as regards savings and increases, of the original Estimate for 1932-33 and the recent Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head &ldquo;A&rdquo;&mdash; Salaries, wages and allowances&mdash;an increase of £6,764 is accounted for by normal increments of salary and a slight increase in number of staff.  Under sub-head &ldquo;B&rdquo;&mdash;Travelling expenses&mdash;an increase of £3,000, from £21,000 to £24,000, is shown to provide for increased activities anticipated in the normal course.  This merely repeats last year's original Estimate.  Under sub-head &ldquo;H&rdquo;&mdash;Payments under Section 11 (7) of the Land Act, 1923&mdash; owing to the issue of Land Bonds in respect of the State Contribution to the price of tenanted land and for the Costs Fund having been greater than was anticipated last year, £1,000 was added in the recent Supplementary Estimate, and a further £8,500 is now added, to provide for the normal increase in the amount of Land Bonds issued for State Contribution and Costs Fund.  Under sub-head &ldquo;I&rdquo;&mdash; Improvement of estates, etc.&mdash;the decrease of £1,000 is in respect of sums required for the purchase of tenancy interests, which are included under this sub-head.  The Estimate for actual improvement works (£180,000) remains the same as last year.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head &ldquo;J&rdquo;&mdash;Advances to meet deficiency of income from untenanted lands purchased under the Land Acts, 1923-31&mdash;the original amount provided in the Estimate for the year 1932-33 to meet normal requirements was £10,000.  Owing mainly to arrears of rents payable in the second half of the year 1932 by allottees of untenanted land, this Estimate had to be <Col N="301" /> increased by a Supplementary Vote of £83,455.  The sum of £20,000 put down in the present Estimate is probably sufficient to meet the deficiency arising from arrears of payments by allottees under normal conditions, without reference to charges which may arise under fresh legislation.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head &ldquo;K&rdquo;&mdash;payments under Sections 42 and 46 of the Land Act, 1927, for liability undertaken by the State in respect of &ldquo;Land Bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;Committee&rdquo; lands&mdash;the revised Estimate for 1932-33 is increased by £3,350 on account of additional advances made or to be made in respect of &ldquo;Committee&rdquo; cases.  The Estimates under sub-heads &ldquo;L&rdquo;, &ldquo;O&rdquo; and &ldquo;Q&rdquo; are merely nominal, but in case any charge should happen to arise under them during the coming year, it is deemed advisable to put down sums of £100 for each instead of the token figure of £10.  Under sub-head &ldquo;N&rdquo;&mdash;advances in respect of &ldquo;additional sums&rdquo; payable by purchasers&mdash;the Estimate provides for the charge in respect of advances made on and after the 1st November, 1932, whereby five-sixths of the two months' interest from gale day to dividend day is advanced from the Vote and is repayable by tenants in five half-yearly instalments.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head &ldquo;P&rdquo;&mdash;advances to provide funds for the maintenance of embankments or other works&mdash;the original round sum of £2,000 which was estimated for the year 1932-33 but not required is restored for the coming year to provide for contingencies, but no precise estimate is possible beforehand. The changes in the individual items making up the appropriations in aid are trifling and do not call for special remark.</P>
    <P>As regards the general work of the Land Commission to which it is customary to make some reference in introducing the annual Estimates, on the tenanted land side the Land Commission are now actively engaged in revesting in tenant purchasers the 80,000 holdings vested in the Land Commission under the Land Act, 1931, and the 20,000 &ldquo;Congested Districts&rdquo; holdings listed under that Act, but <Col N="302" /> this will necessarily be a long and tedious process.  During the past year attention has been largely devoted to clearing up the great mass of correspondence arising out of the publication of the lists of vested holdings under the Land Act, 1931, and making the necessary adjustments in rent, areas, occupancy, etc.</P>
    <P>As regards untenanted land, the present position is approximately that over 434,000 acres have been actually acquired by the Land Commission for division under the Land Acts, 1923-31, of which some 360,000 acres have been already divided among some 18,500 allottees.  This leaves about 74,000 acres on hands but not yet formally divided, though, of course, the arable portion of it, about half the total area, is untilised for grazing lettings, temporary accommodation for migrants, etc., pending distribution.  In addition, prices have been agreed upon or fixed for over 42,000 acres and offers have been made or Provisional Lists published in respect of a further 76,000 acres.  Then, the Land Commission have under investigation with a view to its suitability for acquisition an area of some 700,000 acres, of which 256,000 acres have been inspected, apart from a considerable area which has been put aside after preliminary examination as unsuitable for present action, but with the possibility of revival if necessary.  There is thus plenty of work on hand to keep the Land Commission busy for some time to come, not to anticipate the greatly increased progress in the acquisition and division of untenanted land which should follow on the enactment of the contemplated land legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement does not reveal very much activity on the part of the Land Commission during the past 12 months, and I do not think that the members on his own benches should feel in any way grateful to him for the work he has done since the Fianna Fáil Government assumed power.  When those Deputies occupied these benches, the slowness of the Land Commission in distributing land was the main burden of their complaint in any discussion on the Land Commission Estimates.  Over and over again, I was told that it was possible to divide land three times more quickly than the rate at which the late Government proceeded and, now, I find, from the Minister's reply, that, last year, only 30,000 acres of land were divided&mdash;half the amount under the rate of distribution in a normal year during the lifetime of the previous Government.  The Fianna Fáil Government, when they took over the reins of office, were in an exceptionally favourable position to proceed with the distribution of land. They had, according to a reply I got from the Minister quite recently to a question of mine, 100,000 acres of land ready for distribution and the money was available at that time to pay the owners of the land.  They had 100,000 acres ready for distribution and, yet, out of that 100,000 acres, they have divided only 30,000 acres during a period of 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister why it was that so many of these schemes which had been prepared and sanctioned by the Commissioners before the Fianna Fáil Party assumed the responsibilities of office were held up.  Why were these schemes not put into operation?  I can understand the reason why the Minister cannot proceed with land distribution at the moment.  There is no money available but there was money available at that time and that money was available up to the expiry of the British Guarantee <Col N="304" /> on, I think, the 18th of last December, but the fact is that there were schemes in hands for the distribution of 100,000 acres of land and, yet, out of that 100,000 acres only 30,000 acres have been distributed during the past twelve months.  In other words, their rate of progress has been something less than half the average rate of progress of the Government which preceded them. Notwithstanding the fact that the rate of progress was only half that of their predecessors in office, I find, according to the Estimates published this year, that there has been an increase of £3,000 in travelling expenses and an increase of approximately £7,000 in salaries.  I should like to ascertain from the Minister what is the reason for this increase in travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>The tendency, for some years before the Fianna Fáil Government assumed office, was to reduce the amount of travelling expenses year by year.  The Minister will find, if he cares to look over the Estimates for the years 1932, 1931 and 1930, that there was a gradual reduction in the amount of travelling expenses year by year, and yet, this year we find that, notwithstanding the fact that there was a decrease in activity&mdash;a very marked decrease in the activity of the officials of the Land Commission&mdash;there has been an increase of £3,000 in travelling expenses.  I wonder what is the explanation of that.  In addition to an increase in travelling expenses, there has been an increase as well in salaries of, approximately, £7,000.  Some of that I have no doubt is attributable, as the Minister said, to the normal increments of the civil servants in his Department but the rest of it, according to the Minister's statement, is due to an increase in staff.  I wonder what are the actual functions of the new members of his staff?  For what purpose has the staff of the Land Commission been increased?</P>
    <P>Surely, the main purpose and the main function of the Land Commission is to acquire land and to distribute it amongst the people who require it.  If, as the Minister said a moment ago, only 30,000 acres of land were distributed last year, why, I ask, was it necessary within the past twelve months to increase the staff of the <Col N="305" /> Land Commission?  On the face of it, that increase appears entirely unwarranted. I know that, in addition to the fact that there has been a considerable decrease in the distribution of untenanted land, there has also been a decrease, and a considerable decrease, in the activity of the Land Commission Inspectors in reporting on the suitability of land for acquisition and the valuing of land as well. Yet, notwithstanding the decrease in activity in every direction, there has been, as I say, an increase in travelling expenses and an increase as well in staff and salaries.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to the distribution of land during the last 12 months.  I know that there were schemes of distribution ready to be put into operation before the 9th March, 1932.  I know that these schemes have been held up and I should like to know from the Minister why they have been held up.  Was the Minister, or his predecessor in office, afraid that if these schemes were put into operation they would offend some of their supporters in the country? Surely it was the duty of the Minister when he found these schemes prepared ready to hand to put them into operation. It was his duty when he assumed office and took on responsibility as well, not to be frightened by the clamours of his supporters in the country.  These schemes were prepared on fair, just, equitable and reasonable lines.  I think the country is entitled to some explanation why land distribution is to be held up to all intents and purpose.  I know that some poor and deserving people who had made arrangements when the change of Government came about, in the beginning of 1932, to take over these strips of land, were deprived of the right and have been deprived of that right ever since.  I notice, from the newspapers, that in certain counties land distribution seems to have ceased and so have the primary functions of the Land Commission.  An organisation outside the Land Commission has apparently taken control of things.  I hope the Minister will see that no such organisation is allowed to usurp the functions which <Col N="306" /> only the Land Commission can exercise fairly.</P>
    <P>The second question I would ask the Minister is what portion of the money voted for the improvement of estates, last year, has been refunded to the Treasury?  The sum of £101,000 was voted last year for the purpose of carrying out improvements on estates divided up by the Land Commission. If, as the Minister has said, only 30,000 acres of land were distributed during the 12 months ending 31st March last all that money would certainly not have been spent on development and improvement of those estates, and a substantial portion would be refunded to the Land Commission. Now, in view of the fact that it may be the end of this year before the new Land Bill, spoken of for such a length of time, comes into operation, this money may be used for the dual work of carrying out the improvement of estates in the financial year, and hence the sum is increased from £101,000 to £190,000.  It is perfectly clear the Minister will not be in the position to proceed with land distribution before October or November this year.  In the interval between 1st November and 31st March it will not be possible for the Minister to spend a sum of £190,000 economically, at all events, on the distribution of whatever land he may be able to distribute in that period.  It is very doubtful, therefore, in present circumstances, however laudable the intentions of the Minister may be, if he will be in a position to have the major part of the Land Bill in operation by the 1st November this year.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduced this Supplementary Estimate for the purpose of making up the deficit in income from untenanted land under the Land Acts of 1923 to 1931, sub-head J., he was deputising for another Minister, and was not able to explain his reasons for coming to the Dáil to ask for a supplementary estimate of £90,000.  I should be glad if the Minister would be able to inform the Dáil now what items were included in that estimate.  On that occasion I wanted to ascertain from him what loss the Land Commission had incurred <Col N="307" /> in clearing untenanted land.  I wanted to know what part of the loss was due to the fact that the Land Commission had to pay a certain sum of money covering two months period of annuities and what portion of the loss was due to expenses that had to be paid&mdash;arrears in respect of rates and other outgoings which are inevitable.  The Minister I think told me, in reply to one of my questions, that 50 per cent. of that estimate was composed of a sum towards the two months rent or annuities.  The other figure appeared to be entirely abnormal but I would like, when the Minister replies, if he would be good enough to give further details regarding the composition of that figure of £90,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred very casually to the Land Bank and Committee cases.  I know some of these cases present a good deal of difficulty and because of this difficulty not common to other types of cases the Land Commission has to deal with these cases and to settle them verbally.</P>
    <P>I would like some further details as to what occurred in the case of land that there was to sell under Sections 42 to 47 of the Land Act of 1932, the section dealing especially with these Committee and Land Bank cases.  I know one Committee case&mdash;I shall give the details to the Minister if necessary &mdash;that has been in hands from the beginning of 1928, and which was on the point of settlement when I left the Land Commission.  That case has not yet been settled and has not, in fact, developed or progressed one degree since I last saw it in the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>On the question of embankments there is an increase which is justified in this Estimate.  The embrankment problem in this country is a very special problem.  I would suggest to the acting Minister, if he has any responsibility for the terms of the Land Bill, that he might go even much further than I went in the Land Act of 1931, with the object of securing greater power for the Land Commission to spend money on embankments. Year by year the embankment problem is becoming more acute and year by <Col N="308" /> year the amount of money required for carrying out repairs for injuries to embankments, in the south and west of Ireland, is very much greater. Because of the abnormal seasons of 1931 and 1932 considerable damage was done to embankments in the counties of Limerick and Tipperary and also to the only one embankment that they have in Mayo.  So far the Land Commission has spent no money in repairing that damage and it may be that portion of the money that the Minister is now asking the Dáil to vote may be allocated to the particular embankments I have in mind.</P>
    <P>There is one work to which the Minister made no reference at all in his statement, and that is the experimental work which has been in operation in the Gaeltacht, in Connemara especially, Donegal and Mayo, during the past three or four years. Quite a substantial acreage of land was reclaimed and rendered arable by the judicious expenditure of a very substantial sum of money in these counties.  The work was an experiment, but I think that by now the experimental stage should have been passed and the Minister should be in a position to state to the Dáil whether such work will become a permanent feature of Land Commission activity for the future.  In every debate on Land Commission Estimates, Deputies, from the Gaeltacht areas especially, referred at great length to the reclamation work which was being carried out in these counties.  I think that the work actually extended, in 1931, to five different counties.  I think that it is due to those Deputies and to the Dáil that the Minister should avail of the opportunity presented to him on this Estimate to make a full statement as to the present stage which that work has reached.  I know that in Connemara a very large area of land was reclaimed.  Houses were built on that land.  Portion of the land was tilled by the Land Commission for some years as an experiment, and the Land Commission, I think, was quite satisfied that the experiment had been very successful, even though the cost may have been somewhat abnormal. <Col N="309" /> I wonder if the Minister has continued that experiment, or has he induced the tenants who are planted on these holdings to carry out the experiments themselves, what assistance is he giving them, or what assistance has he induced the Minister for Agriculture to give him in order that the experiments might be carried out completely?</P>
    <P>I should like to know also from the Minister how far the vesting operations under the Land Act of 1931 have been completed.  From the Minister's statement I understand that practically all the tenanted land which came under the vesting sections of that Act has now been vested in the Land Commission except some few difficult cases. I can quite understand the delay in vesting these difficult cases, but what I am particularly anxious to know is the progress the Minister has made in vesting the untenanted holdings distributed under the Land Act of 1923.  I have not yet heard, in my own county at all events, that any of them have been vested.  It may be that some of them have been vested, but I have not heard that any of them have been vested so far.  I feel that in the lull that has taken place in the acquisition and distribution of untenanted lands the Minister should avail of his opportunity of pushing forward these cases and vesting them in the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the balance of the Congested Districts Board tenants still to be vested.  I realise that quite a number of these have been vested, but I realise also that there is still a big number of them to be vested.  I should like to know what are the difficulties the Minister has encountered in vesting the balance of the tenants of the Congested Districts Board. Some of them have been waiting from 1911, 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915 and 1916 to have their land vested, and it was contemplated certainly, when the 1931 Act was passed, that all of them would be vested in at least twelve months from the date of the passing of that Act.  It may be that there are special difficulties.  I am not finding fault with the Minister or with the Land Commission for the delay, but I should <Col N="310" /> like, as a matter of interest, to know what these special difficulties are.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the Estimate is attributable entirely to the fact that the payment of £134,500 in respect of bonus and excess stock is being withheld this year.  Whether that is going to be a permanent reduction or not, time alone, I suppose, can tell; but judged by the Estimate for 1931, the last really active year in the life of the Land Commission, the expenditure this year is as great as it was in 1931. The expenditure during 1932-33 is as great as in 1931, the last active year, as I say, of the Land Commission.  It appears to me still that, in view of the fact that there is such a very marked lack of activity in the work of the Land Commission that all that expenditure is certainly not justified, and certainly the expenditure of £109,000, or at least the figure of £109,000 which the Minister is asking the Dáil now to vote him in the improvement of estates, cannot be justified in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is just one last point.  I think, some time before the last election, there was a Gaeltacht Commissioner appointed.  I would be curious to know from the Minister what are the duties of this Gaeltacht Commissioner. At least, I cannot see in the Land Commission Estimates that any provision is being made for the payment of his salary.  Does he perform any work, or does he perform any duties under the control of the Land Commission?  Are his duties confined entirely to the Department of Lands and Fisheries? And if he does perform any duties for the Land Commission, I am anxious to know what exactly is the nature of those duties?  I should like to hear also from the Minister if this so-called Gaeltacht Commissioner does perform certain work for the Land Commission, what are his special qualifications for the performance of that particular work?  I assume, from a statement which I read in the Press at the time, that he would be engaged in the ordinary work of an inspector in the Gaeltacht.  When the Minister is, perhaps, somewhat longer in the Land Commission, he will come to realise that an inspector has to go through a <Col N="311" /> good many years of hard and severe training.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's statement regarding the administration of this Department during the past year.  Were it not for casual references to tenanted and untenanted land and the Land Acts of 1923 and 1927, one would be inclined to think that the statement the Minister read out had reference to his own Department and not to the Land Commission. One would imagine that in the course of his statement the Minister would have given us, for example, an indication of the state of the accounts of the Department for the last year, that he would have referred to the land annuities and given the amounts collected and the amounts that are still outstanding.  There is no reference to those matters in the Minister's statement.  There is another matter of paramount importance to the agricultural community.  That is, that there should be a definite statement as to when the land annuities will be halved and whether the proposed Bill referred to by the Minister is going to be retrospective so as to cover the forthcoming May-June gale or will it only apply to the November gale?</P>

      <P>I would like to know what progress has been made in the collection of land annuities for the last year, and how the collection compared with other years.  I would like to know also whether there has been an instruction sent out to bailiffs in the matter of the execution of decrees as to the nature of the chattels they are to seize on behalf of the Land Commission.  Within the last few weeks there was a decree executed on behalf of the Land Commission in the County Cork.  When the owner tendered animals that were on the farm to meet the decrees the bailiffs refused to take any of the animals.  They there and then proceeded to the nearest Gárda Barrack, returned with a number of Guards and seized the house and furniture.  This seems to be a new departure and I am anxious to know if a special instruction has been sent out to seize furniture and not to take live-stock.  The practice heretofore has been to seize cattle or horses and bailiffs never seized furniture so long as there were animals on the land.  Are we to assume that the Land Commission is now adopting the policy of taking the line of least resistance and is seizing whatever is saleable?</P>

      <P>I hope they do not pull the two off you.  The Minister has told the House that there was a saving of £131,000 with regard to bonus stock.  So far as I understand it, liability was accepted for portion of the bonus stock by the British Government and the Irish Government accepted liability for the other portion. Does this saving of £131,000 include the entire issue of bonus stock or does <Col N="313" /> it refer only to the portion guaranteed by the British Government prior to recent events in this country relative to moneys paid by land annuitants?</P>
      <P>The Minister said there was an increase of £3,000 in the matter of travelling expenses.  One is curious to know how that increase was incurred. Deputy Roddy told the House that when he left office there were 100,000 acres of land ready to be taken over, but up to the present only 30,000 acres have been taken over.</P>
      <P>There is a sum set aside for embankments. I would like to know whether that is for the maintenance of already constructed works or whether portion of it would be available for operations around the coast where arable land has been covered with sand.  Is portion of that money available for planting Bent or Mirram Grass?  I would like to know whether experiments are being continued with regard to Bent and Mirram Grass for the purpose of protecting the coast from the incursions of sand on arable land.  With regard to sub-division, so far as my constituency is concerned it has progressed very reasonably and satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>The 100,000 acres referred to consisted of about 55,000 acres of bogland.  Some portions of the bogland are in Galway, some in Mayo, some in Kildare, and other areas of bogland are scattered in different counties throughout the Saorstát.  So far as I remember 55,000 acres were bogland of that description.  We hope to speed up the division of land. That is the sole aim and purpose behind the Bill that is at present being drafted.  One portion of the Bill will deal with the funding of the arrears and the cutting of the annuities by half.  The rest of it, if it is possible to get it through in this Session, will deal with the acquisition and distribution of land.  Deputy Roddy also referred to the increase in travelling expenses. The Deputy should know that an Estimate is an Estimate and not a record of expenditure.  And the increase from £21,000 to £24,000 in the Estimate represents the increasing activity of the Land Commission which we hope will occur in the acquisition and division of land.</P>

      <P>I was interested on hearing the Deputy speak about the Land Bank land, because he said he took that land over in 1928 and brought it forward to 1931.  That was about three years, and then he wonders why it was not finished in another year.</P>

      <P>That is in the Deputy's own opinion.  The Deputy referred to the reclamation of land in Mayo and Galway and to the Cloosh Valley and those other experiments where people were planted in boglands.  Those <Col N="315" /> experiments have been going on and very large sums of money have been spent in carrying them out.  Steps are being taken to establish in connection with this reclamation, schools in the new plantations.  That experiment is going to be carried out, and certainly before spending more money in starting further schemes I should like first to see that scheme going for a couple of years and to see how it works.  It is hard to know how much money this reclamation will cost per acre.  In looking over the file recently I wondered whether the money could not be better spent than in these experiments. However, it is an experiment and it will get a fair trial so far as I am concerned or indeed any other Minister operating the Land Commission. That experiment will get a fair trial.</P>

    <P>I have not got the exact figures as to the vesting of the untenanted land. Deputy Roddy asked a question as to how far the vesting of untenanted land and the distribution of land under the Act of 1923 had gone.  I would say that about 18,000 allottees of untenanted land have been listed under the 1931 Act and from the 3rd May next will be subject to annual sums instead of interest on the purchase money. One reason for the slowness in the acquisition of land is that quite a lot of the Land Commission staff have been put on work of a different character these last few years.  For the last ten or eleven years nothing was done to clean up the Congested Districts Board estates.  When the Congested Districts Board went out of operation there was an enormous amount of land left unvested and undealt with.  A large portion of the Land Commission staff was put on that work, and I believe that while that work is not as spectacular as the acquisition and division of land, it is good, sound social and national work. A lot of the Congested Districts Board people were left there for ten years simply because their cases were pretty hard to deal with.  Their cases were filed away in pigeonholes and the people themselves were left with the original rent instead of the annuity at <Col N="316" /> reduced rates that would be put on that land when vested.</P>
    <P>Another hard and difficult work is the cleaning up of the rundale holdings. For ten years nothing was done in the straightening out of the rundale holdings.  We could acquire and divide more land and leave these people in the state they were in, but I think the clearing up of these rundale holdings is more valuable work. Deputy Roddy asked what exactly are the difficulties in the vesting of the Congested Districts Board holdings. Well, I suppose the difficulties are different in each case, but the difficulties were of so great a character that the cases were put aside and not dealt with.  The Gaeltacht Commissioners will be dealt with under the Fisheries Department.  Deputy McMenamin asked what was the amount of land annuities collected during the year.  I have not the figures by me at the moment but I will send them to the Deputy afterwards.  As to the decrees in County Cork I said somebody must have been pulling the Deputy's leg because the Land Commission has not enforced any decrees for months past. Somebody must have been telling him a story.</P>

      <P>Well, the Land Commission has nothing to do with that if it occurred at all.  Some experiments have been carried out on embankments of rivers and on Bent or Mirram Grass.  I think that is good work, as good work as the drainage of land and I hope to see it continued. The Deputy spoke about spending more on embankments.  We hope to spend as much as we will get from the Dáil on that work.</P>
