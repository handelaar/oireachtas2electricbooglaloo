    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this rather futile Estimate has already been prolonged.  It has ranged over a wide field.  I should not be intervening to prolong it further were it not that the Minister for Agriculture has seen fit over and over again in the course of his speech to attribute all sorts of low and evil motives to his opponents.  It appears to me that the Government have been long enough in office by now to drop that sort of line of argument.  The other evening we had Deputy Hugo Flinn comparing Deputy Davin to Rip Van Winkle; but I think the Government, and the Minister for Agriculture in particular, might be compared to Peter Pan, &ldquo;the boy who would never grow up,&rdquo; because they are still exhibiting the same evidences of juvenility in their attitude towards all criticism that might perhaps have been excused <Col N="1153" /> when they first came into office, but is certainly not worthy of any Government with mature experience.  The Minister for Agriculture thinks we are unreasonably cantankerous in our attitude towards all his proposals.  Would the Minister consider for a moment why it is that we take that attitude? Does he mean that we are going around the country stirring up our followers to be hostile to his administration and to his efforts?  If he thinks so, it is a highly misleading picture of the situation.  Does it occur to him that we are deluged with appeals from people through the country who see themselves on the verge of being irretrievably ruined, and that we are constantly being asked to take all kinds of violent action, mostly of a foolish kind, but which is quite natural because these people are in desperate straits and consequently in a desperate frame of mind?  If we criticise the Minister here, it is because we cannot help having some feeling for decent, honest industrious men, who have worked hard all their lives and who now, through no fault of their own, see themselves on the verge of ruin as a result of the Government's policy.  I think that the Minister should make a little allowance for this instead of accusing us of lack of patriotism and sabotage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed it is rather curious that he should accuse us of sabotage or of taking any line, no matter how unpatriotic so long as it is likely to injure the Government, in view of the fact that it is only a few days ago since we had attacks on us from the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches accusing us of quite a different kind of thing&mdash;of having developed a special technique to keep the Government in office by voting with the Government whenever we saw the Labour Party voting against them.  It seems to me that of these two accusations the one ought to cancel out the other.  Would it not be wiser and fairer to take the straightforward view that when we vote in a particular way we do so because we think it right?  If we wanted to sabotage the Government we could do it very easily by joining in any attacks on them originated by the Labour <Col N="1154" /> Party and we could do it without any risk to ourselves because we should be held up then as the friends of the poor and the oppressed and there would be no danger of being accused of lack of patriotism.  The real truth of the matter is that we have our principles and we intend to stick to them no matter how much we are abused by people on either side of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke to us last night about his plans with regard to foreign markets.  I do not want to throw cold water on any efforts that he is making to find foreign markets and, if there were no economic war at all, it would be his duty to try to find as many outlets for Irish products as he possibly could.  If, however, by his talk of foreign markets, he intends to imply that he can find anywhere within reach a country comparable to Great Britain as a market for agricultural produce, he is simply deceiving the nation.  It is absurd to suggest that there is available anywhere a market where you have the relationship between area of territory and population that you have in England.  Whatever success the Minister may have with his European markets, it certainly will not reach the point of providing anything approaching a substitute for the British market and, no matter what he says about the decline of the British market, there is not the slightest doubt that it is, and long will be, the best market in the world for imported agricultural produce, and it would have been a better market still if this Government had done its duty at Ottawa and had succeeded in joining forces with the British farmers and the Northern Ireland farmers to keep out foreign produce and get as much of a monopoly as possible in the British market for home-grown produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us now that he has a plan for foreign markets.  He will not tell us anything about it.  It is a deep and dark secret, because he has such a low opinion of our patriotism. Unfortunately, however, there are precedents which make us suspicious.  We cannot help remembering that the Fianna Fáil Government had a plan all ready for curing unemployment in a year.  They had a plan all ready for <Col N="1155" /> reducing taxation by £2,000,000 a year. They have never disclosed these plans, and they are not disclosing them now, I suppose, because of the suspicion that their opponents might sabotage their plans.  They have never disclosed them, and certainly the plans are not in operation, and all this justifies us in being a little cynical about the plans for foreign markets to which the Minister alludes.  A week ago I asked him had he a plan for saving the horse-breeding industry.  He said he had. I asked him for an indication of what its nature would be.  He would not give an indication&mdash;again afraid of sabotage, I suppose.  We cannot help getting a little tired of all these mysterious plans that cannot be disclosed. During the famous wave of speculation associated with the South Sea Bubble in the 18th century, there was a company floated whose shares were offered for public subscription and, I believe, subscribed for by large numbers. The purpose for which this company was floated was described as being for &ldquo;an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.&rdquo;  That strikes me as on a par with these indications of the Minister for Agriculture with regard to these famous plans of his.</P>
    <P>I am not going to hash up again&mdash; I dare say that the Ceann Comhairle would prevent me if I wanted to do so&mdash;all the arguments about the economic war that have been drawn into this debate on the Agricultural Estimate, but I think I must answer one point made by the Minister.  The Minister insists that the present situation has been brought about merely because the Government stood up for our rights in the way that was inevitable for them to stand up for our rights.  On one of the first occasions on which I had the honour of addressing this House I pointed out that it was not always a good thing to be too preoccupied with standing up for one's rights; that bankruptcy courts and lunatic asylums were generally recruited from people who had been too tenacious and too pig-headed in thinking about their rights rather than their opportunities.  My complaint <Col N="1156" /> with regard to the Government, and with regard to its handling of this whole financial dispute, is that it approached it in that sort of spirit, instead of in a businesslike manner. Anyone who suggests that the attitude of the Opposition, or at any rate&mdash;it is not for me to speak for the Cumann no nGaedheal Party&mdash;anybody who suggests that the attitude of the Centre Party towards the whole of this financial dispute with England is one of suggesting that we should make no attempt to obtain better financial terms from England is simply talking nonsense.  The whole burden of our criticism of the Government is that they have handled the question in a way which was bound to lead to trouble, and could not lead to any good results.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that arbitration had been offered, or rather that the offer of arbitration had been accepted, because the offer did in the first instance come from the other side, provided that a non-Empire tribunal was appointed.  That is true.  Even so, that offer of arbitration, that acceptance of the principle of arbitration on our part, is a less business-like course and likely to lead to less good results than the course that might have been adopted.  After all, if we had succeeded in our point, if we still succeed in our point of getting a non-Empire tribunal to conduct the arbitration, the result would be that if we are defeated, if it is established by the tribunal that the annuities were due and that the Cosgrave agreements were valid, or if either of those things is established by the tribunal, we shall be obliged to pay up in full.  Having been so extremely litigious and so stubborn we could not reasonably expect the British to be in a hurry to make a considerable remission in respect to those sums.  I think it would have been far more businesslike, and still would be far more businesslike, to stop all these litigious methods in handling the matter, and try to arrive at a settlement by means of making a definite cash offer with a view to putting an end to the whole dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a <Col N="1157" /> matter of very considerable comment in this House that when introducing his Estimate the Minister for Agriculture had nothing to say.  Goaded, evidently, by those taunts, the Minister decided that he would make a very long speech in this House.  Having carefully pondered over the Minister's speech I, for one at any rate, have come to the conclusion that the Minister's first thoughts were best, and that he would have acted more wisely if he had kept to his first thoughts, and had not shown up as completely as he has shown in this speech the barrenness of his agricultural policy, and the hopeless outlook of the Irish farmer at the present moment.  After all, if we take the net result of this debate, we are driven to the conclusion that the Irish farmer at the present moment, and evidently as long as Fianna Fáil is in office, must look forward to a period of unbroken loss. There is no hope, no ray of sunshine anywhere, no chance or possibility that Irish land will be made profitable, or that the Irish farmer will be able to pay his way out of the proceeds of his farm as long as this Administration remains in office.  There is no sign of any alteration at all.  Any community that has been put upon a solvent financial basis, and is on a solvent financial basis, can stand a loss for a certain period of time.  That is an elementary proposition; it is a truism; but after a certain period of time, after the reserves have been exhausted, then complete and final collapse must come to that unfortunate section of the community. That is the prospect, and it is as well for us to face it, which is before the farmers of this country at the present moment.  That is a prospect which every single Deputy in this House who knows anything about Irish farming, or anything about the condition of the Irish farmers, must be completely aware of.  That is the position in which the Minister, having nothing hopeful to say, was, I think, well advised when he kept quiet to begin with, and ill-advised when he made that very long speech of his, spread over two days, which certainly, giving as I have said no ray of hope to anybody, has very much blackened the <Col N="1158" /> mental outlook of the persons who are trying to live out of the land.</P>
      <P>We heard last night something about foreign markets.  I wonder, sir, if you could go back to the days of your youth and remember a little nursery rhyme: &ldquo;Little Bo-peep has lost her sheep and doesn't know where to find it.&rdquo;  I am afraid at the present moment there are two little Bo-peeps&mdash;or little Bos-peep, I do not know which is the correct plural&mdash;on the Government Front Bench, who have lost their sheep and do not know where to find them.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has got somewhere or other 300 factories, but he does not know where to find them.  The Minister for Agriculture has got somewhere foreign markets, but he does not know where to find them.  He tells us, of course, that he has them, but he wants to keep it a secret wrapped up in his own breast.  No one except the Minister is to know where they are. The exporters are not to have the slightest idea of where those foreign markets are, in case people, inspired by the Opposition, might go over, and by brute force, by sabotage, beat the foreign customers out of our own market; beat them by physical violence, because that is what sabotage means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order that that terrible result might not come about the Minister keeps carefully from the House and carefully from the people the names of the countries in which those foreign markets are to be found.  I have no doubt that foreign markets can be found.  You found a market of a certain sort in Germany.  You are dumping Irish cows at the present moment in Germany.  You can always get a dumping ground in almost any country in the world, and you can call it a market.  That is what has happened.  There is this dumping of Irish cows in Germany.  They are being sold far below anything that might be considered the cost of production.  A cow is sold at something from 15/- to 20/- a cwt., and, in addition to that, you pay a bounty to the German gentleman who comes over here to buy a cow, with the result of course that he has got her for practically nothing.  When <Col N="1159" /> he has pocketed his bounty this German gentleman who comes over here has probably got the cow at something like 10/- a cwt.  Then he exports her to Germany.  Of course, if we are going to pay farmers to take away our cattle at far below the value of those cattle, at far below what it cost us to produce them, no doubt we will get people who will take a present of our produce.</P>
    <P>But that type of market is no use to the farmer.  What the farmer means by a market is a market in which he can get a reasonable price for the stuff he produces and is endeavouring to sell. At the present moment the Minister cannot point out anywhere in the world a real market as distinct from a dumping ground for Irish farm produce.  That is the problem that is facing us.  We had a market that was sometimes a very excellent market and at other times it was not so good; it varied as markets always will vary, but still it was always at our disposal.  It is the biggest market for agricultural produce in the world.  It is a market for the mastery of which every agricultural country in the world that has a large amount of agricultural produce to export is fighting to obtain.  That is the market which this Administration has succeeded in shutting to our producers. That is the position that exists in our State at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked a lot about the home market.  He advocated the policy of producing our agricultural commodities for home consumption. He declared that all the farms would be richer by producing for the home rather than for the foreign market. Anybody who knows the first thing about Irish conditions must be perfectly well aware that that could not be the case.  Our home market is very limited and it is not able to absorb a tithe of our agricultural produce.  I do not mean by that a tithe of our agricultural produce, but I do mean a tithe of the agricultural produce which will be put upon the market as distinct from what is consumed in the producer's own home.</P>
    <P>What chance is there of all this <Col N="1160" /> ceasing?  At the present moment we can see no chance.  What makes it worse is that from the Government Benches we do not find the slightest expression of desire that existing conditions should cease.  We do not hear any expression of keenness or anxiety from the Government Benches that this economic war should terminate.  We hear from a great number of the back benchers more openly than from the occupants of the Front Benches the statement that they wish this war to be fought out to a finish.  How long would that state of affairs continue? Do Deputies visualise what fighting the war to a finish means?  It means that some time or other there will have to be the unconditional surrender of one party or the other.  Apparently the Fianna Fáil policy is to fight out this economic war until Great Britain surrenders unconditionally.  How long will that take?  I would not dare to hazard a guess as to how long that will take, if ever it could happen.  So far as we can gather, that is the object of this Administration.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the 9th June the Minister for Agriculture informed the House that the continuance of the economic war was largely due to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  That was what he wished to make out. Everybody must know, possibly with the exception of the Minister, if he is an exception, that that is not a fact. There are three ways in which this economic war can be terminated.  In the first place, it can be terminated by a fight to a finish and the complete surrender of one side or the other. The second way it can be terminated is by arbitration and the third way it can be terminated is by negotiation. Arbitration has seemingly broken down.  For my part I think that arbitration would not be a satisfactory method of terminating this economic war.  I do not think that arbitration, assuming a court could be agreed upon, would lead to the results which persons who wish to see this war terminated in some way favourable to this country would like.</P>
    <P>Passing from arbitration, I might say that there seems to be an impasse.  It has been made a matter of principle by <Col N="1161" /> the Government of Great Britain that they will not submit any question in dispute between them and any other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations to a tribunal drawn from outside that Commonwealth.  That they have made a question of principle. On the other hand, as a question of expediency at the present moment this Government say they must have a completely free hand in deciding whence the arbitrator is to come.  That seems to be an impasse which cannot be got over.</P>
    <P>The other method, and the sensible method, by which I and the majority of people in this House and the overwhelming majority of people in the State would wish to see this economic war terminated, is the method of negotiation.  President de Valera did go over to England to negotiate and nobody can say that the breakdown in negotiations which then took place was due in any way to the action of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  The attitude of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party towards these negotiations was made perfectly clear in a statement made by the Leader of our Party, Deputy Cosgrave, on the eve of the President's departure for London. President de Valera took the opportunity of stating that he felt obliged to Deputy Cosgrave for what he had said because Deputy Cosgrave had taken up a most correct and proper attitude. In face of the fact that when President de Valera went to England he had the full sympathies, the best wishes and such support as Cumann na nGaedheal could give him, and as he subsequently acknowledged, in terminating this dispute, to state now that the failure to end the dispute by negotiation was in any way due to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party must be recognised by every sensible person, no matter what his views are, as a misstatement of fact, a grave and serious misstatement of fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture went on to say that farmers now thought that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party did not matter, that the Centre Party did not matter, and then he used the curious phrase&mdash;that even the Fianna Fáil Party did not matter.  I agree <Col N="1162" /> with those farmers.  I have always thought and said so.  I do not think the Cumann na nGaedheal Party matters, the Fianna Fáil Party matters, the Labour Party matters, or the Centre Party matters.  I do not think that any Party in this House matters.  What does really matter is the well-being and the prosperity of the people of the State, and no Party can justify its existence unless in so far as it is directing all its very best efforts, its strongest efforts, towards bringing such a measure of prosperity to this State as it can bring.  That should be the object of every Party.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister for Agriculture and his colleagues would bear in mind what the farmers think.  I wish they would bear in mind that the prosperity of the Fianna Fáil Party is of absolutely no importance to the country. What is of importance is the prosperity of the people of the country.  If they looked less to what would be to the advantage of the Fianna Fáil Party or to what would be an infringement of their personal dignity and vanity, and looked more to the country's wants and gave more sympathy to the suffering the people are now undergoing as a result of their economic policy, I think, they might have the courage to change that policy and give the people endeavouring to live out of the land in this State a fair chance of making a living.  The conditions in this country, as everybody knows, are getting daily worse and worse.  The farmers have got to the end of their resources.  We find there is a gradual tightening up of money and of the purchasing power of every citizen in the State.</P>
    <P>The farmer has no ready money, yet things are made more and more difficult for him.  Prices are put up and kept at an artificial level by taxation of imports.  I should like to know if the Minister is aware what higher percentage the farmer is paying now for his flour as compared with what he would pay if there were no import duties and regulations in respect of flour?  I do not want to go over the ground that I have already traversed, but I would point out that at a time like this month, and next month and August, when the supplies of home-grown <Col N="1163" /> potatoes are exhausted and when the small farmers in Mayo and Galway and counties of that nature are driven to buy in the shops, and when every effort ought to be made by the Government to place cheap food at the disposal of the farmers to enable them to carry on while this economic war is raging, the Government, by putting a tax on flour, raised the price of that commodity to the farmer to a very large extent.  It is, indeed, a very desperate outlook to anyone interested in agriculture and interested in the people who live and have to live by agriculture. It is a very black outlook.  As long as the present Executive Council take up their present attitude I do not see any chance of this black cloud passing away.</P>
    <P>I know we are told from Fianna Fáil Party platforms that we want the country to surrender&mdash;an immediate surrender.  There is not one single man who makes those speeches but who knows that that is not true.  There is always, in every war, a middle course. That is the way 99 per cent. of the wars come to an end&mdash;by the adoption of the middle course and not complete surrender. Why, at the end of the Great War when Germany was down and out the peace terms made did not mean complete surrender to Germany.  Here at the present moment terms can be got. It is perfectly obvious to everybody that terms can be got which will be very different from complete surrender. Terms very favourable to this country can be got at the present moment.  You have only to read the pronouncements made by responsible English Ministers &mdash;Mr. Thomas and Sir John Simon and others&mdash;to see that this economic war can be terminated on favourable terms absolutely different from anything approaching surrender.  It is to get favourable terms that we wish to see a move made&mdash;to get terms the most favourable that could be got.  We urged that from the very beginning of the economic war and we are urging that still.  The policy of peace by negotiation originated in these benches. It was here mentioned first, at the very outbreak of the economic war.  It is the great desire of the Cumann na <Col N="1164" /> nGaedheal Party that this economic war should be terminated by negotiation which will be favourable to this country and which will be neither surrender by this country nor Great Britain.  There is a middle course between the two which we have pressed and are pressing the Government now to adopt.  I am not now, in this debate, going into many specific matters of detail which I might go into.  I might deal with some of the schemes, like the wheat scheme that the Minister put forward, but this debate has already been protracted to a very considerable length, and I think these schemes have been sufficiently discussed and the policy of the Government has been sufficiently exposed already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I ever stood up in this House feeling so embarrassed as I do to-day at the very melancholy speech to which we listened from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. It was so touching that I found it difficult to keep the tears back. Whether it was that the early hour had an effect upon Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney or not I do not know.  Perhaps it was the result of the last general election that was having such a very unfavourable effect upon him, now that he is no longer a Minister preaching the policy of the ranches and grass versus tillage which he preached at the last general election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will not deny that in his melancholy mood he definitely told his constituents that the policy of this country, or any other country, is, first of all, grass, and that its secondary consideration should be a policy of tillage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolutely inaccurate.  What I told my constituents from the beginning was&mdash;and I was very careful only to speak of the part of the country I knew&mdash;that their policy was to till as much as they could, not for the market, but for consumption at home, and that their market should be live <Col N="1165" /> stock&mdash;cattle, pigs, fowl and all other live stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; essentially a grass policy; and I remember distinctly reading that tillage must be only a secondary consideration in this State. The Deputy will not deny that.  He said till as much as you can for the production of live stock.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is meant by his statement and if Deputy Belton pursues that further we will deal with it.  A person with knowledge does not want to go very deeply into that to see that it easily becomes a boomerang. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's speech embarrassed me very much.  It was very hard in such an atmosphere to face facts.  If we could only get the ex-Minister out of his melancholy mind, and from under the very black cloud that hangs over him and over the future of his Party, we might be able to induce him to see a little hope, a little silver lining beneath that cloud.  I am afraid it is as hopeless for the Government to try and bring any real hope into the minds of Cumann na nGaedheal ex-Ministers as it is to get any commonsense method of dealing with British Ministers in this dispute.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred at great length to the efforts made to bring about a settlement. He paid a very effective tribute, melancholy and all as he felt at the time, to President de Valera when he said that the President made efforts to settle this dispute by negotiation.  He pursued that right across to the discussions that took place in London, but he did not tell us what was the effect of the breakdown in the negotiations between the President and the representatives of the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the latter part of his speech he told us that terms can be got if we are to judge by the public statements of British Ministers.  How does he reconcile that with the official statements of British Ministers to President de Valera when they met him?  Are we only to take the public statements of <Col N="1166" /> British Ministers in this matter?  If we are to place the same reliance on statements of British Ministers and ex-Ministers as on the statements of ex-Ministers in this country we can have very little reliance on their desire to settle this dispute by negotiation or otherwise.  British Ministers certainly cannot but be influenced by the fact that this country, in facing up to this dispute, is not a united country and that this Government cannot rely on the co-operation of a very large section of the community.  Knowing British Ministers as we do from their public statements and actions we know that they must be influenced by the fact that there are two elements in this country that are to be relied upon from the British point of view.  One is that the country is not united in taking a stand on its rights and the second that the country is suffering a good deal by this economic dispute.  These are very effective and telling arguments with British Ministers, and knowing them as we do, we cannot expect that they are going to ignore them.  There is one obstacle that we can remove definitely and that is being disunited.  Despite the fact that the people of the Free State gave their verdict in a more united voice than was ever given before in the history of the Irish nation that we were to stand up for our rights in this dispute and to have an honourable settlement by arbitration and by the methods outlined by President de Valera, we did not even then get unity. The contention of certain politicians up to that time was that the will of the people must be respected.  But, as soon as the people declared what their will was, because it did not agree with the political programme of certain leaders of Cumann na nGaedheal the will of the people was turned down. The one effective thing in this matter is to have unity in order to give a fair chance to the Government to settle this question by arbitration.  Let us hope that effective steps may be taking place in London at present.</P>

      <P>I do not want Deputy Dillon to go into his usual ecstasies of <Col N="1167" /> enthusiasm at the start about something that he knows nothing about.  He should reserve his enthusiasm for a later stage.  It is better to find fault with yourself for not being enthusiastic in time than to have to find fault with yourself for being enthusiastic when you should not.  A little caution would be advisable in this matter, and Deputy Dillon should cool his ardour at this early hour of the day.  Effective steps may be taking place.  We have laments in the melancholy strain pursued by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that the Irish people are crying out against a large number of politicians here, and public men declaring that they have the people behind them and saying: &ldquo;Settle this dispute; do not mind arbitration, or the claim which President de Valera has made for an independent tribunal; that is all bosh; go and settle by negotiation; meet British Ministers in the way ex-President Cosgrave used to meet them.&rdquo;  That is, let them fool you again to the same extent as they did before by telling you that you have a nought in the hollow of your hand and when you come back you find it to be £5,000,000.  We are told: &ldquo;Settle in that way; do not mind what our representatives are putting up; it is only all make-believe; there is nothing in it; do not heed Senator Connolly or anybody else; it is not good for the country; settle it anyhow; go to the British and say: &lsquo;How much will you take?&rsquo;  When they find out you want to give something they will not press you too hard; they are a decent crowd.&rdquo;  That is not the way to settle a dispute.  We should rise above that Party squabbling.  I do not think it is going to improve matters.  It is time that that sort of ranting should cease. Throwing a wrench into the machinery is not a decent thing to do and will not help either Cumann na nGaedheal or Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney did say that nothing counts but the country.  They should keep that before their minds and play less at politics as they understand them in a game of this kind.  He said that at the present time the farmers cannot live out of their holdings; that they <Col N="1168" /> cannot make them pay.  I should like to ask any Deputy on the opposite side when did 75 or 80 per cent. of the farmers in the West of Ireland make farming pay under any regime?  I am speaking of Mayo and Galway in particular, and 75 or 80 per cent. of the farmers there never in the history of Irish agriculture made farming pay, They had to depend on the American cheque and on emigration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of farming in the West of Ireland and I know what I am talking about.  The people there have not dairy or grazing farms that others can boast of having.  They have not the side lines that Deputy Dillon can boast of.  Seventy-five per cent. of the farmers in the West of Ireland never made farming an economic proposition.  As you all know, they had to depend upon emigration and upon the American cheque.  It was quite usual for half a million pounds per year to come to small farmers in Mayo from America in order to help them to rear their families and pay their way.  That is how they made farming pay, and not by a policy of grazing and &ldquo;Hoganism.&rdquo; Farmers in the West, even though they had daughters and sons in America helping them, had to leave the women to reap the crops and go away to England to work for three months every year as migratory labourers.  Can any Deputy deny that?  That is the way they made farming pay.  We hear a lot of talk about the great system of the past and the glories of the policy of grazing of the past by people who were never forced to face up to the fact that young men and women had to go to America while their parents went to England to earn the rents, rates and <Col N="1169" /> taxes, and send them back to their women folk at home who were reaping the crops.  That is the position we are up against in the West of Ireland and that is the position the Government is up against and, because they are facing up to the fact that the American income is no longer coming in, that emigration is no longer possible, and that migration, because of the poverty of the English farmer, is no longer a proposition of any value, that they determined that there must be some change of policy in this country.  There must be an industrial arm in addition to the agricultural arm to try to balance matters in this country.</P>
      <P>That does not please certain people, naturally.  I should like any Deputy opposite to tell me what commodity on a large scale, a big item, could be manufactured in this country more cheaply and at a profit than in any other country in the world.</P>

We always have, in debates of this kind, a half-hearted attack on one thing and a half-hearted attack on the other. Deputies get up saying that they are protectionists, and they attack you, at the same time, because you protect the <Col N="1170" /> home market and because you manufacture your flour here.  The people in the West of Ireland may be hit by that.  The price of flour may have gone up but, anyhow, they gave a verdict in favour of a Government that would go ahead with a protective policy because they have young people growing up for whom they hope employment will be provided in this country.  We know very well that the Government policy cannot be judged fairly under present circumstances.  We know the terrible handicaps.

Deputy Cosgrave, in the past, used to lament the fact in the same melancholy tone that we heard from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney this morning, that there was unfortunately no man to take over the running of this State, otherwise he would step out.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people in charge of this State now who have received the support of an overwhelming majority of the Irish people and they are entitled to get a fair chance and, as I have said, in any agricultural policy that is in operation here certain people are bound to suffer. As I have pointed out, the people in the West of Ireland, under present conditions of no emigration, no American income and no migration worth while to England, would have suffered very much.  They had, however, those big outlets and incomes to enable them to live on their farms and it was because of that that they did not feel the full effect of the disastrous policy in operation here.  Those outlets for Irishmen and women from the west and that big income to the small farmers from America are stopped and that, in addition to the economic dispute, is a very big handicap on the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was going to say a while ago, when I was interrupted, that we used to hear Deputy Hogan and Deputy Cosgrave say, a couple of years ago, that the best thing that could happen this country would be that Fianna Fáil should get into office for one year. That was quite a usual statement from the then Ministers.  Deputy Hogan, as a rule, used to say that the best thing that could happen the country and Fianna Fáil itself was that Fianna Fáil should get into office.  It would be a <Col N="1173" /> good lesson for the people, if they need a further lesson after the experience of the last ten years, if Cumann na nGaedheal could come back and get a trial run for three months because I should like to see how they would tackle this problem, with the conglomeration of free traders plus semi-protectionists they have in their Party.</P>
    <P>With no emigration and without the income from abroad which enabled the West of Ireland farmer to live in the past, it could not be solved under their policy and, no matter what settlement or surrender they made with Britain, they could not tackle that problem with their sole dependence on the British market and allowing, at the same time, the overthrow of industries by imports from abroad.  So that I think the Department of Agriculture in attacking this problem have, despite all the handicaps, made a very great effort and deserve the gratitude of the people for bringing out the good points of that policy, the full fruits of which cannot be seen for some little time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said it was a matter for considerable comment that, when introducing his Estimate, the Minister had nothing to say.  After a protracted endeavour we succeeded in drawing him into the fray, and looked forward with eager anticipation to hear what the responsible head of the Department had to say of the prospects of Irish agriculture in the year 1933.  The longer we listened the gloomier the tale became.  Deputy Cleary has referred to-day to the depressing atmosphere that prevails, and says that he longs to see the silver lining.  I am going to read him the gilding that Fianna Fáil has put on Irish agriculture since they came into office.  Just before Fianna Fáil came into office the price of fat cattle was 35/9 per cwt. The price to-day is 24/- per cwt.  Just before Fianna Fáil came into office the price of old cows was 23/- per cwt. The German buyer has arrived, and I think he created a record yesterday. The previous record was 12/- a cwt. But the price made on the Dublin market yesterday for old cows was 8/- per cwt.  I ask Deputies to bear this <Col N="1174" /> in mind that the German buyer is paying 12/- a cwt. for old cows&mdash;we will not go below that figure&mdash;was getting a bounty on top of that for buying them. Springer cows were realising £18 10/- when Fianna Fáil came into office.  The price to-day is £7 or £8.  Yearlings were making £10 15/- when Fianna Fáil came into office, and now they are £5 or £6.  Two-year-olds were realising about £13 13/- when Fianna Fáil came into office.  The price to-day is £7.  When Fianna Fáil came into office, three-year-olds were £15 a head, but you cannot sell them now at any price. I am not surprised that Deputy Cleary is in some perplexity when he finds those concerned with the agricultural community depressed.  I do not think that Deputy Cleary is a man who ever took much interest in agriculture.</P>

It might be something like the information that he imparted to this House with reference to the principal industry in his constituency.

      <P>I do not propose to give way to the Deputy, but I think it is well that this House should understand the source of information which provides us with the interesting statement that the small farmers of Mayo have never made their farms pay.  The next astonishing statement that we had from Deputy Cleary was that the country is suffering from the economic war.  I can remember the time&mdash;we were then walking into the economic war with flags flying&mdash;when we were told it was the greatest blessing that ever came to the country.  Senator Connolly said it was really a great blessing.  The Minister for Defence <Col N="1176" /> said the only consequence he could see that would flow from this economic war was that a new industry would be set up in this country to widen the doors of the farmers' houses so that the people, having got so fat as a result of his policy and that of Deputy Cleary, would be able to get in and out.  But these prescient statesmen have now discovered that, instead of the people getting so fat that they could not get in or out through their hall doors, the country is suffering from the economic war.  We knew that they would learn, but we also knew that it would be an expensive business to teach them.  They will learn.  The next stage is: Do we recognise that there are rumours of a settlement?

      <P>We recognise all the signs of the times, we are doing our best to settle, but in case we do not let everybody know that when we fail it will not be our fault&mdash;it may be anybody's fault but it will not be ours.  That kind of thing has been tried three or four times already by Fianna Fáil, but it will not wash again.  It is getting a bit shabby. I think I should advert for a moment to what the Minister had to say about one of the principal administrative departures in the Department of Agriculture.  He was exchanging courtesies with Deputy Belton when speaking on wheat schemes, those schemes which are going to make our fortunes.  Deputy Belton was referring to the conditions in Canada when the Minister for Agriculture intervened to say: &ldquo;In Canada they are going much further north now as a result of the breeding experiments carried out.  The Deputy said as a result of that they ought to be able to realise in Canada probably 100,000,000 dollars more for their wheat.  He was talking.  I think, of 1928.  What would the figure be now?  I should say that the gain to them now would be about 20,000,000 dollars.&rdquo;  That is to say, that wheat in Canada to-day <Col N="1177" /> is realising one-fifth of what would have been paid for it five years ago. This is the year, when the Minister for Agriculture admits that the value of wheat was never lower than it is at the moment, that we are to march the farmers of Mayo, who never could make their farms pay, into producing wheat, and make them a little worse off than they were before, according to Deputy Cleary.  My answer to the Minister and to Deputy Cleary is this: if they let the farmers of Mayo alone and give them a fair chance they will be able to make their farms pay all right.  If the Minister would induce his colleague, the Minister for Lands and Fisheries to press forward a little more actively the policy of men who really understood the problem of the congested areas, by improving the condition of the small-holders in those areas and by enlarging their holdings instead of talking about doing it, the farmers of Mayo would want no help over and above a fair field and a free field.  If they get that they will make their farms pay and they will get along all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Ryan went on, carried away by his figures, and described Deputy Belton as an old sheep.  What was the purpose of this old sheep?  He said that in America they keep an old sheep for leading cattle in to be slaughtered. I think we never heard a truer word spoken.  The Fianna Fáil Party has been running up and down through the country, describing the benefits and blessings that they were going to confer on this country, when they came in here to form a Government.  If the Deputy will excuse me for adopting the simile, the old sheep was used to bring the cattle in here and the devil such a slaughter has ever been perpetrated in this country before. The agricultural economy of Fianna Fáil has been slaughtered, discredited and dishonoured.  It is an interesting and gratifying thing to know that the Minister for Agriculture is beginning to realise that.  Later on in the debate he was stirred into activity again and he said: &ldquo;Of course their Party is finished.  This Party is finishing all Parties.&rdquo;  Was there ever a truer word <Col N="1178" /> spoken?  The Fianna Fáil Party is finishing all Parties, public and private in this State.  I have no doubt that if the Minister is given sufficient scope and time he will complete the job. This Party is finishing all Parties.  It is finishing everyone in the State.</P>

As Deputy MacDermot said, it was like the South Sea bubble company which was described as &ldquo;an undertaking of great advantage but nobody is to know what it is.&rdquo;  We have foreign markets of great advantage but nobody is to know where they are.  How we are to get into them remains a mystery. The Minister in justifying his discreet operations in foreign markets told the House that the British market is declining and will shortly be of no value, although the Minister knows that at the present time the British market for pork and bacon is of such a character that when we get the quota that will be allotted to us under the Lane-Fox Commission&mdash;mind you, it is only an estimated quota and there are no definite figures&mdash;it will put us to the pin of our collar to supply it.  If we had the whole British market for pigs and bacon this country could not supply half of it.  If we had a free field it would put us to the pin of our collar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking sense.  I know that is not Deputy Hales's long suit, but I suggest he should await his opportunity to talk nonsense after I have done.  If we examine the market in Great Britain to-day for every item of agricultural produce that is produced in this country we shall find <Col N="1179" /> that, much as it has deteriorated&mdash;and admittedly it is not as good as it was 15 years ago&mdash;down in the very bottom as it now is, I do not believe there is a single branch of that market, if we could get the whole of it, which we would be able to supply fully.  It would tax this country to capacity to supply more than half of what is required in Great Britain in any branch of agricultural produce to-day. No man in this House knows that better than the Minister and yet he comes in here and tells us that the British market does not count for anything. Nobody objects to his getting foreign markets; he is welcome to them, but, in my opinion, it is bad for Irish agriculture and bad for the country as a whole that people should be coming into our markets and buying beef at 12/- per cwt. and having us paying them to buy it.  It is a reflection on the quality of our produce.  Cheap sales do not speak well for any business.  Whenever you see a fellow putting up a poster saying: &ldquo;Come in and buy our goods for half nothing and what is more we shall give you a pair of boots with every purchase,&rdquo; you may be sure that fellow is going on the rocks.  That is what is happening here.  When a man starts doing that, what does any reasonable man say except that it is a rubbish sale and that nobody would buy anything there?</P>

      <P>He says: &ldquo;God send me another damn fool like that.&rdquo;  Take the question of the pig market alone.  The Lane-Fox proposals are coming into force.  If the economic war were ended it would mean that we would secure in Great Britain a market for pig products that, doing our best, we should never be able fully to supply. The same can be said in regard to the egg market and in regard to beef and mutton, if we would only recover our senses.  Everybody knows where we stand on that.  We always believed that the economic war could be settled <Col N="1180" /> by sensible negotiations, if the Government wished to have it settled. There is probably a good deal of tomfoolery going on on both sides of the water, if the truth were known.  I am glad to see that there are men getting up in the British House of Commons to tell Mr. Thomas what we are telling President de Valera, that it is high time in the interests of both countries that a sensible settlement should be made and a reconciliation come to.  It is noticeable that the people who say that in the British House of Commons are not told that they are playing Ireland's game.  Most rational men are inclined to say that there should be a sensible settlement.</P>

      <P>That is the trouble.  In conclusion, I would ask the Minister one question.  He said that the bounty on cattle was paid on the gross value of the cattle.  I should like him to inform us on what basis is the bounty paid on cattle exported from this country.  I am informed by a farmer that he exported cattle which realised in Great Britain £100, and when he went to claim his bounty he was told that he would be only paid bounty on the £100 less the 40 per cent. tariff, so that the bounty on the cattle was paid only as if the cattle were value for £60.  I understood the Minister to say that that was not correct.  Do I understand the Minister correctly or is it true that for every consignment of cattle value £100 shipped out of the country we are only paid bounty on £60?</P>

      <P>This case arose some time ago.  In any case this man complained that he was only given a bounty on the basis of what he got for the cattle less the tariff he paid to Great Britain.  I do not think it is an equitable arrangement.  However, these matters fade into insignificance beside the future of our principal industry.  It is time Fianna Fáil woke up to the fact that this business has either to be settled sensibly, and soon, or make up its mind that the principal industry is going down to absolute ruin and destruction.  It is the industry that employs by far the largest number of people in this country.  There is no use in people sinking their heads in the sand like the ostrich; they have to face facts.  If they have made up their minds that they want to wipe the agricultural industry out of existence, then they are going the right way about it. If they firmly believe that agriculture can survive, and if the present policy of the Government is to continue, that is absolute nonsense, and the sooner Fianna Fáil realises that the better it will be for everyone.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The text of this Bill is precisely the same as that of the withdrawn Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Bill to which the House gave a Second Reading on 17th May, with certain exceptions.  Since the Second Reading of the Bill which has been withdrawn further consideration has been given to an aspect concerning which representations have been made to the Minister for Finance from time to time.  As Deputies are aware, the recent Bill only covered the same period as that covered by the existing Damage to Property (Compensation) Acts, namely, from 21st January, 1919, which was the date the First Dáil met, to 12th May, 1923. Apart from the special provision made by these Acts, claims in respect of damage to property are, under the Criminal Injuries Code, determinable by the courts, any compensation awarded being charged on local rates. This was the position as respects damage to property in the period prior to January, 1919.  Damage caused by British military or police forces was outside the scope of the Criminal Injuries Acts and in 1916 the British Government felt compelled to set up a special committee to deal extra statutorily with claims for damage done during and after the Rising of 1916.  This committee rejected a number of claims on the ground of the applicants' complicity with the Rising, with the result that a number of persons who suffered damage failed to obtain compensation from any official source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new paragraph which has been incorporated in the Bill enables such persons now to make a claim for compensation to the Circuit Court, if the damage was caused in one or other <Col N="1184" /> of the circumstances detailed in the paragraph, that is to say, while the premises were being defended in arms against the British authorities by any person ordinarily resident therein, or while such person was under arrest or was endeavouring to resist arrest. The paragraph as drawn covers not merely the period immediately subsequent to the Rising of 1916, but the period between the date of the Rising, and the date of the assembly of the First Dáil, because it is felt that a number of other cases may come to light as a consequence of the additional powers which are being asked for, and that arising out of the conscription period similar cases may fall to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (b) of Section 2 (1) the words in brackets, &ldquo;including damage to or destruction of property occasioned by acts of the British military or police authorities acting or purporting to act under martial law&rdquo; are also new.  The object of these words in brackets is to remove a doubt which arose as to whether the paragraph as originally drafted covered damage to property in the Twenty-Six County area in pre-Truce days, where the damage was done by Crown Forces as a matter of military necessity.</P>
    <P>In Section 1 of the Bill the word &ldquo;injury&rdquo; is defined as having the same meaning as it has in the Act of 1923, that is to say, &ldquo;any loss, damage or injury in respect of which compensation could be given under the Criminal Injuries Acts.&rdquo;  On further consideration, it was felt that a court might possibly hold that the provisions of paragraph (b) of Section 2 (1) as originally drafted applied only to damage which could have been the subject of an award of compensation under the Criminal Injuries Acts, and that damage done by order of the military authorities is outside the scope of those Acts, and therefore outside the scope of the Bill.  A few claims in respect of damage sustained in such circumstances have already been received in the Department of Finance, and presumably these claims will be presented to the Circuit Court in due <Col N="1185" /> course.  Our intention was clearly to make these people eligible for compensation. As the matter does not appear to be free from doubt, the words in brackets have been added to make clear the intention of the Legislature.</P>
    <P>In Section 2, sub-section (2), the following words, which appear in brackets in lines 34 and 35, &ldquo;save as is otherwise provided in any subsequent provision of this Act&rdquo; are also new.  In the debate on the Second Reading of the original Bill, Deputy Esmonde suggested that there was some conflict between Section 2 and the present Section 12, which was Section 10 in the withdrawn Bill. The former, which indicates the classes of claims which may be made the subject of compensation under this Bill, provides that the Bill does not apply to any loss or damage in respect of which compensation has been paid by any Department of State or by the Commissioners of Public Works.  On the other hand, Section 12 in the present draft, which deals with recovered property which has been or will be the subject of compensation, provides that that section does, by implication, apply to cases in which a payment of compensation has been made out of public funds.  While it is not admitted that there is so obvious a conflict as Deputy Esmonde suggested, it was considered desirable, as the question had been raised, to remove any doubt in the matter.  Accordingly, I had already, as in the case of the other alterations made by this Bill, given notice of an amendment which would have that purpose.  In sub-section (2) of this section, in lines 37-39, the following words, which are also new, are being inserted, &ldquo;the Government of the late United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, any local authority.&rdquo;  This addition is consequential on and becomes necessary by reason of the insertion of paragraph (a) in Section 2.  Its effect is to exclude claims for damage to property in respect of which a payment has already been made by the British Government or by a local authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> Section 8 of the Bill is an entirely new section.  It was at first thought that the general power conferred by Section 66 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, to make rules of the Circuit Court would extend to the making of rules of court for the purposes of the Bill.  On further consideration, however, it was felt to be safer to take express power to make these rules, as was laid down in Section 19 of the Principal Act.  The new section confers this power by definitely applying the provisions of Section 19 of the original Act to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is also a new section.  It arises out of the discovery that in a number of cases where decrees were granted by the Circuit or County Court, under Part II of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, notice of appeal was lodged on behalf of the State on the ground, <i>inter alia,</i> that paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of Section 9 of the original Act applied to the application.  Deputies will recollect that one of the reasons why it is necessary to bring in this Bill at all is the number of cases where damage to property was suffered and where the aggrieved persons were debarred, under Section 9, from applying for compensation because of certain political associations which they were supposed to have.  In some of the cases in which notice of appeal had been given, an agreement was reached out of court under which the applicant agreed to accept a reduced payment in discharge of the decree originally made in his favour, on condition that the appeal would be withdrawn.  After a perusal of the files I am inclined to think that in at least some of these cases Section 9 was unduly relied on to force a settlement.  This new section proposes to give me power to reopen such cases and, where I consider that course warranted, to pay such further compensation as I may think proper, but not exceeding the amount of the deduction already made from the original decree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

      <P>I am to have power <Col N="1187" /> to pay such further compensation as I may think proper, but not exceeding the amount of the deduction already made from the original decree.  That is to say, I propose to place these people in exactly the same position as that in which others who were not affected by Section 9 were allowed to remain.  They can be granted now the amount of the decree originally awarded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases they were on all grounds.  It is quite clear from the documents I have seen that where the State had reason to believe the decisions of the Circuit Court on matters of fact&mdash;that is to say, as to the amount of compensation awarded &mdash;would not be reversed, it relied entirely on Section 9 to compel a settlement.</P>
      <P>Our desire is to see these people in the same position in which they would have been if Section 9 had not been in the original Act.  If a reinstatement condition is attached to the original decree, it will be open under this new section to the Minister to make any further payment he may now authorise conditional on compliance with that or any other condition he sees fit to impose.  The necessity for allowing him the alternative is that in some cases it may not be possible now to insist on the fulfilment of the original condition since rebuilding may have been already completed within the amount of the compensation actually paid.  I should say that this is the reason why it is proposed to leave the Minister free to impose any condition, but in practice it is not likely that any condition other than a building condition such as out-offices or buildings of that nature would be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of the new section expressly provides that the 10 per cent. addition which was payable under the 1926 Damage to Property Act shall apply and be payable in these cases. This is necessary in order to place the applicant in as good a position as <Col N="1188" /> he would have been in had the appeal not been taken.  The granting of the additional payments in these cases, in contradistinction to its refusal under Section 9 of the Bill in other cases, is defensible on the ground that in making any payment our predecessors admitted the applicant's legal right to compensation, whereas the persons covered by Section 9 are now, for the first time, being made legally eligible. The 10 per cent. addition has been allowed on the compensation already paid.  We propose to allow the balance which would remain to be paid after the people originally compensated had been given the benefit of the new Section 10.</P>
    <P>These are the only new provisions in this Bill apart from those which were contained in the Bill which was withdrawn and which already had passed its Second Reading in this House. What I have said in regard to consequential damage and to the impossibility of compensating for billeting and other services of that nature will remain, as far as this Bill is concerned. The amendments have been already before the House for a considerable period, but in essence the principle of the Bill remains exactly the same as the original Bill.  I hope the House will give the Bill a formal Second Reading and the amendments can then be discussed on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>If I am not mistaken this Bill was only circulated this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I pointed out that it was the old Bill with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that all right; I have not read it, having only got it this morning, and until now on listening to the Minister's statement I did not know its provisions.  I do not like the manner in which it is proposed to deal with Section 9 in cases where the accommodation was found.  This Bill is a departure from the Minister's strict practice.  The Minister now would have to decide in these cases as to reopening or whether he was satisfied that the original decree should stand. That places the Minister in an <Col N="1189" /> anomalous position.  I think that claims ought to be the subject of a court decision; these claims ought to come before the court.  If the Minister is satisfied that there is a case for appeal then that is another matter.  This new departure is open to very great objection. The Minister will realise that after a couple of years and he will come to the conclusion that it would have been much better in those cases of compensation if the claims had come before the courts and were decided there.</P>
      <P>There are two sections to which I propose to refer.  One is the section dealing with the limitation of time for payment of certain classes of compensation. Now a very great addition is being given to certain people by this measure and there are some cases which may possibly be the cause of hardship by reason of this limitation of time.  I am not prepared to deny that 11 years is a long period, but 11 years would be a long period in certain cases while it would be a short period in others.  I have in mind one case of compensation where a decree was obtained with the condition of reconstruction and that person will not reconstruct.  Possibly his successor in title would be most anxious to reconstruct. Meanwhile the life of one individual stops the house being built. In a second case the people referred to were awarded compensation.  Can the Minister say how many cases of compensation have been brought to his notice under this heading?  If I am not mistaken there is only one such case.  I put it to the Minister: is it worth while for one case to have that provision inserted?  It is unlikely that any other cases will occur.  If so is the amount considerable?  It appears to be disappearing.  There is revealed here in one direction generosity and in the other cheeseparing.  I think the Bill might be just as well without that particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases where compensation was awarded in respect of quite a number of items, if I am not mistaken, they were regarded as hotch-potch. There were cases where sums very closely approximating to the value were obtained by decrees of the court, <Col N="1190" /> but in other cases very much smaller sums were decreed in compensation because of the lack of information.  In a case with which I was in touch there was one article included and it was subsequently discovered that it had been taken out.  In other cases very valuable articles were not included, so that in cases where one had a list of items, it was found that very valuable items were not included. Where articles were recovered a round sum was taken as the value of the entire property.  Very few people keep an exact description of every article of furniture in the house.  I knew one case in which that had been done when people went into a house, but when they were in it a couple of years the list did not bear a close approximation to the value of the articles.  I think that, on reflection, the Minister would be very well advised to exclude that section from the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately about £150,000.  On the point which Deputy Cosgrave has raised in regard to Section 10, I do not think that we would be justified in doing as he suggests in view of the fact that it was not the practice of the Court of Appeal to reverse the findings of the lower courts on questions of fact, including the assessment of the damage done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the assessment of the damage done.  I do not think it is desirable that we should compel these people now to go to the expense, ten years later, of defending an award made to them by the lower court, an award properly made to them.  For that reason, I do not think I can accept the suggestion of Deputy Cosgrave. This is a matter to which I have given a great deal of consideration and I have come to the conclusion that in all the circumstances it would be better to leave the matter as in the Bill, since it is the intention of the Legislature now to put these people on exactly the same footing as other <Col N="1191" /> persons injured or aggrieved during the period covered by the Bill.  I do not think it would be desirable to inflict on them what would be a hardship&mdash;of having to come ten years later to defend their case in the Appeal Court.  The number of cases are relatively small, not more than five or six at the outside, and it would be much better to draw a curtain over the whole of that period and put them in the same position as the others.</P>
      <P>With regard to section 11, I would be prepared on the Committee Stage to consider an amendment, not to the principle of the section, but relating to the final date upon which compensation might be paid.  I think we must stand on the principle in Section 12, which is that, once a person has been compensated for property taken or destroyed, the State, having paid the compensation, becomes entitled to the property.  I do not think we can allow anybody to have it both ways.  Either they lost the property or they did not lose it. If they were compensated for the loss of the property, in my opinion, they lost title to it.  It is not a hardship because it is provided in sub-section (3) that &ldquo;Where any chattels become the property of the Minister for Finance by virtue of this section, the person who satisfies the said Minister that he would, but for this section, be the owner of such chattels shall be entitled to purchase such chattels from the said Minister at a price equal to the amount of the compensation paid or awarded in respect of the destruction, taking away or loss of such chattels.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

If there was such a list and they were included then I think, it would be a matter of equitable arrangement between the Minister and the person concerned and we certainly would come to an agreement as to what the value of these articles might be.  The owner would have an opportunity of re-purchasing the articles from the Minister if he so desired.  I do not think the section is a harsh one.  I think it is meant to deal with a situation that has arisen and which may possibly arise in the future.</P>

So, that particular owner has quite frankly acknowledged his obligation in the matter.  We only want to put the original owners of any further property that may be discovered on the same footing as this owner.

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £41,276 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment <Col N="1196" /> during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1934, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry, including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.  (9 and 10 Geo. 5, c. 58; No. 16 of 1924; and No. 34 of 1928).</P>
    <P>As the House appears to resent the introduction of an estimate without some statement, I propose to make a short statement on this Estimate.  The total net vote proposed for the current financial year is £61,876, being a decrease of £139 as compared with last year.  The total area of land acquired by the Department for forestry purposes up to the end of March last is 54,494 acres.  Of this total 39,245 acres were purchased, 11,099 acres were leased, 3,814 acres were transferred free of charge from the Department of Defence, and 336 acres were acquired compulsorily under the powers vested in the Minister by the Forestry Acts, 1919-28. The total area planted or re-planted to date is 34,138 acres, of which 3,568 acres were planted in the past season. Of the leased lands, 2,007 acres have not yet been taken over.  For the purposes of administration the forest lands are divided into 45 forest units each of which is in charge of a local officer.</P>
    <P>Of the area actually in hands probably 43,887 acres are plantable. Of the plantable area 6,691 acres are at present stocked, or partially stocked by mature and semi-mature timber, mostly of inferior quality, which is being gradually cleared off; 34,138 acres carry young plantations created by the Department; 100 acres are occupied by nurseries, and the balance is either bare ground or scrub-covered in process of being cleared and prepared for planting.  During the last financial year acquisitions were 2,185 acres by purchase; and 1,721 acres on long lease.  Negotiations are in progress in various stages for the acquisition of, approximately, 15,000 acres.  Progress is admittedly slow, but afforestation is essentially a slow matter.  Within limits the question of an increased programme is entirely one of financial <Col N="1197" /> provisions.  The possibility of devoting more money to national afforestation is being examined, and if we find we can afford more the machinery will be expanded for a larger programme. One thing is certain, that whatever programme is adopted it must be assured of continuity.  Spasmodic efforts in which schemes are rushed at one time, and suspended, limited or withdrawn at another, only lead to waste of time, energy and money. It is far preferable to carry on State afforestation by slow and gradual methods which can be continued, than to adopt big schemes which break down through lack of funds in the course of a few years.</P>
    <P>Complaints are often made that forestry work has not been undertaken in such and such a county, or such and such a district, and that certain parts of the country are specially favoured. The question, however, is a national one, and ought not to be viewed from parochial standpoints.  The selection of sites must be governed by considerations like climatic and physical features, soils, availability of large areas, and the respective merits of lands offered for grazing or planting. For economic working the creation of large units is essential; 10,000 to 20,000 acres in one unit would be desirable.</P>
    <P>Taking the sub-heads in detail: In sub-head A there is a reduction of £354 as compared with last year.  This is due partly to the drop in the cost-of-living bonus and partly to changes in the staff.  As regards sub-head C.I. &mdash;Acquisition of Lands&mdash;this is a grant in aid of £10,000.  Provision under this heading is made by way of grant-in-aid so that unexpended balances may be carried over.  The necessity for this procedure arises out of the difficulty in forecasting the length of time which may be required in any particular case of acquisition for negotiation and necessary legal processes.  The balance in the Acquisition Fund on 31st March last amounted to £6,219.  Under sub-head C.2.  (1) Foresters and Caretakers' Wages, there is a sum of £5,000, and (2)  Maintenance, £10,750.  In the latter item is included a sum of £7,250 <Col N="1198" /> to cover the estimated cost of the labour required for preliminary fencing of new areas, and for the cleaning and general aftercare of the plantations already established.  The requirements of fencing materials and tools are estimated to cost £2,500, and £1,000 is provided for the upkeep of buildings. Under sub-head (3) there is included £27,250, representing the estimated cost of the workmen required for nursery work, preparation of ground for planting and actual planting. Under sub-head (3) (b) a sum of £1,000 is provided to cover the purchase of seeds, seedlings and transplants. Most of our seed requirements necessarily come from abroad, but in the case of seedlings they are practically all produced in our own nurseries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The seeds are imported, but the seedlings are practically all produced at home.  Only seeds are imported.  At the moment I cannot mention the countries, but I can get that information for the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-head (4) the £1,500 under the head of timber conversion represents the estimated cost of the running expenses of the Department's sawmill at Dundrum, Co. Tipperary, as well as a small mill recently set up at Emo forest centre, near Portarlington.  There is a small sum under sub-head (E) for Forestry Education, £200.  This item provides for (a) the training of apprentices with a view to supplying the need for skilled forest foremen and foresters, and (b) special intensive courses of lectures for junior foresters and foremen in the Department's service.  As a result of an examination held in July last year, six new trainees are at present undergoing their first year of training.  Arrangements have been made to hold another examination for the recruitment of further trainees during the summer. These men are recruited through the Civil Service Commission and we hope to have a very good staff trained in that way after a few years.  Up to <Col N="1199" /> a few years ago we were depending to a great extent on experts in forestry work coming from other countries; but we hope in future to be able to train our own foresters.</P>
    <P>As regards Appropriations-in-Aid, sub-head H, these receipts will be mainly from the sale of mature timber, including timber manufactured at Dundrum sawmill; rents from grazings, cottages, turbary, shootings, etc., will also be included. I think these are the only comments I have to make on the various sub-heads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his opening remarks, said the House wished to have estimates explained.  He is perfectly correct in that.  I think every member of the House, certainly every member in opposition, wishes to have estimates introduced with a speech by the Minister.  On a question of forestry I must confess that, so far as I am concerned, I would have liked a very much fuller statement by the Minister. Since this Government has come into power we have had no review of the forestry situation, no explanation of forestry policy.  There are numbers of things which are of interest to us and to many private individuals who, either on a small or a large scale, wish to do tree planting in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that 54,000 acres have been acquired already for tree planting purposes and that 34,000 acres have been planted.  That leaves a balance of 20,000 acres in the hands of the Department.  They are proceeding at the rate of 3,000 acres a year, assuming that last year's activities will be continued.  That means that we have got almost a seven years' supply of land on hand. I would like to know what was the need for acquiring 50,000 acres.  Of course, I can understand that if the Department does not acquire the land now, it might not be possible to do so later on.  I notice that for the 50,000 acres a sum of £10,000 has been set aside.  I agree with the Minister that if you are going to plant economically you can plant only upon an area which has a very low <Col N="1200" /> financial value per acre.  On the 50,000 acres the Minister has put a figure of 4/- per acre as the fee-simple value.  It strikes me that is a rather low estimate.  I think it will be difficult to purchase land in fee-simple, no matter how valueless it may be, if it is not pure rock, at 4/- an acre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

      <P>I dare say it is explicable.  The figure struck me at the time as rather peculiar.  The Minister's figure of £3 an acre sounds more reasonable and I can now understand that.  I quite agree that forestry is a national question.  It is inadvisable that Deputies should say here: &ldquo;My area is being neglected.&rdquo;  I think that is very much overdone sometimes in this House.  I would like to know where the planted areas are situated. I suggest to the Minister that there should be, as it were, a double scheme going on.  All the plantations should not be confined to the east coast.  Some efforts should also be made to see if planting can be successfully carried out on the mountain slopes in the western areas.  I am not specifying any particular county.  Of course where there is waste land we would like to see experiments carried out there.  I think a 10,000 acre block is too big for this country.  It is highly desirable if you can get it, but I suggest it would be perfectly feasible to work on a very much smaller block than 10,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter upon which I would like some information.  I have now in mind the species of trees which are being planted.  Are they all soft woods, or are there any hard wood <Col N="1201" /> plantations being made?  In regard to soft woods, I would like to know how the different varieties are getting on and which ones are showing themselves most suited to the climate of this country.  That information would be especially interesting in relation to trees of which we have a very limited experience.  Larch, Scotch fir and the older forms of Norway spruce we know everything about.  We have a fair idea as to what situation these can be successfully planted in.</P>
    <P>I would like some information on other qualities of trees of the newer kinds.  Has the Douglas fir been extensively planted by the Department? What class of land is the Douglas fir doing best on?  I happened to spend two or three days in Wales last year and I noticed on the slopes of the mountains there plantations are being made.  Certainly four-fifths of the areas that are being planted are being planted with Douglas fir. There was some silver fir but the thing that struck me as strange was that they are planting comparatively few areas with larch.  They seem to be specialising in Douglas fir.  To what extent is the Department of Agriculture here growing Douglas fir and what success have they met with in the planting of it?  I made a small plantation myself in which I put down, with other trees, Douglas fir. They grew very well for the first four or five years, but they are showing a tendency to go off now.  They are very quick growing.  It is an early maturing timber.  No other tree of that class will produce the same quantity of timber in the same time as Douglas fir.  I would like to know if it has been found to be suitable in this country.  Another tree I would like to know something about is the silka spruce.  I should like to know how far it is useful.  There is, also, a tree I have seen recommended but I have not planted in my own comparatively small plantation and that is the Thuja Gigantea.  I wonder if the Departments have tried that and whether it has turned out to be as valuable as other classes of timber.</P>
    <P>Not by the way of criticism, but by the way of obtaining information, I <Col N="1202" /> should like to know where the particular forestry plantations of the Department are situated.  A good deal of the work has been done, I understand, in the County Wicklow, but I should like to know where else it has been extended to.  On this question of afforestation, generally, the Minister said it would be a great mistake to embark upon a very big scheme, and having embarked upon it, to find that you had to stop because you had not enough money to complete it.  I am personally of opinion that some of the large sums expended upon relief schemes could be more profitably expended upon the extension of forestry.  A thousand acre or a 500 acre plot could possibly be made to pay.  There are parts of the country almost denuded of timber &mdash;where no native timber is left at all.  Even a 100-acre plantation would be very valuable not only for climatic but other conditions also.  Homegrown timber must be made available for the needs of different localities. Although it may not be a completely economic proposition it would be a scheme that would show more return for the money expended than some of the money we spend upon other undertakings.</P>
    <P>I know the view has been expressed from the Government Benches that forestry is not a very suitable industry because it does not employ a tremendous amount of labour.  I do not agree with that view.  If you have plantations enclosed with wire fencing that may be true, and it is necessary in many districts that there should be wire fencing.  But there are a good many areas in the country where wire fencing would not be necessary.  The danger is from hares and rabbits; but there are no rabbits within miles of some of these areas and hares are pretty well kept down.  They are practically exterminated and you could put up an ordinary bank instead of putting up wire fencing.  Again if you are planting large areas you must do a good deal of trenching which gives great employment.  In the planting of trees much depends on the age of the tree as to the amount of employment given.  If you are only doing slip-planting <Col N="1203" /> very little employment will be given but if the trees are older you have to dig pits, and this gives a good deal of employment.  I think that the amount of employment given in that way is very much more in proportion to what would be given in anything else.  The only expenditure, other than employment, is the purchase of the land.  £3 per acre is not an enormous cost and the cost of seedlings which are now being reared in the nurseries of the Department is not great.  In the cost of most trees it is probably better to grow them from seed.  If you are to make it a paying transaction I think it is better to get the seed from its native place, where the tree flourished in the past.  I think that would be found better than trying to rear trees in this country from seed grown in this country if the tree does not replant itself here.  The only soft wood that replants itself here is the Scotch fir. Therefore I think it would be more economic to import the seed of Douglas fir from Colorado, and silka spruce from Canada, than to use home grown seed for the production of those trees. These are some of the matters upon which I would like to have the views of the Minister for Agriculture.  I would, also, like to have his views as to what variety of soft wood it is best to plant in addition to larch and fir.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to know what class of trees the Department is planting.  Coming as I do from a place where timber is extensively grown, I think we should do all we possibly can to develop forestry as quickly as possible.  The hardwood we have in this country is not much use, and hardwood takes a long time to produce.  Possibly the hardwood in native timber that we have is not of much commercial value. I have in mind such trees as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney spoke of, silver spruce and the like.  Undoubtedly in the near future these trees will be very much more valuable, and I think we should do all we can to speed up the planting of them.  There is another tree of which this country has very little and which at the moment <Col N="1204" /> is of some interest.  I understand that a factory has been established for the making of clogs.  The one tree most suitable for the making of clogs is alder.  It makes the very best type of clogs.  It is light, easily worked and it is the wood always chosen.  Next comes beech.  It has occurred to me that in many parts of the country we have considerable areas of beech.  The trees are old, and many are rotting all over the country.  Could not this timber be taken over by the Department and utilised in the manner I have indicated?  It is a pity to see timber like that all over the country almost rotting when use could be made of it.  If these plantations could be taken over by the Department and cleared and the areas replanted they would, to a great extent, pay for themselves.  That would give us a chance of planting trees which would be more valuable from an economic point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very extensive trade was done in this country at one time in pit-wood but many collieries now are using steel and iron posts instead of wooden ones, and that trade, which at one time gave considerable employment here and brought a considerable amount of money to us, has been killed.  In view of the extraordinary demand there is now for timber such as spruce, which is extensively used for paper-making and the production of artificial silk, we should, I think, concentrate upon growing timber of that kind which would give us the quickest possible return.  We should endeavour to take over the afforested areas which are in private hands and clear them, because a considerable amount of the timber in the existing forests is practically useless.  It is not properly looked after.  The undergrowth is allowed to accumulate between the trees and the timber is really only fit for firewood.  We heard a lot yesterday about the use of turf.  We have a lot of timber in this country that is really useless for anything else but firewood, and in order to give work to those who are unemployed, it would be a good idea if that timber were taken over and cut.  I am prepared to admit that <Col N="1205" /> from a scenic point of view we might possibly do some damage but, apart from scenery, we have to consider the possibility of putting our people to work and I think this timber should be acquired and cut and the areas re-planted.  If existing forests are allowed to continue as they are the timber will simply rot.  If no effort is made to replace it we shall derive no benefit from it.  I think it would be a good idea if the Department would consider taking over the forests that are in private hands and endeavour to utilise them in the way suggested.  The planting of hard wood trees would not be of much benefit in the immediate future as they take a long time to mature and would have no market value probably for 50 years.  Whatever the reason is, native hard wood does not appear to be an economical proposition.  We do not appear to be able to produce hard timber in this country.  On the other hand, there is a class of timber which is most valuable to-day and later on will be even more valuable, inasmuch as large forest areas all over the world are being very rapidly cleared and more and more use is being made of this timber every day. I think that if we were to go in for this class of timber alone we would be doing the best thing we possibly could for the country.</P>

      <P>It was with great difficulty that I followed Deputy Goulding, because I could not hear him very well.  I was, however, interested in one matter he referred to as to which I thoroughly disagree with him, namely, that old stately beech trees should be cut down and turned into clogs.  I had intended to call the attention of the Minister to what is going on in the country and which almost amounts to vandalism, the cutting down of beautiful old copper beech trees which made certain districts very attractive for tourists and other people who visited them. Surely the Deputy does not suggest that districts which were practically denuded of trees during and after the War should be further denuded and that these beech trees should be cut <Col N="1206" /> down and used for the manufacture of clogs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>Afforestation is an undertaking in which the experts employed by the Department have to go slowly.  As regards the plantations established, the complaint is that they are in very backward places, so that tourists and others travelling through the country have not the advantage of seeing these fine young plantations which are adding to the beauty of the country.  Of course experts have to be guided by their knowledge of these matters but, if possible, sites for these plantations should be acquired in more accessible places.  Apart from the question of its being a national asset and of the employment which may be given, afforestation is very important from the point of view of the preservation of game.  Everybody knows that game will be protected by having these plantations and forests all over the country.  I would again direct the Minister's attention to the way in which our wonderful old beech trees are being removed, especially on estates which were formerly an attraction to the people and of which they were proud.  I understand that the felling of trees should not be undertaken until it has been sanctioned by the Department after 21 days' notice has been given.  In many cases, however, it is done without any sanction, and I should like to ask the Minister to look into that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention to the question of the acquisition of land for afforestation purposes.  So far as the County Kerry is concerned, the system does not appear to be workable. Recently I made representation to the Minister and the Department concerned in regard to the acquisition of plots of land for afforestation purposes, and the reply was to the effect that unless there was a centre or depot in the county it would not be <Col N="1207" /> economic to acquire these plots.  It would appear from that, that places like Kerry will never receive consideration in regard to afforestation schemes because, as far as I know, there is no such centre or depot within a radius which would make such schemes economical from the point of view of the Department.  I should like to point out that we have been offered portions of estates for practically nothing with the exception of the reservation of title, but these offers have had to be turned down owing to the absence of a centre. The inspectors reported that the soil was not suitable, but I should like to know if the inspectors concerned were really practical.  I know the county well and I know the districts concerned&mdash;one is an area of 100 acres and another an area of 200 acres&mdash;and I know that the soil is suitable.  Most of the inspectors in the Department, so far as agricultural afforestation is concerned, are purely theorists.  We know that from real experience the people in the areas can prove that the soil that has been reported on as being unsuitable would be suitable, at least, for afforestation purposes.  I would impress on the Minister that schemes of afforestation, whether they are carried out through the Committee of Agriculture or directly through the representatives of the Department, should be carried out in our county.  As pointed out by Deputy Goulding, we have vast areas of forest land which are neglected and which were at one time an asset to the nation.  They are at the moment purely waste lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important point is that this is work which will be of benefit to the county.  Apart altogether from the planting of the land, there is the question of the employment given. The areas concerned will not only be benefited, but men who hitherto could find no employment in isolated mountainous districts would find employment on these schemes.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider these reports sent in with regard to Kerry and to deal differently with them, to treat them as a matter of <Col N="1208" /> urgency, because we know in Kerry that the soil and the climate lend themselves to afforestation schemes, and to see that immediate attention is given to these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Vote last year, I had one or two things to say and, like Deputy Fitzgerald, I look on this matter from a national point of view, but looking at it from that point of view one is disposed to be driven away from that position by reason of the past attitude of the Department in concentrating on one part of the country, and, in fact, on one county. In connection with what Deputy Minch has said, I want to say that I would never have known there was afforestation going on in this country, were it not that I happen to be fond of sporting dogs and ramble from north to south of the country.  I happened to be down in Wicklow on one occasion&mdash; I do a good deal of dog training there &mdash;in the Glendalough district.  It was a very hot day and, after a desperate effort, I struggled over the hill from the valley, having been told when I left the hotel that I would find grouse there.  I found myself in the midst of a huge new plantation belonging to the Department&mdash;a perfect job&mdash;but planted in a God-forsaken spot to which a person could get only after the greatest physical effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says this is a national question, but is it being treated as such?  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has been very modest here and he wished the Minister to turn his eyes from the east to the west but not to any particular spot.  I am not quite so modest and I want the Minister to turn his eyes particularly to the gray hills of dark Donegal.  As Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has already said, this country has become denuded of timber as such. The entire midlands and the west have been completely denuded for the reason that in the past any timber that existed, particularly in the west, existed on the demesne lands belonging to the landlords on which the landlord's mansion or shooting lodge was built.  What has happened? When the landlords were bought out <Col N="1209" /> and when there was no further use for them here, to complete their abolition, they abolished everything.  When the mansion was of no further use, they sold the timber on these plantations and it may well be that it is not considered an economic proposition to plant these plantations as such but yet, so far as I can see, they are the only possible places at the moment.  They have grown timber which has been cut down and there is no doubt but that timber can be grown there again. These plantations range in extent from 1,000 acres down and I would suggest that the Department should adopt a fresh orientation&mdash;that they should decentralise themselves and replant these plantations which have been cut down following the sale of the estates. Unless that is done, I see no hope of this country ever again having any plantations.  The huge tract of land that is being awaited will not become available and this Vote will be submitted to the House year after year, but there will be no national development of afforestation.  I put that view forward seriously from the national standpoint and as being applicable to the West of Ireland but particularly to my own county.  The poet has spoken of &ldquo;the grey hills of dark Donegal&rdquo; and I would suggest to the Minister that he could perform no greater national work than to alter the poet's words and turn the grey hills of dark Donegal into the green hills of dark Donegal.  There is ample scope there and such a scheme would have a double purpose.  It would create a national asset and add to the scenic beauty of the county.  If Donegal has any attractions for the outside world, they are in its scenery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Like Kildare, yes. It must become wearisome for a stranger who comes here to motor over the country to see nothing for miles and miles but these barren mountain roads, nothing but brown heather and rock with not a plant or a shrub to be seen. That is the sort of prospect that meets the stranger's eye over stretches, in <Col N="1210" /> some places, of ten miles of country. Surely something should be done to plant those barren areas.</P>
      <P>I come back again to the point I made about decentralisation.  I do not want to say anything that might be misunderstood or on which I am not properly informed, but I think that in most counties it is correct to say there is a Department official in charge of afforestation.  He has the care of a small nursery.  There is certainly one in the County Donegal.  So far as I can observe the work of this official consists in taking a field from a local farmer.  He employs a staff of men. The official and the men proceed to the field each morning where they fiddle about all day attending to the plants.  That goes on from one end of the year to the other, State money being expended on the cultivation of those small plants.  But as a result of all that I see no big plantation work going on in any part of the county, a plantation comprising, say, five, ten or twenty acres.  Surely with a nursery in the county some effort might be made to plant fairly large areas and thus help to relieve the bleak, barren appearance of the county.  The Department has the central organisation to undertake that work, and I hope that a start will soon be made to carry out my suggestion.  An official paid by the State is on the spot.  Some land is taken from a local farmer and a rent paid for it.  The nursery is there and the plants are being cultivated.  With all that organisation available locally.  I think something might be done to undertake plantation work on areas attached to some of those big mansions, many of which were completely denuded of their timber during the war years.  They are bare and forbidding looking at present. If replanted in the manner I suggest they would add immensely to the beauty of the countryside.  If necessary additional men might be employed to go ahead with that class of work. The cost would not be great because, I think, it is correct to say that in all cases these areas are already fenced in so that all that is required is to get the men to put down the plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> I think the scheme I have outlined is a very practical one, and I hope that some steps will be taken to put it into effect.  Unless a beginning is made on those lines then I fear that the hope expressed by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney will never be realised.  It was unfortunate that when the landlords were being bought out, and when they cut down the large plantations on their estates, that they were not compelled to replant.  There is not much use I suppose in wailing over that now.  It is up to us to get something done.  I think the suggestion I have made to the Minister is a constructive one.  So far as my own county is concerned I submit it to him for his consideration and hope he may see his way to adopt it.</P>

There was a good deal of employment given, but the people are looking forward to more work being done.  He also knows that various requests have come to him from other parts of the county in connection with afforestation work, particularly from Bunclody in the north of the county.  Perhaps the Minister, when concluding, will let us know what is being done, and what the intentions of the Forestry Department are so far as the County Wexford is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney raised a good many points which I would like to deal with.  I think I said already that we tried to purchase land outright for about £3 an acre and to lease it for about 3/- an acre.  Deputies will realise from the figures I have quoted that the type of land we are after is not the best land because we would not get it at that price.  For instance, you would not get good grazing or tillage land at such a price.  On the other hand, we must get land that is plantable.  Very often, since I came into office, Deputies have reported to me that there were five acres and in <Col N="1212" /> some cases 1,000 acres of plantable land available in certain places.  I have always made it a point to send an inspector to these centres.  Very often the inspector reports that the land is not plantable for one reason or another. It might be bare mountain land which would not grow trees or it may be bad bog land, undrained and uncut.  Bog land that has been drained and cut away is suitable for planting, but if undrained and uncut it is not.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney also asked me if we are prepared to take over the 15,000 acres which we are negotiating for.  That may not come off within this financial year.  We hope it will.  If it does then I shall probably have to come before the House again with a Supplementary Estimate to deal with it as well as with any increase in forestry work.</P>
      <P>As I explained when introducing the Vote, if we intend, say, to deal with 6,000 or 10,000 acres a year, if we make up our minds to try and make that our permanent policy. We could not look on forestry work as a commercial or a paying proposition.  We could not, for the sake of the relief of unemployment or any other reason, go into a big plantation of 10,000 acres for a year or two, and then go back to 3,000 acres.  We have been examining for the last 12 months what we can make our permanent programme.  I admit it would take us a few years to reach the 10,000 acre mark.  We have found from experience in the Forestry Department that our own seedlings are better than imported seedlings, so that in order to provide seedlings for a plantation of 10,000 acres a year we would have to develop the nursery end of the business on a much larger scale than at present.  That would mean that a large programme, so far as planting out is concerned, could not be undertaken for two or three years.  That scheme, however, is under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect that we may be able to put our new programme into operation next year whatever we decide on. Of course, a difficulty will arise about getting land.  So far there has been <Col N="1213" /> no great difficulty in getting sufficient land for our programme of 3,500 acres a year.  Sufficient land has been offered to the Forestry Department to cope with the programme that we are carrying out at present.  If, therefore, we change to a bigger programme of 10,000 acres a year, we may be in the position of having to go out to look for land.  If we do, we may again be in the position of having to pay more for it.  These are some of the difficulties to be faced in going in for a larger programme. It is quite true, of course, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that 10,000 acre blocks are very difficult to obtain.  They are practically impossible, I think.  So far as I know, we do not hope to obtain more than five or six such blocks.  What we mean in the country by a 10,000 acres forest is 10,000 acres within a radius of say of seven or eight miles from the centre. We would regard that as one forest even though it was not all within the one fence.  If it were within a seven or eight miles radius of the centre we would regard it as one forest and call it a 10,000 acres forest or whatever the area might be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asked about the species of trees.  We have been trying many new species for some time but, as the Deputy very rightly says, it takes a very long time to find out whether these species will be successful or not.  It takes five years or even up to 25 years to discover whether certain species are suitable.  We cannot say at present definitely whether the new species are going to be successful.  The new species mentioned include silka spruce, Douglas fir, and species such as the Japanese larch.  We are also sticking to the old species, Norway spruce and European larch.  Thuga has not been tried to any great extent by the Forestry Department.  I was asked by Deputy Minch where we get our seeds.  The seeds come from France, Germany and Canada.  I presume they are got, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney says, from the native sources of the different varieties.  I have not got the details at the moment.  It takes a very long time to find out whether those species <Col N="1214" /> are suitable or not.  To give an instance of that, I may say that when I was discussing this matter first with one of the technical men in the forestry branch, I asked him whether they had experiments in cross-breeding as they had in cereals in Glasnevin. He told me that they were doing that work.  He said that the late Professor Henry did quite a lot of that work but that it would take 150 years to know the result.  You may judge from that how long it takes to get results from the comparatively new species in this country.</P>
    <P>In regard to the location of forests, the biggest centre, of course, is Wicklow. There is also quite a lot of planting between Tipperary and Waterford. Then come Leix and, fourth on the list, Kerry.  Deputy Flynn, who made a complaint against the Department, therefore, has not as much cause for complaint as Deputies from many other counties.  Kerry is likely to be amongst the first counties in this respect.  It may perhaps come on top in the very near future because we have acquired there or are about to acquire large lots for planting.  Many Deputies have said that we should not stick to the minimum of 500 acres as we have been doing.  It is not considered economic by the Forestry Department to go below 350 acres at the very least.  As they have been getting sufficient land to carry out their programme they had no necessity to go below that area. If we increase the programme, however, and go in for much more planting in the year, we might be compelled to go below that figure but for the present it is much better to keep as a minimum 350 or perhaps 500 acres.  Once we have established a forestry centre the Department would be quite ready to take in areas, say, of 100 acres, which are quite close to the centre but which are not necessarily adjoining it, because we would have the forestry staff present in that district and it could look after these 100 acres as well as the plantation in the bigger area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Goulding asked some questions about the type of timber we were planting.  We have not been planting hard woods to any great extent.  When we take over demesne <Col N="1215" /> lands we try to replant them with hard wood but demesne lands form only a very small percentage of our plantations.  Alder was also referred to as suitable for clog-making.  We have small areas of alder planted here and there but it has not been planted to any great extent either. Deputy Minch drew attention to the fact that we are placing our forests where they cannot be seen.  The Forestry Department probably looks on forestry as a commercial proposition but they do take into account the scenic effect of the plantations. They keep that consideration in view both in the acquisition of land and the type of timber planted. Their main outlook, however, is commercial. As a matter of fact, in planting their forests they often look so far ahead as to speculate where saw-mills would be likely to be erected when the time comes for cutting the timber.  They are very keen on getting land adjoining rivers where the saw-milling can be done on a commercial scale when the time comes, probably when Fianna Fáil will not be in power.</P>
    <P>Deputy Minch raised another point to which I should like to refer.  He complained that fine old trees in the country such as old beech trees, are being cut down.  It is of course illegal, unless permission has been obtained under the Forestry Act of 1928, to cut down such trees.  Every person who wants to cut down a tree is supposed to apply for permission to the nearest Civic Guard Station. He is supposed to wait 21 days and if no objection is raised he can then proceed to cut it down.  We have, I know, on many occasions refused to grant permission even though the trees might be very good for timber purposes, if the cutting of the trees would mean a very serious loss from the scenic point of view.  The scenic value of these trees is always taken into account.  Of course I need not tell the House that there are complaints because that point of view is taken by the Forestry Department. People who own the trees complain that they require the cash that would <Col N="1216" /> be forthcoming for the timber.  They complain about being compelled to preserve the scenery at their own expense.  Deputy Flynn spoke about the acquisition of land in small areas of 50 acres or 100 acres.  It would be better to deal with that matter through the committees of agriculture because they have power to make grants for the planting of such small areas, which would not be near one of the State forestry centres.  The county committee would have power to make a grant for planting and the horticultural instructor is available to give the necessary instructions to those people who want to make plantations.  Of course where there is a larger area than 100 acres, say up to 500 acres, adjoining a State centre, the State Department should be approached.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn also complained that the Inspectors are theorists and that they report that certain areas are not suitable for plantations where, according to local opinion, they are obviously suitable.  I do not think that is fair to the Forestry Inspectors, because they are not theorists by any means.  As a matter of fact, the students who come from the National University commence by working beside the ordinary labourers in the forests.  In the planting of trees they have to go through that stage of the work before they fulfil the regulations of the National University with regard to that course, and when they come out, if they are taken on by the Forestry Department, they have to graduate once more by beginning at the bottom and working up.  They are by no means theorists.  They are very practical men.  If they have an opinion about the suitability of soils, and if the local people have another opinion&mdash;and I suppose it is not a matter of opinion&mdash;I would be prepared, I think, to take the opinion of the experts on the point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn said that I should reconsider these reports, and, I presume, reverse them.  In certain circumstances a Minister can reverse the advice of his Department on an administrative matter, because he may hold that he knows more about it <Col N="1217" /> than those who put forward the recommendation, but when it comes to a technical point, the Minister cannot reverse the advice of the expert.  If an expert puts forward a recommendation regarding forestry, and says that land is not suitable for planting, I could not take the responsibility of saying: &ldquo;Go and plant on it.&rdquo;  I must rely on the advice of experts in matters like that.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin spoke of a nursery in Donegal that did not give good results.  That nursery is not owned by the Department.  It is the property of the Committee of Agriculture in Donegal, and the trees grown there are for distribution amongst small planters in the county, people who may plant from one to five acres. Deputy Corish asked about Forth Mountain.  In replying to a question a few weeks ago I think I stated that something like 500 or 600 acres would be planted there during the coming season.  With regard to the rest of the County Wexford there have been, at least, three lots under negotiation for some time, and I believe that we have now acquired one of these.</P>

      <P>In Bunclody.  As to small plantations, that may be done in any county.  I do not think Deputies realise that under an Act passed here some years ago, county committees of agriculture have power to levy a certain rate for forestry purposes. Every committee has also power to make a grant to farmers and landowners in a county for small plantations, where the State could not possibly be expected to come in. Speaking, for instance, of the re-planting of a few acres for shelter belts and fencing, that is a matter which could be properly referred to the county committee to say if a grant could be given towards planting.  The State could not be expected to come in there.</P>

      <P>Is the Department looking at the economic side of the price of timber at present? I think if the Department was aware of <Col N="1218" /> the fact that for good Scotch fir £1 can be got in County Mayo, their views on the value of timber would change. Scotch fir has become very scarce.  Are the experts quite certain that drained lands will not breed trees, or that even barren rock will not grow beech?  I have seen beech growing on what would appear to be barren rock, and spruce trees mature on well drained bogs.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that the Guards have authority to stop the cutting of timber when there is not legal sanction to do so.  As the cutting of trees is going on, I would suggest that an order tightening up matters should be sent to the Guards by the Department.  The cutting of trees is going on secretly on a large scale.  It will be a sorry day indeed for the country if we continue to lose the lovely timber that is now being cut down.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, there have been prosecutions under the Forestry Act in many counties during the last few months.  These prosecutions were taken, more or less, as a deterrent, and to have the effect of stopping the cutting of trees without licence.  I do not know if the Department could do any more.  As far as we know, the Guards are doing their duty, as they report frequently where trees are cut without licence.  Perhaps the Department was not doing its duty in not having taken action before, but, for some few months past, quite a number of prosecutions have been brought into court, and fines inflicted, to see if that would act as a deterrent.</P>
