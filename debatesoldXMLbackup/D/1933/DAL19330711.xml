      <P>asked the President whether he has received any representations from public bodies asking that Communism should be outlawed, and, if so, what action it is proposed to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>No such representations have reached me from any statutory public body.  I have, however, received resolutions passed by the National Council of the Catholic Young Men's Society of Ireland asking that Communist activities and propaganda should be made illegal.  These activities are kept under constant observation by the police, and are the subject of frequent reports to the Minister for Justice and myself.  Our information is that the Communist movement in the Irish Free State has failed to obtain any serious measure of support and that it is, in fact, on the wane.  We do not propose to adopt repressive measures which would tend to secure for the movement a sympathy which it now receives from no section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the President aware that religious and public opinion is considerably perturbed at the progress of the Communist movement, and the feeling is that the President should, if necessary, take drastic steps to deal with the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have informed the Deputy that we are getting constant reports and the activities of Communists are under constant observation. If there is any need for public action we will be prepared to take it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mr. McMenamin)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether, in respect of treaties entered into between the Government of the late United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the United States of America, he is aware that the Government of the United States of America contends that such treaties are, since 1922, no longer in force between that country and this, and if, in particular, he is aware that this contention affects the heir-at-law rights of citizens of this State who inherit real property situate in the United States of America, and if he will state what is the present position in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The President) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been misinformed. The Government of the United States have never contended that treaties referred to in the Deputy's question are not in force between the Irish Free State and the United States. Such treaties have been acted upon by the two countries as occasion has arisen.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific matter mentioned in the Deputy's question, namely, heir-at-law rights of Irish nationals to real property situated in the United States, the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty of the 2nd March, 1899, applies. The provisions of that treaty confer upon the citizens of each country rights of disposal with regard to property situated in the other.  There are, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, certain States of the Union in which, by the law of the State, foreigners are deprived of rights of inheritance to real property, but such State laws do not operate against nationals of countries with which the United States has treaty relations similar to those established by the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty of 1899.  By virtue of Article 6 of the Constitution of the United States, treaties concluded by the United States are part of &ldquo;the supreme law of the land.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position of the Irish Free State with regard to treaties and conventions concluded between the late United Kingdom and other <Col N="2059" /> countries is based upon the general international practice in the matter when a new State is established. When a new State comes into existence, which formerly formed part of an older State, its acceptance or other wise of the treaty relationships of the older State is a matter for the new State to determine by express declaration or by conduct (in the case of each individual treaty) as considerations of policy may require.  The practice here has been to accept the position created by the commercial and administrative treaties and conventions of the late United Kingdom until such time as the individual treaties and conventions themselves are terminated or amended.  Occasion has then been taken, where desirable, to conclude separate engagements with the States concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the question is in the affirmative.  It should, however, be explained that there is no obligation on any producer to supply standard peat at the price of 11/6 per ton.  In local markets where the producer can deliver standard peat direct to the consumer, he will obviously expect and obtain a much higher figure, but where peat has to bear transport charges on rail or canal, and subsequent charges for delivery to the consumer, a higher price than 11/6 to the producer would, in my opinion, rule out any chance of peat competing successfully with coal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no means of separating them.  Obviously it would depend largely upon the distance the turf had to be transported.  I have no means of estimating the cost of saving the turf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the delay in the clearing by the Customs authorities of parts and accessories of agricultural machinery after payment of the duty; and whether, in view of the inconvenience caused to farmers particularly at this time of the year when such accessories are urgently required, steps will be taken to have clearance of such articles expedited.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any delay on the part of the Customs authorities in the clearance of goods of any description in respect of which payment to them of the appropriate duty has been made.  If the Deputy will let me have particulars of any such case I shall certainly have the matter investigated and shall take steps to have clearance expedited.  I would, however, ask the Deputy to assure himself in any case of complaint of delay that the duty has actually been paid to the Customs.  It is quite usual to find that a considerable period has elapsed between the date on which the imported paid over the duty to his <Col N="2065" /> agents and the date on which the duty is paid to the collector.  In many such cases, importers, no doubt, are under the impression that they have paid the duty direct to the Customs and that the goods are ready for clearance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may have been misinformed, but I have in my hand a letter from a man to whom quantities of articles were sent in May. He paid the duty a few days afterwards, and up to Tuesday last the goods were still not delivered.  He further adds that as far as agricultural machinery parts are concerned he had to return the machine under repair, because he could not get the parts delivered.</P>

In view of that does he think it better to devote himself to financing relief work, where valuable work of this kind might be done, in that area, which would give splendid employment, simply because he cannot extract the money from the Minister <Col N="2066" /> for Finance necessary to build this school and other schools?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he will state (1) (a) the number of estates vested in the Irish Land Commission on the 1st day of May, 1931, pursuant to the Land Acts 1923-31; (b) the number of such estates in respect of which the owners have not yet received the purchase money or payment in lieu of rent or interest on Land Bonds; (c) the cause of the delay in completing such sales, and if, in view of the consequent hardship on the owners, he will state what steps he proposes to take to remedy such hardship and to expedite completion; and (2) the number of sales under the said Acts completed during the year ended 30th June, 1933, and the total number of sales outstanding as at the said date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>1. (a) The number of estates vested in the Land Commission on the 1st May, 1931, under the provisions of Section 9 of the Land Act 1931 was 4,640.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  Payment in lieu of rent has been made in full to vendors in all cases up to the date of vesting in the Land Commission; vendors are entitled to make application under Section 36 of the Land Act, 1931, that the dividends on land bonds yet undistributed shall be paid out to the parties entitled thereto, as they accrue due.  Interest in some 2,500 cases was paid out under Standing Orders, Section 36, on the 1st instant.  The number of estates vested on the 1st May, 1931, in which the land bonds representing the purchase moneys have not yet been distributed by the Judicial Commissioner is not available and could not be ascertained <Col N="2068" /> without a long and laborious case to case investigation.  The allocation of the purchase moneys of estates depends on the clearing of the vendors' titles, and the examination of titles is proceeding as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>(c)  Provisions to prevent hardship to owners are incorporated in Sections 35 and 36 of the Land Act, 1931.  Under Section 35, purchase moneys of small amounts may be paid out rapidly to the parties appearing to be entitled thereto, without the delay of strict examination into title.</P>
    <P>2.  As regards the second part of the question, I am not quite clear as to what the Deputy means by &ldquo;sales completed.&rdquo;  If he refers to estates vested in the Land Commission under the Land Acts, 1923-31 during the year ended 30th June last, the number of such estates was 130 and only 15 estates for which schedules of particulars have been lodged, (other than lands coming under Section 34 of the Land Act 1927) remain to be vested in the Land Commission.</P>

    <P>23.&mdash;(1) Every person who&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  was on the 30th day of June, 1932, the holder of a qualifying post under an approved society, and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2071" /> (b)  was the holder of a qualifying post under an approved society immediately before the date of transfer in respect of such approved society, and</P>
    <P>(c)  had immediately before the said date of transfer at least one completed year of qualifying service, and</P>
    <P>(d)  was not at the said date of transfer offered permanent employment by the Unified Society at a rate of remuneration which, having regard to the remuneration previously received by him in respect of national health insurance services, is reasonable,</P>
    <P>shall, subject to the provisions of this section, be entitled to be paid by the Unified Society compensation under this section.</P>
    <P>(2)  The compensation payable to a person entitled to compensation under this section shall be a gratuity and the amount thereof shall be a sum (not exceeding in any case the amount of his annual remuneration) calculated on the basis of one-twelth of his annual remuneration for every completed year of qualifying service.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of this section the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  each of the following persons shall be the holder of a qualifying post under an approved society, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a part-time officer of such society;</P>
    <P>(ii)  a part-time employee of such society whose earnings from such society were not his principal means of livelihood;</P>
    <P>(b) in ascertaining the qualifying service of a person who was the holder of a qualifying post under an approved society immediately before the date of transfer in respect of such society the whole of the period immediately before such date during which such person was the holder of a qualifying post or posts continuously in any approved society or societies and <Col N="2072" /> no other period or periods shall be reckoned as qualifying service;</P>
    <P>(c)  the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of the immediately preceding section shall apply in respect of a person who was the holder of a qualifying post under an approved society, within the meaning of this section, in like manner as the said provisions apply in respect of a person who was the holder of a qualifying post within the meaning of the said immediately proceding section;</P>
    <P>(d) the annual remuneration of a person entitled to compensation under this section shall be taken to be twelve times his average monthly remuneration in respect of the year 1932 as the holder of a qualifying post or posts under an approved society or societies, and in calculating his annual remuneration any amount or amounts paid to such person for the provision of clerical assistance or other expenses or by way of bonus shall not be treated as part of his remuneration.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a person who though employed by some other person or body has in the course of such employment been engaged part-time on health insurance work for an approved society, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the remuneration of such person in respect of such work was not his principal means of livelihood,</P>
    <P>such person shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed in respect of every period during which he was engaged on such work for such society to have been the holder of a qualifying post under such society, but in calculating under sub-section (3) of this section his annual remuneration as the holder of a qualifying post under such society no payments, other than payments in respect of such work for such society, shall be taken into account.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a person who was the holder of a qualifying post under an <Col N="2073" /> approved society would, but for his being offered at the date of transfer in respect of such society permanent employment by the Unified Society at a rate of remuneration which, having regard to the remuneration previously received by him in respect of national health insurance services, is reasonable, be entitled to compensation under this section, and</P>
    <P>(b)  such person accepts such offer, and</P>
    <P>(c) such person is dismissed (otherwise than for misconduct or illness) by the Unified Society within five years after the said date of transfer,</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Parliamentary Secretary is not present, as I should like to have called his attention to certain matters that he is well acquainted with.  He is well aware that, as far as my constituency is concerned&mdash;Carlow-Kilkenny&mdash;there is very considerable inconvenience suffered there, and more than inconvenience, as a result of considerable flooding, and I should like to have got some indication from him as to what his views are.  For instance, at a previous stage large drainage works were carried out on the Barrow in the Monasterevan-Athy area.  It happens that since these works were carried out the flooding which afflicts the town of Carlow has been greater than it ever <Col N="2080" /> was before.  I am not saying that that is the result of the work done by this Department.  <i>Post hoc, ergo propter hoc</i>&mdash;that is, they have floods they never had before following, but not necessarily as a result of, that work, and the Department should recognise some responsibility in the matter.  In this matter of flooding a number of things are taken into consideration. Sometimes, for instance, consideration is taken of the amount of land which is made unproductive as a result of flooding, the effect of drainage in making that land productive, and the relation between the additional value of the land and its productivity as compared with the cost of drainage. In the case of the Nore and Barrow there is another consideration that I think ought to come in.  As I say, I regret that the Parliamentary Secretary is not here, because I know he has been down there.  When you have towns like Carlow, Kilkenny, Thomastown, and smaller places like Leighlinbridge and Bagenalstown, where periodically the houses are made uninhabitable, it seems to me that the Government, which is spending large sums on relief works and various other things, should give particular consideration to these places even though the drainage would involve large sums of money.  In Carlow houses are often under water.  Then we have the conditions in Kilkenny, where I and other Deputies have been in houses where there have been five feet of water.  Even when the water subsides, it leaves large masses of sediment, composed, to some extent, of sewage, and the people are living in these houses.  It seems to me that considerations other than the purely economic consideration, the additional value which is taken into account in the case of land, should be brought to bear in these cases.  A large part of Thomastown has been completely flooded three or four times in the last eighteen months.  It is not like fields where the water just goes over them.  These are houses in which people are living.  The people very often have to go out of the houses for a short time. Everybody knows that in the case of a new building made of concrete the <Col N="2081" /> building has to be allowed to remain sometimes for two years with heating arrangements in before being available. People go back and live in those houses, as they have to, immediately after the flood has subsided.  The unfortunate women go back and do the best they can to sweep out the sediment and the sewage that is left there. Then the Parliamentary Secretary goes down and discusses the matter with the local government bodies, and his Department and the local governing bodies are unable to come to terms as to the proportion of money that should be contributed by each, or as to responsibility. For instance, in the case of Carlow, the Board of Works can say that there is another river there besides the Barrow, and that if that were adequately bridged the flooding would not be quite so bad.  On the other hand, it is said that the main part of the flooding comes from the Barrow, and that the flooding has been more serious since the Board of Works carried out operations there.  In the case of the Nore, the Parliamentary Secretary goes down and refuses to advance this work unless the local governing bodies, that is, the county council and the corporation, themselves come to terms as to their respective contributions, when they must contribute 50 per cent. of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present moment, when the Government has withdrawn a large sum that previously went in relief of the rates; when even the Government admits that there is a very serious economic crisis in the country; when everybody knows that, even though the local governing bodies might decide, in the interests of such work, to increase the assessment on rates enormously, it would not at all mean that they are going to get the money, because the people simply have not got the money to give them; when the Government has increased central taxation enormously, and has justified their action in doing so by saying that as a policy they believe in enormous social services, that they believe in using money to relieve every form of distress in the country; it does seem to me that the old policy whereby a rigid percentage <Col N="2082" /> was agreed on by the central Government, with an insistence that the local bodies should provide the remainder, ought to be waived, because it is useless for the Government to come to an agreement with the local bodies which the local bodies will not be able to fulfil.  As I said before, there is no use in saying that the local bodies should increase the rates enormously, because they simply would not be able to collect them.  At such a time as this, with the Government policy what it is, with central taxation increased enormously, it seems to me that this whole matter should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>If the Government desires works that will give employment, here are works which will give an amount of employment, and be in the nature of relief works, while at the same time providing, we hope, a permanent benefit, which is very real.  By spending what is a comparatively large capital sum at this moment you will create a situation in which people in towns of the dimensions and importance of Kilkenny, Carlow, Thomastown and Bagenalstown, and smaller places such as Leighlinbridge, will be able to live in houses which are habitable, instead of in houses which are not only periodically uninhabitable, but which, even in the periods between the floods, should be said to be uninhabitable, because the whole framework of the houses has not merely been steeped in water, but very often in water which is full of sewage. It does seem to me that the Parliamentary Secretary should seek from the Minister, who is dealing with the Estimate, enlarged powers for the expenditure of money in this direction. On so many other things that are called relief works there is money poured out in doing work which, while it keeps people occupied and might for some short time afterwards be of some little use, unless money is poured out on the same project continuously, ceases to be of use after a certain time.  Here is a case which really ordinary humanity would demand should receive the utmost consideration from the Government. We are told periodically of the <Col N="2083" /> number of houses that are required in the country, and of the number of people who are inadequately housed.  I deny that there is anybody in this country more inadequately housed than people who are living in houses that are flooded.  If you go into Thomastown when the floods are on, you will find one-half of the town with the ground floor of the houses and shops under water.  If you go down to certain parts of Kilkenny, when the floods are on, you will find five feet of water in the houses&mdash;water full of sewage.  As it subsides it leaves a filthy and unhealthy sediment.  The same thing applies in Carlow.  It does seem to me that the Parliamentary Secretary should put before his Government that here is a case for spending large sums of money, for the waiving of the old rigid conditions imposed on local governing bodies, and for putting him in a position of being able to get an agreement between his Department and public bodies, which will be greatly facilitated when his Department does not have to insist on those bodies providing sums of money which it is quite beyond their power to find.  In this way employment would be given, and permanent good created.  It would do away permanently with an evil which is one of the most crying evils in the country at the moment.  Some families may have to live in houses which are not quite suitable, but the houses in this country most unfit for human habitation are houses which annually, and sometimes bi-annually, are flooded with filthy water, and to which people go back to reside as soon as the water has subsided, and they have poured out their labour in trying to get rid of the filth which has remained as sediment of that water.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary is not here, because there are one or two questions which I should like to ask him about the general administration of the Board of Works.  One thing is that I understood it was in the province of the Board of Works to schedule an ancient monument, but there is a fight that 40 could join before you can get <Col N="2084" /> an ancient monument scheduled.  I do not know why that should be, because I should imagine that the obligations which are imposed upon the Board of Works, by scheduling an ancient monument, are comparatively trivial, yet the very fact of scheduling provides an important protection.  I have made representations, not, indeed, directly to the Board of Works, but indirectly, on the question of the castle of the O'Garas, which housed the Four Masters, with a view to having it scheduled as an ancient monument. So far as I am aware, no steps have been taken to do so, with the result that it has been carted away piecemeal. I may add that there must be a number of other public monuments of that kind through the country, which are being carted away, and which could be entirely protected by putting up the usual notice on them, and placing them under the protection of the Civic Guards.</P>
      <P>Another thing I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary is what inspired the Board of Works to tear down the fine old portal that was on Charlemont House, and invite somebody to try out his hand on a new one.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2085" /> I have also drawn the attention of the Board of Works, on more than one occasion, to the useful constructive work that might be done if they would bring the old drainage schemes under closer observation.  A great many of these schemes have ceased to serve any useful purpose at all for want of maintenance, or, I should say, for want of adequate maintenance.  I believe very useful work could be done by restoring these old drainage schemes to their original condition, even if it were not intended subsequently to transfer them to the local authority under an Act which gives the Department power to do that at the present time.  I would like to draw the special attention of the Board of Works to a drainage scheme which has been in their hands now for many years.  All the plans for this scheme have been completed, and they have been held up by some red tape or other in the Department.  I refer to the Tinnecarrow scheme in Lough Gara and in the Mantua drainage area.  It is a considerable scheme, and I think that the engineering plans propose or would work out so that the bulk of the money would be spent on labour.  Therefore, it is a scheme which should specially commend itself to the Board of Works from the point of view of labour conditions in the country at present.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear from the Minister for Finance that he is prepared to consider favourably proposals from the Electricity Supply Board to carry out otherwise uneconomic schemes of lighting with the assistance of relief works money.  I think that this is something deserving of more attention than it already has had.  The question of providing electric lighting as an amenity in country towns is an important one, and I take this occasion to refer to it briefly.  There are many towns in this country which the Electricity Supply Board cannot reach because the cost of bringing the network into them would involve an expenditure of a capital sum upon which they could not get an economic return.  Either the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce has laid down that they cannot sanction any such extension at present.  In order <Col N="2086" /> that the Electricity Supply Board may be in a position to satisfy the Department, that extension must be an economic proposition.  It must before the Department can sanction it.  I therefore suggest to the Minister that where, on examination, a proposed extension scheme appears to be uneconomic according to this test, he should volunteer to place at the disposal of the Electricity Supply Board a sum of money which would defray the labour costs of the scheme.  I believe that if the Minister did that in many cases the extension of schemes would come within the permissive conditions laid down.  In that way electricity could be made available in many towns where it is not now available and additional centres for the sale of power would be made available to the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>I remember when the relief works were first under consideration here, the Parliamentary Secretary made a very dramatic speech, and he thumped the table and said that people were chiding him for not spending money. but that what he wanted was schemes, concrete schemes, and that if he got them he would not be long in putting them into operation.  Well, I rose to the bait, and I am still rising.  I sent him two drainage schemes, one from Ramelton, in Donegal, and one from the Lifford area in the County Donegal. I had a very civil letter to say that they were engaging his most meticulous attention.  That was last July.  I suppose they are still engaging his most meticulous attention.  I suggest now that it is time they engaged more than his attention.  I invite the Board of Works to look into these two schemes and to say whether they cannot be put into hands without further delay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the condition of persons in Carlow-Kilkenny, whose houses were inundated with water containing sewage.  I would suggest to the Minister that a very large proportion of the relief money which it is proposed to spend in towns and rural areas should be spent upon providing up-to-date sewerage works. That is a very necessary amenity under modern conditions, and it is one that it is exceedingly difficult to get out of <Col N="2087" /> the local authority, because the moment a scheme is completed the question invariably arises: What is going to be the area of charge?  I do not know if the Minister has any experience of local administration in this country.  If he has he will know that once you start discussing an area of charge at a county council, you may be discussing it for 12 months or two years before there is any chance of settling it.  Eventually the Minister for Local Government and Public Health steps in and fixes it in such a way that nobody is satisfied.  The result is that it was exceedingly difficult now to get any scheme for sewerage works completed at all.  The past experience is with rural dwellers, after they have been facilitated to draw up a scheme for sewerage for any town in the country that scheme will end abortively.  I therefore suggest that it would be money well spent if these sewerage schemes could be financed out of the relief works.  I am aware that the Board of Works has been offering to contribute a substantial proportion of the money, but it does not matter what proportion they contribute if they leave a balance to be found by the local authority to fall on the rateable valuation of the particular town where a sewerage scheme is to be put in operation.  The same row will then start when you are trying to find out the area of charge, and I suggest it would be better if the Board of Works could see their way to provide from the relief grant some provision to complete the sewerage schemes in selected towns.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to refer to something that is present to the minds of the Dáil every day, and that is the structure erected by the Board of Works which masquerades under the name of a dynamo in Dáil Eireann.  I think the more suitable description of that structure would be an incubator.  As an incubator it is admirable.  If there were any proposals to start the production of chickens at Leinster Lawn, I have no doubt this could be turned into a useful incubator.  I suggest that if the Fianna Fáil Party begin to get cold feet between now and the General Election, <Col N="2088" /> it might be used in a Fianna Fáil committee room.  For this it would be eminently suitable.  For the purpose for which it is required I do not think it requires any particular emphasis on my part to elaborate its unsuitability.</P>

At all events, something should be done to reduce the mean temperature of that room or eventually it will become like the deserted village.</P>
      <P>There is one other annexe to this establishment to which I would like to refer.  I can only describe it as a dog kennel, the accommodation that is provided at the entrance gate to Leinster House.  If anybody comes here on business or otherwise he is ushered into this dog kennel which masquerades under the name of a waiting-room.  In winter it is wet and cold and in summer it is hot and stuffy.  It has many other qualities which I do not think it would be expedient or delicate to refer to in this Assembly. I suggest that where strangers are coming to visit this House, though they may be only miserable members of the public between the elections, they are entitled to some consideration. While I am well aware that the staff of the Oireachtas do everything in their power to mitigate the discomforts of this disgusting cubby hole, it is beyond their power to make it bearable for anybody but a man of powerful physique and great resistance. Very little, I think, would provide decent accommodation for visitors to the Dáil.  I submit it is a matter that should engage the early attention of the Board of Works so that the kind of complaints one hears from reasonable people should no longer be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a matter which I raised by way of Parliamentary question in the last Dáil.  I have in mind the agitation that has been going on for years in <Col N="2089" /> connection with the drainage of the Lerr, a river in the south of Kildare that runs along the border of Carlow. The drainage work was carried out as a relief scheme by the Board of Works some years ago without any appeal coming from the farmers through whose lands the river flows.  The result was that those farmers were landed with a heavy rate by way of contribution towards the drainage of this river.  All along they contested this rate and the Board of Works endeavoured to meet their grievance, but whatever was done in that direction was not satisfactory.  The Parliamentary Secretary in the last Dáil said that an <i>ad hoc</i> grant would be made which, in effect, would mean that the occupiers of land which benefited from the drainage would have to meet some charge and those whose lands did not benefit would not have to pay any levy at all.  After that the agitation got worse and a sworn inquiry was held.  I asked for the findings of that inquiry, but I could not get them.</P>
      <P>This whole area has been visited by political pilgrimages representative of all parties and the people there were assured that the situation would be satisfactorily dealt with.  Large arrears of the rates in respect of the drainage have now accrued.  They can never be collected; they are absolutely irrecoverable. It is time a satisfactory settlement was arrived at.  The unfortunate occupiers of land are faced with a rate which they cannot possibly pay and they derive no benefit whatever from the drainage.  If Deputies Norton or Harris were here they would probably say I have not made the case sufficiently strong.  I will ask the Minister to issue the necessary instructions to have a further sworn inquiry.  Deputations have visited the Parliamentary Secretary, but the whole thing has been shelved and the people are being humbugged. I am quite certain that it is not the intention of the Board of Works, the Minister or the local Deputies to humbug the people there.  I certainly hope something will be done in the immediate future to remedy a most unsatisfactory situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): Some 12 months ago I raised a matter here with reference to the desirability of issuing unemployment insurance stamps to people engaged working on the Fergus drainage scheme.  It cannot be argued in this case that the work was agricultural work.  It may possibly be of advantage in the cases of people from whose farms flooding was removed.  No doubt in many cases water-logged land was relieved; but certainly the drainage work could not be considered as agricultural work.  Wading through water is not usually considered agricultural work, and carrying cement bags to make a dam in order to keep back the water for a period while they were repairing the banks is not work usually carried out by farmers.  We were told at the time that this matter was under consideration and a decision would be arrived at.  I expected a decision would be quickly arrived at and that we would have these stamps paid within a reasonable period.  In reply to a Parliamentary question, the Minister mentioned that special cases were picked out and placed before the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>How long does it take to reach a decision on a matter of this sort? Surely the insurance code is not so large as that it would not be possible to reach a decision in a month.  Fully 200 of these men were disemployed when the work was closed down.  They could not draw unemployment insurance, and the wages paid were not sufficient to leave any margin to live on during the period when those men were waiting for the Minister's decision. These 200 men could not get other employment, and they could not draw unemployment insurance benefit. They had to rely on home assistance or on some other charitable institutions during the period when they could not get work.  I trust the Minister will urge on those who are considering the fine points of this legal argument to come to a decision at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this matter were brought to court, and if the Parliamentary Secretary were reported just as an ordinary employer to the National Health Insurance <Col N="2091" /> Commission, I have no doubt the judge would say that the work could not be considered by any stretch of the imagination as agricultural work.  I want the Minister to give the people who are disemployed what they are entitled to.  Unemployment will be relieved if all the relief schemes before the Minister are expedited.  It is not the fault of the county council, which does everything possible.  Whatever delay there is, it is at headquarters. I am not making any grievous complaint in that direction. The Board of Works has given careful and adequate consideration in the majority of cases.  I know the amount of clogging work that there is in their office, and the extent of the work they have to do, but I would urge that when this matter comes before them it would receive immediate attention.</P>

      <P>I just want to ask the Minister whether he can make any statement in regard to the allocation of £100,000 mentioned for the purpose of bog drainage: He must be aware that many Deputies are receiving inquiries about the allocation of this sum, and it would be well if a statement could be made upon the matter. In the same connection I would like to know if it is correct that the Board of Works are still supplying Gárdaí barracks, and similar institutions with imported coal while the public are being asked to use native fuel.  It is certain that many Gárdaí barracks situated on the verge, or in the vicinity, of bogs are still being supplied with imported coal.  Has it not occurred to the Department promoting the turf scheme to appeal to the Board of Works to give orders and to make provision for the burning of turf, since the burning of turf is now portion of the Government's scheme?  It may, possibly, be the case that the Board of Works have contracts for the supply of coal to the institutions mentioned.  But if the matter has been overlooked I hope the Minister will see to it and have inquiries made into it before it goes much further.</P>

      <P>The Minister has already made himself responsible, in <Col N="2092" /> this House, for approval of a proposal which created the greatest possible concern amongst tradesmen in the City of Dublin generally.  That was the arrangement by which instructions were issued by the Board of Works, to certain firms in the city, that kept on big staffs, to dispense with employees who had been employed by them for many years continuously, on Government contracts, in order to replace these more or less permanently employed persons, by casual employees.  The protest on behalf of different bodies in the city, and the protest on behalf of this House, as no doubt Deputies are aware, prevented the pressing of that instruction, at the present moment, and the order, I understand, has been withdrawn.  In view of the importance in all social life in getting and securing such employment to people of the tradesman type, such an order would have had disastrous consequences.  I think it would be wrong on the part of the Minister to allow this Estimate to pass without making a statement to the House to the effect that it is not intended again to issue an order from the Office of Works along those lines. If after further examination of the position which I understand is promised&mdash;I do not know exactly&mdash;it transpired that something happened that would indicate, either to the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary, that it was necessary to contemplate issuing an order that was in any way like the order that was withdrawn, I think it would be well for the Minister to promise that no such order would be issued until a statement had been made in the House as to the conditions that existed and necessitated the issue of an order like that.  There would then be full discussion here as to the conditions existing, which made it necessary to issue an order like that, or made it seem necessary, that an order like that should be issued.  No such order should be issued unless this House had the opportunity of discussing what alternative offered to the issue of an order such as that, and the displacement of a number of tradesmen where they had been permanently employed for many years.</P>

      <P>I am very much interested in the point Deputy Moore raised about the burning of turf in barracks. I raised a similar point, as to whether the houses that are at present being put up in the country districts are being provided with grates suitable for the burning of turf.  I think the Government ought to make up their minds that either they wish turf burned, and are going to see that it is used, or not.  If they do they should provide grates suitable for the burning of turf.  There is no use talking about burning turf in coal grates.  The Government have got to make up their minds that if turf is going to be burned in certain districts, they are going to provide people with grates that can burn turf or not.  The Government, if they persist in their present policy, are going to find themselves shortly up against a stone wall, especially where they say to people: &ldquo;Why do you not burn turf?&rdquo; the person so addressed will answer: &ldquo;I cannot burn it because I have not got a grate suitable for it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is another matter about which I would like to ask the Minister. Other Deputies before me have commented on the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary is not here, but I hope we shall be able to get a reply to some of the questions we have put. Deputy Fitzgerald referred to flooding in certain areas of the country.  At Little Bray there has been very extensive flooding in the past, and to do the Government justice, there had been a very considerable amount of work carried out by them in connection with it, and it has cost a considerable sum of money.  What some of the people in the district are anxious to find out, at present, is whether, as far as the Government are concerned, they think they have cured the flooding, or is it a question of the money having given out after the Government have done a certain amount of work on the river, because there is still a great deal to be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I would like to refer to, and that is the playground of St. Catherine's National School in the city.  That playground is in a very bad state of repair.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know whether or not the Minister would give us some indication of the policy of the Board of Works with regard to certain drainage schemes in certain parts of the country.  I know myself that in County Cavan a number of schemes was sanctioned since the Act of 1924 was passed and they have got no further although engineers and surveyors have been sent down on these schemes and have reported on them and all that sort of thing.  Notwithstanding the reports of these engineers, nothing has been done and no genuine attempt has been made to get the schemes started.  The people are very anxious to get this work carried out. Some of these schemes are economic schemes and are quite feasible, and if they were only started they would give employment and be no burden on the community, but, for some reason, they are being held up.  This work must be approached sooner or later, and I think the Board of Works should expedite <Col N="2095" /> the inspection of these works and settle the matter and get the work started, especially as there is such an amount of unemployment in parts of County Cavan.</P>
      <P>I brought the matter before the Minister so far back as the 10th March last.  We had been asked to suggest feasible schemes to provide employment, and I submitted a scheme on the 10th March last, which, I believe, is a very feasible scheme, and which would realise £100,000 if the Board of Works granted about 10 per cent. of the money.  It would realise all that money, and would create a great deal of employment.  I had information that the matter was being considered, and I should like to know from the Minister has it been considered, and, if so, has it been found satisfactory or feasible?  In my opinion, this is a very opportune time to release money that has been held up.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister about rivers in County Mayo. There is one river which I had in mind particularly, and that is the River Robe.  Before the election in 1932 the Minister for Industry and Commerce was down there, and he gave an undertaking that the work of drainage would proceed as quickly as possible&mdash; in fact, as soon as the Fianna Fáil Government came into power.  The Fianna Fáil Government has come into power in the meantime, but, I regret to say, nothing has been done.  I have asked several questions in connection with this matter, but they do not seem to be able to get any further, although the Minister admitted that a sum of money was set aside for a scheme for the drainage of that river.  Notwithstanding that, nothing has been done. This is the question I asked:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether the Minister is aware that the Commissioners of Public Works submitted proposals to the Mayo County Council for the drainage of the River Robe and its tributaries in April, 1928; that the Commissioners were notified of the Council's concurrence in September, 1928, when the necessary statutory resolutions and guarantees required <Col N="2096" /> by the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, were passed by the Council and submitted to the Commissioners; that a detailed engineering survey of the whole district, a valuation of the affected lands, and an assessment of the estimated increase in value for each individual holding was made and a report submitted to the Commissioners by their engineers in February, 1930, and if he will now state what steps have been taken by the Commissioners since 1930 to have the drainage of that river and its tributaries carried out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The answer I got was simply this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As has been pointed out to the Deputy in reply to previous questions, subsequent to the receipt of their engineer's report in February, 1930, the Commissioners of Public Works had further necessary extensive inspections made by their engineers and valuers in order to obtain sufficient information to enable them to devise the most suitable scheme for the improvement of the drainage conditions in the River Robe district.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A draft scheme has now been decided on and particulars of it with maps and descriptive schedules will, it is hoped, be submitted in about a month's time to the Mayo County Council with an enquiry as to whether that body is willing to make a contribution of 30 per cent. of the cost of the scheme to complement the 50 per cent. to be provided by the Minister for Finance so as to make the scheme an economic undertaking for the occupiers of affected lands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When that was submitted by the Commissioners of Public Works to the Mayo County Council two years ago&mdash; that all that was required was to guarantee 6 per cent. of the scheme&mdash; the Mayo County Council passed a resolution agreeing to that, and the Board of Works sent down more engineers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait awhile&mdash;later than that.  Later on it was increased to 15 <Col N="2097" /> per cent. and the present Minister increased it from 15 to 30 per cent. The answer given a week ago was practically the same as that given a year ago.  Nothing has been done by the present Government although they have been in office for the last 16 months.  What I want to know is whether or not there is a possibility of getting this work under way.  There is serious flooding in the district every year, for instance, the Catholic church in one district is being flooded by the overflow of the River Robe.  I think that even half of the amount, which is £35,000, would relieve the distress. Apart from the River Robe, there are two other rivers, tributaries of the River Moy&mdash;Giveston, Pollock and the Yellow River.  The Board of Works agreed to carry out these schemes at a cost of £12,000 and to give free grants to the extent of £6,000. The County Council passed the necessary resolution agreeing to the guarantee but nothing has been done since.  These are the two principal schemes in South Mayo in which I am interested.  There is also another&mdash; the Dalgan-Clare River from Ballyhaunis to Lough Corrib.  A great deal of damage is caused by flooding there also.  I should like the Minister to let us know if it is the intention of the Commissioners of Public Works to do anything in this connection.  Of course, I can see that the purpose of a number of these drainage schemes is to a great extent to keep a certain staff in employment here in Dublin because the works proposed to be done here were part of the programme of the old Congested Districts Board some 20 years ago.  They had the maps in the office of the Land Commission but I suppose that every time a new Government comes into power they want new maps and new schemes for the purpose, as I submit, of keeping a certain staff in the employment of the Commissioners of Public Works.  I hope the Minister will keep this matter in view, particularly in regard to the River Robe.  The river runs for about 40 miles through South Mayo and an enormous amount of damage is done every year.</P>

      <P>I should like to make an appeal to the Minister that, if possible, a greater proportion of the amount from the various relief schemes should be allotted for drainage purposes.  Perhaps there is no work that could be undertaken that gives greater employment in proportion to the amount expended.  Hitherto it was rather difficult to get any advance from the various relief schemes for drainage purposes.  Perhaps there were reasons for that.  One might be that at certain periods of the year drainage could not be undertaken.  I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister that, as far as possible, he should allot a greater sum than has been given hitherto for drainage purposes.  The drainage of the country is one of the important questions at the present moment and will be for some years to come.  I should like particularly to draw the Minister's attention to the valuable work done under the minor drainage schemes.  I am not detracting at all from the work done by the Office of Public Works, who have carried out very large schemes and very excellent ones.</P>

      <P>Under the minor drainage schemes some valuable works have been undertaken.  I believe that a lot of the difficulty in connection with drainage would be overcome if the provisions of the minor drainage schemes could be extended, that is, if it were possible to spend a greater sum than £1,000, and if the portion of the money given by the Government could be increased, some valuable schemes could be undertaken.  In my county valuable work was done under <Col N="2099" /> one particular scheme which some years ago was declared to be uneconomic under the major drainage schemes and which would have cost some £8,000 or £10,000, and which even was uneconomic with the full grant that the Minister was authorised to give. Latterly, owing to the intervention of various people, this scheme, or part of it, has been undertaken as a minor drainage work.  I should say that certainly more than half of the work that would have been done under the big scheme has been fulfilled by the engineer to the county council under this particular scheme.  I, therefore, wish to make the suggestion that, if possible, works costing up to £2,000 or £3,000 should be brought under the minor drainage schemes with perhaps an increased grant.  In that way a great deal of drainage work would be done which would not be undertaken under present circumstances.  I think this suggestion will have the support of nearly every Deputy.</P>

      <P>I merely wish to stress the remarks made by previous speakers. It seems to me that we are all agreed on the principle adumbrated in these Votes.  We are all agreed on the necessity for public drainage works, and as to the advantages arising out of them. The Parliamentary Secretary, I am afraid, is aware that this subject is getting nearly as sour as the drainage itself, we have spent so long on it. Everyone has harped on the needs of his own county or constituency, and I feel that I must, to a certain extent, follow suit.  As Deputy Moore said, we would like to get some idea when this grant will be allocated.  I hope that when the grant is being allocated a very large territory in the north-east of Wexford will receive special attention. I refer to the district known as the Boira and Macamore.  The district covers a vast tract of very good land which for years past has been intersected by pills and canals which were kept free from rushes by the industry of the population.  That population has been decimated practically during the last few years owing to various reasons, and, consequently, there is <Col N="2100" /> greater need of outside help than there was.  The district called the Boira is in the centre of these canals and pills and marshy boggy land which in itself is very good and very tenacious, but needs to be kept dry by constant clearing of the pills and by excavation of the slow-moving rivers which move through it.  Everyone appears to have an axe to grind in connection with this Vote, and I merely ask that when the grant comes to be allocated special attention will be given to this district known as the Boira.  It is not, of course, situated in the congested districts, but the people there are just in as much need of assistance as the people in the West of Ireland, because the land is very heavy grazing land and is rendered practically useless by the fact that it is being choked up by the pills, rivers and canals which are not excavated as they should be.  At the risk of being tiresome, I would ask that when this grant is being allocated special attention should be paid to this district in north-east Wexford.  Wexford Deputies of all shades of opinion have been harping on this for months past.  We know it is impossible for our demands to be met in full or with the promptitude with which we should like them to be met.  At the same time, as repetition appears to be the secret of success in political action, I want now to harp on this, even <i>ad nauseam</i>, and to ask that the district of Boira and Macamore be kept specially in mind when the grants are being allocated.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will remember what Deputy Dillon said with reference to the accommodation of the Oireachtas.  It is not only Deputies who must be considered in this matter, but also the staff.  It is not fair that the staff should be kept in these unwholesome, unventilated conditions which they have to endure owing to the faulty nature of the new wing. I notice in these Estimates that there is provision made for giving ventilation in the Department of Fisheries.  The poor fish in this establishment never get any ventilation.  While Deputies have their own inferno in the restaurant, the gentlemen of the Press have a private hell of their own where <Col N="2101" /> they are roasted owing to lack of ventilation. During the long vacation the Minister might, at a comparatively small cost, bore some holes in the walls and let some air into the congested atmosphere of the Dáil.  I notice amongst the works mentioned in the Estimates there is a sum of £6,000 required this year for the roofing of Baldonnell Aerodrome.  That work has been on the Estimates for many years. I do not know how far it has progressed. At one time it was removed from the Estimates, but now it has been put back.  It is difficult to expect the Minister for Finance to give a statement on this matter which really would be more appropriate from the Minister for Defence, but as it appears in this Estimate I only express the hope that the Minister will see that the full amount is spent this year.</P>
      <P>There is in the second Vote&mdash;I think we are taking these two Votes together &mdash;an item which I cannot refrain from mentioning, and that is the sum of £3,817 which we are asked to vote in this particular Vote No. 11&mdash;leaving out the sum which we have already voted and which we will be called upon to vote in other estimates&mdash;for the upkeep of the Viceregal grand piano.  I mentioned last week the fact that we were voting £820&mdash;I said £850, but the correct figure is £820&mdash;and the Minister seemed to doubt my statements.  I looked up the records of the House, and I find that on the 29th March I received an answer from the Parliamentary Secretary to the effect that the sum of £820 had been included in the Estimates for rates on Government property, 1933-4, under the heading of &ldquo;Other Services,&rdquo; sub-head A, Vote 17. The Minister naturally was not well up in this matter, and he doubted the accuracy of my statements last week. This week we are asked to vote a further sum of £3,817 for the upkeep of the grand piano.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the answer I received on the 29th March, 1933, from the Parliamentary Secretary was that the sum of £820 was included in the last item, which is called &ldquo;Other Services.&rdquo; That is the information which I received in the official reply of the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is only changed from the top of the list to the bottom of the list.  The sum is being paid, and it is suggested by the Vote that it is not being paid.  It was that very fact which made me ask the question as to what sum was being paid, and why such sum does not appear in the Estimates for 1933-4.  Apart from these sums there are also expenses in connection with the Gárda Síochána Vote for the protection of the Viceregal Lodge, which houses only this grand piano, that is more expensive than &ldquo;the harp that once through Tara's Halls.&rdquo;  Certainly it might well be substituted as a national emblem.  I only mention these large sums in order that the Minister may state what is the intention of the Government with regard to this large establishment in the Phoenix Park.  We cannot go on spending thousands of pounds every year on this white elephant.  The Minister is himself familiar with white elephants, and this is one of his own creations, because whereas we were promised that we would have no Viceregal establishment we now have two instead of one. The Minister might at least, now that he has been in office so long, be able to tell us what are the intentions of the Government with regard to this establishment.</P>

      <P>When the people of Carlow and Kilkenny read Deputy Fitzgerald's speech, which is full of consideration for their sorry plight, I am sure they will bitterly regret that Deputy Cosgrave and not Deputy Fitzgerald was their representative during the period when Deputy Fitzgerald and the Government of which he was a member might have given very practical proof that they sincerely felt and realised those considerations, given, of course, at the expense of the taxpayers.  It is quite <Col N="2103" /> clear that, in a matter of drainage schemes particularly, while the economic factor is not the only one to be taken into consideration nevertheless it is a very important one in dealing with proposals of this nature for the expenditure of public money. We cannot proceed on the assumption that those whose lands are flooded and those whose houses are flooded are not in a position to do anything to help themselves, and particularly that the local authorities who have responsibility for the public health of the neighbourhood, and to whom rates are paid by those people, are also powerless in the matter.  The position which has invariably been taken up in regard to arterial drainage works generally is that the people who should make the first move in the matter are the occupiers of the lands or dwellings affected.  When an investigation has taken place, and the full facts have been submitted, in all cases in which it can be shown that the scheme would be made profitable to the occupiers of land by a free grant of up to 33? per cent. that grant has been given without hesitation.  The amount of that grant measures the consideration which has been given by the Government to other than economic factors in dealing with those schemes.  If it appears that more than one-third of the grant must be a free grant in order to make a scheme profitable to the occupiers of the land, and that otherwise the scheme is a good one, and there is a strong desire for it, the Government will go to the county council and ask them whether they attach importance to this scheme, and whether they are willing to contribute to it out of the county rates. If the local authority expresses its willingness to assist in this matter the Government is prepared to give over the grant of one-third of the cost an equivalent amount to that which the local authority is prepared to provide for the purpose of remedying such evil or inconvenience as exists. I do not think that the Government could be expected to do any more than that.  If the Government is prepared to pay half the cost of the scheme <Col N="2104" /> in the event of the county council or local authority and the affected occupiers being ready to bear the remaining half, then I think that the national purse at any rate, has given all the consideration that it properly could to those factors which Deputy Fitzgerald referred to as other than economic considerations in matters of these schemes.</P>
      <P>With regard to the special case of the flooding in Carlow, it is not clear yet that an expensive drainage scheme will have to be undertaken in order to remedy that flooding.  The flooding occurred during a period of phenomenal rainfall in March last.  It may not occur again for possibly another generation or even longer than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that it is proper to pursue this discussion.  I want to get back to this question of flooding at Carlow.  I do not think any Government would be justified in undertaking a large expenditure merely because flooding has occurred at very rare intervals, and there is nothing on the records, hitherto, to show that the flooding of Carlow is likely to be recurring.  If it were we would have to approach the matter from a different aspect, but all the time our approach <Col N="2105" /> would be conditioned by this, that the amount of assistance that the State could give to a scheme of this nature must be limited in proportion to the amount which the local authority concerned is prepared themselves to give.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the case of the flooding of Thomastown and Kilkenny, which were flooded by the River Nore.  In that case the Government have gone to the very limit.  It has offered to bear 50 per cent. of the cost of the scheme, asking the local authorities to put up 46 per cent. of the cost.  The scheme is a particularly uneconomic one.  I think it is estimated to cost something like £92,000.  My information is that the annual value of the land to be benefited by the scheme would not exceed £900.  There might be some justification for spending £92,000 if there were to be a considerable amount of labour employed on the scheme.  But in fact the labour content of these large drainage schemes is comparatively small.  Most of the work would have to be done by machinery, and most of the cost would go to the provision and maintenance of the plant.</P>
      <P>I do not think that any person could criticise the Government for refusing to give more than £46,000 to the cost of this scheme, estimated to cost £92,000, a scheme which would contribute only a yield or economic return of about £900 a year.  It is a fact that if the amenities of Kilkenny, Thomastown and these other towns are to be improved, then they must be improved at the expense of those who live in them, but not mainly at the expense of the State.  The local authorities, under whose jurisdiction these towns are, ought to have responsibility for these areas and they must realise their responsibility.  If the people there want to do anything to cure this evil which admittedly bears very hardly upon a section of the population in these towns, they will have to put their shoulder to it and bear a fair share of the burden themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of ancient monuments raised by Deputy Dillon, it is quite true that the Board of Works <Col N="2106" /> can acquire monuments by purchase or agreement.  When they have acquired them they can make reservation orders in regard to them.  The position is that the Board of Works has already acquired a great many ancient and venerable castles.  In fact, at the present moment they have acquired more than we can conveniently deal with.  The cost of the maintenance of these ancient monuments is, all things taken into account, not inconsiderable and there has to be, naturally and necessarily, some discrimination in regard to those taken over.  It is quite possible that the particular monument to which Deputy Dillon refers may have had a considerable historic value.  If so, I suggest that he himself is not faultless in the matter, because he stated that he had approached the Board of Works, indirectly.  I should have thought that if he really attached such importance to this monument as he has indicated to the Dáil, he should have come to us direct and used the influence which a Deputy can naturally bring to bear on these matters and so see that that monument was safeguarded before it was taken away piece-meal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to express satisfaction or dissatisfaction in that respect because I am not familiar with the details.  If the Deputy or any other Deputy in the House thinks that more attention <Col N="2107" /> should be paid to any monument, particularly to one of a unique kind like Clonmacnoise, I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary or myself or the Board of Works would be only too glad if suggestions are made to us in that regard.  I do not know how Deputy Dillon came to reckon what had been done in Charlemont House as one of the misdeeds or one of the sins of omission or commission of the Board of Works, because Charlemont House was handed over to the Dublin Corporation some time ago for conversion into an art gallery.  Whatever architectural alterations were made have been carried out since the Dublin Corporation took the building over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they did not. The presumption is, of course, that the architects of the Dublin Corporation are as competent as the architects of the Board of Works in matters of this kind.  In regard to the old drainage scheme to which Deputy Dillon also referred, I have to say that we restored 61 of these old drainage districts.  The bulk of these were carried out under the Drainage Act of 1924.  The general feeling of the Commissioners of Public Works is that this Act is practically worked out and that greater advantages are now to be secured by proceeding under the Drainage Act of 1925.  It is under that Act that operations are now to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Tinnecarrow scheme to which Deputy Dillon also referred, a valuation and an engineering survey of the district have been made. The scheme, it is anticipated, will require a grant of 50 per cent. from Government sources and about 46 per cent. from the Counties Sligo and Roscommon.  If the Government give this 50 per cent. and the county councils concerned likewise agree to contribute 46 per cent. of the cost, the scheme will be put up to the occupiers for their acceptance.  I shall have the Lifford <Col N="2108" /> and Ramelton schemes, to which the Deputy also referred, looked up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon, that consideration should be given to proposals submitted by the Electricity Supply Board to carry out works in districts where they felt that the economic return to the Electricity Supply Board would not warrant the execution of these works, I think the Deputy mentioned that these works might be carried out under the provisions made for the relief of unemployment. I do not know how far a discussion of the manner in which relief grants might be expended would properly arise on this Vote.  In that connection, however, I should like the Deputy to remember that schemes for the expenditure of money out of Relief Votes have to be considered according to the following criteria:&mdash;(1) that the labour content of the scheme should <Col N="2109" /> be large; (2) that it should be work which in the ordinary way would not be carried out; (3) that it should be work carried out in districts where there is a large amount of unemployment to be relieved; (4) that in proportion to the magnitude of the scheme the work should be distributed over a wide area; (5) that the work should be capable of being economically carried out at periods in which the pressure of unemployment is greatest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it will be seen from this that in considering the proposals to extend the Electricity Supply Board network, or bear some part of the cost of extension of the network out of the Unemployment Relief Vote, it is unlikely that all the criteria to which I have referred will be satisfactorily fulfilled. First of all, the question of the economic merit of the scheme is one which may be subject to revision and change as time goes on.  If the network were to be erected in a district where the population was growing and extending, it might be uneconomic this year, but in three, four or five years it might turn out to be quite an economic scheme.  Consequently, the full cost of it should admittedly be borne on the funds of the Electricity Supply Board. The second point is that this network may have to be erected in districts in which unemployment is not rife. Thirdly, and, to my mind, this is the most important, as a general rule this is work which would be undertaken during the summer when the pressure of unemployment is least.  My own opinion is that there would be comparatively few schemes submitted by the Electricity Supply Board in which any considerable grant out of the Unemployment Relief Vote would be at all justified.  As I indicated in reply to Deputy Dillon's suggestion, we are prepared to consider any proposals of this kind on their merits as a relief work, not from the point of view of improving the amenities of any particular district or extending the facilities which the inhabitants of a district may enjoy.  If the people in a district feel a supply of electricity would be of considerable importance and of material advantage to them, they ought <Col N="2110" /> to be prepared to pay for it at an economic rate.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Dáil Restaurant, which was referred to by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Esmonde, I think both Deputies may congratulate themselves on the fact that they are in positions of greater freedom and less responsibility that do not compel them to lunch in the inner room, for then, in the words of Deputy Esmonde, they would know what an inferno really means.  At any rate, the question of the ventilation of the restaurant is receiving special attention at the moment from the Board of Works, as is also the question of waiting-room accommodation.  We trust that it may be found possible to sanction the expenditure necessary to carry out improvements in these matters; but again I must mention that we are continuously reminded from the benches opposite that we must save £2,000,000.  We hope those Deputies who are always crying out for economy will spare a little sweat as a contribution towards that vast sum.</P>
    <P>Deputy Minch mentioned Lerr drainage scheme.  This is one of the drainage districts to which Deputy Dillon referred, and it is a work of the type which he advocated.  It was carried out, I think, by the late Government, under an Act passed in 1924.  If, as is sometimes the case with drainage schemes, the districts in which the works are carried out does not benefit as considerably as was anticipated, then we cannot be blamed.  The charging order in this particular case has since been revised and an additional grant of £500 has recently been given by the Government and also by the county council, so that it is estimated that this charging order will lighten the burden of maintenance and payment by the occupiers of the land, and presumably it will do something to ease the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for referring to that.  May I ask him whether he is aware that a public sworn inquiry took place, and I asked for the findings to be published, and that the grant to which the Minister has referred would not be <Col N="2111" /> accepted?  Is the Minister aware that the whole thing is a most unsatisfactory case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole thing shows that drainage schemes should not be undertaken except after the fullest possible engineering investigation and inquiry.  Drainage is a very ticklish problem, requiring great skill. Deputy Nally and others complained of the length of time engineering investigation takes, but it is necessarily so, because experience has shown that in a number of cases the best planned schemes have failed to get the results anticipated, and that the last state of the occupier has been found to be worse than the first.  At the same time, I do not know how much further the Government can go in this matter than it has already gone. It has given, as I indicated, an additional grant of £500; the county council is doing likewise, and it seems to me that unless an alteration has resulted in the actual disimprovement of the district, I do not see how much further we could go.</P>

    <P>The question of the insurance of workers on the Fergus Scheme, as I indicated, has been referred to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and it is hoped to have a decision that will govern these cases before many more days.  In connection with it, the Deputy must remember that up to the present&mdash;over the past 10 years, and even going back much earlier&mdash;the policy has been to regard the average unskilled worker in drainage districts as uninsurable in employment under the Insurance Acts.  As I have said, we have referred the matter to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for formal decision under the Act, and <Col N="2112" /> we hope to have that decision in the course of the next few days.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore referred to coal for use in the Gárda barracks in the country.  The fuel for the Gárda barracks in the country is not supplied by the Board of Works.  A grant is given to the barracks, and they can purchase fuel from whatever source they like.  They purchase it presumably from a coal merchant in the neighbourhood.  For the Metropolitan barracks we contract for the supply of coal.  Last year the supply of coal used by all barracks was from Continental sources.  This year we are inviting tenders only from continental sources. It is an easy question to substitute peat and turf for coal in Government offices generally and the matter is being considered and turf will be used where possible.  Deputy Dockrell said in that connection there was no use attempting to burn turf in coal grates.  I do not know on what the Deputy bases that statement.  I have had yearly experience of the burning of turf in slow combustion grates and found no difficulty. I go every year to the Gaeltacht district where coal is not available and turf is solely used in slow combustion grates.  It burns quite as satisfactorily and as well and as economically, taking all the facts into consideration. At any rate the question of the provision of suitable grates for the burning of turf is being gone into and examined at the moment by the Department of Industry and Commerce in connection with schemes to encourage the use of turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the flooding of Little Bray, the Deputy referred to the work done there.  That work was done in <Col N="2113" /> connection with relief schemes.  I think they got a grant, but, having got as far as that, I think that the people of Bray and Little Bray will have to complete the work without any further relief work being done upon it.  I think they will have to rely upon themselves in the coming year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the playground at Donore Avenue mentioned by Deputy Dockrell, I think that should be properly raised on the Vote for the Department of Education.  At least, I have no information about it.  If the Deputy will furnish me with the particulars to which he referred, I will have them looked into.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the proposal, which was under consideration, of adopting a rotary system with regard to the employment by contractors on public works.  The suspension of that scheme was not due to any pressure from this House or from any pressure from outside.  As a matter of fact, it was already decided to suspend that scheme before the question went down.  It was thought that a rotary system probably was not a bad thing in the particular circumstances in which works were being carried out and that it should be given effect.  But subsequent investigation into the application of the principle convinced the Parliamentary Secretary that nothing should be done until a much more searching inquiry had been made.  And in connection with that I make the claim that there was no displacement of anybody.  A vacancy did arise where a person who had served for 30 years fell sick and was unlikely, as far as opinion went, to return to work again. The employment of another person was suggested in this case.  The person suggested for the vacancy was a competent tradesman, fully qualified, who had been out of work for a considerable period and had a wife and family dependent on him.  In this connection I should like to point out that an attempt has been made to draw an analogy between those being employed by contractors and those employed by the State.  If that position were to be taken up, then I think, the whole question of employment by contractors <Col N="2114" /> would have to be gone into very searchingly. The Government is bound to employ men in certain ways&mdash;through the labour exchanges or through the Civil Service Commission and in other ways&mdash;so as to ensure that the person in the greatest need of employment will secure employment.  But, if the position is to be created that a private individual, carrying out a contract on behalf of the Government, is to be in a position to determine who shall, in effect, be permanently employed by the Government, then, I think, that position cannot be allowed to continue.  No person employed in that way can be allowed to establish a prescriptive claim in the public service to the exclusion of everyone else no matter how deserving he may be.  The same rules that apply to employment directly in the public service will have to be applied to those employed by contractors on Government contracts, and that is that those who are in the greatest need would have to have first claim.  That is not to say that, where the position has obtained up to the present that a person is in continuous employment by a contractor, he is to make room for somebody else, but that where a vacancy does occur on public works that vacancy will have to be filled in accordance with the principle that the Government has already laid down, which is that those in the greatest need of employment will have first claim.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what the Minister has said, there are two points which I wish to put forward. Has this whole question arisen simply because, in the case of one person who was out on sick leave for a long time, the Government attempted to dictate who should be employed in his place?</P>

Am I <Col N="2115" /> also to understand that contractors who do work&mdash;either maintenance or constructional work&mdash;for the State will have to obey certain regulations as to the type of persons they will employ and that it is the intention to introduce a scheme of rotation as to the employment of these people?</P>

      <P>Nothing of the sort. I indicated that if the claim were to be set up that, because a person was in the employment of a contractor who was carrying out works under a scheme for the Government, he had a prescriptive right to be regarded as a public employee, then the rules that normally govern employment in the public service would have to apply in that case also, but that he could not have it both ways.  The Government is debarred from giving employment to any person except in accordance with certain rules.</P>

      <P>I am pointing out the implication of the attitude taken up that these people are, in fact, public employees, and I am merely saying that if they are public employers, then their employment and the terms, conditions and method of their employment will have to conform to the terms and conditions universally applying to employment in the public service.  The matter is being investigated and I am pointing out the natural consequence of an attitude which I have seen stated in <Col N="2116" /> the public Press during the past week or fortnight in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGovern referred to some suggestions which he made to the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to certain drainage works in County Cavan.  He did not mention the names of the districts in which the work should be carried out and, consequently, I cannot identify them; but if he will be good enough to give me the information with regard to the particular districts involved I shall be happy to have the schemes inquired into.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nally referred to the question of the drainage of the River Robe district which, he said, had been initiated in 1928 when the then Government, as a result of preliminary investigation, suggested that the local authority would only be called upon to contribute 6 per cent. of the scheme. He went on then to point out that, subsequently, increasing contributions, rising from 15 per cent. to 25 per cent. might be asked for.  I am afraid that may not be the end of the auction because, since then, the scheme has been exhaustively investigated and a definitive scheme has now been prepared and will be submitted to the County Council in the course of the next fortnight.  The drainage of the River Robe has turned out to be a very complicated matter and it is estimated that the cost will be not less than £45,000.  I should like to say&mdash; possibly in anticipation of what Deputy Nally might like to say on the matter&mdash; that we, at any rate, are putting a firm proposition before the County Council If the County Council are willing to contribute a reasonable amount to the cost of the scheme, we are willing to make a reasonable contribution also; but it will be nothing in the nature of 6 per cent.</P>

At the same time, they also pledged themselves, according to Deputy Nally, only to ask the local authorities to put up 6 per cent.  I am wondering where the balance is to come from.  It seems to me that if they gave a pledge to ask the local authorities to put up only 6 per cent. they must have taken a leap in the dark, because they could not possibly have known what this scheme, which has only reached completion in 1933, was going to cost.</P>

I am not prepared to take up the attitude, notwithstanding what has been said across the House, that all the time has been wasted.  In view of the complaints which we have received from time to time that drainage schemes, instead of improving conditions, make them worse, I think the most searching investigation must be undertaken before the Government, in the first place, commits itself to expend something like £22,500, as it would be in case the 50 per cent. were given, as I intimated is not unlikely, and ask the county council and the occupiers of the land, who are vitally concerned, to make themselves responsible for a large expenditure also.</P>

Last year the estimate was £1,000, and this year it is £560.  I should like to ask the Minister whether the estimates last year indicate the amounts that were in fact spent, in which case the amounts that are provided for this year under those two headings would be about one-third less. I should like to know whether that is a matter of economising under those sub-heads or not.  If, however, the Minister would tell us that the amounts estimated last year were not spent, perhaps he would have some remarks to offer as to whether a difficulty has been found in getting Irish newspapers to co-operate in the scheme of making use of the Irish language for the publication of news.</P>

There is a sum for editing; there is a sum for printing; and there is a sum for the paper and binding.  This may refer to the reprinting of texts which would not ordinarily be available, or which had gone out of print; it might not include translations.  I will, however, venture to say this much, that I think a situation is arising in which there is sufficient difference of opinion as to the value of those texts in their present form to justify the Minister in taking counsel with his colleagues to find out if it would be advisable to invite a small committee of responsible scholars to make a report of their <Col N="2123" /> views as to the value of the texts as they appear.  Frankly, I am referring to the texts that are published in the <i>Gúm</i>, that is readable books in the Irish language.  This may only refer to scholars' texts that have gone out of print.  My objection, of course, does not really apply to those.  I am referring to the translations.  I think there is scope there for the Minister to seek information.</P>
      <P>As the printing of the Official Reports comes under sub-head F. 1 of this Vote I should be glad to know if the Department has had time to consider the recommendation made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that the Official Reports should be made available to Deputies on the following day in the paper bound volume, rather than in the weekly bound volumes as at present.  I feel that the Reports would be much more valuable to us if we could get them the morning after the debate.  It frequently happens that a Minister makes a long statement on some important matter, which falls for debate on the following day, and though the Press reports are often excellent they are not sufficiently detailed to make the foundation of a debate in this House.  When the reports reach us under the present system the debate is frequently long over, and though they are useful for the Committee Stage they would be very much more useful if they were available on the following morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to say a word in support of what Deputy Dillon said with reference to the circulation of the reports of the debates here.  The Minister will recollect that there was a practice here at one time that the reports came out immediately, and that subsequently a revised edition&mdash;corrected, very often&mdash;was put into the printed volumes.  Now, I am quite aware that, as an experiment and as a means towards economy, that system was changed to the present one.  My recollection is that it was a saving in expenditure of only a very few hundred pounds indeed, and I <Col N="2124" /> myself think that the extra couple of hundred pounds, or whatever it was, would be very well expended if we did get, as we used to do, a first print, so to speak, of the reports, and subsequently got the bound volume at the end of a period, with the corrected, if necessary, reports in it. I would ask the Minister to consider, if it is not very expensive, going back to the original practice.</P>
      <P>In connection with another matter which was mentioned here, the editing, printing, paper and binding for certain Irish texts, there is a point which rather strikes me.  It is only a very trifling sum indeed, £15, but if these are mere reprints of texts which have gone out of print, with no question of revising or improving the texts, one hardly sees what editing is required at all.  However, it is only a sum of £15, and possibly not worth discussing.</P>

      <P>On the question raised by Deputy Mulcahy, the amount provided in the Estimates represents fairly closely the actual expenditure which took place under sub-heads F. 4 and G.  There did not seem to be any point in including in the Estimate a figure the expenditure of which was never likely to be actually made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the daily issue of the reports I do know that the Department of Finance some time ago refused to sanction the additional expenditure incurred, which I may say would not be, all things taken into consideration, an insignificant sum.  It would involve an expenditure of something over £1,100 per annum, or approximately £7 per Deputy, to provide this service.  I think the Department was perfectly justified in doing that because, after all, for four years now it has not been the custom to supply these daily reports.  If the situation warranted a discontinuance of that service three or four years ago, I do not think we would be justified in restoring it now, particularly as, I may remind the House, there is continually held up to us the goal of two million pounds to which we are aspiring and, while £1,100 might appear an insignificant sum in this <Col N="2125" /> connection, we have to remember the old Scottish saying that many a mickle makes a muckle.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that at a time when the Dáil is sitting on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays and when proposals involving a very considerable amount of expenditure are being placed before the House, even not very directly, at a time when statements made by Ministers are certainly not very clear as to where their proposals are leading, it might help the Minister to go somewhere along the road to saving, not the particular £2,000,000 which was contemplated long ago, but some £2,000,000, if we were able to have in our hands the Second Reading statements even in time for the Committee Stage, because it so happens at present that if a matter is discussed here on a Tuesday in dealing with the Committee Stage on the following Tuesday the House has not the benefit of having in its hands a report of the discussion that took place on the Second Reading. The Minister might again reconsider the question of making the Dáil debates more accessible to us. The fact is that the debate which takes place on a Tuesday does not reach the Deputies until the following Wednesday week and that means simply that our speeches are being made available for posterity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would just like to mention again one matter to which the Minister did not refer when speaking on the Vote.  I suggest that I spoke with considerable moderation.  If the Minister had been studying the <Col N="2126" /> comments of certain distinguished contributors to the Irish language movement he would realise that there is very widespread dissatisfaction with the text-books which have been published under this head.  I do not now want to repeat the violent language that has been used in reference to them.  All I am submitting is that in the interest of the language there should be some authoritative committee set up and not have two distinguished contributors&mdash;I mention no names&mdash;cutting sticks for each other about these texts.  I would be glad if the Minister would reconsider the setting up of this committee.</P>

I will certainly draw the attention of the Minister for Education to what Deputy Dillon has referred to and I will suggest to him whether something should not be done in the matter of the activities of that organisation and the manner in which it is carrying out its duties.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £51,681 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1934, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an Aire Gnóthaí Coigríche agus Seirbhísí áirithe atá fé riara na hOifige sin.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £51,681 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1934, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs, and of certain services administered by that Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total of this Estimate, £77,681, for 1933-34, compares with a total of <Col N="2127" /> £79,393 for 1932-33.  In order to arrive at a figure which will show the total net cost of foreign representation, it is necessary to add to this figure of £77,681 the sum of £15,120, which will be expended from other Votes, as explained on page 307 of the Estimates. The total gross expenditure will, therefore, be £92,801.  The fees estimated to be collected by the offices at home and abroad for services rendered on visa, passport and general consular services are £30,000, as against £42,000 in 1932-33, so that the estimated net cost of foreign representation in 1933-34 is £62,801.  The abnormally high sum of £42,000 collected in 1932-33 was due to increased visa fees from visitors to the Eucharistic Congress notwithstanding the fact that a specially reduced scale of fees applied for such visitors.</P>
    <P>Of the expenditure of £62,294 on salaries, wages, allowances and travelling expenses of officers abroad and on stationery and other incidentals abroad, a sum of £16,771 is for exchange compensation and loss on exchange due to the abandonment of the gold standard in September, 1931. Similarly, of the sum of £15,120 anticipated to be expended on other Votes, £3,250 may be attributed to loss on exchange due to the same cause, i.e., a total of £20,021 is attributable to these abnormal circumstances.  Excluding this abnormal item, it will be seen that the estimated net cost of foreign representations would be £42,780.</P>
    <P>The decrease of £2,441 under sub-head A (1) for the salaries and wages of the headquarters staff, is attributable mainly to (a) a saving of £1,700 on the salary of the Minister for External Affairs, the duties being at present discharged by the President, and (b) certain reductions in the junior staff. I am at present having a reorganisation of the headquarters staff carried out which will, I anticipate, result in some further savings being effected.</P>
    <P>A saving of £4,139 is envisaged this year as compared with last year on official entertainment.  Last year's provision was abnormally high in order to provide for Government entertainment <Col N="2128" /> on the occasion of the Eucharistic Congress.  Furthermore, I have decided to reduce the expenditure on official entertainment by half compared with normal years, that is, from £1,250 to £625.</P>
    <P>The sub-head containing provision for the salaries, wages, allowances, etc., of representatives abroad shows an increase of £5,115 as compared with last year.  This increase is due mainly to the decision of the Government to extend Consular representation in the U.S.A. by the establishment of Consulates at Chicago and San Francisco in order to afford essential services to the large number of our nationals in the mid-western and western States of America.  At Paris, as I have already explained to the Dáil, a new post of commercial secretary has been established to foster and develop trading relations with France and Belgium.</P>
    <P>The other items call for no special comment.  The increases are due mainly to extension of offices in U.S.A. and Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was in charge of External Affairs I was expected, in introducing the Estimate, to give some account of the operations of that Department during the previous year, but the President has not seen well to carry on that practice, and it seems to me rather a pity; because in this Estimate practically the main part of the Government's policy should be raised.  I suppose that might be more appropriately raised on the Vote for the President's own Department. During the last year we had the Ottawa Conference ending in disaster for this country.  Previously it would have been very hard to convince the ordinary man in this country, owing to lack of experience historically, that external affairs were any concern of ours; but during the last year or so the people have found that through bad policy in regard to our external relations the ordinary man in the street, the farmer, the farmer's labourer and everybody else, can be made to feel the consequences and suffer.  I am assuming that such matters as the Conference in London, <Col N="2129" /> the economic war, the disastrous failure to achieve anything in Ottawa and such matters, might be more appropriately dealt with on the Vote for the President's own Department.</P>
      <P>When I compare last year's Estimate and this year's Estimate, probably because of stupidity on my part, there are things I cannot quite understand. For instance, on page 306, sub-head A 6, there is reference to the special mission to the United States of America in 1933, it gives the Estimate for this year at £480, while last year it was £980.  I suppose there was a Supplementary Estimate last year for a special mission this year.  Then there was a special mission to the U.S.A. in 1932, and the amount in that respect is set out as £682.  I am not quite sure whether there was a Supplementary Estimate for that year and whether that was the amount spent.  With regard to the special mission last year, an outsider was brought along and sent to America.  To the best of my memory, when we asked what this was about we were told he was going to make a sort of survey or inspection of the offices there.  It seems an extraordinary thing that a Government Department with branches abroad is not able to do its own work.  An outsider, a man with no capacity for such work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we look up the Official Debates, vol. 43, cols. 4 and 5, it will be seen that after this trip to America last year we asked for some report as to what had happened.  To the best of my memory the President indicated that at a later stage he would give a report to the House.  To the best of my knowledge no such report has been given.  On col. 4 of vol. 43, ex-Deputy Blythe asked for information about it and the President said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The object of Mr. O'Meara's mission <Col N="2130" /> was to inspect our existing establishments in the United States and to examine the possibilities of extending our trade and consular representation with a view to providing further facilities and developing trade between the two countries.  He has given me a report on the results of his investigations embodying certain recommendations which are under consideration.  When the examination of the report has been completed I shall be glad to explain the position to the Dáil.  I will at the same time give the Dáil the details of the expenditure involved.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the President will get his officials to give us the reference.  This year we had another special trip to America and it was also made by an outsider.  The <Col N="2131" /> Dáil votes money for the maintenance of a Department which has the duty of looking after our external affairs, but from time to time the President brings in somebody from outside and sends that person careering around the world to do business that, I presume, this Department should be doing. There is a special sum of £480 and when there is a thing like this I think the Dáil is entitled to get some information. Normally in regard to Departmental work we can ask any question.  For instance, we can ask questions relating to the office in Paris, in Berlin or Rome, but when these outsiders are sent around the world, apparently the President objects strongly to any questions being raised about it.  I submit that what the President has done in this case is practically a notification to the Dáil that he is not satisfied that the Department for which he is responsible is capable of fulfilling the functions for which it exists.</P>
      <P>I pointed out earlier that when our external affairs are running smoothly nobody will say that they matter tuppence; but, on the other hand, when they are not running smoothly, everyone feels the effect.  Consequently, this is a very important Department.  We have offices in various foreign countries and the purpose of those offices is to maintain good relations and promote the interests of this country and its nationals in those foreign countries.  At this time, when everybody is agreed that great economy is necessary, one naturally looks to see that that economy is exercised and that we are running this Department in order to get the maximum good results from the minimum expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I turn to the Paris office I find a completely new system under several headings.  There is a Commercial Secretary at a salary of £400-15-£500, and the figure for the year 1933-34 is £415.  Then we have a local allowance of £275, a representation allowance of £200&mdash;this sum will not be vouched for &mdash;and a rent allowance of £150 for an unmarried man and £175 for a married man.  The actual sum for the year is <Col N="2132" /> £175.  Now, it will be seen that all that comes to a sum of more than £1,000. I am not going to pretend that I think that particular appointment was made because such an office was necessary. I have no doubt that if the present occupant of that post were removed to another office nobody would be appointed to fulfil his functions because there are no real functions.</P>
    <P>I referred here on a previous occasion to the time when a man who was appointed asked to be given £300 and he would start a farm near Bordeaux. I can understand the President may have felt he owed a personal debt to that man for past services.  It seems to me regrettable that that £300 was not available at the time because the State might now be saved the expenditure of over £1,000.  Even if we accept an expenditure of over £1,000 for an unnecessary office, other questions arise as to the appointment made. I think the President is aware that at the earlier stages the man appointed walked off with the property belonging to this State.  I should like to ask has that property been restored?  I doubt very much if it has because, on the 23rd of the tenth month, 1925, this gentleman wrote to the President's agent asking:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Am I responsible for the correspondence from 1919 up to date or am I to destroy it or otherwise dispose of it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was told to retain possession of those files, and I should like to ask the President if those files have been entered amongst the Minister's property in the Paris office.  I should also like to know what about the furniture. I do not remember the exact value of the furniture, but I think it was estimated at about £50,000.  What steps have been taken for the restoration of that?  I take that case referred to. On the 17th November, 1925, this gentleman wrote to somebody:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am of opinion that we are not likely to realise more than about 4,000 francs when selling off.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 23rd October in letter No. 216 there occurs the pasage:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is all the furniture of which you have an inventory to be sold off? <Col N="2133" /> Can this be disposed of at any time prior to 31st December?  Is the amount which may be realised to be converted into sterling right away, and in what way do you wish the money to be remitted to Dublin after all the expenses in connection with the liquidation have been met?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A letter sent to him on the 1st November&mdash;I shall give the President the reference because this letter should have been restored to the Paris office, it is letter No. 58, from U.S.F.A.&mdash; states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Office furniture as per your inventory&mdash;M.F.A.  (Minister for Foreign Affairs) would like you to retain for your work for us such furniture as you consider will be needed, and the same with the typewriter. All the furniture not required to be sold at your convenience and when it is all liquidated, he would like you to send us an account of the transactions.  M.F.A. will then send instructions re disposal of the balance.  Correspondence files dated from 1919&mdash;M.F.A. asks that you will kindly retain these for the present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am assuming that there would be a likelihood of a return or a restoration of these things to the Paris Office as belonging to the people of this country who had paid for them.  I am also assuming that the files are now in the Paris Office.  It seems peculiar that a man who walked off with the property of the State should be appointed, but I do not want to go into the past as much as that.  The President probably had personal reasons for making up things with this gentleman and to recognise the previous services of this gentleman.  I should like to know, however, that he did not put undue pressure upon the President.  I am aware that this gentleman was occupied in certain deals in France which I think could possibly be used by the President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well then; I shall refer the President to the correspondence. This man was a native of the south-east of Europe.  He was over here and saw the President.  Afterwards he was in France and spent a good deal of time with a gentleman who is now appointed in the Paris Office. That gentleman acted as a go-between with Marino and his friends.  He was in touch with them and he informed people that they were members of the Russian Government.</P>
      <P>I refer now to letter 197, which should be in the Paris Office.  It is dated the 16th August, 1925, and is written by Mr. L.H. Kerney and is addressed to the U.S.F.A.&mdash;that is the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, who at that time was a gentleman named Robert Brennan.  It reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Marino.  Our friend has just gone to Marseilles for three weeks and wishes me to keep for his return the letter which he says he entrusted to your care and which he hopes you are sending me.  I understand that this was a communication addressed to a very important personage, whose name I need not repeat; he says you were to have forwarded this by a very safe channel.  I hope he has not misinformed me, that there is no misunderstanding, and that I can let him have the missive on his return.  He seemed to attach great importance to it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the President cannot identify Marino I shall, of course, give his name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>His name was Ciubranovitch.  Again, on the 5th of the ninth month, letter No. 201, Mr. Kerney wrote again:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2135" />&ldquo;As to Marino: I cannot get his opinion until his return, but would not use for this purpose an untried address.  Perhaps you might instruct our usual intermediary to write to me at latter address, to await my acknowledgment and then, if it functions without a hitch, to forward by that channel; I would be expecting it and would advise my friend accordingly.  Unless we do this it may mean subjecting Marino to a delay which he would find irksome and inconvenient.  The date mentioned in this paragraph of your letter can be summed up as 25, and if further reference to it is ever necessary, I would suggest your using that number.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During the whole of this correspondence it was held that great secrecy should be maintained and that no risks should be taken with covering addresses.  On the 30th of the same month the same gentleman wrote to the U.S.F.A.:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Marino.  I have this morning handed to him personally the letter to which he attached so much importance and for which he is greatly obliged.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And he goes on to give the reason which is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Professor Baldacci, a well-known Italian publicist, is coming to Paris in a few days time; he will be visiting England and Ireland, spending probably three or four weeks in the latter country (at Marino's request) for the purpose of ascertaining for himself the real position.  He will be calling on you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 26th October, 1925&mdash;for the President's information, I may inform him that this letter is No. 55 addressed to L.H. Kerney&mdash;the U.S.F.A. wrote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Will you very kindly tell Marino that I forwarded his kind letter to M.R.A. and convey to him verbally the following answer in reply. M.F.A. desires that you will kindly thank Marino many times for the friendship and devotion clearly proved in every word of his letter. After carefully considering Marino's proposal, while bearing in mind <Col N="2136" /> every detail of their formal talk together, and with much regret M.F.A. has reached the conclusion that under our present circumstances it would be better not to send Signor della Sedia, or any other until we had more information than we at present possess.  It is here that Marino could render us a very valuable service.  M.F.A. asks of Marino's kindness to ascertain for him from the person Marino hopes to see the extent of financial assistance that might be expected; the exact manner in which its transfer would be effected and the conditions, if any, attached.  Also whether absolute secrecy could be maintained, so that the whole transaction would remain unknown to the agent here in England and elsewhere.  You will know without my telling and can describe how great are the difficulties. For us these would be greater than they are even for others in like case.  Yet the need also is greater perhaps.  While the objectives are of necessity unlike, it is the selfsame obstacle that stands in the way of both.  This for the person of whom Marino writes.  Once M.F.A. possesses this information it might be possible to adopt the proposal or rather the example Marino plans to set.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This for the person of whom Marino writes.  Once M.F.A. possesses this information it might be possible to adopt the proposal or rather the example Marino plans to set.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In all, this you will understand all M.F.A. has in mind and will be able to express his gratitude for Marino, who shows such remarkable generosity in what he is trying to do for Ireland.  If only it were possible to do as much in return.  If the day comes when we can do this, we shall not forget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that means that we are committed now to declaring war on Jugo-Slavia.  Does the President deny this correspondence?</P>

      <P>If the President wishes to disown all knowledge of this matter I am ready to ask him to require Mr. Kerney to hand over the files and I hold that those files should be made available to this House.  The letter was dated the 26th October.  I myself was personally aware when this gentleman, referred to here as &ldquo;Marino,&rdquo; interviewed the President.  I also saw him.  He tried to see me abroad and I refused to see him because I understood that he was in touch with Bolshevist agents.  I will read again&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is from a gentleman who signs himself &ldquo;U.S.F.A.&rdquo; which means Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs.  At that time, it was generally occupied by a man named Brennan.  He acted as Secretary to Mr. de Valera, who&mdash;I do not like to use the word&mdash;&ldquo;postured&rdquo; as Minister for Foreign Affairs of an illusory Government <Col N="2138" /> outside of this House.  Does the President deny that this correspondence took place?  I have given him every date.  The letters of October, 1925 figure around the numbers 55, 58, 63 and so on, whereas the letters I have quoted from are numbers 197, 201, 210, 211 and 216, and the last was sent on the 23rd October, 1925.</P>
      <P>Previous to this period the files belonged to this State.  They were made off with by Mr. Kerney&mdash;various things, including typewriters and other possessions were made off with by Mr. Kerney who, at the time, was advised to retain possession of these files.  It was the President's duty to see that the property of this State, that was taken away by this gentleman when he went off in 1923, should be restored, and, when he was appointed to this office in Paris, to bring in these files to that office because they effectively belonged to the Government of this country and to the people of this country.  I ask if he has done so, and I maintain that the President was bound to see that he returned those files and made them available.  I may tell the President that the contents of these files were known, not merely to this Government, but to two other Governments, but I will say this, that if it is a fact&mdash;as has transpired and as I was aware at the time from the correspondence&mdash;that this man in France abused the hospitality of that country by being in secret relations with the agents of other countries, or at any rate of another country, which was doing its best to subvert order in various other countries, including France&mdash;if that man acted, together with a man called &ldquo;Marino,&rdquo; whose name is Ciubranovitch, for the purpose of getting financial aid for certain revolutionary people in this country&mdash;I say that, if he acted in that secret way on French soil, it is not calculated to improve our relations with France that he should now occupy an official position in the Paris office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the same thing can be said with regard to the President, but I want the House to understand that whatever a man has done in the past, when he is elected to the position of President or some similar position, <Col N="2139" /> other countries cannot take any exception to whatever may have happened previously; but when it comes to the case of an official it is a different matter.  The President may contradict me&mdash;it is a thing which can be put to the test afterwards, because the documents are in the possession of two other Governments and should be in the possession of Mr. Kerney&mdash;but if I am right in this, then the appointment of that man in France is a direct affront to the French people.  The French Government does not necessarily advert to the matter, but this action follows on other unfortunate things that happened and of which the President is aware.  I do not want to drag up the matter again.  I am referring to the unfortunate thing that happened a year ago on the occasion of the reception by the French Ambassador when&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Did it happen during the currency of the present financial year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say that, but I believe it did.  The President should know the date.  I am referring to the reception in Dublin by the French Ambassador when they skedaddled out and created a lot of trouble.  I was glad to see that the President did try to make amends a month or so ago and swallowed all his principles and wore a top hat in Paris, which I entirely approve of.  The only thing I regret is that he did not wear it on the occasion of the Eucharistic Congress but he evidently realises now that he made a terrible blunder on that occasion and did his best to make amends for it.  I remember seeing Deputy Little, on the famous night of that reception by the French Ambassador, rushing across the room and colliding with people dancing on the floor in his endeavour to get out before the Governor-General might get in contact with him.  It may be that our whole foreign relations are managed in such a way at the moment as to bring us nothing but harm.  Of course it may be said that that is an essential part of the Government's policy&mdash;the economic <Col N="2140" /> war and all the rest of it&mdash;but I do object to going gratuitously out of our way to make trouble.  This man would have been satisfied if he had got £300 to start a farm at Bordeaux.  The President and his Party at this time were very hard up.  I agree that they did discharge this man because they could not afford to keep him at the beginning, and finally they agreed to keep him on part-time giving him £15 per month.  They were still hard up. It is a pity they were so hard up as all this might have been over if they had £300 available to satisfy him at the time.  This man has acted as the agent for the President for these years and he does know, I think, an awful lot about the President.</P>
      <P>As the House will see from the correspondence, his associations with &ldquo;Marino&rdquo; were involved in negotiating with certain other people to get money over to this country from Russia. I should not like to think that that had anything to do with the fact that he is now appointed so expensively, because this country cannot afford more than £1,000 per year for fulfilling a quite unnecessary office.  I am not surprised that the President casts doubt upon that correspondence.  I do not want to suggest that the President is in any way trying to mislead the House, because I am prepared to have the matter looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one further question I should like to ask.  The President has been to Rome recently.  I presume that the President went as a private person, paying his way out of his private pocket and not out of State funds.  If that is so, of course I have no right to refer to it.  To the best of my memory, however, Deputy Cosgrave, as President of the Executive Council, went to Rome also as a pilgrim in 1925.  I think he went as a private person and, if he did I personally would have resented that anybody should have raised any question whatever about his going there. The President went there as a pilgrim, I understand; he went there as a private person.  Therefore, I assume&mdash; I do not even like to ask the question &mdash;that that trip cost the State nothing <Col N="2141" /> whatever.  It will be remembered that while the President was in Rome his own personal newspaper brought out a perfectly ridiculous story by a man who is so old that I would not like to attribute blame or responsibility to him.  I never did even when he was a good deal younger.  A perfectly silly and rather scandalous story&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am questioning whether it does or not, because I understand that when that perfectly ridiculous and scandalous story was put in the President's personal organ in the office of that newspaper a telegram was received from the President in Rome telling them really to keep clear of that.  The reason I raise the matter is that I should like to know was that telegram paid for out of the President's personal pocket, or does it in any way become a cost to the State. If it was paid out of his personal pocket, I have no right to discuss it. If, on the other hand, it should, by any chance, by inadvertence or otherwise, have come down on the cost of, say, our Roman office, then the question would arise.  I do think the President, in his position as President and as Minister for External Affairs, in leaving this country on that pilgrimage, should have taken steps to see that, in so far as his personal ventures or possessions, or whatever you like to call them, are concerned, nothing untoward should happen that might injure this country.  As a matter of fact, what did happen?  This scandalous story is published with a scandalous leading article, which even stated more than the story had in it. The story was published under the name&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I said it with a negative tone in my voice.  If the President had even shook his head I would have accepted it.  I waited to see if there was any contradiction on the part of the President, but there was not. He has given it now, and we will let the matter drop.  This is a Department whose importance has been brought home to the people of the country during the last year or so as it never was before.  Some of the most important things in the history of the Department have happened in that time.  On the one hand, our whole relations with the Government of Great Britain have become strained, leading to an economic war.  The President gave us no information whatever on that.  As far as my memory goes, in giving no information he has departed from precedent.  When I occupied the position of Minister for External Affairs I had to refer in my opening statement to the major things that had happened during the year and to give some account of them, which was useful in giving Deputies some picture of what had happened during the year so <Col N="2144" /> that they could co-relate the comments they had to make.  At present, when the Department costs nearly £100,000 a year, when anything requires to be done in America somebody from outside is brought in and sent over to America at additional cost, which implies, as I said, quite clearly that the President does not think that the Department for which he is responsible is competent to do what it was established to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having, in fulfilment of his Government policy, which I do not wish to quarrel with at the moment, made a certain amount of trouble all round, he then adds £1,000 to the cost in relation to the Paris office by appointing a person whose appointment&mdash;if his past activities are what I believe them to have been and what are indicated in certain correspondence which was shown to me from time to time, quite authoritatively&mdash;is not merely pitching £1,000 of Irish money into the gutter, but would definitely be doing harm, and instead of improving our relations with France, would be injuring them. I do not think the President wants to do that, because having made one gaffe, he hastened to do his very best to remedy the thing afterwards by fulfilling the necessary forms when he was in Paris.  I should like to ask, and I hope the President will not take exception to my asking, whether the President's trip to Rome, which was clearly of a personal nature, was borne out of this Vote.  I do not want the President to turn around and say I am trying to suggest it was, because if the President tells me it was not I am not going to dispute it.  I do not think I am being unjust to the President in raising this point, because it gives him an opportunity of assuring the Irish people that his whole journey to Rome did not cost the people of this country one penny.  If that is so he can say so, but if it did actually impose some cost on the people of this country, then I should feel bound to protest. We have an office over there and there was no particular function for which the President was necessary there as President.  I can quite understand that it is a right and proper thing, in view of the position he occupies in this country, that he should <Col N="2145" /> go over and perform the pilgrimage. If&mdash;I put that word &ldquo;if&rdquo; in&mdash;it were a fact that it imposed cost on the people of this country instead of on the President's own purse, then, I think, it would be a matter that we should protest against very loudly.  I am not going to develop that point very much, because if I go on developing what would be rather scandalous if it had happened the President will get up and say that I am trying to suggest those things.  I will not pursue it lest it be said that I am trying to misrepresent the position, but I do ask here and now that the President will inform us whether the trip to Rome cost the State anything.  If it did impose cost on the State I should like to be informed of it.  I think this House has a right to know that.  I think also, as I said, that I am not being in any way unjust to the President.</P>
    <P>I should like also to know if the President is going to deny that letter No. 55 of 26th October, 1925, from U.S.F.A. on behalf of M.F.A.,&mdash; U.S.F.A. meaning Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and M.F.A. meaning Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;in answer to Mr. Kerney's letter No. 213 of 14th October, 1925.  If the President denies that such letter was sent on his behalf or was sent by those acting under him, namely the gentleman referred to as U.S.F.A., well and good.  Then I would ask that Mr. Kerney produce the files up to and including 1925, to show whether or not such a letter appeared. The letter says: &ldquo;M.F.A. desires that you will kindly tell Marino that I forwarded his kind letter to M.F.A. and convey to him verbally the following answer in reply.&rdquo;  The following answer, if that letter is <i>bona fide,</i> is from President de Valera himself&mdash;that is Mr. de Valera acting in the capacity of Minister for Foreign Affairs for a body outside this House.  If he was responsible for that communication being sent through Mr. Kerney to M. Ciubranovitch to be conveyed to an agent of the Bolshevist Government, relating as it did to financial assistance which was hoped for from this important person, then I say that the President, in his present position, can <Col N="2146" /> afford to tell everyone that as far as he is concerned that is all over.  As far as the official is concerned, the man who was enjoying French hospitality at that date and was abusing that hospitality by getting into touch with secret agents in France, then I say that the appointment of such a man would be a scandal, would be calculated to bring discredit on this country, calculated to interfere with the good relations between this country and other countries, calculated to put distrust into the minds of other Governments as to the subterraneous activities of this Government, and would be an appointment which this House and this whole country should protest against.  If the President is prepared to deny that letter, I ask him to produce the files from the Paris office.</P>

      <P>That is not what I asked.  I asked whether the revenue from the visas had been increased as a result of the appointment of these gentlemen.  I am sure there is nothing in these Estimates about it.  There is a provision made for loss of £2,733 in Exchange.  I take it that will be cut in half for the current year if the United States dollar continues as it is now or even declines.  I share Deputy Fitzgerald's regret that the President did not give us some account of our external policy in general&mdash;some account of what has been going on.  We are spending over £60,000 a year on these representatives abroad.  It would be certainly reasonable to give such an account of what was being done as would satisfy us that that money has been well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder, for example, whether our representation in Germany can be worth the money it costs us.  I even wonder about our representation in France, though I do that with great reluctance, because I happen to be specially interested in the City of Paris and the Irish Legation there as a centre of genial hospitality which I have had the pleasure of enjoying.  I wonder with regard to both these countries, particularly Germany, whether the money spent is really worth while, or whether it would not be really more worth while to have legations in Denmark and Sweden, which are countries of our own size and in which much more <Col N="2148" /> might be learned about the organisation of agricultural and industrial activities. However, I speak as a novice in these matters.  I dare say there are advantages attaching to our representation in Germany of which I am not aware.  Of course, if either of these countries is promising as a market for our produce there is a great deal to be said for representation there.  But so far we have been given only the most fragmentary or mysterious allusions as to what has been accomplished in the way of securing foreign markets.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that on this Vote for External Affairs the outline would have been filled in to some extent.</P>
    <P>Necessarily, the external matter which most affects the welfare and prosperity of this country is the matter of our relations with Great Britain and, therefore, I am afraid that very few of us can feel satisfied with the record of our Department of External Affairs during the past year.  The President, the other day, when he was passing through Paris, made a speech to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in which he expressed regret that the spirit of St. Vincent de Paul did not permeate the League of Nations at Geneva.  He expressed the view that much better work would be accomplished there if it did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">

      <P>Yes.  On the way back the President made a speech to the American Club in Paris in which he chastised Great Britain and British policy in a manner that was not at all suggestive of St. Vincent de Paul, nor indeed was it in a manner which seemed to promise success in the negotiations which we hoped might be initiated in London to settle our dispute as a sort of side-line to the Economic Conference.  Moreover, as Deputy Kelly has just remarked, the President's admonition to the League of Nations as to the spirit of St. Vincent de Paul might be appropriately applied in relations with political opponents nearer home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">

      <P>There is only one point of difference as between this year's Estimate and last year's in the matter of External Affairs and that is the increase in the representation in the United States.  This change in our policy took place during the course of last year.  A Supplementary Estimate was introduced and the Vote was passed by agreement.  We did not get an opportunity from the President to hear what was the reason for the change of policy.  We have now got representatives in Boston, Chicago and San Francisco.  I presume there was some definite need for these appointments.  In that connection, I presume our representative in Chicago has taken some steps to see that we are properly represented in the World's Fair.  Otherwise their only function is one of a semi-legal character connected with wills and bequests from Irish people in America to relatives at home.  I notice that the papers a few days ago reported a judge in the Free State as announcing that in future he would not accept documents in the Free State certified by British Consuls, that they must be certified by Irish Consuls.  That seems to be rather a sweeping statement for a judge to make, because we have these Consuls only in four or five States in America and where we have not got our own Consuls it is the usual practice for members of the Commonwealth of Nations that the British Consul acts as our agent while taking, of course, the fees.  For that reason, I think, the President should make it clear that judges in this country are entitled to receive documents certified by British Consuls when there is no Irish Consul in that State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of whether we get value for our money is <Col N="2150" /> a very natural question to ask in regard to this Vote.  It has been asked on every occasion on which the Vote was before the House and it is really very difficult to be able to reply to that question in a convincing way.  I quite agree that if our external trade with countries outside of Britain was of larger proportions than it is, it would be much easier from one point of view to satisfy Deputies in this House that the money had been well spent.  As a matter of fact, our trade with countries abroad is considerably limited and our representatives abroad, both Ministers and Secretaries of the various Legations, have been very busy in trying to extend our markets and to redress what is at present the adverse balance against us in most of these countries.  At the present time it is extremely difficult to get into European markets or into United States markets on account of the very high tariffs there and also on account of the quota system.  We are determined that these balances will be redressed, and that if countries outside want to get goods in here to the extent of some £1,500,000 they will have to take from this country in return a very considerable portion of that amount in goods.  If they do not it will be necessary to take steps to prevent their goods coming in as freely as at the present moment.  We have activity proceeding in this respect in the various Legations.  Our representatives have been hard at work, and more and more the Department of External Affairs is developing the trade side of the activities of our offices.  I cannot say, on the purely trade basis, that at the present moment the money spent is justified, but our activities are far greater than they were in the past, and the defence of this expenditure must be, for the present at any rate, on the very same lines as it was defended in the past, and that is that we cannot afford not to be represented in certain countries abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain centres which immediately occur to one as centres where we ought to be represented.  The first is the United States.  As a matter of fact, our establishments are almost self-supporting there.  When <Col N="2151" /> you consider the millions of people of our race there and the relations between the people in America and our own country, the services that are constantly being rendered to our nationals there and to citizens of the United States who are of our race and want to come here, I think there is not the slightest doubt that we can defend our representation in the United States&mdash;our representation at Washington and the Consulates that have been established in a number of the other cities of America.  The principal Consulate is in New York. Before I took office you had also a Consulate in Boston.  We have extended that to Chicago and San Francisco. The reasons for the extension are that, from my own knowledge of the United States and from the reports which we got from visitors from these cities, it was obvious there was a need for Consulates there to give service to our own people with regard to estates and a number of other things.  I was satisfied that Consulates in these particular cities of Chicago and San Francisco would meet their costs.</P>
    <P>I know the establishment of Consulates has been a source of very great satisfaction to friends of ours in these cities.  They are too recently established to be able to show whether my anticipations in that regard are correct. That remains to be seen.  We have offices in New York and Boston, in Chicago&mdash;which deal with a number of the middle States&mdash;and in San Francisco.  We feel the presence of our Consuls there is going to be a matter of very great convenience to our nationals and also to friends of Ireland, American citizens who are of our race and whose contact with this country is very close.  One of the duties performed is in connection with estates. I have some notes here which indicate that last year there was about £9,000 recovered for our nationals by our Consuls. When you consider the size of the United States and the fact that, previous to our Consuls being established, British Consuls had to be approached by our citizens for the necessary facilities, I think you will agree that we were justified in establishing <Col N="2152" /> these offices.  I think the House will be convinced from the figures we have of our revenue from the United States that representatives in the United States are justified.  I think anybody who knows the country will agree that on account of the size of the territory and the cities in which the new Consuls have been established, they were a natural development.  I think there can be hardly any real criticism in regard to representatives in the United States.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going back on that.  I am at the moment trying to develop the question the Deputy asked &mdash;are we justified in our expenditure in regard to our relations with foreign countries?  The next place that suggests itself as a place where we ought to be represented is the Vatican.  As a Catholic nation our relations with the Holy See are probably as close, if not closer, than those of any other country in the world.  I think, therefore, that the expenditure in that regard is an expenditure which will not be questioned by any Deputy.  I can pass on from that.  The next place is Geneva.  If we are to be members of the League of Nations, I think we will have to continue to be represented at Geneva.  The activities of the League of Nations, such as they are, are all concentrated at Geneva, and, if we do want to keep in touch with world affairs generally and to take our place as a nation amongst the nations in the League of Nations, it is necessary that we should be represented there, so I would say Geneva is the third.  If we were to cut down our expenditure at all I think these three places would have to be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to France and Germany, it becomes more difficult to say exactly what we are getting for our money.  I admit that.  France has practically closed her ports against all imports.  Our trade with France is very light but, such as it is, the balance is against us.  I took occasion, when I was in Paris recently, to point that out to the proper authorities and to urge&mdash;<Col N="2153" /> our Department is constantly urging&mdash; that the balance of trade be redressed. However, I think it is an expenditure in regard to which you find it difficult to see what the country is getting.  In the past, in the Republican days, we felt, when we wanted the position of this country to be known in all important centres, we were justified in sending a representative to Paris.  France being a great nation, one of the greatest nations on the Continent, we felt is was to our interest to send representatives to the capital of that nation in order that our position as a people claiming the right to complete freedom should be known.  Therefore, on the ground of general insurance, so to speak, to see that Ireland's point of view in any matters that concerned our country might be properly represented in France, we felt we were justified in continuing the representation which began in the past, when it was more difficult for us to meet the cost of that representation.</P>
    <P>What I have said about France might apply also to Germany.  In the case of Germany our trade is not in a satisfactory position.  We have got certain representations made, and certain advantages have been secured, but I am quite willing to confess we are not at all satisfied, and efforts are being pressed to redress the adverse balance of trade between Germany and ourselves. But from the point of view of representation in general, I think our Legation in Berlin must be on the same general lines as our Legation in Paris.  Deputies may differ as to whether, in fact, we are getting value for our money.  Speaking for myself, I think the expenditure is justified both in Berlin and in Paris, although I am not asking other Deputies to accept what I say or to agree with me.  But it is also the opinion of the Government and we propose to continue to have our representatives, both in Paris and in Berlin.  As regards Belgium, our representative in Paris also represents us in Belgium, and we are in the happy position that our representative in Paris is familiar with Belgium and knows the conditions there exceedingly well.</P>
    <P>I think I have said all I can say to <Col N="2154" /> justify the expenditure of this money on our representatives abroad.  I have shown that there are three centres, at any rate, where it can be shown certainly that we are getting value for our money and that we must be represented there.  In the case of the other two countries, they are great nations on the Continent, and I think we ought to continue having representatives there.</P>

      <P>In the case of London our High Commissioner is doing work which has been done in the past there. He is very actively engaged.

      <P>Now, that covers the field in general.  It is very difficult to prove to anyone who wishes to look for a return in pounds, shillings and pence that we are justified in continuing this expenditure.  So far as the Government is concerned, we feel we are.  We feel there is going to be no retrenchment at present in any of these offices and we cannot see any time in the future when a Government is likely to come along and propose that any one of these establishments should be cut out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question was with regard to special missions to the United States.  The first special mission of Mr. O'Mara to the United States was on foot last year.  Shortly after I took office, I sent him over to the United States because I happened to know that he knew the conditions in the United States as well as any of our representatives could know them, through the attitude of large sections of our friends towards existing establishments there; and the sending over of Mr. O'Mara was intended so that he might observe and consider a number of questions and give us a report upon them.  Some of them were of a very <Col N="2155" /> confidential character and I do not think at that time I suggested I would give them to the Dáil.  They were there to give me information which I felt was necessary for the proper conduct of the Department.  I got that information and also certain suggestions with regard to the development of systems over there.  Certain inquiries had to be made.  These inquiries were made by them, and mainly as a result and consequent upon Mr. O'Mara's first report.  There were certain changes which were suggested might be made by me.  The position generally was that our establishments in the United States would have to be greatly extended because of the greater number of American citizens using them than they enjoyed up to that period.</P>
    <P>Now the expenditure was sanctioned by the Dáil.  It was brought in as an Estimate.  I remember a statement I was prepared to make.  Deputy Fitzgerald is correct in saying that no statement, as a matter of fact, was delivered here.  The Vote went through.  I do not know whether I was actually present on the occasion. I know about a statement that was to be given to the Dáil but the fact is, I think, that the Vote passed without discussion and I do not think any statement was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>March, 1933.  It is true, as a matter of fact that there was no real discussion.  The statement prepared in my Department was not given. With regard to the criticism that Mr. O'Mara was an outsider, anybody who knows the conditions in the United States and the attitude of a very large section of American citizens to our establishments in the United States will understand why somebody who knew the conditions and customs and had the confidence of the people was being sent.  However, as I say, that was last year's business, properly speaking, and not this year's.  With regard to the sum, attention is called <Col N="2156" /> to £480 and £980.  The two of these should be added together in order to get the total Estimate for the particular mission.  The reason it was divided into two was that it took place at a time when only part of the expenditure was estimated for this financial year. It is really the same payment.  Adding these two you get the sum of over £1,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there a Supplementary Estimate for this £980?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am perfectly certain that Finance took care that the usual financial procedure was adopted and that this Estimate was introduced. The point that needs explanation is this: £480 for the year 1933/34 and £980 for the year 1932/33.  Each year of the estimate divided into two parts according as the expenses were envisaged for 1932/33 and 1933/34.  We have got an account of that.  In fact the mission did not cost half that sum. Whatever may be said of Mr. O'Mara as an outsider, I find it very hard to understand how a member of the Executive Council could in any circumstances be regarded as an outsider. Mr. Connolly was a member of the Executive Council; he knew America, and he had, in fact, at one time been Consul representing the people of this country in New York.  He was sent over on a very definite mission to make preliminary arrangements with regard to the repayment of the Republican Loan.</P>
      <P>As far as the Estimate is concerned, the actual expenses are less than half the Estimate.  I simply point out that it was a member of the Executive Council who went on this last occasion and that he was particularly fitted for the mission because he knew America well. He had been there for a number of years and knew the circumstances particularly well, inasmuch as he had in addition to being there for a number of years as Consul, also carried on business as a private individual in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is with regard to the special missions in the United States.  Now we come to some other items.  I do not know if I would be justified in talking about criticism.  I find it very hard sometimes to get words to characterise <Col N="2157" /> the statements of Deputy Fitzgerald. The Deputy has made suggestions with regard to Mr. Kerney, and every one of these statements, as far as I am aware, is unjustified.  Mr. Kerney represented the Republic, and when Deputy Fitzgerald talks about going away with the loot and running away with the property of the people, I want to tell him that I still believe to-day, and that a large section of the Irish people still believe to-day, and that history will yet prove, what is more, that the State established by the Irish people in 1919 continued to be the State and was the State which the Ministers, by their attitude in suppressing the courts and so on, tried to overturn by a <i>coup d'étât</i>, and those who stood for the State&mdash;and Mr. Kerney is one&mdash; did not try to run away with anybody's property.  They tried to defend the State set up by the Irish people and to hold the property of that State for the people, and neither Mr. Kerney nor I, nor anybody associated with that movement, are going to offer any apology for our actions to Deputy Fitzgerald. Mr. Kerney represented us in Paris.  He tried to maintain the position as long as possible.  He gave accounts to the proper authorities&mdash;the people to whom he was reporting and, so far as I know, there is nothing that can be said about Mr. Kerney except that which is good.</P>
    <P>That is as far as the question of property is concerned.  I did not ask for these files.  Once that kind of thing is raised, we get immediately into the same sort of question we would have if we were dealing with the balance of the American money.  I did not ask for the files.  It is possible they will be given, but it did not occur to me to ask for them.  As a matter of fact, I doubt if Mr. Kerney has them in his possession at the moment.  There is, however, a suggestion about the appointment of Mr. Kerney to which I must refer.  It is known even by our Department that Mr. Kerney accounted to the old Dáil authorities and, therefore, in so far as he is concerned personally, nothing whatever can be said against him.  It is characteristic of Deputy Fitzgerald when he is talking to suggest that I had some personal reason for appointing <Col N="2158" /> Mr. Kerney and he tries to develop that by reading out fairy tales to us.  The suggestion, as far as I can discover what the Deputy has been at, is that somehow I was personally in Mr. Kerney's power and that, to placate Mr. Kerney, or something of that sort, that is the reason he was appointed to the office in Paris.  I am not quite sure, but as far as I could discover what the tortuous suggestions of the Deputy were leading to, I think that was his aim.  I say that is an absolute falsehood. I am in no person's power.</P>

      <P>I am free to take any action I choose and Mr. Kerney was chosen for the position because he had proved an efficient officer in the past and he was entitled to be considered for the post as a faithful servant in the past and because, in addition to that, we believed he had special aptitudes which would be useful to our people in France.  For these reasons he was appointed to the post and, since he has been there, he has proved himself a most valuable and efficient officer.  Now we come to the suggestions.  It is an extraordinary thing that Deputy Fitzgerald had all this information for all these years and was quite well aware of it and, it appears that the French Government were aware of it, and that there was never a suggestion until now about it.  I can say a word or two on that matter.  First of all, with regard to the gentleman to whom Deputy Fitzgerald referred, I know nothing about what names he may have had, such as &ldquo;Marino.&rdquo;  I know nothing about it.  I doubt if Mr. Brennan was in the office at all in that period.  I could not tell the House exactly when Mr. Brennan gave up acting in that capacity but I doubt if he occupied the position of Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs since the Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's imputations are all of the same character. With regard to this particular person, I knew that there was a certain Montenegrin refugee who came over here.  I knew nothing about him, but, like a great number of other people, he asked to see me and I saw him.  I did not know him and I placed no confidence in him.  I know nothing about him except that he was like hundreds of other people from other countries who come to see me.  He told me that Montenegro had been deprived of its freedom and a number of other things, gave me the story of the conditions in his country and of all the wrongs under which his country suffered.  I listened to what he had to say.  I did not even check up upon whether his statements were true or false, because I was not going to take any action which would make it necessary for me to check up on what he said.  I knew nothing about him, and, as a matter of fact, I did not care very much, because there was no particular action I could take which would make it worth my while to probe that matter home.  The Deputy talked about a lot of letters.  I do not know anything about these letters.  The <Col N="2160" /> Deputy went on to suggest that these were written at my instance.  As I say, the only thing I know about this man was&mdash;I would not have known him only his name was mentioned; I could not even now spell his name&mdash;that he came over and asked to see me. Somebody, I could not say who, gave him some sort of an introduction.  I saw him and he told me the story of Montenegro and I know nothing more. Deputy Fitzgerald says he met him himself.  I do not know what he said to Deputy Fitzgerald, or what representations he made to him.  It is quite possible, because Deputy Fitzgerald happened to be a Minister at the time, that he would have said very much more to him, and would try to influence him very much more than he tried to influence me.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that Deputy Fitzgerald has tried to make it relevant.  He has tried to make it appear that I made this appointment in Paris, because Mr. Kerney had been a go-between between me and some Bolshevik agent, or something of that sort.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that that may be so.  The only point, however, that the House is interested in on this Estimate is that Deputy Fitzgerald suggests that Mr. Kerney was in intimate communication with Bolshevik agents and, therefore, he is an unsuitable person for his present position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that Deputy Fitzgerald had two strings to his bow. He was trying to fire at two people. His first shot was at me&mdash;that I abused my position in appointing Mr. Kerney because, forsooth, I had some personal reason&mdash;my evil ways were known to Mr. Kerney and I had to buy him off. That is the suggestion made by Deputy Fitzgerald and it is worthy of him. The second suggestion is that Mr. Kerney is not a suitable person for his position.  I think the French Government are well able to look after themselves. If the French Government felt that there was an insult, or anything wrong being done by us in making that appointment, they would have made their objection.  Again, of course, because he is not asked in this House for anything more than mere suggestion, Deputy Fitzgerald suggests that we are doing a very wrong thing and that we are insulting the French <Col N="2162" /> Government, with whom naturally we want to be on friendly terms, having our representative there, by appointing somebody that he represents Mr. Kerney to be.  It was Deputy Fitzgerald's representation of Mr. Kerney and nothing else.  I know Mr. Kerney and I know Deputy Fitzgerald.  The Irish people know Deputy Fitzgerald anyhow.</P>

      <P>And I think if we had to choose a person who would do honour to this country and who would fairly represent this country, we would not have much difficulty in choosing between Deputy Fitzgerald and Mr. Kerney.  Mr. Kerney at any rate has been appointed by the Executive Council, on my nomination, as Commercial Secretary.  I take full responsibility for Mr. Kerney.  I believe that Mr. Kerney has not been guilty of any act that would make him <i>non persona grata</i> with the French Government. Another incident has been brought up. The Deputy spoke about our making amends.  We offered no insult and no insult was taken.  No suggestion was ever made by the representative of the French Government to this country that there had been an insult offered. No insult was taken.  No insult was suggested, and there was nothing, therefore, to amend.  Therefore, my visit to the President of the French Republic was a State visit paid to him in my official capacity and received as such, and there was no question of its being a visit simply to make amends for some supposed insult.  The suggestion of insult was made by Deputies on the other side who wished to try and turn that particular incident in a different direction from the direction it was in.</P>

I went to Rome as the head of the Government of this country&mdash;as the Catholic head of the <Col N="2163" /> Government&mdash;and I went there officially and not as a private individual. I went officially to the Holy See and to Rome and, as one Deputy remarked, whilst there I also, as a private individual&mdash;if you can separate the two&mdash;performed the exercises of the Holy Year.  One part of my visit there was not official, though indeed it might have been.  The expenses of the journey to Bobbio, both for myself and the officials who were with me, I made quite clear before I left, were going to be paid out of my pocket.  But the other part was a State visit to Rome and the Holy See.  It was undertaken in my capacity as head of the Government and it was in that regard it was appreciated.  On my way back I also paid a State visit to the President of the French Republic, to the French Premier and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I do not know if I have covered all the points raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points which I should like to put to the President.  I understand that he has the approval of Deputy Kelly, but as to whether he has answered Deputy Fitzgerald, well, I do not think he has.  I quite agree that it is exceedingly difficult, on the mere question of pounds, shillings and pence, to weigh up the value of our various representations abroad, but to a certain extent the President tried it. I am not finding any fault with him for doing that.  I think he made it quite clear, however, that our representations abroad will have to be judged on other grounds.  The following question, which I should like to put to the President, is relevant, and would certainly interest the people of the country.  The President will remember that he began to show that in America our representation paid for itself.  He had very obvious answers as far as America was concerned. Then he went on to refer to Paris, Brussels and Berlin.  Roughly speaking, I may say if you take in our representation in Rome, we have now representatives in touch with Italian speaking people, French speaking people and German speaking people. I think so far as French speaking people and German speaking people, and indeed so far as Italian speaking people are concerned, the President more or less suggested that from the point of view of pounds, shillings and pence it might be hard to put up a case for them.  What about those markets that they are finding, which the Minister for Agriculture told us all about?  Could not the President now justify their existence by pointing out that they have found all those markets which are going to replace the 95 per cent. market that we have lost?  I presume that is the work they have been doing.  I presume our representatives in Paris and Brussels have been busy in that respect.  I presume our representative in Berlin has also been busy in that respect.  Does it mean any more than the removal, for instance, in the case of the French or other Governments of certain veterinary regulations, and permission for <Col N="2165" /> our products to enter, or does it mean a guarantee of any price?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the Deputy unfortunately does not represent the country, as he proved by his speech about the fine hats which the farmers' daughters are wearing throughout the country.  I do represent a country constituency, and the price paid by the German buyers at the present moment is certainly not sufficient.  If that is all that has been done, namely, the opening up of markets, and the getting in of cattle at the price paid at present, I submit that that is not of any value.</P>

      <P>It will be seen that there is an increase of £594 on this Vote as compared with the 1932-3 Vote.  The total contribution of the Irish Free State towards the upkeep of the League of Nations is 3,364 gold francs, or in Saorstát currency £19,305, £14,193 of which is provided for in this Vote and £5,112 in the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce, page 240 of the Estimate Book.  In respect of the International Labour Bureau of the League, of the total contribution of £19,305 as provided, £6,205 is in respect of loss on exchange due to the fact that Saorstát currency is not on a gold basis.  Additional provision had to be made this year under the travelling and incidental sub-head for the expenses of the delegation to the World Economic Conference in London.</P>

      <P>I was hoping that somebody else would speak, but as the <Col N="2167" /> Vote seems on the point of going through I should like to say first of all that I am very strongly in favour of this country keeping up an active interest in the League of Nations, and I am very glad that any cold water which the present Administration may have been disposed to throw on it when they were not in power is apparently a thing of the past.  I just want to ask this question.  As the President is keeping up a lively interest in the League of Nations, has there, since the outbreak of what we call the economic war with England, been nothing that he could do at Geneva to get the subject of that dispute brought before such a court as the Hague Court?  Could he not make any sort of move in that direction?  If he could have had, I wonder if he would give us any explanation as to why no activity has been shown in that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy MacDermot has said. I think the President will find that even if the League of Nations cannot adjudicate, even if a court cannot adjudicate on this matter except with the consent of both parties, still a court could give an advisory opinion.  It has given advisory opinions on other matters without the consent of both parties.  If an advisory opinion were given, say, on the question of the land annuities perhaps at any rate that much would be out of the way.  With regard to the general policy of the League of Nations, I wish the President would give us a general statement, seeing that I suppose it will not be in our life-time again that the head of the Irish Free State will preside at the League of Nations.  I think the President's statement at the opening of the Assembly met with the general approval of everybody in this country as to its general lines, although there were some references he made which perhaps would not meet with approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, when he, from a high and mighty position as President of the League of Nations, announced with rather a pathetic accent that he did not consider himself as being free, I would like to know what further position he <Col N="2168" /> should be in in order to be free.  I do not know but apparently as President of the League of Nations he was not sufficiently free.  Furthermore, his action with regard to the dispute in the East, I suppose, was taken as a result of the General Council and not as his personal opinion.  I saw a large headline in the papers &ldquo;Senator Connolly warns Japan&rdquo; and other statements of that kind.  I certainly did not approve of the President's action in persecuting the unfortunate people of Manchukuo.  Certainly if he did represent the Council on that matter he did not represent me.</P>

In addition the chairman and members of that whole-time Commission were appointed by the Executive Council in December, 1932, to act as a Commission for the marketing of live stock and agricultural produce.  Furthermore, since that date a number of matters have been referred by the Executive Council to the Tariff Commission.  Recently the Executive Council have referred a number of matters to it including, amongst others, an investigation into meat meals and bone meals.

      <P>I am sorry the Minister has not given us any details of the reductions on this Vote.  Of course it is not a very large sum and, as the Minister said earlier this evening, they wish to effect all the economies possible in the Estimates. At the same time one is curious to ask how far certain economies are real.  I would like to refer to a couple of items coming under the heading of Scientific Investigation, etc. (Grants-in-Aid).  I would like to refer to the reduction in the grant to the Royal Irish Academy of Music from £300 to £100.  We are supposed to be a music-loving race and, presumably, the Government wish to promote music.  If, however, we are to measure the amount given by the Government as the extent of the interest taken in the development of music in this country it is indeed very small.  I think I am correct in saying <Col N="2173" /> that the wages&mdash;I will not call them salaries&mdash;paid to the professors are extremely low.  The fees paid by the pupils are only £50 a year more than the wages bill of the Academy of Music.  That is a very slender sum on which to keep up a building and pay various other expenses.</P>
      <P>The Irish pupils of the Academy receive an excellent education in music and they earn commendations in many parts of the world.  Under the British régime the grant used to be £300 a year.  That was the grant for a great number of years and it was even then contended that that sum was not adequate.  It rather looks as if our Government have taken the opposite view when they proceed to reduce the sum by one-third.  How are the Academy authorities to cut their coat according to their cloth?  I am afraid they will have to effect economies, probably in a way that the country would least like that economies should be effected.  The Academy authorities take in a number of pupils who are charged a certain scale of fees.  When they find a very promising pupil, whose parents are not able to pay the requisite fee, usually some arrangement is made by which the genius of the pupil would be taken into consideration and developed.</P>
      <P>I would like to urge on the Minister that for the sake of £200 a year he is going to do away with the possibility of a certain number of geniuses being brought to the front in the musical profession. This is a very serious matter. The Academy authorities are paid for conducting examinations at local centres throughout the country, and if they are handicapped to the degree likely to follow this reduction in the grant the examinations in local centres will suffer and the Government will not get the type of examination which was got in the past.  It is a very trifling sum and I would like the Minister to consider the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a reduction in the grant to the Zoological Society of Ireland from £1,000 to £750.  There again economies must be effected in some way.  The Gardens are a credit to this City and they add considerably to our social amenities.  I think Dublin was <Col N="2174" /> one of the first places in which lions were bred in captivity, and it is a very serious position, from this Society's point of view, to have this substantial reduction in the grant.  How are they to carry on?  Are they to reduce the number of hands employed in keeping up the Gardens, or are they to reduce the amount of food for the animals? I believe the lions fast one day a week, and if, at the Minister's wish, they are to fast another day, I can only suggest to the Minister that at the next general election&mdash;there is some doubt as to how near it is&mdash;I hope he will not have to face in the constituencies as well as the clamour of the electors the roars of the poor, hungry lions.</P>

      <P>The speech Deputy Dockrell has just delivered shows how hard, straight and narrow is the path of national retrenchment.  It seems to me that it would be a very good thing, the next time that Deputy McGilligan produces that famous advertisement which he is so very fond of producing here, if Deputy Dockrell would get up in a white sheet and say: &ldquo;The Government is not to blame because when they were trying to make a reduction of over £2,000 or almost more than 20 per cent. of the amount voted in Estimate No. 21, I rose in the House and protested against that economy being made.&rdquo;  I do not wish to go into the merits or demerits of any one of the associations or societies which have been affected by reductions in these grants-in-aid.  I feel if I could place before the House the facts that I have in my possession in regard to each and every one of them it would be instantly admitted that no undoubted hardship would be imposed by any reduction which I propose to make in this Estimate this year.  One of the societies to which Deputy Dockrell referred closed last <Col N="2175" /> year with a very substantial surplus of over 12 times the amount of the present grant and more than four times the amount of the grant last year.  The other society, while it was somewhat straitened in its circumstances as compared with years ago, has recovered a good deal of lost ground.  While I would not like to put myself in the position of having to say that the grant now paid to them is everything that the Government, in happier times, would desire or was at all commensurate with the importance of the work the society is doing, or the efficiency with which that work is being done, nevertheless, this is the maximum amount, taking everything into consideration, that can be allocated for the purpose this year.</P>

      <P>I think it would be only fair, even in the light of an Estimate of this kind, that the Minister should make some short statement of the activities of the particular Department for which this Vote is asked. For instance, there is a gross total sum of £38,000 being asked for for salaries, travelling expenses, incidental expenses, telegrams, telephones, and an appropriation-in-aid of £6,870, giving a net total of £31,292 expenditure for this particular Department. It is a comparatively big Department, as big as some of the Departments about which we hear a great deal more.  I think, especially, in view of the fact that the House these days changes almost yearly, there are a great number of Deputies who do not know, but would like to know, what this is all about.  In introducing this Estimate the Minister should give some statement of the activities of the Department.  The appropriation-in-aid in this case gives the one and only intimation as to the activities of the Department because there you read the proportion of the cost of the annual revision of valuation that has to be paid for by the several counties and cities and that is the only information we have.  It tells us something of the nature of the revision of valuations done.  A great many Deputies would like to know how often these revisions are carried out and under what circumstances.</P>

Apart altogether from that, I think the Deputy <Col N="2177" /> is aware that the general hope is that the Estimates should be disposed of this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I think we ought to economise the time on this, so as to give more time to that Estimate.  The definite object of the Department is to carry out the provisions of the Valuation Acts, and the valuation and revisions of tenements as requested by the local authorities. These, indicating the revision required, are furnished by the rating authorities in each particular area.  The valuation deals with particulars such as rateable hereditaments, railways, tramways, electric lighting, gasworks, water works, factories, etc., and all businesses with new reconstructions, alterations and additions.  In order to carry out this work the valuers are sent to every district in the Free State and an investigation is made into each case in which provision for valuation is requested.  If appeals are made against the valuation fixed upon revision a further visit in each case by the valuer is generally necessary.  If the appellant is still dissatisfied with the result of the first appeal and proceeds further to the Circuit Court the valuer must prepare evidence and appear at the hearing of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1932, the number of tenements dealt with in this way at the annual revision was almost 35,000 and the number of first appeals was over 700. In addition to general appeals against the valuation of property occupied by the Great Northern (Ireland) Railway and the County Donegal Railway, the number of appeals in the Circuit <Col N="2178" /> Court was 57.  As the Deputy is aware, copies of the revised valuation lists are furnished annually to the local rating authority.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the terms of the Vote in this case are almost self-explanatory and that anything that may be lacking therein will be found on pages 91 to 93 of the volume of Estimates.  However, I may say, that the principal services formed by the Ordnance Survey Department are, first of all, the revision of the 1/2500 scale maps on the ground; drawing the revised maps; computing and compiling the revised areas; re-levelling and supplying bench marks to replace those found to be defaced or destroyed; examining the revised plans in all stages; reproducing the MS. plans on zinc plates by Vandyke process; carefully checking proofs of 1&rdquo;, 6&rdquo;, 25&rdquo;, 5-feet and 10-feet scale maps, also proofs of indexes and diagrams.  In addition, the Department prepares and prints, at special prices, maps for schools, and does a considerable amount of special printing work for the Government, in particular the facsimile reproduction of ancient manuscripts.</P>

      <P>There is one matter with regard to this Estimate which causes me a little difficulty and which I would like the Minister to explain, and that is how he reconciles sub-head E with sub-head G.  In sub-head E I see that last year, for materials for facsimile reproduction of ancient manuscripts, it was estimated that £320 worth of material would be required, and that this year only £150 worth of material will be required; but when I look down further I see, under sub-head G, that they expect repayment by the Stationery Office for facsimile reproductions of ancient manuscripts amounting to £1,272 as against £886 last year.  According to that, as far as one can gather from these two items taken together, they are going to receive a very much larger sum from the reproductions they have carried out and, on the other hand, they are going to have a smaller amount of material.  I should like to have that matter made clear by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has said about the cost of these manuscripts, but I approach it from a different angle.  It seems to me that it is rather absurd putting it in under this particular heading.  I suppose the colour process is type or printing, but they have the printing of these ancient manuscripts under the Stationery heading and they have it here under the Ordnance Survey.  However, that is really only a matter as to why it is put in under this particular head and why they are not grouped together.  I should like to ask the Minister how long does he reckon to work around a complete survey of the country; in other words, how long is it since a particular portion of the country was surveyed before?  It was brought to my notice not so long ago&mdash;it may have been made right since&mdash;that a certain portion of the City of Dublin has not been surveyed for the past 25 years.  I should like to ask the Minister is that the greatest delay that has taken place in the country or does it take 50 or 100 years to go around, because if you are 25 years behind since the last Ordnance Survey was taken of a particular area, <Col N="2180" /> that is very little use to people for up-to-date reference.  Could the Minister say how long it takes them to work around the complete survey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney I think the explanation is a simple one.  It should occur almost to any Deputy who read the Estimate.  It is that the amount of work to be done, for which materials will be required for this year, will be less than last year and there is no discrepancy between the reduced figure which appears against Sub-head E in consequence of that and the increased figure which appears under Sub-head G; because in this year the Stationery Office, it is expected, will pay a sum of £1,272 as has been pointed out.  This amount consists of the complete payment for the reproduction of &ldquo;Patrician Documents from the Book of Armagh&rdquo; and balances of payments in respect of the &ldquo;Book of Lecan&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Annals of Lough Cé.&rdquo;  This is for a work, which, it is anticipated, will be carried out this year and the other amount is for work already done.</P>
      <P>On the question of the revision of the survey I may say that prior to 1923 the revision of the 25&rdquo; survey took place by counties which were divided into two lists; those requiring revision, say, every 20 years, and those requiring revision, say, every 40 years.  When the Ordnance Survey was reorganised it was thought that some economy could be secured without involving any very great practical disadvantage if the period between each revision of the survey were lengthened out and, in fact, the average period now is about 25 years.  However, revisions take place more frequently than that in districts where it is thought that more frequent revision is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the explanation was very plain and simple but I am not quite clear about it even after his explanation. If he says that the sum of £1,272 is the repayment for work already done, then that is the sum which was estimated for last year.  Is it then that the Estimate last year was £400 <Col N="2181" /> under the actual work done and that the Estimate was £400 wrong?  That seems to be the Minister's explanation.</P>

I should like to point out to the Deputy that people who had greater experience than we have had of the necessity for the revision of the maps fixed the period for revision at 20 years in certain areas and at 40 years in other areas. When the reorganisation was taking place in 1923, as I have already explained, in order to secure some economy in this service, the period between revisions was extended.  On the point made by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, I should like to say that what I have said in regard to 1933-34 applies to 1932-33.</P>

The grant, cut down as it has been this year by £448,000, is causing very grave inconvenience, to say the very least of it, to the agricultural community.  Something less than two years ago, when things were nothing like as pressing on the agricultural community as they are at present, the last Administration considered it necessary that the agricultural grant should be increased by £750,000.  At that time the present Minister and his Party were very strong that this sum of £750,000 was not at all sufficient, that it should be much greater.  The needs of the ratepayers were such and their condition then was such that it was necessary that a much larger sum than £750,000 should be made available for the relief of the agricultural ratepayers, and they suggested £1,000,000.  In last year's Budget the Minister increased the £750,000 to £1,000,000.  This year we find, however, that there has been a going back upon that policy, that while they may have kept their promise to make £1,000,000 available it was a mere keeping of the promise in form, because when it is said that there is going to be a grant in aid of the rates of £1,000,000 that does not mean that it is a grant for one particular year or for one particular season.  It is taken by everyone in the country to be a permanent condition of affairs, a lasting policy on the part of the Executive Council.  I am going to leave out now, because I think, sir, you would probaly rule them as irrelevant, such matters as promises which were made that entire relief of rates would be given.  I do not deal with that particular undertaking given by the present Administration. I do, however, deal with this undertaking: that the agricultural <Col N="2183" /> grant was to remain precisely as it was, and we now discover that it is being cut down by £448,000.  That is the policy of the present Administration, that instead of assisting the ratepayers who are agriculturists by a grant equal to last year's, at any rate, they are going to have this very large sum indeed added to their rates.</P>
      <P>There has been a cutting down of the agricultural grant.  One would naturally say that the grant has been cut down because the needs of the people are less; that the people are in a condition now to pay higher rates than last year, because they are in a better condition.  That is what one would expect.  That seems to me, at any rate, to be the only justification which the Government could put forward. But, that is completely and entirely at variance with the known facts of the situation.  I am not in any way exaggerating, I am putting the case, I think, very temperately indeed, when I say that at present Irish agriculture is passing through a worse time, and Irish farmers, especially small farmers, are at present in a condition worse than they have been since what used to be known as the bad times&mdash;since 1879 and 1880.  In this particular year, when it is impossible for the ordinary farmer to get ready money to supply himself and his family with the necessities of life, the Government comes along and says: &ldquo;In addition to the other burdens which we have put upon your shoulders this year by our policy we are going to place something heavier on your back, in case you have not a heavy enough load upon your back; we are going to put this extra sum of rates upon you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is more than that in this. This is not an ordinary year for rates. All over the country rates must increase.  It is within the knowledge of every country Deputy, and if it is not within the knowledge of the Executive Council, then it is because the Executive Council are deliberately closing their ears and shutting their eyes, refusing to hear what they do not like, and to see what they do not care to see, that the number of persons <Col N="2184" /> going upon home assistance is vastly greater than it has been.</P>
    <P>I know in my own constituency that that is so, and I know it is worse in other constituencies.  I know there are people at the present moment looking and fighting for home assistance who a few years ago would have considered it the greatest possible degradation to them that they had to go and receive charitable assistance. After all our people were a proud people.  Individually they were a proud people, proud men and proud women.  They were anxious to earn their own livelihood by their own hands, and they hated any single neighbour of theirs to think that they had been forced to go on outdoor relief.  Indeed that spirit may have gone a little too far.  There may have been people that really ought to have received outdoor relief in other years who refused to accept it, but it was a manifestation of a fine manly spirit in our people.  The policy of the Government is fast breaking down that manly spirit and that manly feeling.  I do think that, when the history of those last two years comes to be written, every historian of this country will agree that it has not been so much the material injury that this Government has done to the people of this State that really counts, terrible as that material injury has been. What will be laid most at the Government's door is the demoralisation which they have brought upon the people of this State.  Now it has ceased to be, as one knows, anything to be ashamed of, or anything that one wishes to keep hidden from one's neighbours, all over the country, that one is receiving home assistance.  The old proud spirit is broken.  The number of persons who are going upon home assistance all over the State is increasing daily, and during this coming winter it will increase more and more.  In consequence of that, the rates in every single county of this State will have to be enormously increased during the coming year. Supplementary estimates, and borrowing from their treasurers, will have to be the policy of our county councils, or else there will be poverty, amounting <Col N="2185" /> in certain cases to starvation, to be endured by the necessitous in the country.</P>
    <P>This year anybody looking forward when those Estimates were framed must have foreseen and must have known that there would be this increase in Home Assistance, and that the rates would press more heavily upon the people this year than last year, or in any year since the Irish Free State was established.  The Minister must have had that knowledge, because everybody else in the State had that knowledge, and because from these benches the Minister was again and again warned of the state of affairs which he and his Government were producing in this country. He must have foreseen that the rates would be heavier this year, and that the ratepayers would be in a worse condition this year to pay them, and yet this is the year in which the Minister thinks it right and proper that the burden on the poor rate should not be lessened by the ordinary assistance which the Government gave in other years to the ratepayer.  If there is one policy which it seems to me this Government should pursue during the present state of affairs it is to lessen the burdens upon the agricultural ratepayer and upon the agricultural community, and to make the things which are necessaries of life available to the ordinary ratepayer as cheaply as possible.  Every single thing that this Government has done, this deliberate attack which the Government is making upon the really poor people of this country, every single bit of its policy is going to increase the amount of Home Assistance that will be required.</P>
    <P>I am not going through the whole of the Government policy, nor pointing out how the Government policy is going to make the increase on rates higher than in any other year, but I will just point out one particular item of Government policy which must have its reaction upon the amount of Home Assistance which will be required in this State.  The main staple food of the poor people in this State, especially during the summer <Col N="2186" /> months, must be flour.  If you have dear flour, then you are going to have more people in receipt of Home Assistance than if you had flour at a cheaper price.</P>
    <P>What is the effect of the Government's policy upon flour?  It is that the price of flour is 50 per cent. higher in this State than it is in Northern Ireland.  In other words you will buy three bags of flour in Northern Ireland for the price of two bags of flour here in this State.  If you continue a policy of that nature it must drive under water the persons who are barely able to keep their heads above water at the moment. They must seek home assistance to keep them up.  Therefore, when you have a general policy which is impoverishing the people on the one hand, and on the other hand is making the necessaries of life intolerably dear for the people, Home Assistance must increase enormously.  That is the year in which the Government, instead of cutting down the amount of the agricultural grant, should sweep away the poor rate altogether by making an agricultural grant equal to the entire amount of the poor rate.  Instead of taking the course which a sense of duty should have directed them to take in relief of the ratepayers of the State they have taken the very opposite course.  Therefore, in my opinion at any rate, in introducing this Estimate they are most highly blameworthy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney says that the Government has been guilty of a great injustice in reducing this Grant in present circumstances. They certainly have been: I thoroughly agree with him.  He also, I gather, thinks that the reduction is going to cause great hardship upon the bulk of the ratepayers.  I am not so certain of that, because I have the very gravest doubts as to whether the bulk of the ratepayers will pay their rates.  I have said that here before, but I have always refused to advise people not to pay their rates.  I invite the Minister to inform himself as regards that matter and to get the best evidence he can procure.  I think the sooner he realises the truth the better.  The great bulk of the ratepayers <Col N="2187" /> in this country will not be able to pay their rates during the current year.  Consequently, I think the Minister will be called upon in the end to produce a very much larger estimate than is now before us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this Estimate.  I want to oppose this reduction of £500,000 in the grant in rates to the agricultural community. The Minister is aware that the county homes are full; that the question of home help is one which is pressing severely on the county councils as a body and on the boards of health as their subsidiaries; that the situation is so appalling at the moment that the local bodies do not know how or where they are to get means to carry on. The county councils struck a rate, and at no time prior to the general election or prior to the rate being struck, was any indication given that there was going to be a deduction in the agricultural grant.  It makes an appalling difference to any local authority to strike a rate and then to discover like the Kildare County Council, for instance, that £11,000 was to be taken off them in the matter of the grant.  When the House was heatedly discussing the £1,500,000 that was going to America in repayment of the Republican Loan, I indicated as far as I could, that this was not the time for money to go out of this country.  We find when the agricultural community is almost prostrate with financial depression and financial stringency, that this is the time in which £500,000 is to be taken off them.  I would have liked to have heard Deputy MacDermot refer to that a few nights ago.  I would have liked to have heard Deputy Norton refer to it when deductions and the slashing and cutting of wages and all these other things that go with the present hardships and with the present conditions were being discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are sending away £1,500,000 for these Republican Bonds, and at the same time this £500,000 that should go as aid to the farmers is being withheld. This half a million grant is being deducted.  In fact, it is like a reduction <Col N="2188" /> in medical aid and in hospital help to the soldiers who are fighting a hard battle.  We hear talk about the economic war and about the soldiers in the front line trenches.  We hear of depressed conditions all over the country, and here we are dealing with an Estimate which is cutting away and keeping away half a million of money from the farmers.</P>
    <P>I repeat again that at no time was any indication given that this deduction was going to be made.  When the county councils struck that rate they had no idea of the sort of encouragement and help the Government were about to offer them to collect the rates.  The farmers are to march along in this great national war and the encouragement they get to do their job well is to be told by the Minister for Finance that, approximately, half a million of money is to be withheld from them.  This time of financial stringency is not the time when the farmers should be treated in that way.  No matter what the conditions are or what are the means of winning this war, no matter how long it is to last, we have the situation that instead of inspiring them with courage and pluck the Government is doing everything to demoralise the farmers and to knock the punch and the pluck out of them. The Government is knocking the fight out of them.  The farmers are becoming demoralised more quickly and sooner than anybody here in the City of Dublin can realise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this particular Estimate I wonder in which mood is the Minister to-night&mdash;is it a mood of jubilation or a lachrymose mood?  Within the last couple of months we have had the experience, every second week, of the Minister coming in here and one week telling us that the Revenue was never so buoyant; that the country was never so prosperous, and that there is money in plenty for all.  We have him coming in the next week telling us that we are up against it; that we are in sight of the last penny and that except everyone tightens his belt and everyone lives a little bit closer the country cannot carry on.  I presume it is the latter <Col N="2189" /> tune we will hear to-night.  We are confronted with this Estimate this year in the face of the economic war; in a year when farmers are being robbed of their market; in a year when the prices of agricultural produce have fallen to rock bottom.  That is the time that is chosen by the Government to reduce the agricultural grant by approximately £500,000.  That action is being taken by a Government that just a few short months ago preached to the farmers that their policy was to reduce overhead charges on agriculture.</P>
      <P>Now and then from the Government front benches we hear noisy arguments about mandates, about what the country voted for, and we hear references to the fact that the hands of the Government are tied because a certain policy was put before the country and that that policy obtained a majority vote.  I submit that, more clearly than any other policy, what Fianna Fáil put before the country was the necessity for reducing overhead charges on agriculture, and I submit that if Fianna Fáil has a mandate for anything more than for any other thing, it is a mandate to reduce overhead charges on agricultural land.  Yet to-night we have this Vote reducing the agricultural grant by £448,000.  I should like to know what is the case made for that deduction.  Why is this year chosen for it?  Is it because there is a shortage of money?  If the agricultural community in this country in this year is to be deprived of £500,000 because the money is not there, why was this particular year suggested to repay over £1,000,000 Internal Loan and to give a grant of £100,000 to the <i>Irish Press</i>? When that Bill was introduced we heard nothing about the shortage of money; we heard nothing about the difficulties in revenue and about the necessity of economies.  But when it comes to the case of the ordinary Irish farmer his grant must be reduced by half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy MacDermot said, the grant is to be reduced in a year when there is every indication that the rates are likely to go up.  There is every stimulus from the Government itself to increase the rate of progress in <Col N="2190" /> building schemes.  With this I think all parties agree, but every one of those schemes will necessitate an increase in rates.  Every sewerage scheme and every scheme of water works will mean an increase in rates. There would be acute difficulty in getting in the agricultural rates this year if this grant had remained at the same figure as last year.  Even with the grant as it stood last year I, for one, doubt if the agricultural rate or any considerable proportion of the agricultural rate, could have been collected. But here we have the Government halving the grant towards the relief of rates and expecting the rate to be paid.  That, to my mind, is expecting the impossible.  I should like to know, apropos of the singling out of the farmers for the reduction of their grants, exactly at what period in the history of this country did the farmers become the enemies of the country and the enemies of the people. We have every indication for the last two years that the greatest crime that could be committed in this country is for a farmer to make good, for a farmer to succeed in his business or for a farmer to extend his holding.</P>
    <P>We have the farmers deliberately picked out for a little Fianna Fáil vendetta and the harder they work and the more successful they are, the more bitterly and harshly they are to receive the lash of the Fianna Fáil Government.  At what stage in our history did the farmers become the enemies of the country?  When did they become people to be treated as enemies, people to be robbed of their markets and the title to their land stolen from them, people to be deprived of anything in the way of a grant? Why is such a year, when the farmers are going through it more than any other class of the community, chosen for this particular action?  It is easy enough to smile at a case made.  It is very easy to smile at a taxpayers' burden if an individual does not pay taxes himself.  It is very easy from an atmosphere such as this to make little of the plight of the farmer; but the fact of the matter is that, even with the grants they had heretofore, no farmer <Col N="2191" /> could carry on in the face of existing prices.  When the Minister for Finance was looking for votes in County Dublin he was aware of that and the promise he and everyone of his comrades made was that it would be their policy to reduce the overhead charges on agriculture. That stared at us in black and white from every dead wall in the country.  You got support for that; you got a majority vote behind that; you got a mandate for that and you should treat that mandate with the same kind of respect as you treat other so-called mandates.</P>
    <P>This year, as I said, is likely to see a vastly increased rate.  Destitution is increasing; unemployment is increasing; home help is doubling itself with every Board of Health in the country. Other expenditure is being increased. There is more and more of a call on the rates and the rates must go up. The capacity of the farmers to pay the rates has admittedly gone down very considerably and on top of that comes the proposal to reduce the grant which would relieve the rates&mdash;a proposal for which there can be no reasonable defence.  This question has been discussed on many occasions under different headings in this House, but nobody from the Government Front Bench has ever yet attempted to make a case why, in this particular year, with things as they are, the farmer is better able to pay his rates than he was in recent years.  I will be interested to hear what particular case the Minister for Finance is going to make.  If he can make no other case let him, after last week's exhibition, keep away from the case of the shortage of money and the necessity for bolstering up the revenue.  I would say, if the choice has to be taken, that it is far more important to bolster up the agricultural industry than it is to bolster up the finances of any political newspaper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to enter a strong protest against the withdrawal of £448,000 from the agricultural grant.  I do not believe there was any year in the last half a century when the withdrawal of such an amount could have such a disastrous <Col N="2192" /> effect on the farmers.  The amount of money the Government expect to collect in the way of rates is, to my mind, far more than the farmers will be able to pay.  To add to their burden comes this proposal of the withdrawal of almost half a million from the agricultural grant.  There is bound to be great hardship if they have to meet even part of their obligations.  The rates during the coming year will be increased to such an extent that no farmer will be able to pay them, with the result that local services will be carried on only under the greatest difficulty.  Conditions were never so bad, and it is too much to expect the farming community to face a rate increased by 1/6 or 1/8 in the £.  I am not one to advise the farmers to refuse to meet their liabilities, but I certainly am aware of existing conditions, and I am convinced that the farmers will not be able to pay their rates simply because they have not the money.</P>

      <P>The reduction in the agricultural grant of £448,000 will mean that the ratepayers in Mayo will be placed in such a position that they will not be able to pay rent or rates.  Up to the time Fianna Fáil came into power the people in Co. Mayo always paid their rent and rates promptly. Now, when £448,000 will be taken off the agricultural grant, the rate will be increased in Mayo by 1/9 in the £, and the result is that the farmers will pay neither rent nor rates, not because they do not want to pay them, but because they will not be able to pay them.  All this is due to the policy of the Government.  I do not want to discuss the economic policy, because that was thrashed out here time and again. The fact is that the people cannot sell cattle, sheep or pigs and, as far as butter is concerned, they can get no sale for that either.  We all know what the farmers get for eggs at the moment.  The result of the whole thing is that the Minister can count on the people in Mayo not paying their rent or rates because they have not the money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Estimate is presented, the reduction which takes <Col N="2193" /> place in the agricultural grant is in respect of £599,011 voted by the Dáil as far back as 1926.  There is no interference with the additional supplementary agricultural grant of £750,000 voted for the first time in 1931, nor with the sum of £250,000 voted for the first time last year in pursuance of the policy which had been announced by the Government, which was then in Opposition, so that their supporters throughout the country can say that they did not reduce the £1,000,000 grant which they said was necessary for the assistance of agriculture in the difficult times through which we were passing.  The form in which the Estimate is presented, as was mentioned by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, is that the Government cannot be taxed with having interfered with the £1,000,000 which they declared was necessary to relieve rates during the last year or two.  They go back to 1926 to find a sum which was then voted and paid since to relieve the rates of agriculturists.  One would imagine that in a case like this some examination would be made of how the economy of agriculture stands at the present moment, whether the prices of agricultural products, eggs, butter, poultry, pigs, cattle, sheep or horses which made up the revenue from which the wealth of agriculture is derived could stand this extra burden this year.  It may be said that 1/4 in the £ is a small sum.  That depends altogether upon the capacity of the person in question to meet it.  Any examination which could be made of the results, or the fruits rather of the agricultural industry during the last 12 months would show any reasonable-minded person that the farming community could not afford such a reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of those particular holdings where employment is given, and where perhaps the loss during the last few months may be relatively greater than in the smaller holdings, employment must suffer.  It is not good policy, in a case like that, to interfere with any employment given.  People who have a certain number of employees engaged regularly during the last few years dislike very much to have to let <Col N="2194" /> them go.  But there is an inexorable law in connection with dealings of that kind in agriculture, as well as in other matters.  If money is not there to meet the outgoings there must be some economic effort in order to enable one to pay his way.  It is in that connection, I think, the greater mistake is made by the Government in selecting this particular year for such a huge reduction.</P>
    <P>The Press accounts of the number of persons in receipt of home assistance show a remarkable increase for the last year.  It could not be but that there would be an increase.  We cannot afford such a big drop in the exports of agricultural produce and consequently in sales effected in this country.  In the case of exports the figures are at once discernible, but in the case of goods sold in the country one is afforded no opportunity of estimating what the loss in revenue from agriculture is at this particular time. This year the Department of Agriculture sent out some messages to the farmers drawing their attention to the necessity for buying manures.  Less manures were bought this year than in other years.  The result of that policy means less production, and, consequently, less capacity to meet the additional burdens or to meet the burdens involved in all the circumstances of the case.  The Minister for Agriculture, in addressing himself to the subject of farming the other day, said that if the farmer dealing with purposes other than his own, is in any way unable to make farming pay they were providing other means; they would give them bonds which would earn money, and that would relieve them of the holding of their farms. He went on to say in Claremorris on 9th June that the Government were well aware of the difficulties of the times; that the farmers were hard pressed; that labourers found it difficult to get employment; that shopkeepers found it hard to collect their debts.  The same Minister, as a member of the Executive Council, is collectively responsible with other Ministers for this reduction in this relief which ought to go and which should go to the farmers of the country and <Col N="2195" /> which they are legally and morally entitled to get.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Bill which passed through the Dáil last week.  The Minister will probably say that the sum for which this country is liable under that measure will be a funded amount; it will not be paid in this year.  The cash will be paid probably, but the liability will be spread over a number of years.  That is not the point.  The point is, in all the circumstances, if one were to consider the question of charity, whether those at home are not deserving of our charity as well as those who are abroad.  We have not been asked for this particular money in this year.  It is a question of being called upon to pay, and we are prepared to bear our responsibility in that connection.  But if our main industry this particular year is not in a condition to bear, and does not want such a huge impost being placed upon it, then I think we are entitled in honour and morality and in Christian charity to take into consideration the difficulties of the times.  And the times were never more difficult than at the present moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not lightly get up in the West of Ireland and say: &ldquo;We know anyway of the conditions of affairs in the country.&rdquo;  Even if last March or April it was thought that this particular saving had to be effected this year, now, in the changed circumstances of the times, the Executive Council should consider those changed circumstances.</P>
    <P>Speaking in this place, some four or five weeks ago, the Minister for Agriculture read out a question which had been put to the Minister for Agriculture in Great Britain regarding the prices of fat cattle, and the price was down by something like 9/- per cwt. on last year.  The Minister is, no doubt, aware that the price of fat cattle is down here in this country by much more than 9/-, possibly 20/-, on last year, and cattle are the principal products of our agriculture.  There were times when the export of cattle from this country amounted to much more <Col N="2196" /> than one-third of our agricultural exports, and consequently, taking the average one should expect that form of export accounted for more than one-third of the revenue from agriculture. If the price be down so much as that, surely that is a consideration that the Minister ought to bring to bear upon the Executive Council in assuring them that agriculture at the present moment is unequal to the present rates and the other expenditure and outgoings it has to meet.  The rates this year are higher, generally speaking, than last year, and they are higher by reason of the fact that there is greater need for assisting people in their homes than there was this time 12 months.  The difficulty of collection will, no doubt, arise during the year.  I hope not.  I hope there will be better times and better prices and greater profits and greater ease in the discharge of those obligations and others than we have had experience of in the last 12 months.  But we cannot live entirely upon hopes.  We ought to be able to see some possible change before being able to do so.  The Government are in the best possible position to examine all these real necessities of the farmers and to help them by restoring the agricultural grant to what it was last year.</P>

      <P>Dealing with this matter I would like, if possible, that the few deluded farmers and farm labourers of County Dublin that voted for the Minister for Finance at the last election were here to see his indifferent sneer when the last speaker was addressing the House.  The time will come, and perhaps it may not be long, when he will have to face the realities, not of his previous tub-thumping at the crossroads of County Dublin, but to face a maddened and deluded electorate whose suffrage he got at the last election by false promises.  I, as a farmer here, do not get up to speak for a dole for farmers.  Properly speaking, I believe that farmers have got too many doles or are expecting too many doles. They should get fair play and a free market&mdash;a reward for their labour&mdash;and the man who does not work let him get out.  When I say that I mean it, and I hope, if there is one farmer with <Col N="2197" /> honesty and intelligence on the opposite benches, that he will get up and make a case for Government policy. Let him tell this House how a farmer can make his business pay at the present time and pay any wage.  I am not the type of farmer that looks across a ranch with field glasses.  I did my apprenticeship at the handles of a plough.  There is no work on land that I did not do, and I did not look to the Land Commission or to anyone else to give me a farm.  I went into the open market to buy a farm and I bought it with the money I earned myself.  I have more land under the plough probably than any farmer in the Free State and I pay as high wages, if not higher wages, than any farmer in the Free State.  I know the farmers had to sell early potatoes last Saturday at £4 a ton.  I am sorry that the Labour Benches are empty with the exception of one solitary occupant.  They are the people who are responsible for the reduction of wages in this country&mdash;the Labour Party who allied themselves to Fianna Fáil and to the Fianna Fáil Government policy for the last year and a half, which, inevitably, led to the reduction of wages and to the ultimate bankruptcy of this country.  When this policy was adopted about a year ago, we had the Deputy Minister for Agriculture getting up in this House and saying: &ldquo;Now we will have cheap food.&rdquo;  But he produced no food.  We had another Minister getting up and saying: &ldquo;We are going to make this an industrial country.&rdquo;  He said that at the same time that the market for industry is deprived of its purchasing power and our export market cut away.</P>

    <P>I will give a classical example of a case put to me over the week-end by a farmer down the country.  He said:&mdash;&ldquo;I had a number of lambs, and last week a butcher from the town&rdquo;&mdash;and I am glad that there is a Deputy here from near that town, and when I mention the name of the town I invite him to contradict me; that town is the town of Longford. &ldquo;The butcher from the town came out, and out of a number of lambs he selected ten and he gave me £7 for them.  I bought a new mowing-machine this year&mdash;a Pierce&mdash;and I <Col N="2198" /> gave £21 for it.  Two years ago I could buy that mowing-machine for about the same price, if not cheaper, but I got £2 apiece for my lambs. It would be as cheap two years ago for me to give £60 for a mowing-machine as it is to give £21 to-day. In other words, the manufactured article that I could buy with about ten lambs three years ago I have to give 21 lambs for it now.&rdquo;  That is the position into which the main industry of the country has been brought.  There is no reduction in the price of the manufactured goods, and who is to buy the manufactured goods?  I was in Ennis three or four weeks ago when a manufacturer there at a public meeting stated:&mdash;&ldquo;There is no trouble in parting with goods but there is terrible trouble in getting paid for them.&rdquo;  The money is not in the country, and the Government is choosing this time to reduce what was not a grant but what, in equity, belonged to agriculture.  This is being done in an agricultural country by a Party that boasted, before the last Election, that it had 25 or 40 farmer Deputies but which did not consider that one of these farmer Deputies in this agricultural country was fit to occupy a position on the Front Bench.  That is what Fianna Fáil thinks of the farmers and of the farmer Deputies who were elected to this Party by a machine.</P>
    <P>At this time, when our market has been taken from us, we are up against a situation in agriculture which should be met by a Government that, if it had the competency and the honesty to do so, should have met it; but, instead, it has broken its promises&mdash;promises made by the Minister for Finance on the 15th August, 1931, in the town of Monaghan, with President de Valera standing on the platform with him, and the Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, also with him&mdash;promises made by the Minister for Education in a series of letters in the &ldquo;Carlow Nationalist&rdquo; in 1930 and 1931 to derate agricultural land, without a single word of depriving agriculture of its market.  They are getting certain farmers around the country, many of whom I know have forgotten when <Col N="2199" /> they paid the last annuities or rates, saying that half the annuities are better than the remission of the whole of the rates.  We have a fictitious Farmers' Organisation promoted by a barrister and an R.I.C. pensioner, and every week they have something in the daily Press about the farmers' position. They get columns in the <i>Irish Press</i>, and they send out this dope to all the provincial Press, in the name of the farmers, <i>mar eadh</i>, and that Farmers' Organisation has been promoted by the Ministers.  It was first established by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he was Deputy Lemass. What is the position to which agriculture has been brought by the present Administration?  I hope the Minister when replying will not work himself into the usual hysteria, but that he will answer a straight question in a straight, calm way.</P>

      <P>There would be very little hysteria about the Minister if he was looking for his income from the produce of the plough.  There would be very little floating into the clouds by the Front Bench opposite if, instead of the Bar, the stethoscope, and the high falutin nonsense appealing to the imagination of the youth, to make a living out of politics, out of law, or out of medicine, they had to go and work agriculture in this agricultural country themselves.  They would then know how to govern us. But men who have never turned a shilling in agriculture do not know how to manage an agricultural business, and the government of this country is a first-class agricultural business.  At present there is no danger of any farmer working himself into hysteria, except the hysteria of despair, and many of them would be excused for working themselves into <Col N="2200" /> that hysteria if they saw the antics of the Ministers in this House and of the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men behind them.  When, with a flourish of trumpets, we were told that the Government would not pay tribute to England in the shape of the land annuities, they promised the country unequivocally that from that date all that money would be used for the benefit of agriculture by derating agriculture.  I challenge any Deputy or Minister on the opposite benches to contradict that statement.  Some of them went as far as to say that no annuities would be paid.  What happened?  When the Government refused to pay the annuities the British Government started collecting them and are collecting them still. They are collecting them from the agricultural produce sent over to England.  The British Government are getting these annuities and the farmer is paying more than the annuities.  He is paying £2,000,000 more than the annuities.  He is paying more than his annuity and his rates put together.  What did the Minister for Finance do?  He collected the taxation to build up the £2,000,000 that went to pay the British Government for local loans and pensions, and that was put into a Suspense Account. The land annuities were also put into the Suspense Account and he had then close on £5,000,000.  That money was normally to pay a debt that the farmer had to pay through the tariffs which England imposed.</P>
      <P>When the farmer paid that debt to England which was a Government liability, that money in the Suspense Account that the Government held should go of right to the benefit of agriculture and to meet the entire annuities and rates on agricultural land. But it did not.  The Minister and his colleagues are either so stupid or dishonest that they go to the country and tell the people: &ldquo;We are going to give you relief of half the annuities,&rdquo; while the people are already paying twice the annuities to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is another sleight-of-hand trick of the Minister since his Party came into office.  I went over in detail on another matter last week the history <Col N="2201" /> of the agricultural grant.  I am not going to go over it in such detail now, although it might be no harm to teach the Minister something he does not know.  That smile that just beamed across his lovely face if it appeared in the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> or the <i>Leinster Leader</i> would be worth a terrible lot in election times, but not to the Minister.  Originally, the agricultural grant was a right of tenancy that our predecessors in the occupation of the land made with the landlords. The original agricultural grant was a burden which the Government of the day took on itself to meet what was hitherto a landlord's liability.  It was standardised by the Local Government Act of 1898 at half the rates for that year.</P>

When people acquire bad habits, it is hard for them to get out of them.  The time will come, however, when they will be taught good habits, and that time is fast approaching.  The way to win a fight is not to run away from it, and the Minister has been an adept at running away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1931 I heard the Minister in this House become furiously eloquent over the condition of agriculture.  Nothing short of one million pounds immediate relief to agriculture could save agriculture from ruin then.  £750,000 was given by the late Minister for Finance.  That was given by the imposition of taxes.  When the Minister took office in 1932, with a flourish as to what he was doing for agriculture, he increased it by £250,000.  How did he increase it? <Col N="2202" /> The previous year those taxes that were imposed to give £750,000 were only producing for nine or ten months, and they only produced roughly about £750,000 or £800,000.  In the natural course of events those taxes would be producing over one million pounds the following year; that is in a complete 12 months.  The product of those taxes would give a million for the agricultural grant and leave a little residue with the Exchequer as well.  So that all the Minister did was to give the same grant as his predecessor had given, plus the extra two or three months' produce of the taxation imposed by his predecessor to help agriculture.  Although the Minister this year reduces the agricultural grant by £448,000, he has not reduced that taxation that was imposed to give £750,000 in nine months, and which would produce over one million pounds in the 12 months.  The taxation remains, and the grandiose schemes of the Minister when out of office to relieve agriculture have disappeared, just as his plan to reduce national taxation by two million pounds has disappeared.  This is a period of stress for the main industry of the country, when the value of arable land and the value of all crops has been reduced for want of a market.  It might be interesting to tell the Minister that despite the tariffs on feeding stuffs, and despite this admixture of grain which was going to give us inflated prices for corn, good oats is unsaleable now at 7/6 a barrel.  We were told a couple of weeks ago here: &ldquo;Look at England. Look at Scotland&mdash;8/6 and 9/- a barrel for oats.&rdquo;  At 7/6 a barrel it cannot be sold here now.  If the Minister or his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, can tell us where there is a market now I will deliver to him in the next four weeks 400 tons of potatoes at £4 a ton.  Can he tell me where there is a market?  He cannot, because he has ruined the market.  With pig-feeding potatoes I will have to do the same as I did last year&mdash;throw them in the ditch.  I have been employing men who went out and voted for the Minister, and he has taken the bread off my men's table by his policy.  The agricultural <Col N="2203" /> labourers in County Dublin were fooled by the Minister and his satellites with wild promises that never fructified.  He has taken the bread off their table by his policy.  Let him name a market for potatoes now, and we in County Dublin will glut that market.</P>

      <P>While prices are so low and while wages are unobtainable in agriculture, we have Deputies and Ministers of the Government going out and saying: &ldquo;We know people who have reduced wages since this Government came in, and we will know how to deal with them.&rdquo;  I have reduced them, and I invite the Front Bench to deal with me.  I reduced them, and I will reduce them further, because the price I can pay my men is regulated by the price I get in the market, and that market price has been regulated by the Minister.  It is time that the working man used a little intelligence, and put his finger on the sore spot.  If we in this country do not make up our minds to put people on the Front Bench who have run a business and run it successfully in this country we are going to run this country on the rocks.  People who never handled business cannot handle the intricate and important business of governing this country.  I wonder has all this been a studied plan to reduce the value of land so that they can come along with a confiscatory Bill when the market prices of land are reduced to nothing, or is it incompetence?  It must be either incompetence or a deliberate policy to ruin the country.  We were rushed into an alleged war which took from us our market, and we have never been told without equivocation what the issues in that war are.  Any man with commonsense objects to being dragged along at the chariot wheels of President de Valera.  When he puts on his hat his house is thatched and if he took a handbag and left this country in the morning it would not cost him a penny.  For people who have to live their lives in the country it is a very different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Front Bench opposite asks what is going to happen to the 25,000 or 30,000 men and women that every year are coming to the age of manhood and womanhood.  What is going to happen <Col N="2205" /> to them?  No matter what they will turn their hands to they cannot make it pay.  What is to happen to them? For fear they would get anything out of it, the relief that was considered necessary for agriculture before the market was lost has now been taken away by the Government, the members of which urged that relief was necessary before the market was lost.  And what have they substituted for it?  They raided the fund and they took £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 out of it and they went out and made paupers of the small farmers and their sons throughout the country in order to win an election.  They made the farmer and his sons who never registered at a labour exchange go and register there, and they worked there during the general election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The agricultural grant totalling £1,750,000 for the current year is entirely inadequate to meet the situation.  The result will be when the sheriff and the Guards and, perhaps, the military go round that no rates will be paid at all.  They will not be paid because the money is not there to pay them.  We had an examination of our rate collectors in the County Dublin just before the close of our financial year.  One rate collector said: &ldquo;I went to a farmer who owed me about £30 in rates, and what do you think he told me?  He said &lsquo;There are three bullocks there and you can take them for the rates.&rsquo;&rdquo;  I asked the rate collector: &ldquo;Did you take them?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;no, what good are they to me?&rdquo;  I then said: &ldquo;What good are they to the farmer?  He can only pay the rates by cashing these bullocks, and as you cannot cash them, how is the farmer to cash them?&rdquo;  How is the farmer to give money to the county councils if he cannot cash his stock? The Minister and the Government will find that the greatest empty formula they ever struck was the mandamus order they made against us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that what applies to agriculture in Dublin applies with greater force to the rest of the country, because agriculturists in Dublin, being near the market here, can cash most commodities even though the cash is not adequate.  We can turn our produce into some sort of money, but down the country the farmers cannot turn their stock or produce into any sort of money.  If it is impossible to find rates in the County Dublin, the position is ten times more impossible down the country.  It is ten times more difficult to find the rates there.  The ability of the farmers to pay is the test of the whole situation.  On the admission of the Deputies opposite, with a good market, with higher prices, with lower rates and the same annuities, with general world conditions for agricultural produce slightly better than they are now, the farmers could not pay.  A depreciated world market, reduced by a 40 per cent. tariff &mdash;a market for stock two years old and upwards almost annihilated because of the extra high tariff&mdash;makes it practically impossible to find money in the country.  This is the time chosen by the Government to reduce the Agricultural Grant instead of giving the farmers what was definitely promised to them&mdash;complete de-rating. After causing a situation where the farmers have to pay their annuities twice, this is the time chosen by the Minister to reduce the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry I have not here by me the circular which was addressed to <Col N="2208" /> the county councils by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  In that circular he coolly stated that, owing to the other benefits given by the Government to the farmers in the last twelve months they could afford, in fact, a reduction in the Agricultural Grant, and that even after that reduction they would still be better off.  I would like to hear the Minister for Finance in his best classical style dealing with that and showing how agriculture is better off now than when he and his colleagues took office.  I heard it summed up this afternoon in this way by a farmer: he said the only way to raise the price of stock would be if a discriminating Providence last week in that thunderstorm had killed half the stock it would mean that we would not be one bob worse off.  No farmer would be worse off because the price he would get for the remainder of the stock would be as much as he will now get for the whole of it.  We are coming to the time when the only way of disposing of agricultural produce is to do what is done in America. There when they have a bumper crop of cotton or wheat they destroy portion of it so that they might get better prices for the remainder.  This is what we are coming to here, because we have been deprived of our market at the other side 60 miles from these shores.  We have been deprived of a market, not by foreigners, not by the Saxons, but by our own elected representatives&mdash;elected on false pretences&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There has been no attempt made to prove this.  We get wild statements and platitudes.  We want to get down <Col N="2209" /> to business.

They will be found out and there will be a terrible day of reckoning for it.  People are not going to starve in this country.  The working farmers who, through their industry, have built themselves up, are not going to be ruined at the whims of Ministers who never built themselves up in industry.  It is time we faced facts and it is time that we called a spade a spade.  It is time that Ministers disclosed their mentality as to whether they want to ruin this country or whether they do not.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am afraid, is watching lest I should go back into ancient history.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;their farms would be very little good to them.  After all the schemes we have had, everybody knows that agricultural produce in this country since we lost our markets does not pay the cost of production.  Everybody who is not wilfully blind or wilfully stupid knows that.  It is staring <Col N="2210" /> him in the face every day.  Yet this is the time that is chosen for reducing grants.  What case is there for reducing grants this year that cannot be urged with greater force next year, when the cumulative effect of this policy will be felt more acutely than it is to-day?  Think, again, that you have 25,000 or 30,000 more looking for a living in this country because the foreign country is closed to them.  No matter what they turn to, they cannot make a living.  Any man who is reputed to be able to give a day's work, day after day, has to turn dozens away who are looking for work at any price.</P>
      <P>I must say that I have to agree with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that they would take gladly 24/- or 21/- a week.  They would take anything that would keep body and soul together if they could get it.  That is the position to which we are reduced by the policy of the present Government.  The labour market is such that the Union expenditure is going up week after week.  The bottom is put out of the market; the purchasing power of the worker is diminishing and the price paid to the consumer must diminish accordingly. It all arises from the one source&mdash;bad administration and bad government. Next year we shall probably be discussing even a smaller estimate because there will be nothing left in the exchequer to pay an agricultural grant.  Then perhaps we shall wake up.</P>

They reduced the agricultural grant at a time when the farmers were justifiably expecting that the Government would redeem their promises and give complete derating. I can claim to speak on behalf of agriculture as well as any man in the Free State.  If I want to address an agricultural meeting in any county in the Free State&mdash;and I have addressed them in every county&mdash;I would get as large an audience as any other man in Ireland. Yet while I was dealing with the matter the whole Government Front Bench opposite was left vacant.  I hope the Press, even the kept Press of the Government, will report that to-morrow and show the country the contempt which the Minister for Finance and the Government generally have for agricultural workers in this country.</P>

      <P>A great protest has been voiced because the amount of this grant is only £448,000.  I hold it is not a question of £448,000.  It is a question of obtaining complete justice for the farmers by giving them complete derating. This question of giving them grants is only like giving them a slice of justice instead of giving them complete justice.  The question of the annuities and other matters can be dealt with on their own merits.  In every other industry in this country, tariffs are imposed in order to enable the workers in the industry to produce at a price that will pay them and to give them a decent wage.  With regard to agriculture, it is admitted, I think, even on the Government Benches, that agricultural produce is being produced under the cost of production.  In these circumstances, it is impossible for farmers to pay a decent wage even where they employ their own family. They cannot afford a decent wage for the members of their own family, let alone men they employ and, if they do give them a living wage they cannot pay these overhead charges.  Take, for instance, the position of the farmers in Northern Ireland.  The world depression is such, at the present time, that the farmers of Northern Ireland, who are completely derated and who are getting the full price for their agricultural produce without any tariffs against the sale of that produce and without any tariffs on what they have <Col N="2213" /> to buy&mdash;with all these advantages&mdash; are, at present, unable to pay annuities and they have petitioned the Government of Northern Ireland to reduce their annuities by one half.  The farmers of the Free State are selling their agricultural produce at a 40 per cent. reduction as compared with the Northern farmers and buying their requirements at a similarly increased cost as compared with that paid by the Northern farmers and, in addition, are paying an increased rate this year as compared with last year, while the farmers of Northern Ireland are completely derated.  When all those things are taken into consideration, it is easy for the Government to see that it is impossible for the farmers to meet these charges.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton referred to the fact-I do not want to refer to the matter at any great length-that the farmers here are paying more than the annuity by reason of tariffs and by reason of the loss sustained by the dispute. Since they are paying more than the amount of the annuities, it is absolutely impossible for them to pay an increased rate or, in fact, any rate. Reference has been made to cattle coming in from Northern Ireland. I do not believe that there is a Deputy in this House who believes that there are cattle coming in from Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>A slip was cut out of a paper and sent to me a couple of days ago, in which certain gentlemen in England are given as saying that there has been an increase in the number of cattle sent from the Free State in three months of this year as compared with a similar period last year notwithstanding the tariffs.  How can you have it both ways?  If there are more cattle going out, how, then, would they be coming in?  They are not sending cattle from Northern Ireland.  I am living much nearer the Border than Deputy Flynn is and if he lived where I lived he would know the difference. I have been living there for a very long time and cattle were always coming up <Col N="2214" /> from Northern Ireland.  I used to bring them up myself and sell them in the Free State, but there is no use in telling this House that there are cattle coming in from Northern Ireland now. In a few cases, they might come in but the cattle are going out and there are, at least, as many cattle being sold in Great Britain, after paying the tariff, as there would be if there were no tariff because they have no other market except in the case of the few hundred that go to Germany.  There is no use in putting up an argument like that.  I should like to ask the Minister for Agriculture, or the Minister for Finance, who represents him here this evening, to consider this matter because the farmers will not be able to pay.  Even yet, we hope that something will be done to meet the situation and that this reduction in the agricultural grant will be reconsidered and something done to relieve the farmers.  I do not see any hope of getting in this money because they are unable to pay it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a grant that goes to the local authorities in connection with agricultural rates.  I wonder whether the Government has asked itself whether the authorities are in a position to meet the situation&mdash;I speak of the local authorities&mdash;which it has created by the diminution of this supplementary agricultural grant?  The Government has been accused of not keeping one of its promises.  That was in respect of complete derating.  There is, of course, a great deal of truth in that particular accusation.  It was honoured in the same way in which most of their promises have been honoured but, at least, they did one thing.  When they were in opposition, they did increase one portion of the agricultural grant by £250,000.  They might say, therefore, that they honoured a portion of their bond, and as it is one of the very few instances in which they went even that distance to honour a portion of their bond, they should, possibly, get credit for it, but it is a very characteristic way of doing it that, having added on that £250,000, they now proceed to deduct £450,000, roughly speaking, from another portion <Col N="2215" /> of the grant.  I have no doubt that the subtle minds we sometimes hear on the Government Benches would be able to prove, mathematically and logically, that they fully honoured their bond so far as the relief of agricultural rating is concerned, but the Government ought to consider the situation in which the ordinary local authorities and county councils will find themselves in the coming 12 months.  They have to budget or, at least, to levy rates without getting practically £500,000 on which they had counted.  This affects everybody in the country.  It affects not merely the farmer, who has to pay increased rates but, ultimately, it is likely to affect everybody who, in one way or another, comes into touch with the local administration.  It is a matter for the Deputies of every Party in this House to ask themselves whether the farmer is in a position to pay the increased rates that become necessary as a result of this particular withdrawal of £450,000 by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the essence of a great deal of the charge that has been made against the Government.  At any time, such a sudden imposition on the farming community would be serious.  It is, as Deputies of every Party will recognise, particularly serious at the present moment, apart altogether from the economic war.  It would have been a difficult situation owing to the general fall in agricultural prices but, as has been pointed out again and again, that general fall has been made catastrophic for our farmers by the incidence of the economic war and that, unfortunately, is the time when new burdens are put on the local authorities.  The answer of the Government, again and again, has been to point out that they have come to the assistance of the local authorities in other ways, and they are coming to the assistance of the farmers in other ways.  So far as local authorities are concerned, let us be quite clear that, in respect of relief from rates, the Government has in no way come to their assistance.  It has induced them in various ways to embark on further expenditure&mdash;even <Col N="2216" /> the grants for building are inducements to further expenditure&mdash;and, therefore, further to increase rates.  Those who are acquainted with some of the county councils in this country know perfectly well that that is a taking-on of a new liability by the county councils and other local authorities.</P>
    <P>That is not an excuse in any way; it is rather an aggravation of the situation. It is not an excuse for the withdrawal of this relief which, up to some months ago, the local authorities had every right to expect they would enjoy this year.  It is not merely now a question of the farmers who have to pay the increased rates.  The farmers are not the only people affected in the various counties.  If, as has been strongly urged by various public bodies, by people in touch with the farming community, the farmers will not be in a position, owing to the decline of the value of their produce and owing to the loss of their markets, to pay the increased rates, that is bound to affect everybody in the country, not merely those who pay rates, but those who gain benefits from the rates.  Therefore, this action of the Government is directed against every section of the community that has anything to do with county councils.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave quoted a Minister speaking in the West where he boasted that they were not unaware of the conditions in the country.  Personally, I have often felt convinced that the one excuse they have for the policy they are pursuing is that they are not aware of the conditions existing.  How is the the farmer to meet the increased rates that he is called upon to pay?  That is a question that ought to be put to himself by every Deputy.  The farmer has lost his markets.  Has he got any others in exchange?  It was hinted by the present Minister for Finance that there were prospects of markets.  We were told definitely by the Minister for Agriculture within the last month that they had got the markets and we had the Minister for External Affairs, the President, this evening stating that our relations with other countries from the commercial point of view are most unsatisfactory.  We have representatives abroad in different portions of <Col N="2217" /> Europe, but in not one of the countries in which we have representatives is there anything, according to the President, except a very unsatisfactory state of affairs so far as trade with these countries is concerned.  Therefore, although we have the Minister for Agriculture telling us he has markets, the President tells us he will have to take very serious steps indeed unless these countries with which we now do a certain trade mend their hand and do more business with us.</P>
    <P>Where have the markets vanished to within a month?  How is the farmer to meet the additional burden, that, in this above all years, the Government has chosen to put upon his shoulders? On the one hand, by their policy the Government, deliberately or not&mdash;it is impossible, as one Deputy pointed out, in matters of this kind to make up one's mind as to how far the Government is deliberate and how far it is merely incompetent&mdash;are driving the local authorities into bankruptcy and, on the other hand, they have certainly done a great deal to drive those on whom the local authorities must depend for their revenue to bankruptcy as well. I suggest there is absolutely no justification for the line that is being taken by the Government, for the policy that is revealed in the Estimates.  The farmers always had a difficult position to fill.  That applies to all countries, not alone to the Free State.  It is not easy in that particular industry to get the balance on the right side.  That would be difficult under normal circumstances, but in the present circumstances it has become impossible. At the moment, the difference between the value of what the farmer sells and what he gets is very considerable.</P>
    <P>The Government is treating a very serious matter with a flippancy that, I am sorry to say, we are now rather accustomed to get from some members, at any rate, of the Government Front Bench.  It is nothing less than flippancy not to realise existing conditions and to pretend that the economic war has no effect whatsoever on the capacity of the farmer to pay his rates.  It undoubtedly has.  You must compare the average price of <Col N="2218" /> cattle in this country and in Great Britain.  It is useless to tell fairy tales about an individual who wandered into a fair in Enniskillen. An individual happening like that, even if truly reported, has nothing to do with the situation.  Whatever benefits there may have been from other aspects of Government policy&mdash; and I do not believe there have been many&mdash;we in Kerry certainly have got very little benefit from their wheat and grain-growing policy, except increased costs as we have to buy feeding stuffs and sell our farm produce outside.  In that particular county the farmers have to meet their share of the Agricultural Grant.</P>
    <P>We are now familiar with the Government's reply&mdash;that there is no satisfying the farmer.  As one Minister put it, the farmers do not know how well off they are and how well they are being treated by the Fianna Fáil Government.  They do not know all the good things that the Fianna Fáil Government has done for them.  They do not know how, again and again, that beneficent and patriarchal Government has come to their assistance.  Of course, it may diminish the annuities by one-half but, in reality, and it is necessary to insist upon this, it is no good to reduce land annuities by one-half and at the same time reduce the value of the land to one-fifth or less.  That is the situation.  You come to the assistance of the farmer by reducing what he has to pay in land annuities&mdash; that is the answer I heard when objection was taken to this step before &mdash;but as against all that the farmer now has to bear burdens he had not to bear before and he has not the wherewithal to meet these burdens. At any time, a step of this kind could only be described as retrogressive. The policy of the previous Government, and for a while, apparently, the policy of this Government, was a policy of coming to the assistance of the agricultural community by increasing the Agricultural Grant. Now a step is taken in the opposite direction by diminishing the Grant at a time when the farmer is least able to bear the charge.  I move to report progress.</P>
