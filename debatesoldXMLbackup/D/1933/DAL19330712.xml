      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the difficulties experienced by married members of the Gárda Síochána in securing houses for their families and themselves in different towns of the Saorstát, he will take advantage of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, to have a certain number of houses built specially for married Gárda in each of the towns where such difficulties exist.</P>

      <P>Barrack accommodation for the Gárda Síochána is provided by the Board of Works out of the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.  That Vote contains no provision for building houses for married members of the Gárda, and I do not propose to ask the Minister for Finance to make such provision in future.  The housing policy of the Government, which is directed towards relieving the general shortage, does not include the provision of State owned houses for Government employees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, as a member of a local authority, I ought at least to enter some protest against what might be described as the scant courtesy shown to local councils all over the country when the Government proposed to reduce the agricultural grants.  As a matter of fact, we did have intimation previously that our grants would be the same as before, and the local councils, acting on that information, proceeded to frame their estimates.  When they had framed their estimates, and made provision for the general expenditure, <Col N="2226" /> they were actually informed that the grant was to be reduced by a certain amount.  Not alone was that a hardship upon the local authorities, and the farming community of the county who had already lost their markets, and were unable to pay their way, but it showed a great lack of courtesy to the local authorities that they were not informed in time of the situation that they had to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not remember ever in the history of local government&mdash;at least during my connection with it&mdash;when local authorities were treated with the same lack of courtesy as they were treated during that period.  The position of local authorities is not at all times, perhaps, a very happy one. They have to make provision for the general expenditure on the public services and, largely irrespective of the position of the people who have to carry on the public services, they have to strike rates and, sometimes, to take very drastic steps to see that the rates are paid.  As I have said, the position is not always very happy, but to be shown such scant courtesy as we were shown on that occasion was something new.  The local authorities were called upon to make their estimates and, having made them, they were told that the bases on which they framed the estimates were false.  They were told, in effect, that the local authorities would be curtailed to the extent of £448,000 for the coming year.  Not alone was that uncalled for, but I think it was discourtesy, particularly coming on top of the fact that the farmers had already lost their markets and that their resources were dwindling.  I think it was a very bad step.  As a member of a local authority, I certainly do not want to make any statement here, or in any other place, that might be construed as saying that the rates cannot or ought not to be paid; but certainly I do not look forward to the future collection of rates with very happy feelings.  I hope that times will improve and that it will be possible to collect the rates, but I think that the cutting down of the agricultural grant by £448,000 at the present time is an act of which the Government ought to be ashamed and <Col N="2227" /> I am afraid that it will have disastrous effects on the country.</P>
    <P>As I say, I do not want to create the feeling that the rates ought not to be paid.  I want to stress that.  I have never taken up that attitude.  I know that the public services must be maintained through the collection of rates, but I am very doubtful as to the way in which the farmers at the present time will be able to pay them.</P>
    <P>I was absent from the House yesterday in order to attend a local fair.  I am sure that if the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Local Government and Public Health were present at that fair and happened to understand the prices offered, and which had to be taken at that fair, they would feel very pessimistic, as I do, about the future collection of rates in the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to protest against the absence from this House, both yesterday and to-day, during this debate, of the Minister for Agriculture, and, most particularly, of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, because, with all due respect to the Minister for Finance, I submit that he cannot understand the effect on local authorities and upon the ratepayers, which the action of the Government in reducing the grant by £448,000 has had, as well as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the Minister for Agriculture should understand it.  At least, one would not expect that the Minister for Finance, as he is not dealing directly with either the farmers or the local authorities, would know or be expected to know, so much as the other Ministers I have mentioned.  I should like to deal with this matter from what might be called the parochial point of view as it affects my own constituency, because I take it that what is true of Tipperary is true of the rest of the country.  In North Tipperary the action of the Government <Col N="2228" /> in reducing the grants meant an increase, I think, of 1/7 in the £ on the rates and, in South Tipperary, it meant an increase of 1/4, plus 2/3, of an increase which had to be put on to meet the abnormal unemployment and the abnormal demand for outdoor relief.  I want to suggest that the Government are responsible for placing an increased rate of 3/7 in the £ on the ratepayers of South Tipperary; first, because of their failure to keep their promises with regard to the agricultural grant; and, secondly, because of their failure to put into operation a motion which was carried by this House last June twelve months, the effect of that motion being that if the Government were unable to provide work for the unemployed in this country it was their duty to provide maintenance.  I am putting it, sir, that the imposition of that 2/3 strengthens the case as to why the grant should not be reduced. It means, so far as the South Tipperary County Council are concerned&mdash;and I am speaking roughly now of round figures&mdash;that last year the demands made by the County Council on the ratepayers was for a sum of £95,000, whereas this year it is for a sum of £138,000 in the same area.</P>
      <P>Surely there is no member in this House who will suggest for a moment that the people are in at all as good a position to meet the demand for rates this year, even if they were only last year's rates, as they were last year.  They talk of having to meet an increase of roughly 50 per cent. and this coming from a Government which at a time when this country was, comparatively speaking, well off, promised full derating to the farmers of this country and stressed that, if the farming industry was to survive, it was essential that they should have full derating.  If it were essential that they should have full derating when they had a free market and were able to dispose of their stocks at fairly good prices and when they were getting at least 60 per cent. more for their produce than they are getting to-day, I submit that it is much more essential to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter to which I should like to refer. <Col N="2229" /> Many councils, when they were informed of the Government's intention to reduce the agricultural grant and thereby increase the rates, in order to minimise that increase as far as possible, cut down on services and, in many cases, reduce the estimates submitted by the county surveyors for road making and road maintenance. As a result of this action of the Government, there is very much less money available this year for the relief of employment by the way of road making and road maintenance than there was last year.  To my mind, that is perhaps the most serious part of the whole matter.  I should like to stress that, that in order to lighten as far as they possibly could the effect of this reduction of £448,000, county councils cut down the estimates submitted by their county surveyors for the roads&mdash;the estimates which would give employment.  If you like, that was rather foolish, because to those to whom they cannot give employment on the roads they will have to give home assistance through the county boards of health.  I do not know how the Minister will try to justify this action of the Government, particularly in view of statements made in the last two or three years by himself and his colleagues.  Difficult as it will be for the Minister himself, it will be much more difficult for some members of his Party.</P>
    <P>We ought to get a clear statement from the Minister as to whether there is to be de-rating or not, or whether there is to be partial de-rating, and that statement ought to be made on this Estimate.  We had statements made during the week-end by certain prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party in the country about Bills that are to be brought in in the Autumn Session dealing with de-rating. I would, however, prefer to hear a definite pronouncement in this House, because members of the Fianna Fáil Party are rather inclined, I am afraid, when a matter is raised in this House to run away from the speeches which they have made in the country.  If we could get a statement made in the House and put on record in the Official Reports it would not be so easy to get away from <Col N="2230" /> it.  The matter was discussed very fully yesterday.  I do not intend to go into the by-ways that were gone into yesterday. I am trying to keep as closely as I can to the matter before the House. I hope, however, that the Minister will explain to the House and to the ratepayers of North and South Tipperary, particularly South Tipperary, where they have to pay an increase of 3/7 in the £.  In view of the economic war, and the fact that they are getting 60 per cent. less for their stock than they got before the Government came into office, they are unable to meet that burden.  Like Deputy Brennan, I am not preaching the non-payment of rates &mdash;I never did.  I am as anxious that rates should be paid, if it is possible to pay them, as any Deputy.  I am as anxious that the social services should be maintained as any Deputy.  But we have to recognise that if the money is not there it cannot be paid, and then it is for the Minister to point out how it can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMichaelBurke" hpid="Mr. J.M. Burke Mr. J.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The marked silence on the Government Benches during this debate in its mute eloquence proclaims, as no tongue could proclaim, the utter inability of the Fianna Fáil Party to excuse, palliate, and much less to justify the action of the Executive Council in reducing the agricultural grant in the present condition of agricultural depression in this country.  On the eve of the general election people were told that the bells were ringing and the birds were singing, that the millennium was at hand, that the Golden Age was going to be restored, that the swords would be turned into plough shares, that every peasant would have a fowl in his Sunday pot, and that the Free State would be a paradise of perfect bliss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now what has happened?  Every prophecy has been falsified by events. We are calmly told that it is a good thing for the people to wear sackcloth and ashes and hair-shirts.  It is much easier to tell 20 people what were good to be done than to be one of the 20 to follow your own advice.  The times are lean and hard.  There is no money in circulation.  Take the small farmers of West Cork, my constituency.  They work from early morn until late at <Col N="2231" /> night to wring a scanty livelihood from infertile and reluctant patches of land.  They have striven and struggled; they have toiled and moiled, they have scrimped and they have scrounged to pay, as they always did, their annuities regularly and punctually. What is their condition to-day?  They are crushed down by the weight of public burdens; they are unable to meet their obligations and they are deprived of the only valuable market that was open to them.  This was bound to happen.  Everybody with an ounce of commonsense knew that it would happen.  The Department of Agriculture is under the presidency of a very courteous gentleman, and I most willingly and readily pay tribute to his courtesy, but he knows a great deal more about potions, lotions and motions than he does about potatoes or lentils or mangels.  The sweetly smiling and soft-voiced gentleman who is in charge of the Department of Finance, the mildest mannered man that has lived since the time of Lambro knows, I have no doubt, a great deal about callipers, but I am very doubtful about his knowledge of calves.  I cannot say I am sure, but I would almost make a bet that he would not know the difference between a scilán and a cailleach.  I do not for a moment wish to throw any aspickawn on that gentleman.  I only say in the words of the Latin poet: <i>Ambitiosus et audax Naviget Anticyram.</i>  He is ambitious and he is daring.  Let him take a trip to Anticyr and when he has taken a triple dose of hellebore perhaps on the return journey he will pay a visit to Canossa and do penance for his economic heresies.</P>
    <P>It seems to me very unfortunate at the present time that of all the grants the agricultural grant, which is a matter of supreme importance to the greatest industry, the key industry of the country, should have been reduced. A great Irishman was asked once when did the Irish question start, and he said, &ldquo;When Strongbow landed in Ireland. Then he was asked when it would end, and he said, &ldquo;When Cromwell is released from Hell.&rdquo;  Now the land question started when Cain, the <Col N="2232" /> husbandmen, slew Abel, the rancher, and so far as this country is concerned I believe it will never be ended until the Executive Council will learn the elementary principle of farming, and that will not take place until Lá Philip a chleite.  I think it is time that the members in charge of the Government at the present day should give up their old cearrbheach policy of cutting and shuffling.  They should face up to the facts of the situation, and realise that once agriculture is ruined in this country the Free State is absolutely finished.  I do not wish to detain the attention of the House any longer; I have kept it already possibly too long. I am very sorry that so far no murmur has come from the Labour benches, which I see are at present graced by the presence of Deputy Corish and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because the astute members of the Party must know that depression of agriculture means the lowering of wages for the whole of Ireland, and they must have already learned that one of the effects of the Government's economic policy has been that while the standard of living has been lowered, its cost has been raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only natural that when any department of life suffers, either through a lowered grant or in some other way, they should give some expression to what they feel. What I want to point out is that the reduction of the agricultural grant in this case is no ordinary reduction.  To my mind, the reduction of this grant is an impingement upon the right of the agricultural community.  In the bad old days that we have left long behind, the farmer received half of his rate from the landlord.  Successive Governments afterwards came to his relief to some extent, until last year we had reached positively the top of any effort towards the alleviation of the farmers' burden in that respect.  Now this year we are faced with a reduction of £448,000 on the agricultural grant, and I think it is only natural that we should make our protest.  Much has been said yesterday and to-day in regard to that matter.  I wish to confine myself very strictly to a few of the points bearing upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2233" /> I think, in the very first place, we, as an agricultural community, should give voice to our despair, because however far we may have differed from the Government in power in many of its policies we eagerly listened to the promises that we were approaching the time when we would have full derating, and it comes as a terrible blow this year to find that instead of marching towards derating we are reducing this grant by £448,000.  It is as an argument in favour of this reduction that some Deputies have pointed out that we are receiving benefit in regard to the land annuities.  I respectfully point out that they are two distinct things.  The proposed reduction in the land annuities has come about as a result of the economic war, or what brought on the economic war.  I think it was the Minister for Finance who pointed out a couple of weeks ago that the money for that purpose has not to be found in the same way as other moneys.  If by withholding payments under the Acts previous to 1923 we can meet liabilities under the subsequent Acts that has nothing whatever to do with the relief of the farmers' rates. The bounties are a legitimate help towards the relief of the burden which has been brought about by the economic war, but derating falls under a different category altogether.  We are faced to-day with a demand for increased rates.  The gross demand for rates in all the counties of the Saorstát is higher than it was last year, and, in addition to that, the amount of the grant is lower.</P>
    <P>My friend here has been quoting Irish history and Scriptural history, and many other histories.  I will recall now the time when we read with such sadness and perhaps such bitterness of the time when Pharaoh crushed the Israelites too hard in the land of Egypt, and when he exacted the toll of bricks though he would not supply the straw to make them.  I think the Government has gone one better, because they are asking an increased toll when there is a decreased income to meet it.  We have an increased rate to meet on a decreased income.  That is burning the candle at both ends.  On <Col N="2234" /> the one hand our Government has voluntarily surrendered the only market in which we could sell our produce, and on the other hand it is giving us less relief in rates.  There is no sense that I can see in this policy of building up bounties against special duties.</P>
    <P>Some members have stated that in their constituencies there is no outcry. I would suggest that the reason why the outcry is not so great from the farming community is because they are the patient oxen.  If this impingement was on the labour element, on the teachers or on the civil servants, we would have special meetings and uproars, but because the farmers are feeling their responsibility in the country, are not at all revolutionary, and are not perhaps making their cry as loud as they might, it is no argument that they are not suffering.  It has been said that the economic situation is not such as to warrant any outcry, and that if anybody went into the country and attended the fairs they would see whether a volume of business is being done or not.  I know several people who have not been able to cash their stuff yet, although it is now well into the month of July.  The argument has been put forward several times in this House, although there are no grounds that I can see for it, that the price of cattle on the other side of the Border is worse than it is in the Free State.  A Deputy from Sligo, I think, mentioned that at the Enniskillen fair there were some buyers from the Free State buying cattle because they could buy them cheaper than in the Free State.</P>

      <P>Store cattle.  Well, of course, anybody who has studied the question of the export bounty can understand that that can be done.  It can be done in this way, when cattle can be bought in Northern Ireland and a certificate of origin obtained from the customs coming in and these cattle can be re-exported free of duty.  That is so.  We have done it.  I live on the Border and I know.  For any responsible Deputy to ask this House to believe that cattle in bulk are cheaper <Col N="2235" /> in Northern Ireland than in the Free State is to ask us to believe something that cannot be so.  On the face of it, one can see how unreasonable it is.  A two-year-old beast has to carry a tariff of £6 export duty and then it is graded from that down to £4 and £2 10s.</P>
      <P>On the question of prices, I should like to tell Deputy Flynn through you, Sir, this one transaction which will illustrate that and show that our ability to pay is reduced very much.  In the town of Castleblayney, in the county in which I live, a friend of mine bought a litter of pigs for £10 10s.  These were then smuggled across the Border and they were sold at Keady for £31.  The price was made in the same market and by the same man.  There is wholesale smuggling.  I ask the Deputy is he asking us to believe that the people are running the risk of the loss of their cattle together with the penalties that can be imposed on them just because cattle are cheaper in Northern Ireland than they are in the Free State?  I might ask, too, why is it, if that is so, that the fairs immediately across the Border are much larger than they were 15 months ago?  It is because these cattle are smuggled across the Border for export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to register my protest on behalf of the agricultural constituency that I represent against this reduction in the agricultural grant.  This is a reduction that is hard for the agricultural community to bear.  Our livelihood has been taken away.  Our responsibility to the boards of health and to the county councils have been increased and yet this agricultural grant, this contribution to our rates, is lowered by the Government.  This has been done at a time when we were looking forward hopefully, no matter in what other respects we might differ with the Government in power, to the redemption of this promise made by them that we would have full derating just as our competitors in Northern Ireland have.  We are now faced with the question of what are we going to do with our cattle.  Our country is fast growing into a wilderness.  Young stock is not being brought forward to eat the grass or hay or the produce of <Col N="2236" /> our tillage operations.  We cannot increase our tillage operations except for the purpose of feeding the produce to live stock.  When we are unable to dispose of our live stock we cannot go on doing this.  I submit the whole situation is one of grave concern to the agricultural community.  I am not one to be sounding a wail where there is no need, but I should like to draw the attention of the Minister for Finance, even at this hour, to the plight in which our agriculturists find themselves and to the inability of the farming community to pay the increased rate which has to be faced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinlay" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a few remarks with regard to the agricultural grant.  As a member of the Leix County Council, I may tell the House how the matter affects us down there.  In the last three weeks, I am sorry to tell the House, we had to dismiss a large number of labourers from our service in the County Council through inability to find money to pay their wages.  I do not know if there is any county council representative here to-day whose county is in the same plight as we are in Leix, but I am sure every Deputy in this House will agree that it is a deplorable thing to see men thrown out of work, and unemployed in the longest day in the year.  As the House is aware, this agricultural grant of £448,000 of which we have been deprived works out very drastically on the farming community. Down in Leix it means that the farmers are deprived of a contribution of 1/6 in the £.  Deputies will see how that makes it difficult for the County Council there to operate. Previous to any notification of this grant being stopped, we in Leix had forced on us the necessity of striking a rate in excess of last year's rate of 2/- in the £.  That means that the Leix County Council will be faced with a rate of 3/6 in the £ higher than we had to pay last year.  I want to ask the Minister does he think it is right to deprive the farming community of this grant in this year of great depression?  One would have thought that instead of reducing the grant the Government would have increased it in the present year.  As <Col N="2237" /> a matter of fact, the farmers and ratepayers are clearly unable to pay these rates.</P>
      <P>I am not one to advocate the non-payment of rates or annuities.  I have never done so, but I can tell this House that I sincerely believe it will be impossible for the people down in my county in the coming year to meet either rates or land annuities.  I may be in the position like other farmers that to-morrow I may have ten cattle for sale.  It is very hard on me to take out these ten cattle to the fair and sell five out of the ten because that is all I can sell.  I am giving the other five for luck.  In such circumstances, it is hard for me to go home from that fair and try to maintain the expenses of my farm, pay rates and land annuities on the farm.  All the farming community ever wanted was to live and let live.  The farmers never had any large ambitions, or extensive ways of living, or anything like that.  All they wanted was a living wage for themselves.</P>
      <P>Some years ago if it were a thing that I had ten cattle, and if, as a matter of fact, I went out in the morning in the field and found five of my cattle dead in the field, would not the countryside come to my assistance in some little way so as to try to help me in the way people had of helping a neighbour?  But to-day it is not my fault if I have lost five cattle and that it is what it means.  Every man in the farming business knows that half of his cattle have been lost.  He owns at present only 50 per cent, of his live stock.  That is exactly the position and I think every farming Deputy here will agree with me.  That being the case, I put it to the House to press on the Government to relieve the agricultural community.  In this matter instead of helping them they are taking away roughly £500,000.  As a matter of fact, instead of that contribution being reduced by half a million, what the Government should do would be to double it, so as to meet the cases which are pressing so hard upon the Free State farmers at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not an advocate of the non-payment of rates, but at the same time, I can almost promise the Minister that it <Col N="2238" /> will be practically impossible to collect rents, rates and taxes during the coming year.  Farmers always paid their way and they would be only too willing to do it now if they had the markets. But our markets have been taken from us and there is no great likelihood that they will be restored in the near future. I was at the fair of Kilkenny about a month ago and I happened to have a fairly useful colt.  A man asked me what I wanted for the animal and I said 100 guineas.  He asked me if I would not be prepared to take 50 guineas and I replied that on other occasions I got 100 guineas for a worse animal.  Then he pointed out that if he gave me 50 he would have to pay another 40 guineas across the Border.  He did not know if I understood the matter sufficiently, but I assured him that I understood only too much about it.  It is just the same with all live stock.  At the moment, it is almost impossible for a farmer to exist.  I think it is the duty of the Government to make every effort to relieve the farmers in their present condition of distress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one estimate that the people expected to be increased rather than reduced it is this Estimate in respect of grants to local authorities.  One of the things the electors were definitely promised was, if not the total abolition of rates, at least something tending towards that desirable consummation.  It came as a bombshell when this Estimate was reduced by £448,000.  The proposal was particularly objectionable coming as it did when most of the county councils had prepared their estimates.  They made provision for the agricultural grant and they had arranged the rates on that basis.  This proposal is also objectionable because of the existing depression in agriculture. No Deputy who honestly represents agriculture could let this Vote pass without making some protest. Like other Deputies from my side, I do not wish to imply that the people should not pay their rates and provide for local services.  We have never made that statement in this House or outside it.  As a representative of the agriculturists, however, I am bound to say that I believe many <Col N="2239" /> of them, if not the majority, will find it impossible to meet their demands in the way of rates this year, taking into account the declining prices for agricultural products.  Every Deputy on the Government Benches must be as well aware of that as we are.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture was in my county during the week and he made a very strong speech, his usual speech, attacking members of this and another Party.  He was in the town of Kilmallock.  I wish he had waited in County Limerick until the following Monday morning instead of undertaking the long journey to Clonmel. If he remained in Limerick he would have learned much a distance of four or five miles from where he had been speaking.  There was a fair held in the town of Hospital.  It used to be one of the greatest fairs in County Limerick for the sale of fat cattle.  On Monday morning it was more in the nature of a funeral procession than a sale of cattle.  One had only to look at the long-drawn faces of the farmers and the melancholy expression of the shopkeepers to realise to what straits agriculture has been reduced.</P>
      <P>There is an increasing demand on local councils for the provision of relief for necessitous people.  I observe from statistics that there are 143,000 people in receipt of poor law assistance. That was the case up to the end of May and that showed an increase of 31,000 people over the previous year.  It means an increased expenditure of £3,500 a week in the payment of home assistance.  That is an excessive demand on local councils at a period when the farmers find it difficult to pay rates and when the Government have reduced the grant in relief of rates by £448,000.  That reduction is indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the declining price for agricultural produce farmers ordinarily would have found it difficult to pay even last year's rates, but they will find it much more difficult, in fact practically impossible, to pay this year's increased rate. An increasing number of people, because of the existing depression, are in need of outdoor relief and other forms of assistance from local councils. <Col N="2240" /> The prospect that faces local councils is not a happy one.  I do not like to adopt the role of a bad prophet, but I think it is my duty to say that I believe the local councils will find it extremely difficult to get the people to meet their obligations this year.  In the majority of cases the people will not be able to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>Many things have been said in the course of this debate, and one would imagine sufficient had been said to convince the Government that the situation is very serious.  I think too much could not possibly be said in order to impress on the minds of the Government the serious nature of the situation that has been created for the farmers and the position of responsibility into which the Government have put themselves.  The farmers were promised total derating, and I am sure Deputies recollect that there were times when the Government had every intention of being most generous, if not actually extravagant, with regard to the manner in which they were going to assist the rates.  I recollect that a proposal was placed before this House by the Cosgrave Government to give £750,000 for the relief of rates. On that occasion the Opposition said the amount was not sufficient and it should be made £1,000,000.  That matter was put to a vote.  What do we find now?  The Government, in order to make good their promise, went through the farce of passing an additional sum of £250,000 for the relief of rates, and this additional sum brings the total amount up to the £1,000,000 originally promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was pointed out by many other Deputies, we have here the astounding fact that despite the political promises of Fianna Fáil, which ought to have deceived nobody, the people are now suffering the results of the action they took in sending that Party into power.  The evils are now coming home to their doors and to their pockets, and they are seeing too late the consequence of their action.  We are now sustaining a reduction of £448,000 in the agricultural grant, at a time when the farmers of the country, owing to the economic war through <Col N="2241" /> which they are passing, and other causes of depression, are unable to pay their rates.  I speak on behalf of a county whose ratepayers I have represented for the past 25 or 26 years on the county council.  I can claim to represent on that council a body of farmers who always met their obligations promptly and paid their rates and annuities regularly.  In 1928 the rate was 3/2 in the £.  An additional rate of 1/4 was imposed and the rate to-day is 5/9.  In dealing with a matter of this kind, as a result of the reduction of £448,000, it is most difficult to exaggerate the trying circumstances through which the farmers are passing. We hear about reductions of the annuities.  Let us contrast the advantages and the disadvantages.  The reduction of annuities is 50 per cent. of the yearly payment, but in addition to his share of the annuities the farmer has now to bear his share of an additional £2,000,000 taxation.  The annuities amount to £3,000,000, but the farmer now, even with reduced annuities, has to bear his share of a burden of £5,000,000 and he is called upon to do that at a time when he is deprived of the advantages of free access to the English market.  He is told that there is no profit to be made out of that market.  Yet we had the Minister for Agriculture, and even the President stating in this House, yesterday, that they are seeking for alternative markets and that by spending money on keeping representatives abroad in other countries, as these representatives are assisting to find markets, that money is not spent in vain.  These are the hopes held out to us.  The farmers are told to live in hopes.  We were told how worthless the British market was for the general farmers of the country.  Yet notwithstanding that fact we have now, staring us in the face, the tragic circumstance that the farmers who are on the brink of ruin will have to bear a loss of £448,000 in reduction of their agricultural grants.  That sum is being taken away from the farming community at the time when, in the whole history of the country, they never needed it more.</P>
    <P>We are told that the British market is not worth keeping and is no <Col N="2242" /> loss to the farmers of this country, yet notwithstanding that, we see that the action of the Government with regard to this matter contradicts these things. They are prepared to send the farmers produce into the British markets at a loss of 40 per cent.  They are prepared to accept £60 for every £100 worth of produce they send into the British market.  I am mentioning these things in the hope of impressing upon the Government the necessity of taking into consideration the circumstances through which the farmers of the country are passing to-day, and how necessary it is that they should do something in the interest of the farming community.</P>
    <P>We hear talk about tariffs and that the sum of £6 per head is to be paid in the way of tariffs on cattle, but a bounty of £1 15/- a head has to be paid.  I want to know who pays these bounties and who gets them.  I have heard it said by Deputies in this House that at no time in this country were the farmers ever able to make their farms pay.  I am sure if the farmers were not able to make their farms pay, despite their industry in the years prior to the economic war, they must be in a very happy position now, indeed, and must be making a great amount of money.  If they were not able to make their farms pay before the economic war, I wonder how they stand now, with a duty of 40 per cent. against them.  I am sure they must be very comfortable and putting a lot of money aside, especially when we consider the prices they are getting for live stock and for farm produce like potatoes.  I know a man who sold potatoes last year at £8 a ton.  This year that same man sold his potatoes at 10d. per cwt., practically 15/- a ton. These are matters that ought to appeal to the Government.  It is unnecessary to remind them where the responsibility lies.  They have been reminded of that many a time.  But I look forward to the day when they will be reminded of these facts by the people who have to bear the burden, and when that reminder will bring home to them that they ought not to proceed lightly, and in a gambling fashion, to deal with the livelihood of the farmers of this country.  The day will come <Col N="2243" /> when the farmers of this country will make them realise that, as they made the farmers suffer they have lost the confidence of those whom they made to suffer.</P>

      <P>This debate reminds me very much of Muggleton's dinner; it is a re-hash of the fag-ends of Cumann na nGaedheal propaganda of 12 months ago&mdash;propaganda to which the country has had an opportunity of listening and judging for itself in the course of the general election which took place in the beginning of this year.  We are told about the miserable condition of the farmers.  Deputy Haslett depicted the earthly paradise, which, according to him, the farmers in the Six Counties must live in, because a litter of pigs, which some omadhaun at Castleblayney sold for ten guineas, brought 21 guineas when sold in the Six Counties.  I know as much about the Six Counties as Deputy Haslett, and about the farmers' condition there and I know this much: Seven or eight weeks ago I was in the centre of one of the greatest potato-growing districts in Ireland and they told me they could not get 6/- a ton for their potatoes, not to speak at all of 15/-.  They told me that 80 per cent. of the farmers were so submerged in debt that they had no hope of being able to clear themselves.</P>

      <P>I was going to say that Deputy Haslett must have given up reading the <i>Irish Times</i> recently. But for the condition of affairs pertaining to this particular transaction and prevailing generally throughout the Six Counties, and throughout Great Britain, we should not have this appearing in a leading article of the <i>Irish Times</i> yesterday.  Talking about the condition of the British farmer and of agricultural prices in Great Britain, generally, that newspaper, which cannot be accused of being a Party organ, or at least of being an organ supporting the present Government, said this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Prices in England have fallen and are continuing to fall, very <Col N="2244" /> heavily.  During the month of June the index figure for agricultural products fell by two points to 100, showing that the average price was identical with that which ruled during the month of June, 1913.  At Leicester, a fortnight ago, large numbers of fat cattle were returned unsold to their feeders, and last week the prevailing price was between 17/- and 35/- a cwt. Breeders and feeders alike must lose at this rate and they are demanding that steps shall be taken to protect their interests.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no increase in the agricultural grant in Great Britain, notwithstanding the fact that it is generally admitted that the conditions described in this article have prevailed universally throughout Great Britain during the past 12 months and that you have responsible Ministers&mdash;even Mr. Baldwin himself&mdash;admitting that the steps which they took to restrict the import of live-stock into Great Britain, and the policy they had pursued of imposing tariffs upon Irish live-stock imported into Great Britain, had failed.  It seems to me that that statement, coming from responsible members of the British Government, is a complete refutation of the canard that has been spread up and down the country by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to the effect that the present condition of the Irish farmers is mainly due to the economic war.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Baldwin pointed out in a recent speech that the effect of tariffs can be counteracted by a system of bounties and subsidies and the Free State Government has not been slow to take advantage of that fact.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>These quotations from the <i>Irish Times</i> raise a very important matter for consideration. As I have already stated, members on the Opposition Benches have combined to ascribe all our ills to the present dispute which exists between Great Britain and this country.  They point to the undeniably low prices which live stock fetches at our fairs; but they fail to ascribe that to its proper cause, and that is that if prices are low here it is due to the fact that the demand in Great Britain has declined already, and that if prices are low in this country it is due to the fact that the British people are no longer able, or at least no longer willing, to pay the same prices for Irish cattle as they were up to a few years ago.</P>

      <P>It is admitted that prices of cattle are low in Great Britain.  An import duty has been imposed, the effect of which either has been completely counteracted by the bounties and subsidies which the present Government has given, or else, if that be not admitted, then this import duty must have operated to restrict the supply to the British <Col N="2248" /> markets.  The point I am putting to those who wish to ascribe the present condition of the Irish farmer to the continuance of the dispute with Great Britain is this: what price would the Irish farmer be getting for his cattle if the Irish farmer had unrestricted admission to the British market at present?  And, what is more important, what price would the British farmer be getting for his cattle?  I say that is more important because any person who has studied the statements which have been made by those responsible for British fiscal and agricultural policy, during the past 12 months particularly, must have come to the conclusion that the dispute with Great Britain had merely been made the excuse and was not the reason for the imposition of the import duties upon our cattle; that, in fact, it is clear from the negotiations which took place with other Dominions, and the agreements to restrict the imports from them which have been secured from other suppliers that what was in that was not to collect the annuities at all, but to restrict the admission of Irish live stock into the British market in the interests of the British farmer.  That is why I say that the economic dispute was merely made the excuse and was not the real reason for the policy which was adopted 12 months ago and which has since been pursued by the British Government.  We must then ask ourselves: if this was the fundamental condition subsisting all the time during the past 12 months, if the economic dispute between Great Britain and ourselves had not arisen, if we had paid over the land annuities as we were told on the other side we ought to have done, would our position be any better than it is to-day?  Would we not still be faced with these import restrictions? Would we not still be faced with the prospect of a quota?  Would we not have to submit exactly to the same disabilities to which other members of the Commonwealth have had to submit in order to retain any place in the British market?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the Minister is concluding on this occasion.  The point that I am trying to make, if I will be permitted to do so, is that, so far as the Irish farmer is concerned, he is no worse off, even with this dispute about the land annuities continuing, than he would be if no dispute had arisen at all; that we would still be faced with import restriction of one kind or another that would prevent us getting back, as they say, our markets; that the British themselves either by agreement&mdash;possibly by agreement, if the Opposition were on these Benches&mdash;or in spite of the Irish Government, would have excluded us from some part of that market, in the same way as they are trying to exclude other suppliers to that market, not out of antagonism to us, but out of concern for their own people and in order that they might do something to help the British farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having disposed of that argument, we have to consider whether there is any ground for the complaint that the Government are not treating the Irish farmer, as one section of the Irish community, fairly and generously, in making the allocation which they propose to make in this present year of the Supplementary Agricultural Grant. I think the year that should be taken and could fairly be taken for comparison in this case is the last year that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office.  In 1932 the total amount voted&mdash;and I should like to emphasise the word voted because of what I am going to say later&mdash;for the relief of rates upon agricultural land was £1,948,000, but that was not <Col N="2251" /> the total amount paid over by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government to the local authorities in the year 1932. Not at all.  They voted that sum, but when it came down to a question of payment they withheld £211,000 from the local authorities on account of land annuities not collected, so that the net payment to the local authorities in the year 1931-2 by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was £1,736,000, and that figure is to be compared with £1,750,000 which will be not merely voted but given to the local authorities in the present year.</P>
    <P>There is nothing being withheld from the local authorities in respect of land annuity arrears.  On the contrary, whenever arrears do come in, arrears in respect of the years preceding our advent to office, they will be given out to the local authorities from whom they had been withheld previously.  Therefore the local authorities in this year&mdash; the local authorities as distinct from the ratepayers&mdash;will this year, notwithstanding all the trying circumstances of the time, be very much better off than they were in the year 1931-2 when, according to the statements we have heard from the benches opposite, the then Government was in a much better position to deal more generously with them than we are.  So much for the local authorities.</P>
    <P>What about the farmers?  They are going to receive £2,450,000 by way of bounties and subsidies, which, as I have already argued, and as Mr. Baldwin and other responsible members of the British Government have admitted, are counteracting the effect of the import duties imposed by them.  In addition to that the farmers are to receive a permanent reduction in the annuities payable by them of over £2,000,000 per annum, going to the individual farmers. What is the position therefore?  We find that the local authorities&mdash;corporations which are maintained not merely by the farmers&mdash;one would have thought that the farming community are the only section to be considered if one were to listen to the speeches that have been made from the benches opposite&mdash;and which are representative <Col N="2252" /> not merely of the farmers, but of the farm labourers, merchants and shopkeepers in the towns&mdash;are going to be not less better off than they were in the years 1931-32.  The farmers themselves, that special, select section of the community, are going to be better off by £2,000,000 in the year 1933-34 than they were in 1931-32.  I think the only conclusion that can be drawn from that is that we have not been unfair to the farmers, if we have not been unduly generous towards them.  World prices have declined.  Economic conditions everywhere are depressed.  Every section of the community is affected, but every section of the community must contribute to the Exchequer, and must contribute to that £1,750,000 which is being spent on the agricultural grant in relief of the rates upon agricultural land.  Every section of the community must contribute directly or indirectly.  In order to make possible the reduction of the land annuities every section of the community has to contribute to that £2,000,000 which is inuring to the direct and immediate benefit of the farmers.</P>
    <P>In no other country at the present moment is so much being done for agriculture out of the public purse as is being done here.  In no other country is every section of the community contributing as much as it is contributing here.  I know very well that every self-respecting farmer of this country&mdash;who looks at the position of everybody around him; who sees people with nothing to sustain them, not even a half acre of land and a labourer's cottage, having to pay out something when they buy tea, sugar or tobacco, to help to make up this grant; who has a sense of civic duty; who realises that he is a part of the nation and does not wish to stand apart from it&mdash;feels that as much is being done for him by this Government as could be done for him by any Government that would have to hold, as a Government is bound to hold, the scales evenly between all sections of the community.  We are not insensible, as the Minister for Agriculture has stated, to the sufferings which the farmers are going through at the present moment, but neither can we <Col N="2253" /> permit ourselves to lose sight of the fact that when this dispute is settled and when an agreement is reached it is the farmers who will retain for all time the splendid fruits of victory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to put one question to the Minister.  He has made a statement that cattle were 17/- a cwt. at Leicester some time ago. He tried to persuade the House that the farmers are in as good a position to-day as if there were no economic war.  I will just take a ten cwt. beast at 17/- a cwt.&mdash;£8 10s.  On that the farmer is paying a levy of £6, leaving a balance of £2 10s. on which he gets a bounty of £1 15s., making £4 5s. in all, less expenses.  Would not that farmer be getting £8 10s., less expenses, if there were no economic war?  Let us take the poor parts of my own constituency and the County Kerry.  An eight cwt. fat beast in Leicester at 17/- a cwt. would realise £6 16s.  After deducting the tax of £6 the farmer would actually get 16/-. Adding the bounty of £1 15s. to that sum, he gets a total of £2 11s., less expenses.  Does the Minister want to convince the people of the country that they are better off than if there were no economic war?  That is a fair question.  I will write it down for the Minister if he wishes.</P>

      <P>Last year when this question of law charges was before this House and when an Estimate similar to the present Estimate was being considered, I pointed out to the House that the Attorney-General is an independent officer, that he is not under the control of the Executive Council, that he stands by himself with his own responsibility, his own rights and his own duties with which the Executive Council have no power to interfere.  I pointed out, moreover, that he has no responsibility to the Executive Council. I pointed out that he has got the responsibility of the administration of the criminal law when it comes into court in this State and that he and he alone is responsible for miscarriages of justice which are due to the action taken by State prosecutors whom he has appointed.  It is no excuse for the Attorney-General to say that the Executive Council are afraid of the I.R.A.  It is no excuse for him to say that the I.R.A. can dictate the policy of the Executive Council as they wish.  It is no excuse for him when he shows himself afraid of that body &mdash;when he shows that whenever they face him he is ready to run away from that body&mdash;to say that the Executive Council as a whole, or the Minister for Justice as an individual, are willing to run away from that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had last week in the County Kerry a flagrant example of the Attorney-General being afraid to carry out his plain obvious duty.  We had a flagrant example of a case in which a member of the I.R.A. defied and successfully defied the administration of the law.  It was the case of a man called John O'Connor who came from the neighbourhood of Tralee.  He was charged with larceny, with the possession of a shot-gun and eight cartridges.  That man was arraigned before the Circuit Court of the County Kerry on the 25th April last.  He showed his contempt for the court.  He <Col N="2255" /> refused to plead.  The Attorney General was there represented.  The indictment was read out to the man. He was charged with it and with the offence therein contained.  He refused to plead.  He was remanded in custody.  He went on hunger strike and immediately because he refused to obey the law, because he refused to recognise the court which charged him with larcenies and because he said he would have nothing to do with the court he was released in five days by the Minister for Justice.  I pass from that case because we are not now discussing the Vote for the Minister for Justice.  The case came on last week again.  What was the attitude of the Attorney-General?  He has got a man here before the court tried by him before the court indicted by him before the court as the Attorney-General for this State.  In his opinion last April there was a case to be investigated by a jury.  The magistrate had returned him.  It was a <i>prima facie</i> case against the man.  But the man defied the law and what is the answer?  A <i>nolle prosequi.</i>  The State dropped the prosecution.  The man goes free.  Why?  What possible and conceivable reason is there except that this man has defied the law, that he will not recognise the court?  What principle would flow from that action of the Attorney-General?  What principle has he established by that action? Let a man defy the court, let him refuse to recognise the court and then that man can go scot-free.  That is the attitude that the Attorney-General has taken up in the administration of law in this country&mdash;that those persons who defy the law, those persons who say they are not amenable to the courts&mdash; because they say they are not amenable to the courts&mdash;are to be allowed go scot-free.  I say that there is no justification for the action of the Attorney-General.</P>
    <P>We see cases of this kind every day in the papers.  For instance in yesterday's papers we had a case where a man defied the courts again.  In that case a Deputy of this House went as a visiting justice and told these men who <Col N="2256" /> had defied the court that they were putting the Government in an awkward position by not recognising the court. The Minister for Justice promptly let these men out.  Similar action by the members of the Executive Council is no palliation of the action of the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General has got his own duties and he discharges those duties, and no matter what may be the cringing attitude of the Executive Council as a whole towards the I.R.A., that cringing attitude adopted by them is no justification for a cringing attitude being adopted by the Attorney-General.  When he comes in his capacity as Attorney-General of the Irish Free State and prosecutes a man against whom there is a <i>prima facie</i> case, the man being sent on for trial, he has his duties to discharge.</P>
    <P>Let us turn now to another example, a very flagrant example, of the manner in which the Attorney-General discharges the duties of his high office. It has been very often said that the bully is always a coward.  I have given the House an example of the Attorney-General's cowardice.  Now let me turn and give the House an example of the Attorney-General's bullying.  Let me draw the attention of the House to the way in which the Attorney-General was afraid to face men who defied the law and contrast it with the way in which he deals with men who are upright, honourable citizens of this State. There is a statute called the Official Secrets Act.  That statute was invoked by the Attorney-General during the course of this year.  I do not think that in any other State in the world has the Attorney-General or a State prosecutor ever covered himself or the administration of justice with such ridicule as the present Attorney-General did by the way in which he behaved in that case.  It was a case which caused a considerable amount of sensation all over the State at the time it was heard.  It is a case the facts of which I believe are familiar to every Deputy in this House.  Therefore I will summarise them very briefly.</P>
    <P>An officer of the Guards, with the authority of his then superior officer, <Col N="2257" /> the officer in charge of his Department, collected some documents to send to a Professor of the University in Cork who was writing a work on Bolshevism and kindred associations.  The way in which that matter was dealt with in the earlier stages is most extraordinary. The head of the Department had been changed a very short time before, a few days before, and the new head of the Department was informed by a detective officer that he was to bring these papers to a very distinguished military officer in this State.  If there had been any objection to these documents being conveyed one would have thought that the head of the Detective Division would have sent for his subordinate and would have said to him, &ldquo;Why are these documents being sent out?  What is the explanation of this?&rdquo; Nothing of the kind happened and it would appear that a deliberate effort was being made to found criminal prosecutions against these persons. The detective officer who had been told to bring these particular documents to the barracks where the inspector had directed him to bring them proceeds, not to carry out instructions, but to hand them over to the chief of the department and they are kept completely secret for some time.  This detective officer who, on his own admission in the court, is certainly one of the most first-class liars that walks the streets of this City or walks the roads of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling, sir.  That was the type of witness whom the Attorney-General produced in court and that was the position.  I am not sure, I do not know, I cannot know, I have no means of knowing, when into this very discreditable transaction the Attorney-General entered.  But I do know this much, that a prosecution cannot be brought in this State without the authority of the Attorney-General.  A prosecution cannot be brought without the fiat of the Attorney-General and I know that before these men could be arrested the fiat of the Attorney-General had to be got.  Here was a case in which one would have thought the Attorney-General, instead of issuing his fiat, would have said &ldquo;Let us get an explanation, let us see what has happened, <Col N="2259" /> let us go and ask first and see if there is any explanation.&rdquo;  That course was not followed.  The Attorney-General's fiat was given, the prosecution was started and these officers were arrested, one of them, though known to be in delicate health, at midnight.</P>
      <P>Then the Attorney-General comes upon the scene in person.  This was going to be a very great State case. Never before, I believe, in the history of the Irish Bar has an Attorney-General gone down to a police court to prosecute in person.  This case is a case of such tremendous importance that, so anxious is the Attorney-General about it, he sets a new precedent. For the first time, I believe, in the history of the Irish Bar the Attorney-General went down in person to a police court to prosecute.  Here is where the vindictiveness comes in, here is where the bullying process begins. These men are men who held high positions in the State and they discharged their duties to the State well and worthily.  They apply for bail. There is no conceivable reason why these men should not be granted bail. No one, for a moment, ever thought that either of them would break his bail bonds if he were granted bail, and leave the country.</P>

    <P>But the Attorney-General must have his whack at them and the Attorney-General opposes the granting of bail in order that these men, against whom this charge is brought, these untried men, these innocent men, will have the indignity of spending a few days in prison.  It is for that&mdash;and it could have been for no other reason, because no sane man could have thought either of them had the slightest intention of breaking his bonds&mdash;the Attorney-General again comes to court to prosecute. We hear a lot about these documents and about the Official Secrets Act and what an important thing it is.  What these documents were I do not know, but I do know that in the course of the hearing it was remarked by the judge that one of the documents in regard to which this prosecution was being launched was a <Col N="2260" /> printed document that could have been bought and was on sale for sixpence or something thereabouts.  That was one of the documents which was the subject-matter of this great prosecution. What the other documents were I do not know, but I do know that it transpired in court that those documents were documents that were somewhat old.</P>
    <P>They were not documents that come into the possession of the Government within a few months of the previous year or the previous year and a half. They were documents that had been in the possession of the Guards for a very considerable period of time.  I knew every single document relating to Saor Eire, or the I.R.A., in the possession of the Guards, or the Department of Justice.  Therefore these particular documents must, at some time, have been subject to my scrutiny.  I say and I believe that there is hardly one of these documents, if there was even one, that I had not alluded to, and quoted, in this House, at some time or other. If there was one of these documents that I had not quoted to this House, then I say that document was not quoted because it was entirely too insignificant to merit attention.  It was in face of documents of that class that this prosecution was allowed.</P>
    <P>We saw all this great flair, the Attorney-General in the police courts, coming along with all his forces.  We had the Attorney-General, head of the Irish Bar, in the police courts and, afterwards, appearing before a jury in Green Street.  And after having listened to all his evidence, and to his witnesses and after he had brought forward every document, that jury intervened, and stopped the case as soon as they heard the evidence of the defendants. Here you have this case brought forward with all this great flourish of trumpets, and because the jury thought it so shockingly weak, they stopped it in the middle of it.  The Attorney-General was there in person to prosecute, yet because that case was so desperately weak the jury stopped it before it could be put to them by the judge.  That is a very rare thing to <Col N="2261" /> happen.  It is very rare that a case is ever presented that is in itself so desperately weak that the jury takes it upon itself to stop it before the finish. It is still more rare that a case, so weak in itself as that the jury has to stop it even with the Attorney-General present, is allowed to be prosecuted. There is a little more.  This case was heard not merely by a jury, but there was a judge there also.  What was the reaction on the judge?  He suggested next day to the Attorney-General that considering the nature of the case&mdash;I am not quoting his exact words, but only giving the substance of his remarks&mdash;that considering the nature of the case and the record of the officers who were prosecuting, the State ought to pay the expenses of the trial.  No doubt, therefore, we have the view of the jury that the case was so desperately weak and unfair to the men charged, that it ought never to have been brought and they stopped it in the middle of it, and following on that you get the view of the judge, that the very exceptional step of paying the cost of the defence of the accused persons should be taken in this case.</P>
    <P>Now I have contrasted the ways in which the Attorney-General administers the law.  If a man defies the law the Attorney-General does not come down to prosecute him.  Oh, no, the Attorney-General runs away from such a prosecution.  But in the case of men who have served the State honourably and well for many years, even if one or two only have committed an indiscretion, the Attorney-General, riding forth in full panoply of war, must march out to battle.  Is that the way the law should be administered in this State?  Is that the way the Attorney-General thinks the people of this State will come to have respect for the administration of the law?  After all, in this country, as in every other country, perhaps more in this country than any other country in the world, it is advisable that every single thing should be done that would cause the administration of the law, the procedure of the courts and the procedure and practice of the Attorney-General in the courts to be kept above the shadow of a shade of suspicion.  How <Col N="2262" /> are we to have a law-abiding State if we find that men by their actions, and actions speak more potently than words, can defy the law and become law-breakers with impunity?  How are we, in these circumstances, to have law-abiding citizens?  If there is one thing calculated to break down a law-abiding spirit it is that method of showing by your example that if you are law-abiding every single resource of the State will be brought against you; but if you face an investigation, and it is shown that you are not law-abiding, the State will put its tail between its legs and let you walk out of court a free man.  Is that the way the people of this country are to be brought to admire and to believe in the administration of the law?</P>
    <P>I know the Attorney-General may get up and say it is part of a policy.  He will say, of course, there are no I.R.A. in this country at all; that since the Oath was taken out of the Constitution the I.R.A. have completely vanished. We were told that that would be so, and we will be told now that it is so. Everybody knows they have not vanished.  They are here and they can, with impunity, carry arms.  They have come in and defied the courts.  They can laugh at the law and still nothing is done.  All that is done is that a <i>nolle prosequi</i> is put in by the Attorney-General. If the accused is by any means convicted and sent to prison the prerogative of mercy will be exercised by the Minister for Justice.  I venture to inform the Attorney-General that he is taking the wrong course.  By these acts of cowardice the Attorney-General is not going to kill any illegal association or any association that wishes to destroy the welfare of this State by force of arms.  It is all very well for the Executive Council to take this or that particular man and say: &ldquo;Here is a job for you in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Keep quiet now!&rdquo;  Or to say to another man: &ldquo;We will make you an income-tax collector, and hope you will keep quiet.&rdquo;  It is all very well to take up that attitude but it is going to fail.  If you buy off these men, you may be sure that there are plenty of others who will come along to be bought off also. Exactly in the same way by entering <Col N="2263" /> a <i>nolle prosequi</i> against particular men you are not going to prevent persons being members of illegal associations; and you are not going to prevent people willing to defy the court and defy its jurisdiction from doing so.  You will not turn them away from courts and make them peaceful, law-abiding citizens by refusing to prosecute them when you bring them to court.  The whole thing is wrong.  It is wrong from start to finish.  Everybody in this State should be made to obey the law and everybody in this State should be made to respect the law, and the Attorney-General, who ought to be the great upholder of the law, is leading the law fast into the disrespect of law-abiding persons.</P>

      <P>Had I not listened to a similar diatribe from the Deputy last year, I might be disposed to take more seriously what he has said.  Last year he indicted me for my administration of the law during the preceding six or seven months and he singled out two instances upon which he made an attack upon me.  A considerable time has now elapsed during which I have had the administration of the law in my hands, and I think I can claim that at the present moment there is respect for the law. I would venture almost to suggest that there is more respect for the law at the present moment than there was during the previous régime.  I challenge any Deputy in this House&mdash;I shall deal in a moment with the one or two cases to which the Deputy has referred&mdash;to say that in my administration of the law or in my decisions as to whether prosecutions shall or shall not take place I have been swayed by any consideration other than that my duty is to enforce the law.  I accepted that last year and I still accept it&mdash;that in this matter I am sole judge and completely independent of the Executive.  I have no right whatsoever to have regard to policy.  I must take the law as I find it and administer the law as I find it, and no consideration should sway me from that course.  I think I may claim that my conduct of the office during the time I have held that office has <Col N="2264" /> not in any way led any section of the community to believe that they can flout the law in any way.</P>
      <P>I have been criticised in a directly opposite manner from that in which the Deputy has criticised me.  I think the Deputy has been most unfair both last year and this year in suggesting that I was &ldquo;dragging my office in the mire,&rdquo; as I think he said last year or in the two instances which he has dealt with, to suggest that I have in any way, by my behaviour in office, done anything to lower the position of the high office which I hold.  I think I may claim justifiably, although the Deputy has deliberately gone out of his way to avoid anything in the way of allowing or admitting it, that taking the whole course of my conduct during the time I have held office and the way my office has reacted on the country, that at the present moment there is respect for the law and that everybody, no matter what party they belong to, feel that they are going to get a just administration of the law.</P>
      <P>I think I have the confidence of the police authorities.  As the Deputy knows, most cases come to me after they have been handled by the police authorities.  It is only in very rare instances that cases come to me beforehand. In all the cases initiated by the Guards, with their knowledge of the law or under the instruction of the State solicitors, I think that I could number the cases in which I have written <i>nolle prosequi</i> on the files on the fingers of one hand and I think that the courts are quite satisfied that they are directed by me and required by me to administer the law as they find it and to show no favour to any class or section of the community.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has singled out two instances during the past year.  One of these cases was the O'Connor case in Kerry and whether the Deputy, as he did last year, consciously or unconsciously, has omitted certain important facts in the case or not, I do not know. Whether he has done it consciously or unconsciously I cannot say.</P>

      <P>The O'Connor case was not accurately related by the Deputy.  I directed the prosecution of this man O'Connor from Kerry.  He was charged in the District Court before the district justice on a date, I think, early in the month of February.  On that occasion, I understand that he took up the attitude of refusing to recognise the court.  He was returned for trial by the district justice to be tried at the court which was to be held in Tralee on the 25th April.  He was offered bail but declined it.  He went to gaol and spent from the early part of February to the end of April in custody.  The case came on in the Circuit Court and I had counsel there briefed to prosecute him. He was duly arraigned and, as the Deputy says, he took up the attitude of refusing to recognise the court.  The matter then passed out of my hands. I have no jurisdiction over the court when a prisoner refuses to recognise it.  It is none of my affair as to how the judge deals with what is known as contempt of court.  The Deputy knows that.</P>

      <P>Allow me to show where the Deputy has left out some part of the story.  The judge, dealing with this matter which was within his jurisdiction, had the option, if he wished to do so, to go on with the trial and either punish or not punish the prisoner for the offence which was created by the Juries Act. He took the course of sentencing O'Connor to a term of imprisonment of two or three months&mdash;I forget what was the amount at the moment.  The sentence was for contempt of court. That is where the Deputy made a mistake. He said that he was remanded &mdash;I forget the exact words.  O'Connor was sentenced for that offence and was transferred to Cork Prison.  Here <Col N="2266" /> is the point, which, I think, the Deputy omitted to mention, and which appeared in the newspapers.  On the following day, Judge MacElligott, who is a judge who has been in office, I think, since the Courts of Justice Acts were passed, and who was appointed under the régime which preceded us, came down to court and referred in open court to the case and to the conduct of O'Connor in refusing to recognise the court and to the action he had taken in consequence of that refusal, and he suggested to the Executive Council that in his opinion O'Connor should be released.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has a good deal to do with it.  The judge then said that had O'Connor been convicted for the offence with which he was charged, in view of the fact that he had already served from February to April, he would not give him a day's imprisonment.  Is not that important to the case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so. I think the Deputy might in fairness have told the whole story.  He admits that he knows all that appeared in the paper.  O'Connor, on the suggestion of the judge, was released and at that stage, as the Deputy well knows, the position was first of all, a rather difficult one.  The man was not on bail and the police, as the Deputy knows, in this case did not act without the report from the Guards in the locality, from the Commissioner, and so on, as to the difficulties in the position. Difficulties arose from the fact that this man who had been sentenced for this offence under the Jury Acts was then a free man.  Apart from that, I submit that, in this single instance, which in the whole 12 months which have elapsed since my last Vote has been the only case in which a <i>nolle prosequi</i> was entered, it was a reasonable and proper thing for me to enter a <i>nolle prosequi</i> in all the circumstances, taking into account that the <Col N="2267" /> judge, who would be the man to try the prisoner, had stated in open court that he would not have sentenced the man to a day's imprisonment, if he were found guilty.  That may or may not appeal to the Deputy as a justification but it might at least have been mentioned by him in his slashing condemnation of me.</P>
      <P>We will pass from that.  There have been, as the Deputy knows, several other instances of cases of a similar kind.  There was a case the other day in which a similar situation arose.  I have been confronted with it on several occasions, but I have not shirked my duty, and I am not going to shirk my duty.  I do not regard my particular action in that case as encouraging anybody to believe that I am going to shirk my duty.  I am not going to shirk my duty.  If any persons are found in the possession of arms and the police bring the matter to my notice, I will prosecute them and go through with the prosecution&mdash;let there be no mistake about it.  Anything I have done while I have been in office cannot be suggested as showing any contrary intention.  That is my firm intention until the law is changed. While the law is there prohibiting people from carrying arms I am determined, so far as I am concerned, if cases are brought to my notice, and evidence put before me, to see that the law is going to be enforced in that regard.</P>
      <P>As regards the O'Connell case, the Deputy again has painted a picture of what happened in that case which rather persuades me to believe that any of my activities are viewed by the Deputy with a jaundiced eye.  He seems to take a particular delight in singling out anything he can find to say against me.  I find, even in speeches down the country, that he singles me out and refers away back to things I said years ago.  I saw the other day that he made a cross-roads speech in which he made an attack on me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>He came then to the Hogan-O'Connell case.  In that case I accept responsibility for the prosecution.  The papers came to me as they must in cases under the Official Secrets Act, for my <i>fiat.</i>  I had nothing to act upon save the police report as to what was the information in their possession at the time.  The Deputy has referred to the fact that the principal witness, upon whose evidence the prosecution was founded in court, subsequently admitted that he told lies. That, of course, said in that bald way, might suggest that it was a very foolish thing to depend upon such evidence.  I presume the Deputy is referring to statements which he made to the officers who were charged when they sought to get from him what he had done with the documents.  The story of the case, I suppose, is so well-known that it is hardly necessary to go over it.  But what happened was this: When this officer was handed by Inspector O'Connell a bundle of documents he was told to deliver these to Colonel Hogan at Portobello Barracks.  Instead of delivering them to Colonel Hogan he handed them over to his superior officer.  In keeping from Colonel Hogan the fact that he had handed them over to his superior officer he did what I am quite certain the Deputy well knows he authorised his own officers to do in the course of his administration of the office of Minister for Justice&mdash;he made evasive answers which were untrue.  I regarded the case as a serious case.  I quite admit that.  It was the first definite case we got hold of in which we were in a position to show that an attempt was being made to hand over to persons, who had no authority to receive them, official documents.  The Official Secrets Act, in the minds of a great many people, is connected with the safety of the country in time of war. The Deputy is a lawyer, and he well knows that the Official Secrets Act has two aspects: one designed to protect the country against the betrayal of <Col N="2269" /> official secrets to enemies of the country and the other designed to protect official documents and official information of any kind, which comes into a person's possession by reason of their official capacity.</P>
      <P>Just before this case, if I might pass from it for a moment, there was a case in London where the editor of one of the leading newspapers was charged under that Act with having received, and the officer who gave it was charged with having given, a copy of a will from Somerset House.  If I recollect aright, the Attorney-General went down to the Magistrate's Court in London and prosecuted for that offence.  This person handed out a copy of a will the night before probate had officially been granted.  It was in the newspaper office at ten o'clock in the morning and it was printed in that day's issue of the paper.  It was available to all the papers at four o'clock in the evening. Notwithstanding that fact, such a serious view was taken of the leaking out of that particular document, and so anxious were the Government there to prevent any looseness in that regard, that they pounced upon the man who handed it out and he was convicted and sentenced.  The gentleman who received the document on behalf of the paper was also convicted and sentenced, and on appeal the convictions and sentences were affirmed.  I forget the term of the sentences, but they were very severe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we had in this case what I regard as a much more serious position in which there were documents which I was informed by the responsible officer in charge of that branch of the police&mdash;my judgment does not run to such an extent that I am entitled to place it against his in a matter of the kind&mdash;were of a secret nature and that it was most important that their confidential nature should be preserved. The detective officer employed in the headquarters of the branch, feeling that something was going amiss when he was handed these documents by Inspector O'Connell, reported the matter to Colonel Broy, who was then in charge of the department.  I got the documents and I looked at them.  I <Col N="2270" /> did not read every single solitary line of them, and I doubt very much whether the Deputy if he had read those documents would have made the statement he made in this House to-day that they were not of a secret nature, and that their secrecy should not have been preserved.  The documents were varied and numerous. Some of them, as was stated by the judge in court, and as everybody who was there knew, were publications which could be bought in the shops in the city, but they happened to be with the bundle which was handed out and which were simply torn from the files by Inspector O'Connell.  No record was kept of the documents taken out. They were thrown into a basket and left there until suddenly one day he bethought himself that he had been told by a superior officer to hand them out.  They had been left there in the basket and were then bundled into an envelope.</P>
    <P>Again, on the question of whether those documents should not have been handed out to a person who had no authority to receive them, when this case was in the District Court&mdash;and the Deputy knows this&mdash;an application was made to District Justice Cussen by Mr. John Fitzgerald, who represented the accused, to have access to those documents.  I agreed. I said that I did not wish to hamper the defence in any way, but I told the district justice what I had been told about their nature, and the importance of preserving their secrecy.  The district justice said from the bench that he had read the documents, and agreed absolutely with me that they could not be allowed to get publicity.  So strongly did he hold in that regard that he laid down as a condition for the inspection of those documents by the defence that they were to be kept in a safe in the courts, were only to be inspected in the presence of a police officer, and that no copies were to be made of them.  Does the Deputy still hold that they were not secret documents?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, and that that was a request made by the Attorney-General.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just stated that the district justice did not yield to my request in another matter which the Deputy has referred to.  He did not show that he was ready to yield to my request simply because it was my request.  He stated in the court that he had read the documents, and that the documents should not be revealed.  The Deputy must be perfectly well aware that it was a most unfortunate case from the point of view of the police.  Several of the documents which were on the files of the court were not read to the jury. The jury did not see the documents, and did not, in my opinion, appreciate their importance, I do not want to criticise in any way the action of the jury, which I am prepared to accept, but I do want to say that the story of how these documents were obtained would convey to any intelligent man that it was of the utmost importance that they should not leak out.  Some of the documents may not have contained matter of great importance, but the method in which they were obtained showed that the whole police system of capturing documents of this nature, dealing with Communism as these were, was imperilled by the fact that this looseness was allowed to prevail in the police department.  The Deputy quite well knows that the police had certain methods of getting hold of those documents; that they photographed these documents; that only a limited number of photographs were taken; that two of those copies were sent to a certain officer to be put away in a safe; that the other two copies were sent to the headquarters of that branch; that one of the copies was retained there, and the other sent to Scotland Yard.</P>

      <P>I am stating here, and I am willing to produce the documents to the Deputy if he doubts me for one moment, that several of the documents involved in this case and handed out in this loose manner were documents which were obtained by police methods, and the mere revelation of the fact that they could get out of the police department was bound to, and I am quite certain did, stop the flow of such information to the police.  Yet the Deputy says that the case was not a serious one, and that I was not entitled to take a serious view of it.</P>
      <P>Another type of document in the case were documents which came here from Scotland Yard, confidential documents sent over by the English police in order to enable the police here to keep track of Communist activities. Those documents were handed out by Inspector O'Connell, under, as it turned out at the end of the case, directions from Colonel Neligan, and were handed over to Colonel Hogan for transmission to his brother.  I am not going to, and I did not in the course of the case, make any aspersions on either Colonel Hogan or his brother, or their <i>bona fides</i>, or deny that Professor Hogan is a reputable historian, who probably wanted those documents for the purpose for which he said he wanted them.  I made no suggestion against him in the course of the case, but I think the Government were entitled to take serious notice of the fact&mdash;however well intentioned were the recipients of those documents, and however innocent the channel through which they were going to Professor Hogan&mdash;that a responsible police officer, an officer in the most important branch of the whole of the service of the Government, with documents under his control which, above all other documents, should be guarded in complete confidence, dealt with them in that loose manner.</P>

      <P>I will pass to one other aspect of the matter for a moment.  The previous Administration at one time considered the question as to whether it would be advisable to publish these documents.  In order to satisfy themselves as to whether it would be in the interests of the police force or in the interests of the public that they should be published they invited Colonel Neligan&mdash;they invited first of all the Commissioner and the Commissioner transferred the minute to Colonel Neligan&mdash;to give an opinion as to whether those documents should be published or not.  It was quite remarkable the care with which that question was considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minute as to whether certain documents should or should not be published was passed from rank to rank, right down through the whole of the detective branch, and each officer was asked to give his opinion as to whether it would be in the public interest that these documents should be published.  We had a report coming from the lowest rank up, passing through Colonel Neligan and passing on to the Commissioner, showing their opinion that it was not in the public interest that those documents should be published.  Yet three months after we get into office Colonel Neligan meets Professor Hogan at the Horse Show.  What is the proceeding there? Professor Hogan asks Colonel Neligan might he have some documents about Communism.  Colonel Neligan in his evidence admitted that he went back to the office, and I think on that occasion he also used Inspector O'Connell to detach the documents from the file. The documents were detached from the file, put in an envelope and posted to Cork.  No record was made of them, and until the case was at hearing Coloney Broy or anybody else did not know that a bundle of documents had gone out to Professor Hogan from that office.  That was the first instance.  I think there was a second instance in which more documents were sent out, and so careless were they about the way they sent them that Professor <Col N="2275" /> Hogan wrote back and said that most of the documents were no use and could he send more valuable stuff. The bundle brought to our notice was the bundle of more valuable stuff, going out in the casual and careless manner which I have just described.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The case was presented to me in the district court, and I make no apologies for it.  I consider it is of vital importance that we should bring home to every officer in the service that any documents which come into their hands by reason of their official positions should be treated as secret and confidential.  We had our own good reasons for that.  It was necessary that the first instance we got of this sort of thing should be dealt with in a drastic manner.  We could have dealt with the matter in another way.  I suppose the previous Administration would probably have dismissed everybody.  We prefer, as we have tried to do in every way, to try the ordinary methods of law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that I went down to court and prosecuted in this case.  The case was presented, the documents were there in court.  They were examined by the District Justice, and everybody who knows District Justice Cussen will admit that in dealing with a case of <Col N="2276" /> this kind he goes to the most scrupulous care in making himself familiar with the evidence.  He examined the documents and gave his view about the documents.  In considering the secrecy of these documents and my ideas as to the secrecy of these documents, I do want the House to know that I do attach importance to the fact that whether the documents were secret from the public point of view or not, that the officers who had taken them had no right to exercise their judgment as to what was to be passed out to the general public.</P>
      <P>However, District Justice Cussen heard the case with the greatest care, and when the case for the prosecution closed what happened?  Defending counsel, Mr. Fitzgerald, one of the ablest counsel at the Bar, got up and said to the District Justice: &ldquo;I have no reason why the accused should not be returned for trial,&rdquo; and then we have the Deputy here suggesting that I had no grounds to prosecute.  Surely when counsel for the accused offered no explanation and made no opposition to the case being sent forward, that disposes of the Deputy's charge.  The case was sent forward to the higher court.  Here I make no apology for my action in the case.  I do not think it needs an apology.  What happened in the course of the case is known.  We had established beyond yea or nay that these documents were official documents. We had the evidence of the officers concerned that in their opinion not alone were they official documents which were not to be handed out in any event, but that they were of the type of official documents which should be most carefully guarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the defence was opened the defence was this, that Colonel Neligan when in charge of that particular office, had given instructions to the officer immediately below him, Inspector O'Connell, to hand out those documents. I think most Deputies will agree that that was a most extraordinary action for Colonel Neligan to take. Inspector O'Connell acted on those instructions.  Colonel Neligan left the office in December.  This incident happened, I think, in February, and Inspector O'Connell, six weeks or more <Col N="2277" /> after Colonel Neligan had left the office still acted on that authority.  He did not come to his superior officer, Colonel Broy, and say: &ldquo;Look here, Colonel Hogan wants these documents for his brother.&rdquo;  Not at all.  He completely ignores his superior officer and hands these documents to a junior detective to be transmitted, in the loose way described, to Colonel Hogan.  If ever there was a case in which it was obvious that a conspiracy was on foot to get these documents out, that was a case, and on the evidence which was then before me there was no course open to me, if I wished to carry out the law as it should be carried out, but to have invoked the law and prosecuted. I have nothing whatsoever to apologise for in this prosecution and there is nothing that I have reason to be <Col N="2278" /> ashamed of in it.  I do not think I need say any more in answer to the diatribe that has been delivered against me by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  I repeat what I said at the beginning.  I have been in office now since this Government took over office and the House is in a position to judge whether, in the course of my administration of the law, I have allowed any political considerations to influence me.  No Deputy in the House can say that I have ever been influenced in the discharge of the duties of the office by political consideration. If that is a crime, I plead guilty to having done my duty.  I agree that it is my duty to see the law administered fairly and honestly and so long as I am in office I intend to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy must be aware, the collection of quit rents is not the only function of this office. It happens to be the main current function of the office.  The total rental comes to about £8,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it costs over £4,000 to collect about £8,000, and we call that economy!</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I pointed out that that is not the main function of the office.  It might be said to be the main function, but almost equally important is the fact that the office is utilised where sales are made through the Land Commission.  Every case of a sale made through the Land Commission has to be made through the Quit Rent Office.</P>
      <P>Investigation of title may be made to ascertain the total of all quit rents and reversions.  These are laborious matters and have to be performed with the greatest care because quit rents, as well as all other charges on the land, have to be extinguished in their progress through the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree these operations and functions of the office are important, but I cannot agree with the major portion of the work of this office which costs so much.  This Estimate comes up year by year and always practically for the same amount, notwithstanding the fact that the quit rents are a reducing sum.  In order to justify the retention of this department we are told that portion of its work is inquiry into matters referred to it by the Land Commission. It appears to me that examination of that character could equally well be done by the Land Commission itself, without reference to this Department. I would like some justification from the Minister for the continuance of this Department further than what we have heard this year and on previous occasions.  The sum of £4,000 for collecting £8,000 a year is, I think the House will agree, an excessive amount.</P>

      <P>Of course, but I am not prepared to say that for the expenditure of £1,000 what the Deputy suggests could be done.  I am sure that if we provided a certain sum of money to operate these functions, the collection of quit rents and so on, it could be done, but this is not the only function of that office.  They have the maintaining of Crown property transferred to Saorstát by Article 11 of the Constitution, and, in addition, the roads, paths and shores to inland lakes and other rights of property.  The importance of the office is growing and references to it arising out of legal proceedings are continually increasing.</P>

      <P>This has nearly always been the attitude adopted on previous occasions in connection with this Vote. It comes up here again just as if no useful purpose was served by debates on these estimates.  I do not want to press the Minister unduly.  I am sure he is as anxious as I am that economies should be effected but here is an outstanding case where economies could be effected.  It is equally difficult to get the present Minister to move in the matter as it was his predecessor.  They all talk about economy when in opposition but when they are in a position to effect economies I do not find them so interested in economy.  I do not want to blame the present Minister unduly.  I am quite satisfied, from information that I have about this Department, that the duty it discharges could be equally well discharged by a couple or one additional <Col N="2282" /> official on the staff of the Land Commission.  The work they do is an off-shoot of the work of the Land Commission and I am satisfied it could be equally well done by that Department with the assistance of a couple of officials.  I hope, having said so much on this occasion, that it will not be necessary to press this matter to a vote on a future occasion.  Let us hope that between this and the next occasion on which this Vote comes up we will find that something has been done by those who are then responsible for the Government which has not been done by those in power at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make quite clear that the possibilities of economy in this Department have been investigated.  We are in this position. We inherited this Department from our predecessors.  The people in this Department have special knowledge. If we were to close this Quit Rent Office we would have to employ the same persons to do the work if we transferred it to the Land Commission. These people have specialised in this Department and have been a long time in the Department.  It is, if you like, a sort of pigeon-hole into which they have drifted, and in which they have spent their official lives.  Everyone of them is a transferred officer.  They are discharging special functions for which they have specialised and have a special knowledge.  If we close down that office these, being transferred officers, have rights under Article X, and if they go out they will possibly cost the State as much when drawing their pensions and doing nothing as they cost the State now, when the State, at any rate, has the advantage of their specialised knowledge.  As I say, this is one of the difficulties that we inherited in the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to follow the Minister's argument we cannot hope that any estimate for the Government service in the future will be reduced. I recognise the difficulty.  I am sure that all these officers who have given valuable services in the past if they were transferred to other departments would give good and useful service to <Col N="2283" /> the State.  I am not with the Minister when he says that no economy could be effected.  These transfers occur in ordinary business every day in the year with good effect and I cannot see why the same should not apply to Government departments.</P>

I should like to point out that, since the presentation of this Estimate to the Dáil, the Governor of the Bank of Ireland, on behalf of the Bank of Ireland, has very kindly offered to aggregate, for the purpose of calculating the remuneration of the Bank of Ireland and the National City Bank for the management of Government stocks, the amounts of the securities registered in the two banks, and to apply to the <Col N="2284" /> aggregate figure thus secured the rates of remuneration for unredeemed national debt prescribed in the Bank Act of 1892.  As a result of this, the cost on the new rate will be reduced by £7,325 2s. 10d., and the expenditure under the Estimate will be reduced accordingly by that amount.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £71,577 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1934, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including the Rates Advisory Committee, and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important change in the provision for this Department is an increase of £7,931, being an increase in respect of administrative expenses in connection with the Trade and Industries branch.  Owing to the greatly increased work which has arisen in connection with the Government's policy on the protection of industries, the development of Irish industries, and projects giving employment here, a great deal of extra work has arisen.  I think that Deputies will realise from the amount of legislation that has gone through the House, the <Col N="2287" /> amount of Orders that have been made regarding tariffs, and the greater complexity of that work, that in connection with the protective policy of the Government alone it is obvious that an additional staff would have been required.  An additional staff is also required to deal with many other matters, such as licences, giving information to persons anxious to start industries, and carrying on negotiations with firms which desire to start industries, or to develop their existing industries.  All that work has greatly increased and it has been found absolutely necessary to increase the staff in the Trade and Industries branch.  One superintending officer, four higher executive officers, nine junior executive officers, and ten clerical officers have been appointed. That accounts for the increase of £7,931 under that head.</P>
    <P>In connection with travelling expenses and incidental expenses there is a small casual decrease.  Telegrams and telephones show a casual increase of £110.  Fees of certifying surgeons is a nominal figure which arises because provision has to be made under the Factories and Workshops Act for certifying surgeons.  Sub-heads F. and G. do not call for any special consideration. As to sub-head H. (1)&mdash;Grant-in-Aid of the expenditure of the International Labour Organisation, League of Nations&mdash;the subscription is increased and a note in the Estimates, on page 56, explains how the contribution which the Saorstát makes to the International Labour Organisation is computed.  A certain provision is allocated between the different States and the amount attributable to the Irish Free State is £3,467.  There is, however, a loss on the exchange, as the contribution is payable in foreign currency, necessitating an additional payment of £1,645, or a total of £5,112.  There is a small increase in travelling and incidental expenses in connection with the travelling expenses to the International Labour Organisation.  A small amount is allowed for entertainment purposes and a sum of £70 or £80 has been found to be necessary to pay the <Col N="2288" /> travelling and subsistence allowances of each delegate attending.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I. makes provision for £4,700 for the Saorstát exhibit at the Chicago World Fair.  In last year's Estimate provision for £300 was made out of a total provision made by the Executive of £5,000.  This exhibit is being organised under the direction and supervision of the Saorstát Consul at New York, I think, and there is a very good exhibit indeed of Free State industrial products generally.  The Executive Council were satisfied that it would be worth while to spend this money, which may look large, but which we found on examination was the least that we would have to spend in order to get a fairly reasonable exhibit. As Deputies are aware, the costs are somewhat higher in the United States in connection with matters of this kind than elsewhere. There is also provision for £3,000 as a grant-in-aid of the Irish National Exhibition, Cork, 1933.  When the estimate was framed it was thought that the exhibition would be held and the Government were prepared, and made arrangements accordingly, to give a grant-in-aid of £3,000.  We now find that the exhibition is not to be held, so this money will be saved.</P>
    <P>In sub-head K. provision is made for the exhibit at the Paris Fair.  The Paris Fair is a yearly event and is of great commercial importance and arrangements were accordingly made to have an exhibit of Saorstát manufactured goods.  Most countries exhibit their goods at the Paris Annual Fair.  The firms who might be interested were circularised in the matter and a certain amount of success was achieved.  Not every firm, I must say, responded, but the exhibit will include such goods as Gaeltacht industrial products, biscuits, woollen piece goods, whiskey, hosiery, woollen and knitted goods, linen goods, arts and crafts, poplin and stout.  The reservation of space is calculated to cost about £150 and, in addition to that, it will be necessary to provide for the hire of an attendant, for decoration, and for some incidental expenses, details of which are not yet available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2289" /> I do not think there is any other matter arising on the expenditure under this Vote as compared with former years.  The important difference, as I have pointed out, is the increase in the provision for salaries, wages and allowances, owing to the extra provision of staff which has been found necessary in the Trade and Industries Branch and which could not be avoided in view of the Government policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been of great assistance to those who cannot read.  To those of us who can, and whose interest in this Estimate is to hear from the Minister what his Department has been doing for the development of Irish industry and commerce during the last 12 months, he has not been of very much assistance; in fact, he has been of no assistance.  He speaks of the additional cost of the Trade and Industries Branch.  The estimated expenditure on wages and salaries last year was £92,569, and the increased estimated expenditure in the Trade and Industries Branch this year over the expenditure last year is £10,600 odd. That is, the expenditure in that branch alone of his Department has gone up by one-ninth of the total expenditure on salaries and wages in his Department last year, and we have not heard one single word about what these officials are doing.  We are told about the exhibit in Chicago.  We are told that an exhibit is going to be made there of Free State industrial products generally.  We are not told that, when Irish artists were invited to send forward specimens of their paintings, the portrait of Arthur Griffith was submitted in response to that invitation and was turned down by the Minister's Department as not being a suitable subject to send in the art section to the Chicago Exhibition, because the subject of that portrait, who was one of the founders of the Free State, was not <i>persona grata</i> with the present Government.  We are told about some of these minor matters which, as I say, we could read about ourselves.  Even when the Minister does touch on the Chicago exhibit he <Col N="2290" /> keeps back very interesting and very important information.  While to-day he is boasting of Free State industrial products, the portrait painted by an eminent Irish artist of one of the men most responsible for the setting up of this State which is to have an exhibit at Chicago is not considered suitable to include in the art section of the Chicago Exhibition, because the person is not <i>persona grata</i> with the present Government.</P>
      <P>However, we are concerned here, in the discussion of the Estimate, with the Minister's Department and what it is doing.  While we had, in dealing with the Budget, a most exalted and enthusiastic description by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of what was happening in the country with regard to the development of industry and all that was going to happen, we now find, when it comes down to a critical discussion in Committee of this House on the Estimate for the Department, that the same silence has fallen over the Department of Industry and Commerce as fell so remarkably over the Department of Agriculture when the Minister for Agriculture came to introduce his Estimate here.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture is now visiting different parts of the country explaining that he sympathises with the farmers and that he knows they are in a bad condition.  Are we to understand that Irish industry is in a bad condition too?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when dealing with the Financial Resolution in the main Budget debate on 11th May last said, as reported in column 920 of the Official Reports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When we had the budgetary discussion here the Minister for Industry and Commerce made the following statement (column 920 of the Official Debates of the 11th May, 1933):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The fact is that despite world depression, despite the peculiar circumstances of the economic war we have made more progress, industrially, nationally and economically, during the past 12 months than was made in the previous 50 years. Deputies who controvert that statement have got to produce facts and have got to produce figures.  They must examine the records.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the silence of the Minister for Education in dealing with this Estimate in the absence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if he also was not at that time rather enthusiastic about the general development here.  In spite of the serious conditions generally throughout the world <Col N="2292" /> he said in column 887 of the Official Debates that we &ldquo;had not failed in regard to the provision of purchasing power for the people and were not failing in our endeavours to provide them with a better standard of living.&rdquo; The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that if we are to controvert his rather remarkable and enthusiastic statement that we have made more industrial progress during the last 12 months than this country had made for the last 50 years we should consult his figures.  The House knows how often and how strongly Deputies have pleaded here for a look at some of the information contained in the Minister's records.  We have been anxious to see what the records of development here are.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made various promises on different occasions.  He promised us on the 26th April a return of employment which he &ldquo;intended to submit to the House at the earliest possible moment.  That was when he was asked for information with regard to the employment in tariffed industries in respect of which a record had been kept half-yearly up to the 1st September, 1931, and the compilation of which was discontinued by the Minister.  He promised it would be issued in respect of the period to the 1st March last.  At any rate he promised us a return of Employment, which he &ldquo;intended to submit to the House at the earliest possible moment.&rdquo;  He promised us again on the 5th April last that he was issuing a Directory of Manufacturers, and that that would contain all the information which, judging from the attitude which he took, he thought proper to have in the hands of Deputies with regard to the development of Irish industry here.  He also promised us an analysis of the types of persons that were regarded as unemployed in the weekly record of unemployment figures, and he promised that the figures for the 16th January would be analysed. He told us he had been analysing them. On the 27th April last he told us that the result of that analysis was of definite interest, and that he would endeavour to make it available.  We have had no report of unemployment, except the reply to a Parliamentary <Col N="2293" /> question yesterday can be considered to be some kind of a report.  We have heard nothing at all from the Minister as to the position of the Directory of Manufacturers, and the Acting Minister told us yesterday that he did not intend to publish for the information of this House an analysis of the unemployment figures to 16th January last.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the position as disclosed in the figures quoted by the Minister yesterday.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question he gave figures as to the total number of persons employed in a certain number of industries, tariffs on which had been imposed by the previous administration, tobacco, boots and shoes etc., numbering, say, 19 in all.  When we come to look at those figures a rather remarkable state of affairs is disclosed. Deputies will remember that on the 13th January, I think it was, the Minister for Industry and Commerce made a pre-election statement giving information as to the number of new factories that have been set up in this country since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office.  Among the many factories set up he told us there were seven new furniture factories.  I endeavoured to find out some information with regard to those furniture factories, the amount of capital invested in them, whom they belonged to, where they were, the number of persons employed and the wages paid.  I was told that I could not get any information about them.  We were afterwards told by the Minister that the new factories were all located in the City of Dublin.  The Minister told us yesterday that the total number of persons employed in the furniture industry on the 1st March, 1933, was 1,400.  The last issued information from the Department of Industry and Commerce placed in the library shows that on the 1st September, 1931, 18 months before that date, there were 1,545 persons employed.  Whereas the Minister for Industry and Commerce tells this House that seven new furniture factories were set up in Dublin prior to 13th January, and since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office, although he will not tell us anything more about them, we now learn that <Col N="2294" /> the number of persons employed in the furniture making industry in this country has decreased by 145 persons in the 18 months ended 1st March.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If a factory is burned down, are the Government to blame?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate I am talking of the 1st March.  If there is anything in the point that a dislocation of industry has taken place as a result of a fire, we should like to hear from the Minister if the seven new factories have been burned down, and if the 145 persons who have become disemployed since September, 1931, were employed in the old factories.  At any rate we should like some information on the furniture industry, when we take into consideration that a further £10,000 is being spent on the administration of the Trade and Industries section of the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the new factories that were announced to have been established in the Minister's statement of the 13th January, new factories set up after the Fianna Fáil Government had come into office, there were two new factories for the manufacture of brushes and brooms.  Nevertheless, when we turn to the information provided yesterday as to the number of persons employed in the brush-making industry on the 1st March this year, and compare it with the number of persons employed on the 1st September, 1931, the last date for which the Minister permits us to get information, we find that the number of persons employed in the brush-making industry has gone down by 20 &mdash;from 351 to 331&mdash;in spite of the fact that two new factories have been set up in the meantime.  Both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce were challenging from a very high and toploftical understanding of things some of the statements made from these benches during the Budget debates on the question of tobacco manufacture in this country.  I pointed out that in the 12 months ended December last the total amount of unmanufactured tobacco brought into this country was down by one-third. That was for last year, as against the year before.  And I suggest that the <Col N="2295" /> assertion of the Minister for Education that the standard of living in this country was being maintained is untrue if the consumption of tobacco was to be taken as a test for that standard. The high financial understanding would, of course, scorn that idea.</P>
    <P>We look at the imports of unmanufactured tobacco for the first five months of that year, and whereas the imports of unmanufactured tobacco last year had gone down by one-third, the total amount of unmanufactured tobacco imported in the first five months of this year was only one-third of what was imported in the first five months of last year.  In the first five months of last year 5,105,000 lbs. of unmanufactured tobacco was imported as against 1,600,000 lbs. of unmanufactured tobacco this year.  The Minister will argue that it is all nonsense to suggest that that shows a lowering of the standard of living in the future or that it implies that there was to be less employment.  The figures quoted to the House showed that there were 86 fewer persons employed in the first six months of this year as compared with the number who had been employed in the six months ending September last year.</P>
    <P>Let us now take as examples furniture, brushes and tobacco.  In spite of the fact that in the Minister's opinion we have had more progress industrially in the last twelve months than in the previous 50 years, this is the position as far as these few industries are concerned:&mdash;As far as the total items quoted to us in reply to a question I put down yesterday, the position was that the total number of additional persons given employment in 18 months was 1,689 persons.  If the Minister will look back over the record of figures of which this is a continuation he will see that in six months from the 1st March, 1929, to 1st September, 1929, there had been 2,427 additional persons put into employment. So that for one of a rather important list of industries&mdash;a list of industries tariffed under a previous administration&mdash;there is a record surpassing the record of the last 50 years.  The record for the last 18 months falls below one <Col N="2296" /> particular six months of the previous administration.</P>
    <P>It was argued on the Budget statement that the fact that we were not getting in as much revenue from Customs was a very important fact, but that it was a splendid index to the growth of industry in this country. But when we turn to some of the items in respect of which we have a drop in revenue and Customs, if we expect from the Minister's statement an increase in industry here we are disappointed. For the 12 months ending December last the value of imports of men's and boys' suits fell from £207,000 to £154,000, that is a decrease of £53,000.  That is to say, the value of the import fell by one-fourth.</P>
    <P>When we turn to the first six months of this year we find that the value of imports is very much down as compared with the value of imports last year. The value of imports in the first five months of last year was £88,175, and the value of imports in the first five months of this year was £26,092.  That is a fall of over £62,000.  The imports had fallen by more than two-thirds. If the Minister will look at the figures he has published as to the average output of workers in the different industries he will see a drop of £62,000 in these imports.  That would represent if the work were taken on here, an increase in employment of about 1,200 persons.  But when we turn to the Minister's figures to see what additional persons have been employed, we find that whereas on the 1st September, 1931, there were 3,858 persons employed in the making of men's clothing, there was a reduction of 490 persons in these figures by the 1st March, 1933.  The number of persons employed has fallen to 3,368.  So that as to the £62,000 of a drop in imports in the first five months of this year, not only was not that found to mean an increase in employment in the number of persons making men's and boys' clothing, but actually there was a decrease compared with the number employed in the previous period.  That decrease amounted to 490 persons.  We now turn to the furniture business in the same way.  In the first five months of last year the value of furniture <Col N="2297" /> imported into the country was £41,350. The imports into this country in the first five months this year amounted to £17,711, so that there is actually a drop there of over £23,000.  I have already quoted the figures to show that there has been a drop in the number of persons employed in the furniture industry, so that the drop in the import of furniture is not met by an increase in employment given here this year.  If we are using less tobacco and therefore giving less employment in the tobacco manufacture, we are using less clothing as far as men and boys are concerned, and we are using less furniture.</P>

      <P>The Minister has all the figures for the tobacco in bond. The Minister has had plenty of warning that all these figures would be dealt with.  We will listen to what he has to say about these figures.  He has taken an interest in the matter; the Minister for Industry and Commerce has taken an interest in the matter, and the Minister for Finance has taken an interest in the matter.  May we hope now that when again, in our ignorance apparently, we bring the facts of the situation before the Minister and his colleagues, they will say something on this subject, so that our anxieties may be relieved by having something said about industry and commerce, if nothing can be said about agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other matters that we would like the Minister to explain. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when speaking in the discussion on the Budget on the 11th May, went through a regular gamut of <Col N="2298" /> industries and talked about them in the most glowing terms.  He said: &ldquo;Take the confectionery industry.  Employment in it has been doubled.  The output has been more than doubled, and it is still increasing.&rdquo;  Then he rather wavers a bit.  He said: &ldquo;Progress has not yet stopped in that industry,&rdquo; and he picks up courage and says: &ldquo;One new factory of considerable magnitude is being built, and there are more to come.&rdquo;  In the confectionery industry employment has been doubled and the output more than doubled.  When we come to take the Minister's figures we find that on the 1st September, 1931, there are 5,096 persons employed in that industry, and on the 1st March, 1933, there are 5,247.  In an industry that employs more than 5,000 persons there was an addition of 151 in 18 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the Minister, when he was speaking on the 11th May, which was about two months and two weeks after the 1st March, the date to which these figures referred, two months and two weeks after figures were disclosed to the Minister indicating that in an industry which employed 5,096 persons on the 1st September, 1931, 151 additional persons had been put into employment, was able to say that employment in the industry had doubled and the output had more than doubled.  When the Minister is dealing with the position as regards tobacco, an industry in which we are interested in this country, I will be glad if he will deal also with sugar confectionery, as he seems to know something about it and to have something to explain as to what is behind these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the hosiery industry the Minister said we had more than doubled production and many substantial orders for foreign markets were received.  The figures quoted yesterday show a definite improvement.  I would like to know how an increase of one-third in the numbers employed in that industry has had the effect of doubling the production. I spoke of the position as regards men's clothing and the Minister spoke of the position as regards <Col N="2299" /> women's clothing.  On the 11th May he said: &ldquo;I have not yet referred to women's garments of all kinds, an industry which was practically nonexistent 12 months ago, but which is at the present time employing several thousand hands.&rdquo;  Yesterday the Minister for Education said that information in regard to the numbers employed is not available.  I do not know what we can make out of the statements made by the Minister to the effect that several thousand hands are employed.  We are told in other circumstances that progress has been greater and more rapid than it was in this country for the last 50 years.</P>
    <P>There is something definitely at variance between the statements that are being made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and others. We had occasion previously to point out the discrepancy between the number of new factories as quoted by the President and the number of new factories as quoted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The President addressed the country generally on this subject the other day at Kilkenny. He told the people, particularly those responsible for the administration of our towns, that he was not satisfied that people with capital are taking sufficient advantage of the opportunity to extend and to establish industries. He carried it further when addressing the electors of the City of Dublin.  The Minister's Party in some of their literature advised the citizens generally in this fashion.  One pamphlet states: &ldquo;Dublin is Ireland's premier industrial city.&rdquo;  It is the city which is able to establish seven new furniture factories, while bringing about a reduction in the number of persons employed on furniture-making by 145.  At any rate, it is our premier industrial city and the Minister's Party points out that in other cities and towns Fianna Fáil councillors and mayors work in cooperation with the Department of State in offering facilities and advantages to industrialists to erect and extend factories.  Already, the circular says, many firms which might have erected factories in Dublin have been induced <Col N="2300" /> to go elsewhere because the local authorities in other centres were more alive to the possibilities of the present position.</P>

I have endeavoured to find out from the Minister for Local Government, in order to help the development of industries, what powers local authorities have so as to give assistance to people building up industries.  I have not been able to find that out from the Minister.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce is able to tell us in what way local authorities can assist the development of industries throughout the country we will be very glad to hear it and so will local authorities, too.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to define the time in which an application may be made for redemption.  It is necessary because many bondholders have changed their addresses since the <Col N="2301" /> external loans were launched, and it would be impossible, except at enormous expense, to ensure that all persons concerned could be approached as individual subscribers.  Many will never hear of the intention to redeem those loans except indirectly; it will take time before the news gets generally circulated.  The reason for fixing a limit of time is that it is desirable some limit should be fixed for handing in applications; otherwise there would be a continuing liability on the Exchequer and the House will generally agree that that would not be a desirable position.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire, by way of correction, to refer to what happened on the Committee Stage of this Bill last week on the question as to the payment of these sums.  I used three sentences in their context.  The President afterwards intervened, and represented me as suggesting that these moneys were not due and should not be paid.  I intervened subsequently to say that that was not my intention.  I pointed out, as appears in the Official Report, column 1857, in reply to the President:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I made it quite clear that I meant it was not payable at the present time as the conditions are not fulfilled.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was a plain enough indication of what my meaning was.  Subsequently the President came into the House and said: &ldquo;Deputy Rice corrected himself to-day.&rdquo;  I should say I did not correct myself.  I corrected the President's statement of what I had said. The President continued:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I stated that he had said the money was not due and he denied that.  I said I was prepared to take his correction but I have since got the transcript of his speech.  It is a matter of record, but here is what he is reported as having said.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then the President purports to quote what I said on this matter and undoubtedly the one sentence he did quote, he quoted correctly.  He quoted as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This country, through its Government, now proposes to pay a debt which is not due.  That is what he <Col N="2302" /> said.  He corrected that to-day when I charged him with it.  Other Deputies whom I heard speaking are apparently of a like mind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That purports to be a quotation of what I said, and a justification of the interpretation put by the President on my remarks.  Turning back, however, to the Official Reports I find in column 1836 what I did say was this&mdash;and I should like to call the attention of the House to the fact that there are three sentences in my statement, but there is one context dealing with this matter. The one sentence quoted is the middle sentence of the three, and no reference whatever is made by the President to the others, namely the first or third. Of course, if you take the sentence out of its context it can bear an entirely different meaning from what was intended to be conveyed.  I leave to the judgment of the House whether my statement, as to what I intended to convey is accurate, or whether the President's interpretation was accurate. Here is what I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the present time every country in the world that owes debts is trying by every honourable means to postpone payment owing to the financial conditions.  This country, through its Government, now proposes to pay a debt which is not due.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the sentence quoted by the President.  I went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This debt is not due because the condition of affairs under which these bonds are payable has not arisen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, this debate showed perfectly well, apart from the sentences I have quoted, what I was referring to, that the condition on which the bonds are repayable had not been fulfilled, and no person hearing these three sentences could be under any possible misapprehension as to what they meant.</P>
    <P>If it is not out of order I would like to say that I had no opportunity of making this correction until to-day, because the transcript was not available to me as it was to the President on the date in question.  In these circumstances it would be very well if we could revert back to the old practice of having the Official Reports available <Col N="2303" /> two days after publication.  If that were done, I should not have been compelled to remain silent with this charge hanging over me for the past six days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have sat through many speeches on this Bill and, personally I do not think that any case has been made out for taking the action that is proposed to be taken in this Bill at this moment.  As I say, there have been many speeches&mdash;a great flow of words&mdash;but many relevant points have not been dealt with.  The case made for passing the Bill in its present form has been based on quite a number of things.  The President, in many speeches, endeavoured to prove that his attitude had been perfectly consistent all through.  Anybody who took the trouble to listen to his speeches and to the facts contained in other speeches will realise, of course, that that is not so.  One of the reasons we are called upon to support this Bill is that everybody was given clearly to understand from 1922 until to-day that such action would be taken.  I am not contesting that point, but I do say that in 1926 the President himself said that he did not believe it was the intention of the then Government to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2305" /> With regard to the change which I wished to be made in the Bill, as was indicated in my amendment on the Committee Stage, the President resisted that amendment and gave what he would like us to take to be reasons.  One of them was, of course, as he said: &ldquo;I know that it is gall and wormwood to them that they are not here to do it, and that is the whole trouble.  They are not here to do it, and it is the great and supreme pleasure of my life to know that they will have to digest that gall and wormwood.&rdquo; Those words that I have just read out, in which it is announced, by a man who purports to have one object in life, which is to set up a Christian State, that it is the supreme pleasure of his life to know that his political opponents will have to digest gall and wormwood, are the words of an energumen.  That is the outstanding reason, we are told, why the Bill should be passed in this form.  It is argued that it should be passed in this form because the change I proposed was dictated by no other consideration than a desire to injure a certain enterprise in which the President is interested.  I gave the President an opportunity of looking up certain matters.  I told him that away back in 1924 or 1925, when the matter of repaying the loan that had been raised here was before the Cabinet, and before the Department of Finance, action such as I proposed in my amendment was considered.</P>
    <P>At that time there was no question whatever of a paper calling itself the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;no question of that whatever. We had reason to believe that there was an attempt being made, once it became known that the internal loan was going to be repaid, to defraud the unfortunate people who had contributed to that loan.  As I pointed out, it was much easier for people in this country to know the facts and to know that it was the intention of the Government to pay back the money in full with a certain amount of interest than it was in America with regard to the repayment of the American loan, because in this country that information was a matter of great news value. Our papers, being preoccupied primarily with Irish affairs, naturally <Col N="2306" /> would give that news a good deal of space.  In America, as I pointed out, where newspapers run to as many as 120 pages&mdash;newspapers too big practically for anybody with anything else to do in life to read them in one day&mdash; and being published where Irish affairs are relatively of no importance at all&mdash; I pointed out that in that huge country with the people scattered all over it, it was much easier for people not to be aware of what was going to happen with regard to these bonds than for the people in this country.  I told the President that although there was so much more reason to believe that it was impossible for people to be swindled by people offering them payment for their bonds which bore no relation whatever to the value of the bonds&mdash; although there was no possibility of the people being swindled in that way here, yet it was the intention of the Executive Council at that time to put a clause in the Bill to prevent anybody who had defrauded or attempted to defraud the original subscribers from benefiting by their dishonest actions. As far as I remember, some sort of warning was issued to people that if they attempted to get the bonds of the internal loan without giving adequate compensation for them, the Government would take steps to see that when it came to repayment, the repayment would be made only to the original subscriber and not to the assignees.  I invited the President to inquire from his officials as to whether what I stated was true or not, because my memory is &mdash;and I was interested in it&mdash;that it was only when the Executive Council was satisfied that none, or practically none, of the bonds had been thus assigned against something that did not in any way bear any relation to their value&mdash;it was only when the Government was satisfied that no such swindle was occurring or that it was occurring only on a minute scale that they allowed the repayments to flow.</P>
    <P>If what I state is true it means that the President knows that when he says that the change in this Bill which I proposed was dictated by no other consideration except a desire to injure the project with which he is associated, that is not true.  In 1924, or whatever <Col N="2307" /> the date was in which we proposed that action, the President will agree that we could not have had any object except to protect the interests of the people who originally subscribed and to save them from swindlers and to see that the people who attempted to swindle them would not benefit from their dishonesty.  But we are now told that the Government insists on passing the Bill in this form because they are not going to give way to an opposition which is dictated by no other desire except a desire to injure an Irish concern.  I maintain that the form we wanted this Bill to take was to attain an object which was clearly before our minds in repaying the home loan and I invited the President to see if that matter was considered at that time.  The President should be able to find amongst the officials of the Department of Finance or amongst the matters considered by the Cabinet at the time, a clear indication of the intention of the Government at that time, with regard to that home loan which, therefore, had no relation whatsoever to the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    <P>When it comes to the American loan it is ever so much more important, as I pointed out.  There are 120,000,000 of people in America, and scattered among them is a comparatively small number of Irish people or of Irish sympathisers, of whom, presumably, a comparatively small number subscribed to that loan.  These subscribers are scattered all over that continent.  There is a vast number of newspapers there.  In San Francisco they read the San Francisco something-or-other. In Philadelphia they read the Philadelphia something-or-other. In Boston they read the Boston something-or-other and so on. The President triumphantly came out and referred to some secret document in the files in which, he said, we were advised that we could not claim in America that the people were unaware that a certain repayment was going to be made on these bonds.  I pointed out before that it is one thing to be able to go into a court and get a decision from the court that people <Col N="2308" /> were unaware of certain things because the court will hold that if there were the means by which they could possibly know these things, then they themselves are to blame if they did not know them.</P>
    <P>But what was actually the fact? The most enlightened people in America, those who were closest to things, could know that on these bonds they were entitled to receive 58 cents in the dollar.  That 58 cents in the dollar has now been paid.  We are told, therefore, that because the most enlightened of them had means of knowing that they were entitled to get 58 cents in the dollar and agreed to part with them, therefore, they were absolutely enlightened as to the fact that there was a further 67 cents in the dollar to come to them.  There was nothing in America at that time to give any assurance to the people that they were entitled to get more than 58 cents in the dollar.  The President says that we, as a Government, have from time to time stated that it was our intention to repay the loan.  The present Government themselves stated their intention to give pensions to widows.  I should like to ask what a widow in this country could raise on her potential pension at the present moment.  If a widow goes to a bank or a moneylender and says: &ldquo;Here is my husband's death certificate proving that I am a widow; here is a statement by the President (or some other Minister) saying that we widows are going to get pensions; I ask you to give me an advance on my pension.&rdquo;  What is her interest in that pension worth as an negotiable object at the present moment?  It is worth exactly nothing.  That was the position with regard to these bonds in so far as any sum over the 58 cents in the dollar was concerned.  That 67 cents in the dollar was as negotiable as the widow's pension.</P>
    <P>The President, speaking in a most disinterested way, stated that, of course, he had to take no chances, that he had to see that with regard to the money that was embarked in this enterprise, as he called it, every safeguard was going to be taken. Therefore, it is still his duty, as <Col N="2309" /> trustee of these moneys in the <i>Irish Press</i>, to see to it that these bonds are repaid, that the assignments are recognised by this Government, and that the money goes to the assignees. At the same time, the President stated that he was perfectly sure that if we were in his place we, as a Government, would have taken appropriate steps to see that this additional 67 cents in the dollar would not go to the assignees.</P>
    <P>The President also stated that the <i>Irish Press</i>, this business that he is associated with, has entered into commitments in view of the assignments. Did the President and his Company enter into commitments to the extent of that 67 cents in the dollar?  If he did, was he not clearly betraying the interests of those who are, with him, financially interested in the enterprise by committing them to an expenditure on the understanding that they were to receive this additional money, when he himself says that he was perfectly satisfied that if we had still been the Government the 67 cents in the dollar would not have gone to the assignees in that case?  He also stated that when he went to collect this money the last thing that ever entered his head was that he himself would be the President of the Executive Council when it came to the repayment of this money.  I suggest that his statement contradicts itself.  He says that these assignments were legal, that they were made over to the <i>Irish Press</i>, and that the <i>Irish Press</i>, involving a large amount of Irish capital, had entered into commitments on the strength of the assignment of these bonds.  Quite possibly, up to the extent of 58 cents in the dollar, but not to the extent of the additional 67 cents in the dollar, unless the President was hoodwinking the shareholders in that company by pretending he felt perfectly certain that the additional 67 cents in the dollar would be given, when he himself admits that he was perfectly satisfied that if we were there we would not recognise these assignments. He was right.  He had great reason for believing it.  He had this good reason, that with regard to the repayment <Col N="2310" /> of the internal bonds it was our intention to see that if people had parted with their bonds without getting adequate compensation for them the people who had got possession of the bonds should not benefit by that deal.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The <i>Irish Press</i>, which went ahead with the work of establishing a newspaper, and which entered into commitments with those who assigned the bonds, is to be deprived of the capital on which they had counted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Had they counted on this additional capital?  By the President's own words he had no reason to count on it.  He did not look forward to a change of Government taking place in the meantime.  The President also said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to this amendment I say we are rejecting it because it was designed from a mean party motive, namely, to try to prevent going to the <i>Irish Press</i> the money which is legally due to it&mdash;money on the strength of which the <i>Irish Press</i> started perhaps earlier than it would otherwise have started.  I say the attempt to deprive it of this money by any subterfuge of this kind would be an act of positive injustice, an act which the attitude of the gentlemen opposite showed they were quite ready to perpetrate, if those gentlemen had been on this side.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We were quite ready to perpetrate it. We intended, in a like case, to have done exactly the same thing in 1924 and 1925, when the <i>Irish Press</i> was not established.</P>
    <P>What other arguments have been put forward with regard to the repayment of this money at this moment?  I do not want to misrepresent the President, but I gathered from him that he felt it was desirable to repay this money now before the trustees who were appointed by the court are disbanded.  I do not want to misunderstand the President, but I would judge from that that his intention would be that the same men who distributed the 58 cents in the dollar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would take me a long time to find it, as the President makes many long speeches.  I think I can take it from what the President said that one of the reasons why this moment is particularly appropriate, and why there is hurry about it, is that the trustees who were distributing the residue of the money are just finishing their work; that if this were delayed for any length of time their office would be done away with and they would not be there with their office operating.  That is what I thought was one of the reasons he gave.  If the President says it was not, I will not pursue it.</P>

      <P>I presume, therefore, that if this Bill goes through, and these moneys are to be distributed, the official receivers appointed by the court will have nothing whatever to do with the distribution of this remaining amount of money.  May I ask if the President agrees that that is the case? The President, or some other speaker for the Government&mdash;I cannot give the exact reference, but I do not think he will refute it&mdash;did seem to suggest that we had been wrong; that when the court appointed these trustees to distribute the 58 cents in the dollar the right and proper thing for us to have done at that time would have been to provide for the repayment of the whole loan, so that when the 58 cents were being distributed by the trustees the whole sum would have been distributed by them also.  Am I misrepresenting the President there?  I cannot undertake <Col N="2312" /> to find the exact reference.  As the President does not deny that, I presume it is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the House to understand that these trustees were appointed in this way, and it is a regular thing in America.  They have an interest in getting a percentage of the total amount to be distributed.  They get a very large sum of money out of this. It is a very well known thing in America, and a thing that many Americans object to, as they feel that it might easily tend to corruption.  It might be that a judge, when there is a large sum of money to be distributed, a million dollars say, could go to two or three men and say: &ldquo;There is a million dollars to be distributed.  I have the appointment of the official receivers for that purpose.  The law provides that the official receivers shall receive such a percentage of that sum. I am prepared to appoint you people as official receivers provided that you will hand over a portion of that money.&rdquo;  That is a thing that could happen.  If we had handed over the whole amount of money, as was suggested, to be distributed by those official receivers, they would have drawn an enormous sum of money as a percentage of the total amount of 6,000,000 dollars. It would have been a public scandal if that had happened.  I raise the point now, as I should like to give the President an opportunity of giving an assurance that that will not be the method of distribution.  We maintain offices in America.  When the official receivers' work is over, and it is the intention that this loan is to be repaid in full, with 25 cents in the dollar interest, it would be appropriate that this Government should apply to the American courts that all documents and lists should be handed over to us for that purpose.  The American courts have no interest beyond the repayment of the residue.  We have an office in America, and, as the President stated &mdash;he need not deny it, as it is in the Official Report&mdash;a very good and perfect list of the subscribers was kept at that time.  Our representatives, being appointed to act on our behalf, could distribute the remainder of this money. They will have the whole lists, and I <Col N="2313" /> hope there is no suggestion that the official trustees or receivers or whatever you like to call them are going to be utilised for this purpose.  I know that the people appointed are very good friends of certain people in America, but if that is so it would impose on this country an additional 2 per cent. or 3 per cent. of the whole amount that is to be distributed.  The President said: &ldquo;A perfect record was kept in America, and the only difficulty there has been in America has been the difficulty that a number of subscribers did not continually register their changes of residence.&rdquo;  That is in column 1923 of the Official Debates.  I should like an assurance that we are going to use the ordinary method of distribution.  We have our machinery over there, and we should not employ people at a high percentage.</P>
    <P>There was another point that I asked the President to clear up, and to the best of my knowledge he did not do it. The President, periodically during the debate, in showing how perfectly well those original subscribers are being treated with regard to the <i>Irish Press</i>, said: &ldquo;They were taken £ for £ of their value, in the sense that every person who assigned a bond knew that he was going to get the equivalent amount of interest on a similar amount in actual cash.&rdquo;  The President has stated that he has formed an American corporation to look after the interests of the bondholders, and that an interest in the <i>Irish Press</i> has been assigned to that corporation.  I should like to ask the President, first of all, whether when that assigned interest was handed over, as he tells us it has been, to this American corporation of bondholders, the interest that they were given per dollar of assignment was the 58 cents which the <i>Irish Press</i> had already got or the 125 cents that they are due to get when completely paid?  The President has stated that the <i>Irish Press</i> has entered into commitments assuming that they had this full amount of 125 cents in the dollar and not 58 cents. He has stated that the bondholders in America, this American corporation, recognises their interest in the full value of what they assigned.  When this Bill is passed the full value of <Col N="2314" /> what they assigned will be 125 cents in the dollar and not 58 cents.  I should like to ask the President if this American corporation gives to each bondholder an interest on 125 cents in the dollar and not on 58, and if that was done when he formed the corporation.</P>
    <P>There is also another point.  During the debate, as I have just read, the President said: &ldquo;They were taken £ for £ of their value, in the sense that every person who assigned a bond knew that he was going to get the equivalent interest on a similar amount in actual cash.&rdquo;  When I was speaking here last I did not want, in this instance&mdash;I put that in because I might be considered hypocritical otherwise&mdash; in any sense to misrepresent the President. I asked him to state if he really meant that every person who assigned a bond is going to get the equivalent interest on a similar amount in actual cash, because the prospectus issued in America did not state that.  It stated that everybody who gave a bond of less value than ten dollars was not to have a proprietary interest in the <i>Irish Press</i>, and was not to draw interest when the <i>Irish Press</i>, if ever, should make a profit.</P>
    <P>I asked the President whether what he stated in the Dáil here was true, which would mean that what was stated in the prospectus had been departed from, or whether he has kept to what was in the prospectus.  He has not answered that.  If I go on the assumption that the prospectus was adhered to, as one has the right to do, and it does happen that everybody who handed over those bonds has been put in a position to receive interest to the value of that bond, 125 cents in the dollar, if ever the <i>Irish Press</i> makes a profit, the President will say that I am misrepresenting him.  I gave him an opportunity of making that point clear.  I quoted from Miss MacSwiney's statement that most of the people who had subscribed large sums to the loan were &ldquo;Free Staters.&rdquo; Now I know to my own knowledge that many people who are what are called &ldquo;Free Staters,&rdquo; or supporters of the Cosgrave Party, were misled into parting with their bonds in this case, but it was their own look out, it may be <Col N="2315" /> said.  One must assume that the majority of the people who parted with them were people for whom the very name &ldquo;De Valera&rdquo; wove spells, people who were supporters of the President's Party.  It was stated by Miss MacSwiney, who had been over in America and had been personally associated with the case in the courts and with this matter generally, that most of the people who gave the larger sums were &ldquo;Free Staters.&rdquo;  Consequently those who were non-&ldquo;Free Staters&rdquo; were mostly subscribers of small sums to the loan.  One is accordingly justified in assuming that the majority of the bonds that were assigned to Mr. de Valera were of smaller denominations, probably most of them less than ten dollars.  If the prospectus is adhered to, those people parted with their money, and it does not matter to them whether the <i>Irish Press</i> becomes such a property that it could pay 200 per cent.  They are not due, under the prospectus, to get one penny. The most they can hope for is to get an occasional copy of the weekly edition of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I maintain that, if that prospectus has not been departed from, the President has completely misrepresented the position in this House, and has done it more than once in this debate.  The President can correct me if I am wrong.  I should like to ask him now, so as to save further argument, was the prospectus adhered to, or were the statements he made in the Dáil true?  I must assume that the prospectus was adhered to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2316" /> The President said that this propagandist organ which is to benefit so much as a result of the passage of this Bill is not a Party organ.  Strictly speaking I think he is correct there. When that venture was being launched it was not announced that the policy of the paper would be controlled by the Fianna Fáil Party, but the public were given to understand that irrespective of directors and shareholders the policy of the paper would be directed by one individual and that individual Mr. de Valera.  If that is so, the President can correct me if I am wrong, it means this that if the whole Government Party, nine or ten Ministers and the Back Benchers disagreed with the President and the President went out of office and the whole Fianna Fáil Party disagreed with him that then the <i>Irish Press</i> would not represent thereafter the views of the Fianna Fáil Party but the views of Mr. de Valera as he would then be.  That is what I understood from the case.  Strictly speaking we are told it is not a Party organ.  It is at the moment a most unscrupulous Party organ for the Fianna Fáil Party because the Fianna Fáil Party are at this moment, if I may say so without offence, pawns of President de Valera.</P>

If some temptation should come now to the whole Party then the <i>Irish Press</i> is not going to be a Fianna Fáil Party organ.  It is going to be the organ of President de Valera or of Mr. de Valera as he would then be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are always trying to limit what Irish nationality is.  We are only traitors, the Centre Party are only Imperialists; Miss MacSwiney does not fulfil certain conditions.  It is bad enough in all conscience to limit the nation to Fianna Fáil but if you are going to exclude everybody and make <Col N="2317" /> President de Valera the Irish nation, then it is about time some of us began to protest against it.  I quote from column 1930 of volume 48, No. 5 of the Dáil Debates, 6th July, 1933, where the President said speaking of the <i>Irish Press:</i>&ldquo;The Party does not own it or control it.&rdquo;  That is true.  &ldquo;It is owned by the shareholders and its policy can be controlled by the Board of Directors.  The only case where I would intervene actively&mdash;and I would intervene as trustee on behalf of those who subscribed the moneys&mdash;would be if the policy of the paper were to depart from that of supporting the movement for Irish independence and supporting the policy of economic independence also.  Are its rivals Party organs?  It is no more a Party organ than they are.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now the President does indicate there that in certain circumstances he would intervene as trustee on behalf of those who subscribed the moneys. I presume that the people in this country who subscribed moneys are shareholders and they have power to elect the directors; they have power of going to the shareholders' meetings and making their voices heard.  Therefore, President de Valera does not need to intervene on their behalf.  He is a director only as long as they keep him a director.  I gather however from that it means that the people in America who gave the money to him in his name and to his heirs and assigns to do as he likes with, knowing that he was going to use it to invest it in that paper and knowing that he was acting as their trustee, handed over all this money to him to put it into the paper as they intended it should be put, and he now comes as their trustee to see that the paper is carried on on the lines they meant to have it carried on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have gathered, possibly wrongly, from the course of this debate that there was rather more Irish money subscribed in Ireland to this venture than there was subscribed of American money, even counting the assignment of the bonds in America.  But if we take what the President said there it means that he as trustee of the people in America who subscribed a less sum <Col N="2318" /> of money, would intervene to override the decision of the subscribers of a larger sum of money in Ireland.  Even if the people in America did subscribe as much what does it mean?</P>

      <P>The question has been asked on a point of order whether all this debate is in order.  We are now on the Fifth Stage of the Bill and the question is that the Bill do now pass.  Entering into details as to the policy and control, possibly of the action of the directors of the board of a paper in a certain eventuality, is not in order on the Fifth Stage of the Bill. It might be appropriate to use as an argument on the Second Reading but entering into details on the policy and control of a paper is not now in order.

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret you say that, sir, because I have a number of objections to the passing of this Bill.  There has been ample opportunity in the previous Stages of this Bill to clear up a number of points which might conceivably have removed a number of my objections.  I raised certain points which I considered very real objections to the action pursued by the Government. One of them is that this is not an opportune time for repayment and the other is that I do object to legislation in this country in a set form to permit a possible wrong on people who parted with certain values that they possessed and parted with them when they were not fully advertent to what they were parting with and to its value and were not in a position to be watchful enough to see that they got full value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a strong objection to the Government of my country promoting such legislation.  The Government have a duty to protect the weak and the ignorant and to see that every care should be taken that nobody should be wronged.  I have a strong objection <Col N="2319" /> to this Bill passing in this form.  I have a very strong objection that certain people who parted with their bonds should lose what they should get and that certain other people should get these bonds&mdash;I will not say under false pretences&mdash;but in circumstances where they were able to forecast the future in a better way than the subscribers.  I have an objection that these people should benefit by their cute work.  I object to that very strongly.  I would refer the House to an incident in the papers just a few days ago.  That was a case of a man buying a Correggio in Italy some time ago.  The person who owned it was not aware that it was a Correggio.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mentioning it as an analogy.  The buyer who bought this Correggio was a picture expert. The seller was not aware that there was any chance of this being a Correggio. He sold it for a comparatively small sum.  Later on the seller found that the buyer some years previously had published a book which contained in it a copy of this picture and in the book the buyer had referred to it as a Correggio. The seller took the case into the courts and the case made was that as the buyer was probably aware that this picture had a much higher value than what he paid for it that therefore the seller had been in that way prejudiced. The Italian law found in favour of the seller although the buyer had handed over his money for the picture. It was found that the buyer had a wider knowledge and was using that wider knowledge in order to get this picture for less than its value.  The result was that the Italian law stepped in and said he must pay over a large sum to the person from whom he bought the picture.  I am suggesting that a similar case is happening here and I strongly object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Italian law stands to protect the ignorant from being made the victims <Col N="2320" /> of the cute, smart fellow.  I object to our legislating here to see to it that the ignorant are to suffer by not being able to advert to things that people in a much better position to anticipate what is going to happen can advert to. I object to a law being made here in a form specially designed to see to it that those who got certain bonds for considerations in no way equivalent to their value should be able, by the act of this Dáil, to benefit by that sharp practice.  I object to that very strongly. I also object to this, that we should be voting money here for this purpose. I object that we should be, as I judge from what the President said here with regard to acting as a trustee, legislating to pass money for this newspaper which is going to be controlled by people outside this country.  The people in America, I judge from this, are to decide what is to be the policy in this country, and this organ is to be used for misleading, for concealing the truth from our people and doing everything to direct our people in a line of policy which is to be decided by people in America, who will act through President de Valera as their trustee, to see that the paper pursues the policy that the people over there want, and not what the people in this country, with their eyes open and well enlightened, may deem to be in the best interests of this country.</P>
    <P>The President can get up and say that Deputy Fitzgerald tries to insinuate, tries to suggest, and all the rest of it; but when you give almost the identical words the President uses he gets up and challenges them.  When I read out here the exact words that were in this document that the President had circulated in America, the Minister for Finance demanded that I would produce the identical document. He was going to suggest that unless I produced them, which I did afterwards, that what I was saying was contrary to truth.  But the President can get up and say that the tendency of what we say is that we try to suggest and all the rest of it.  So far as he is concerned, if one happens to have a comma wrong, one is to be denounced <Col N="2321" /> as a blackguard trying to misrepresent all the President ever said.</P>
    <P>I would like to run over some of these objections.  Is it a fact, as the President said more than once in this debate, that every single person who subscribed in bonds of any denomination whatsoever is now in a position to feel perfect security through the operation of this American corporation, to get full dividends on the value of their bonds, or is it a fact that those who subscribed less than ten dollars are not due to get any benefit, no matter what profits the <i>Irish Press</i> may make?  The President time and again&mdash; and if necessary I will read out his statements&mdash;has stated that everybody who gave over these bonds is due to get paid.  I invited the President to look up whether or not with regard to the repayment of the home loan we intended to put such a condition into the Bill on that occasion as I wanted inserted in this Bill.  We intended to do that unless we were satisfied that no such transfers had taken place.  It was only when we were satisfied that the warnings we issued were effective that we abstained from putting such a clause in the Bill as I wanted introduced in this measure.  The President knows perfectly well when he says the change I want has no other reason behind it whatever but to affect the <i>Irish Press</i> and that it has no concern for the well-being of the original subscribers, that he is saying something that all evidence proves to be false. Why should it be said, if in 1924 and 1925 we took all the trouble we did take to protect the interests of the original subscribers here that when we try to do the same thing with regard to the subscribers in America that we are moved by nothing but Party spleen and spite?  What is the truth?  The President gave us his own mentality on this, both in his appearance when he leaned over the bench with his pale face and the lock over his eyes and with a face filled with venom when he said: &ldquo;I know it is gall and wormwood to them that they are not here to do it, and that is the whole trouble.  They are not here to do it, and it is the great and supreme pleasure of my life to know that they will have to digest that gall and wormwood.&rdquo;  There is <Col N="2322" /> the man revealing his mentality.  There is the man who goes around talking about the Christian State he is trying to create in this country.  There is the man who goes around and appeals to every cupidity in the country, urging people, as his whole policy has done, to vote for his Party so that the other man's property and possessions will get into their pockets and he calls it Christianity.  He talked in the Sinn Fein Ard Fheis about himself and Griffith as being brothers when he really tried to bilk Griffith.  He gave the game away there&mdash;&ldquo;it is the great and supreme pleasure of my life to know that they will have to digest that gall and wormwood&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The President can do that if he likes but his little story about gall and wormwood does not hold water when we know the facts of 1924 and 1925. The very people he is denouncing now were taking exactly the same steps before the <i>Irish Press</i> was heard of.  He knows the change I wanted in this Bill had one primary object and that was to see that the unfortunate people in America who subscribed originally and who in 1929 when things were very flush in America realised that they were due to get 58 cents in the dollar, or did not realise it and parted with their interest in the bonds, should get a fair deal.  My interest was so far as the further 67 cents were concerned that they could give it to the <i>Irish Press</i> if they so desired but that they should have an opportunity of getting that money which is only part of the money that should have been returned to them and that they subscribed in 1920 and 1921.  My suggestion was that they should get the money in their hands and they should be entitled to decide for themselves what they wanted to do with it.  They may, and if they do, nothing that we can do will prevent them, say, &ldquo;here are the 67 cents in the dollar.  In 1928 and 1929 we signed an assignment giving that to President de Valera.  It would be perfectly wrong of us to retain that money now.  We will give it to him.&rdquo;  No amendment we could propose would prevent them from doing that.  To suggest as was constantly done from the opposite benches that the whole meaning of our amendment was to <Col N="2323" /> deprive the people of an opportunity of giving it to the <i>Irish Press</i> was incorrect. We were told that we wanted to prevent people giving the money to the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Nothing of the sort. As regards the people who handed over their bonds, how many of them were there?</P>

    <P>That, for the purposes of any Act of the present Session to make provision for the formation and registration of a company having for its principal object the providing of industrial credit and for the acquisition by the Minister for Finance of share capital of such company, and for other purposes connected with the matters aforesaid, it is expedient to authorise:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  the loan to the aforesaid company out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of a sum not exceeding fifteen thousand pounds;</P>
    <P>2.  the charge on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  all moneys required for the purchase of shares under such Act,</P>
    <P>(b)  the principal and interest of any securities issued under such Act (for the purpose of providing money for the sums charged on the Central Fund) and the expenses incurred in connection with the issue of such securities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2325" /> The expenses involved in the flotation of this company will fall under three heads: (1) From advances to the company to meet preliminary expenses which will not exceed £15,000 and which will bear interest and be ultimately repayable, therefore involving no financial liability upon the Exchequer; (2) the moneys expended by the Minister taking up that balance of the company's issued capital which may remain unsubscribed by the general public.  It is absolutely impossible to ascertain what the cost to the Exchequer will be in this connection, but it cannot exceed £5,000,000.  The capital, however, will not be issued en bloc and, therefore, this liability, if it ever arises, or if that figure is ever reached, will certainly be spread over a number of years.  The third is to cover expenses of issue and interest and sinking fund on the loan for the purpose of providing the necessary moneys to pay for the shares taken up by the Minister for Finance.  The whole or part of the expenses borne by the Exchequer, in connection with the purchase of the company's shares, may eventually be recovered from the sale of the Minister's holdings and the shares, standing at premium at a date on which such sale or sales took place, the Exchequer would stand to make a net gain.</P>

      <P>In view of the general difficulty the House has of getting information from Ministers or members of the Executive Council with regard to developments taking place, or the amount of money spent, would the Minister, on this Resolution, give the House some indication of what information it will get, from time to time, as to what exactly is taking place in the general application of these moneys towards the development of companies in the country, and towards the consolidation of the general industrial fabric?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated, in my speech on the Second Reading, fairly fully the position in which the House will be placed in regard to this Bill.  First of all, under Section 11 of <Col N="2326" /> the Bill, the accounts of the company are to be laid before the Oireachtas, and while they will not disclose particulars relating to individual firms, in which the company may be interested, they will show very definitely the position of the company, indicating the manner in which it has been managed and, I presume, in connection with reports of the company, they will be published from time to time showing the range of its activities. When these accounts are laid before the Oireachtas the Minister may be questioned on a Vote regarding them. I have no doubt the House will be able to elicit whatever information they require consistent with the activities of the company.  I think it would be exceedingly undesirable that any Minister for Finance should attempt to withhold information from the House in connection with an undertaking of this kind.  I am perfectly certain no attempt will be made to withhold such information as the House may reasonably require, because, if such an attempt were to be made, it would react against the Minister and Government to which he belongs.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us now that we will get the account of the company as to how that company is getting on, but from the point of view of its balance sheet; that we will no doubt get reports from the various companies in the ordinary commercial way.  Is that the only responsibility that the Minister for Finance takes upon this matter?  If this company is flourishing from what its balance sheet shows, is the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce going to be responsible for indicating to us in any more general way what effect on the industrial life of the country the operation of this company is having?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite appreciate the Deputy's difficulty in this matter.  It seems to me that since the Minister is responsible for the loaning of public moneys in this country, it would be possible by putting down a Parliamentary question to get an <Col N="2327" /> answer eliciting all necessary information as to the general activities of the company.  But I think the Deputy will admit that it would be undesirable that I should pledge myself or my successor, who will probably have to deal in this case with the daily operations of this company, that that undertaking should be the subject of unkind review in this House.  I do not want to take up the attitude that any Minister would be justified in withholding from the Dáil, which is responsible in connection with financial matters, information that could properly be disclosed.  But at the same time, I do not want the company to be put in the position that it is going to be managed by the Dáil. I think that would be very undesirable, and would certainly eventuate in the failure of the company, and the complete loss of the money invested in it.</P>

      <P>I take it that there will be a parent company, and that shares will be issued in the different industrial developments that arise, such as paper pulp mills, sugar beet factories, cement and mineral development. I take it that the parent company will take shares in the flotation of these different companies, and will have a controlling interest in every one of them.  I take it that they would hold the majority of the shares, and that a committee of the directors of the parent company will be in complete control of the auxiliary companies.</P>

      <P>It has got to be remembered that in this connection I do not want to bind or fetter, by Ministerial declarations in this House, the discretion of those who will be appointed directly.  I think we have heard, from time to time, references to &ldquo;the dead hand of the Government&rdquo; in industrial matters, and our desire is that, while we have to provide finances for this company, and while we have to see that these finances are judiciously and properly handled with a full sense of responsibility, we do not want unduly to hamper the men of affairs who will be placed in charge of this company.  The full responsibility will be placed upon them.  We, in selecting them, will have to take <Col N="2328" /> responsibility for their selection; but we do not wish that any part of the individual, personal responsibility, which would rest upon a member of this board, should be passed on to the House or to the Minister.  If these men are permitted to operate in that way, and if they make mistakes, and the mistakes result in serious losses to the State, then the Minister, or the Government which nominated them as directors, will have to take responsibility for the mistakes; but the persons concerned will also have to take personal responsibility, and the Minister will be able to visit the consequences of their mistakes on them, and the House will be able to visit the consequences of his misjudgment in selecting these men on the Minister.</P>

      <P>I should like to know from the Minister will the directors of the new company have to give such information as they would have to give if they were directors of an ordinary company.  Will the shareholders get the information that shareholders in a company ordinarily do get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.  That is the intention.  The intention, as it is disclosed in the Bill, is to offer the shares to the general public in the first instance.  If the general public, taking into consideration all the risks, are not anxious to subscribe, then the Minister will have to come in and take up such shares as may not be taken up by the public.  Consequently, he will secure the representation upon the board to which the extent of his investment would entitle him.  At the annual general meeting of the company, when the statement of accounts is submitted and the report of the directors is received, and at which the chairman's speech is made, any member of the general public who holds a share of £1 in the company will be entitled to go there and put whatever questions he may wish to the chairman and secure answers to them.  I am perfectly certain that, in a case of that kind, where a nomination can be so easily secured, all those interested in the public welfare will qualify themselves as shareholders and thus elicit the <Col N="2329" /> information even if there were an attempt on the part of the Minister to withhold the information from the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister how far the subsequent operations of the company will be disclosed by their balance sheet.  The Minister has stated that this company is going to be floated and that the shares will be taken up either by the general public or by the Government. To my mind, that is a detail.  The really important question for this Dáil is the subsequent operations of this company.  The Minister has stated, quite frankly, that, apparently, this is to be used for underwriting the issues of large capital flotations that are required in connection with the development of industries.  He has stated that, and yet in the schedule here he takes power to lend money, apparently, to an individual.  There is already the Trade Loans Board and I should like to know will an individual, who has been turned down by the Trade Loans Board, be able to come to this company and, presumably, get terms that he could not get from the Trade Loans Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point about which I should like to ask the Minister, and I have not gathered it from his remarks. The Minister seems most anxious that this company should not be managed by the Dáil, and I think that is very proper.  At the same time, here is a company that is going to be floated, presumably, with Government money. I do not know the exact proportion, and the Minister himself does not know it either.  We want to see that it is not managed by nobody, because if it is an industrial concern and the capital is obtained from the public, the directors would be responsible to the shareholders; but it occurs to one that in this company, which is practically solely an underwriting company, the real question that will arise will be the value of their holdings in various concerns. Will that be stated, for instance, in the published accounts of the company, and will it be stated at what value the investments are taken?  To my mind, that would be one of the <Col N="2330" /> points that we are entitled to know, because when this company is going to get a very large share of public money or Government money, we ought to be quite clear that the shareholders, or the people wishing to have information about it, were not left with less information than they would have in an industrial concern.</P>
    <P>There is another matter about which I should like to ask the Minister, and, to my mind, it has a most important bearing on this Bill.  Presumably this company would be qualified to apply under the Approved Investments that funds that were in court and trustee funds could be invested in this company. If that is so, and I take it to be so from reading these two Bills, a trustee would be in the position of having his patriotism impelling him to invest in this company, and there would be less information disclosed to the shareholders than would be disclosed in an ordinary industrial company. I should like to ask the Minister to deal with these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Money Resolution puts a very big potential liability on the State.  We are committed, in the first instance, to approximately £15,000.  We will get that back, I presume, as soon as the company is launched.  The other portion of it, however, is a very much larger liability. It is, perhaps, the largest liability that the State will have entered into so far, if we exclude the Shannon scheme. This is a matter from which politics ought to be excluded altogether, and I am not so well satisfied that the scheme is a sound one.  In fact, the more I hear of it the less satisfied I am that it is going to work.  This sum of money will be like Mahomet's coffin, for fifteen months.  We will either be entitled to ask about it in the House during the fifteen months or we will not.  From some statements made, I conclude that no question should arise pending the balance sheet.  I presume that, if we allow fifteen months, we will probably have the balance sheet in twelve months, and allowing the usual time to run, it will take fifteen or eighteen months before it will be in Deputies' hands.  Is it not inevitable from the <Col N="2331" /> construction of the scheme as it stands that a question as to some one being refused some grant, or some one being in a hurry to get some finance, is bound to be ventilated in the House; that any suspicion that there is red tape operating, if you wish to put it that way, or delay, or something else of that sort, will occasion some apprehension.  There is, in addition to that, the possibility of a big sum of money being subscribed which cannot be employed, of the persons who are on the directorate desiring to see it immediately employed, and I can foresee the anxiety of the Government to see sums of money invested without delay, and we know what dangers there are in that connection.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister a further reconsideration of this matter even to this extent: that the Bill might be limited in its scope to provide for whatever present needs there may be for the immediate industrial experiments that are under consideration, and that further consideration should be given to the bigger question of extension or of some other method of dealing with the sum.  In connection with the construction of the board, I think it is practically inevitable that the Minister's nominees will be in excess of others.  If the Minister's nominees are in excess of others, there are going to be Parliamentary questions and answers in connection with the matter.  That is not a good scheme. Consequently, I suggest that, if it were considered feasible, a lesser sum than that involved here should be considered in connection with this scheme. Although I expect that we will pass the Money Resolution, I suggest that the Minister should reconsider the matter with a view to giving the company whatever chance it can get, and not having all the business subject to question and answer in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also suggest one other matter to the Dáil.  A short time ago we had a Trade Loans Bill before us, and some request was made that a balance sheet should be submitted.  If my recollection is correct, the Minister for Industry and Commerce objected to that. <Col N="2332" /> We might have even a larger Government commitment in respect of one of these trade loans than we would in connection with a loan under this Bill. The Minister thought on that occasion that it was inadvisable to produce a balance sheet.  If that be so with regard to the Trade Loans Bill, why have we departed from that policy in this case?  I therefore suggest that a smaller sum should be provided for until some system would be evolved under which the Dáil's interference would be limited while, at the same time, retaining its hold over the expenditure of public money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister why it is necessary to introduce this Bill.  As I understand the position, it is in order to get funds to finance certain developments in connection with beet, cement, and other prospective industries.  Is the Executive Council satisfied that it is not possible to get these industries under way without Government intervention of this kind?  I might remind the Minister that when the present beet factory was started the conditions in this country were not at all what they are to-day, yet the capital was obtained for that particular industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection I should like to point out to the Minister that capital is only one of the essential features in industry.  The Minister may say that we have people in this State as capable as can be found in any other country, but we lack, of course, experience in many of the larger industries.  It is one of the misfortunes of this country that we have not any number of large industries.  Consequently, we have not experience of these industries, and it is essential, if we are to make a success of them, that we should have at their head men of experience and knowledge in these industries.  From that point of view, I should like to impress on the Minister that capital is only one of the essentials of success in industry.  I think, therefore, that it would be advisable for the Executive Council to examine the problem a little more fully before they embark on this measure, because once they put a certain amount of capital into an industry <Col N="2333" /> it may be necessary, in order to save that capital, to advance further sums. That has been the experience in connection with the Trade Loans Act.  In that way Government investments in industry became in some cases rather larger, probably, than the Executive Council or the Minister for Finance would have desired.  I therefore suggest that, before we embark on a measure of this kind, inquiries might be made in the other direction, and that the Minister should satisfy himself that it is not possible to get these industries started without assistance of this character.  That is one of the matters to which I should like the Minister to give attention.  I do not know whether he could answer the problem contained in it when replying on this debate.</P>
    <P>There is another point which has been touched upon by Deputy Dockrell. This Industrial Credit Bill and the Approved Investments Bill, introduced a week ago, I take it, hang more or less one on the other.  On the Second Reading of the Approved Investments Bill inquiries were made as to exactly what is the amount of Government funds dealt with in that measure? Could the funds advanced by the State, say, as a first charge on these industries, become trustee securities under that other Bill?  If so, the courts would probably put trust moneys into them. What would happen in the event of any misfortune overtaking such an industry and its funds?  There is a speculative element of that character involved in these Bills that one would like some explanation of.  Probably it is out of order to discuss the other Bill, but I think the Minister will agree that there is a connection between the two Bills, and one would be glad if the Minister could see his way to let us know exactly the extent of that connection.</P>
    <P>The only other point I should like to make is that, in view of our experience in connection with the Electricity Supply Board, and also in view of our experience in connection with the advances that were made under trade loans, I think it is desirable that the State should, as far as possible, keep <Col N="2334" /> apart from industry.  I grant that there may be special occasions when State intervention is essential, but I think it is the experience of all States, including our own, that while we may be good people at governing, we are not, as a rule, the best people to manage business.  The surroundings of a Deputy, and, might I say, of a Minister, are not always what might be called business surroundings.  Other interests come into play that cannot always be dealt with from a business point of view.  There are things called votes that are considered of importance. When you come to manage a business, with all those influences before you, you realise the difficulty that a State or a Minister is in.  For that reason I think it would be very desirable, except as a last resort, that the State should not take a really active part either in starting or in financing any of those industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the points raised by Deputy Dockrell as to the amount of information which might be given in the balance sheet, I think I should refer him to sub-section (2) of Section 11, which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The balance sheet and profit and loss account to be furnished as aforesaid shall be drawn up in such a manner as shall be prescribed by regulations made under this section, and such balance sheet shall contain (in addition to any matter required by such regulations) a summary of the capital, assets, and liabilities of the company, together with such particulars as will disclose the nature of such assets and liabilities and the manner in which the value of the assets was arrived at.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that that will compel the auditor, who will be appointed by the Minister, and for whose appointment and actions the Minister will be responsible to this House, to make in the balance sheet a fairly full disclosure of the nature of the assets and liabilities of the company.  Furthermore, I wish to point out that the company is bound under sub-section (3) to furnish to the Minister &ldquo;such explanations as the Minister shall think proper to require in respect of any <Col N="2335" /> balance sheet or profit and loss account furnished pursuant to this section.&rdquo;  I take it that the anxiety of the Deputy is not to secure information if things are going well with the company, and if the balance sheet disclosed a satisfactory position, particularly if it carried with it the certificate of an auditor of repute.  I take it that it would not be the anxiety of the Deputy, or of any Deputy in the House, to probe very closely into the affairs of the company in that case&mdash;that it would only be when the balance sheet disclosed that things were not going well with the company that there would be an anxiety on the part of the House to prevent disaster if it could, or to retrieve losses.  In that connection the Minister responsible would have to give to the House the fullest information that might be at his disposal. Under this section he has the power to secure, under penalty, any information that he requires.  Therefore, I say that he should furnish any information which the House might require him to demand as to the operations of the company.  This section is put in so as to ensure that at any time the House thinks it is desirable in the public interest to secure the fullest information about this company that information will be forthcoming, or else that the Minister will have to take upon himself the public odium of refusing to give that information.  I think we have got to assume that the House is going to be reasonable in matters of this sort.  I do not think that the House is going to ask for information when it does not seem in the public interest desirable that such information should be given, but facilities are afforded to the House to procure the information if necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill gives the House another safeguard, and another means of control over the operations of this company, because Section 4 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No issue of the share capital of the company (other than share capital issued to subscribers of the Memorandum of Association of the Company) shall be made at any time, unless the Minister, after consultation with the <Col N="2336" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce, has authorised such issue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Consequently the House, when an issue is authorised by the Minister for Finance, will be put in the position that it may ask the Minister to disclose the purposes for which the issue has been made.  If the issue seems to be for so large a sum of money that the possibility which Deputy Cosgrave envisaged might arise&mdash;that large sums would be lying idle&mdash;the Minister would have to answer to the House for such a lack of foresight in provision, and failure to exercise ordinary financial prudence.  Deputy Cosgrave said that, at the beginning of its operations at any rate, the Minister would possibly have a majority on the Board, because he would hold a majority of the shares. The Deputy seemed to be of the opinion that that would be undesirable, and that such a provision could not lead to the efficiency or harmonious working of the company because there would be too much political interference.  I cannot assent to that, and particularly I cannot assent to it because there is at present operating in the State a company in which the State has sunk, and the general public has invested, very large sums of money.  I refer to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  In that corporation the chairman and secretary, and other members, constituting a majority of the Board, are nominated by the Minister.  I can speak for myself and for my colleagues in the Executive Council in saying that we have never attempted, and I do not believe that our predecessors attempted either, to bring any sort of undue influence to bear on the members of that Board.  There has not been, during the whole course of its history, anything like a division of opinion between the members of the Board nominated by the Minister and those elected by the ordinary shareholders. If that sort of arrangement worked and is working quite satisfactorily in regard to the Agricultural Credit Corporation I cannot see that there is any great likelihood&mdash;to put it at the lowest &mdash;of its operating undesirably in the case of the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the Minister agree that the problems confronting <Col N="2337" /> the directors of the Agricultural Credit Corporation are of a very much more limited character?  There will be very much more diverse problems to be faced by this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to agree to that, because after all this company, at the outset at any rate, will be dealing with a limited number of propositions, whereas the directors of the Agricultural Credit Corporation have to deal with a considerable number of proposals, and consider each of them&mdash;those of any magnitude&mdash;on their individual merits, merits which, because the personal equation enters into them very largely, are very difficult of assessment.  In the case of industrial projects at any rate they will have the experience of other countries to guide them.  The company will, I am sure, have the reports of competent technical advisers to guide it.  There will be a mass of information before it in relation to any of the considerable projects that will be dealt with here, which the directors of the Agricultural Credit Corporation cannot get in regard to individual applications made to them.  Therefore, I say that I think the directors of this company, although they will be handling undertakings of greater magnitude, will probably have a simpler task than the directors of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Good said that the Government ought to remember that capital after all was only one of the essential features.  I quite agree.  I will put technical skill and commercial acumen and ability on a par with capital as an essential, but unfortunately in this country, as the experience of the Sugar Beet Manufacturing Company shows, it is easier to get technical skill and commercial experience than it is to get capital for an Irish enterprise.  If there was ever an undertaking floated under favourable auspices, with every encouragement to the Irish people to subscribe to it, it was the Irish Sugar Beet Manufacturing Company, and yet the amount of Irish capital subscribed to that concern was infinitesimal.</P>

It is the general policy of the Government, and I do not think that from any point of view the wisdom of the policy can be questioned, to secure to the utmost measure the support of Irish investors for the undertakings which will be launched in fulfilment of the Government's policy of industrial development, but we have got to face facts.  We are anxious to get ahead with our industrial programme, but we do think that one of the big difficulties we shall have to face is to induce Irish investors at the beginning to risk their capital in this concern.  We feel that like many another good undertaking, they will have to go to the Irish public as a proven success.  That is one of the reasons why, in order to give them a chance of proving successful, we have to take those measures to defend them.</P>
      <P>There was a question raised by Deputy Dockrell in the first instance, and subsequently referred to by Deputy Good, as to whether shares of this company would constitute trustee investments.  Personally, it is not my intention to refer shares of this company for the consideration, and for the approval, if deemed fit, of the committee to be set up under the Approved Investments Bill.  I would consider, personally, that the shares of this company should be regarded as a trustee investment, particularly as a suitable investment for the Government funds which we had in mind when we were submitting the Approved Investments Bill to the House, but there is nothing in this Bill which guarantees the interest on capital or any stock, whether debenture or otherwise, to be issued by this concern.  The stock carries no Government guarantee, and that will be made clear in the prospectus.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he will see:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that the company shall have power for the purposes of the company to raise money by means of debentures, subject, however, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the amount so raised shall not exceed at any time the paid-up share capital of the company, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the said power shall not, without the consent of the Minister, be exercisable at any time while the Minister holds more than one-half (in nominal value) of the issued shares of the company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This company has been floated as an ordinary commercial proposition, not carrying any Government guarantee. The Government will, possibly, have to invest considerable sums of money in it from time to time.  The wisdom of those investments can be questioned in this House, but beyond the commitments, which must be made under Section 5 of the Bill, the House is not committed in any way whatsoever.  It may happen, and it will happen, in connection with the sugar beet proposals, that certain stock issued by the Government will carry a Government guarantee as to the payment of interest and repayment of capital.  In that case and in this particular sense they would <i>ipso facto</i>, under the law as it exists at present, because they did carry that Government guarantee, be a proper investment for Government funds, and would be trustee securities, irrespective of any action that the committee to be set up under the Approved Investments Bill might take in regard to them.</P>

      <P>The Government is taking this possibility into consideration, <Col N="2341" /> that notwithstanding the fact that the shares of the Sugar Beet Company will be offered to the public, the public may not take them up.  As I have already pointed out, in reply to a statement made by Deputy Good, the public did not subscribe the shares of the Carlow Sugar Beet Factory.  We may be in the same position with regard to the new company, and we may be in that position in relation to every other project which the Government decides to initiate or the shares of any project which the Government may offer to the public.  That is the method of procedure and the policy which has been definitely decided upon. Therefore, in fixing the figure for the capital of this company, it has got to take every one of those contingencies into account.</P>

They are told it is Government policy, and they are told to under-write to that extent, or to that proportion of it. There are three or four sugar companies and there is a quarter million of money in each case.  They have to lend the money that is not taken up by the shareholders.  They have no other voice than the shareholders' voice in connection with the management; because if they have I see a regular vista of industrial labour on these directors.

      <P>This is an important measure.  Many questions have been asked on this Money Resolution, questions obviously put with the genuine desire to elicit information. Money Resolutions are considered in Committee on Finance, but I would remind Deputies that at least two speeches were Second Reading speeches, and that it is most unusual and almost unprecedented to spend one hour discussing a Money Resolution of a Bill.  Many of the matters raised might be debated on Section 5 of the Bill itself.  I am loth to seem to desire to limit discussion owing to the importance of the Bill and the manner in which the debate has been conducted, but I would again draw the attention of the House to the fact that it is contrary to precedent to have a protracted debate on a Money Resolution.</P>

I should say that a balance sheet drawn up by a conservative firm of auditors <Col N="2347" /> is bound to present a most unfavourable appearance in the first year.  That may give rise to considerable apprehension. So far as I can judge, no provision is made for that in the Bill. If a large holder of shares should die during the year, the market value of the shares would be affected unless the Industrial Credit Company took them up.  The Minister can see how difficult the position would be in that connection. The shares would be likely to fall.  The company would be well advised to get them as cheaply as possible.  If they buy them for 16/-, 17/- or 18/-, or at any figure under par, and their accounts are made up on a given date, obviously the remainder of the shares must be charged in the balance sheet at the same value.  The Minister can get that information from the Revenue Commissioners.  When a man dies, the market value of whatever shares he holds is taken into account.  I do not expect that that eminently respectable method will be departed from when the auditor comes to make up the accounts.  The first year &mdash;indeed the first three to five years&mdash; are likely to be very difficult in the life of this company.  I do not know that there is any way out except one&mdash; that until earnings commence to come in, there should be a loss shown.  I do not know whether the Minister has considered that point.  Even if there are great expansions in certain directions, and if the company is interested in prosperous undertakings, in the normal course the companies will be in their beginning years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no company in which they are likely to be interested in respect of which there will not be a beginning year.  Some means ought to be found to deal with that position.  I have not considered the matter other than in the course of the discussion here, but there may be a very serious presentation of affairs&mdash;possibly more severe than just, taking everything into account.  The auditors must save themselves. They must give a truly accurate audited account, and, in consequence, I see very considerable difficulties in the initial years.  You cannot have a reserve fund in the beginning in a case <Col N="2348" /> of this sort, but it does come down to this, that the bigger the sum involved the bigger the sum, it is more than likely, that will be shown on the wrong side of the balance sheet, and, even though the auditor represents a correcty audited account, it may not give a perfect picture of the whole situation.  I want the Minister to understand that, when he said, to-night, his successor would be responsible, he is probably making an unfortunate bed for his successor to lie upon in that connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, when anwering my criticism earlier about the balance sheet, pointed to Section 11 and to the matters that would have to be disclosed, and he mentioned that anxiety would probably only be displayed in the balance sheet of the company if people thought there were some doubtful items, or that the company was not doing as well as it might. That is precisely the point to which I wish to call attention, because I am not clear if this company is to be a public company, under the Public Companies Acts, and if it will be incumbent on it to furnish and publish accounts to the shareholders.  The Minister read out triumphantly Section 11 to me, but, when I read it, I see that it sets out:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The company shall, within ninety days after the end of every accounting year, furnish to the Minister......&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not say that these matters shall be furnished to the shareholders. If he transferred this section into the articles of association in the Schedule, I could understand the matter, but it occurs to me that, if there is any doubt about the trading of this company, very considerable pressure will be put on the Minister not to hand out all the information for which he can ask under Section 11, and that that might have a very damaging effect on the company, or some of the subsidiary companies. Personally, I should like to know what details the shareholders are going to get, because it is quite clear by Section 11 that, apparently, the Minister can get practically any particulars he likes from the company, and the company <Col N="2349" /> directors, who are in default with their returns to the Minister, will be fined £5 for every day during which the default continues.  This looks as if the company directors were going to have two masters, and I do not know which they are going to serve.  It is, however, clear that they will have to serve the Minister, under Section 11, but what I want to know is whether it is equally clear that the shareholders are going to get the information that the Minister is going to get, or, if not, what particulars they are going to get. I should like to ask the Minister if he does not think that Section 11, or some of the powers conferred by that section, should be put into the articles of association, in order that shareholders might be in a position to appreciate what the balance sheet was and what their holding in the company was worth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it might possibly be better to deal first with the point raised by Deputy Dockrell.  He asks if this company is to be a public company.  I think the Deputy is under the impression that it is not going to be a public company floated under the Companies Acts.  I think that that was really the hypothesis on which he based the statement which he has just made. If that be the case, I should like to refer him to Section 2 of the Bill, which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Immediately upon the passing of this Act the Minister shall take all such steps as appear to him to be necessary or desirable to procure that a limited company (in this Act referred to as the company) conforming to the conditions laid down in the Schedule to this Act shall be formed and registered in Saorstát Eireann under the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1924.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the shareholders in this company, irrespective of what may appear in the Schedule of the Bill, will be entitled to all the information that shareholders can procure at the general meetings, or at such extraordinary general meetings as may be called for the transaction of special business.  They will be in exactly the same position as the shareholders in <Col N="2350" /> any other company, with all the rights and privileges that such shareholders may have, including, amongst other things, the consideration of the accounts and balance sheet, and the reports of the board made to them in the ordinary way at the ordinary general meetings of the company.  It seems to me, therefore, that a great deal of what was said by Deputy Dockrell loses its point the moment that fact is appreciated.</P>
    <P>On the question raised by Deputy Cosgrave, it may be, and I am quite prepared to admit that the probabilities are, that the early years of this company will be difficult ones, and that the balance sheet may present an unfavourable aspect and that the auditor, who will be a person of standing and a competent person, a person of honour and repute with a professional reputation to lose if he does not discharge his duty as an auditor properly, will present a true balance sheet.  I think that is the sort of balance sheet he ought to present and that it should be clear from the balance sheet, which, under Section 11, has to be presented to the Dáil, what the exact position of this company, sound or unsound, favourable or unfavourable, happens to be from year to year.  I think that, if Deputy Cosgrave will consider the matter, he will agree that, while it may be true that the balance sheet may, in its early years, be unfavourable, nevertheless, the House, which has accepted responsibility, or which has given to the Minister power to float this company, will appreciate the circumstances and that the general public will appreciate them also, and that, in any criticism which the House may make of the Minister, because of the actions of the persons for whom he has accepted responsibility, it will bear in mind the fact, to which Deputy Cosgrave has referred, that the early years of the company are bound to be difficult ones.</P>
    <P>It may mean that the Minister will possibly have to stand a good deal of uninformed criticism, a good deal of unfair criticism, but I think that whatever disabilities the presentation of a fair&mdash;and by that I mean an <Col N="2351" /> accurate&mdash;balance sheet imposes on the Minister, and whatever reflections it may seem to cast on the directors, and will be cast on the directors by ill-considered persons, because of the condition of affairs manifest in the balance sheet, it is desirable, and I think that any other course would be unthinkable, that the Dáil and the general public should know, from year to year, the exact condition of the affairs of this company.  It is for that reason we are taking no powers in the Bill.  There are no provisions in the Bill that will enable us to cloak or conceal in any way what the result of the company's activities has been.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recollect that on the occasion of the report of the engineers who were appointed to consider the plans in connection with the electrification works at Ardnacrusha, they made out a very detailed specification of the cost.  They went further.  They made provision for a normal gradual development and in their estimates they fixed upon a given year.  I cannot exactly remember the time.  I think it was five years from the start or three years from the inauguration of the general working of the plant. They made allowance for a certain expansion as from the date when the works would be taken over up to, I think, 1932.  I am not exactly clear about the date but, anyway, it can be seen in the reports.  These were engineers of very good reputation, and it is obvious from the presentation of the report and from the construction and the whole basis of their calculations and specifications that they foresaw that particular difficulty in the case of the electricity undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case we are asking certain citizens to subscribe to an Industrial Credit Corporation.  The Minister has admitted, and any person with business experience will have to admit, that you are not going to start under-writing or taking up shares in new companies and expect in the first year to see results.  Apart altogether from what one calls a flotation, the earlier <Col N="2352" /> years are not years in respect of which any result can be anticipated.  Why not take into account all these characteristics that are bound to present themselves and make allowance, in respect of whatever capital is to be employed, for such sum in advance as will meet any deficiencies and let the presentation of the first balance sheet be as respectable as one would like to see in the case of a big corporation of this kind?  We have had the precedent of the electrical undertaking and the recommendation of engineers who are, perhaps, as great businessmen as they are engineers.  Endeavour to avoid the apprehension and the criticism that are bound to arise on the presentation of a poor balance sheet in the first year or the second year.  I see very great difficulty in the presentation of a balance sheet in the first year.  I presume it is unlikely that the whole of the capital will be invested in that time.  They will have taken certain shares in a few cases and those only in the case of long established businesses where there have been a flotation and an appreciation within a short time on the shares.</P>
    <P>Here we have a different situation. Although the Minister will hold a block of shares in this country and although the company will hold blocks of shares in various other places, sometime or other, when it is least expected, blocks of these shares may go on the market.  It is very undesirable to have big fluctuations in respect of business.  We have had almost an act of contrition on the part of 60 nations in respect of the fluctuation of their currencies, which is much the same as fluctuations on the Stock Exchange.  They all admit they have sinned, but very few are inclined to repent.  In this case, from the beginning let us envisage whatever hard times there may be in front of us, and let us start from the beginning with the sure indication to the public that the concern is sound.  It would be very much better for the Minister and for whoever comes after him to have such a state of affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">

      <P>I would like to refer the Minister to Section 11, where it is <Col N="2353" /> set out that particulars shall be furnished to him.  When he was speaking earlier on this matter he referred to the Dáil, as if these particulars are going to be given to the Dáil as well.  In view of the importance of that statement I would like the Minister to be quite clear.  I see, of course, that particulars have to be furnished to the Minister.  What I want to know is, will the Dáil be given those particulars?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Dockrell, under sub-section (3) of that section, the company shall furnish to the Minister such explanations as he may require from time to time.  It does not inevitably follow from that that this information will be given to the Dáil. It may be given to the Dáil on demand. I assume when the Dáil demands it, if all the circumstances that have to be taken into consideration warrant it, that information will be given without hesitation.  A case may arise where it may seem to be in the public interest to withhold information from the Dáil. I am only putting it that way&mdash;where it may seem to be.  In that case the Minister may refuse.  However, if the Minister does refuse, any member of the Dáil can put down a motion demanding that the information be given.  We can debate that motion, and the Minister then will have to give sound reasons why the information should be withheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that all the information the House might reasonably require would be given under the section without hesitation by the Minister.  That, at any rate, is my conception of what the Ministerial attitude should be.  It may be that circumstances might induce the Minister to depart from that attitude. If so, the Dáil has its remedy.  If members of the Dáil are sufficiently interested in a particular matter in respect of which information is required they can put down a question and raise the matter on the adjournment. If that is not satisfactory they can put down a motion, the matter can be fully debated in the House, and the Minister will not merely have to justify <Col N="2354" /> himself to the House, which possibly is the least important aspect of it, but will have to justify himself to the country in refusing or withholding information which, in the reasonable judgment of the country, ought to be given to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I should say that would be the minimum amount. I do not think the Dáil would regard it as in the public interest that very much more than that should be asked. If it has reason to suspect that the affairs of the company are not being properly conducted, or that any of the subsidiary companies in which this Industrial Credit Corporation has any interest are not being properly conducted, the Dáil can always get that information, and would be entitled to look for that information, from the Minister.  The Dáil could eventually, I believe, compel him to give it.</P>

      <P>I would not like even to commit myself to that, because the <Col N="2355" /> Minister must&mdash;if he is accepting responsibility for the actions of the Industrial Credit Corporation&mdash;accept responsibility for all its actions.  If the directors make investments in any undertaking, I think the Dáil, whom the Minister represents in the matter, is entitled to get information in respect to any of these undertakings that any shareholder holding one share would get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, but I thought the Minister was referring to special information&mdash;more than the ordinary shareholder would get.  Surely it would not be fair to the ordinary private investor, who invested in a subsidiary company, if the State, because of a minority of the shares, was entitled to discuss internal and private affairs in the Dáil?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that would have to be one of the disabilities under which those who go to this company looking for financial assistance will have to accept.  If they do not like it there are other concerns from which they can get the financial assistance which they require.  They can go to the ordinary banks, when the Dáil would have no right, so to speak, to inquire into any of these concerns.  If public money is invested in these concerns then the Dáil has a right to all the information it requires, in order to assure himself that the investments have been properly made.  At any rate, I am not going to be any party to denying the Dáil that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to bother the Minister, but his remarks have given a totally new aspect to the measure. Is it intended that this company will seek investments, apart from what it may be advised to do by the Government? Is it intended that it will seek other investments?  On the Second Reading Stage I asked whether, if it appeared to the directors of the company that a hire-purchase corporation could be financed in this country, and if it was likely to be a profitable enterprise, could the directors of the holding company agree to invest in it, apart from consultation with the <Col N="2356" /> Government?  What the Minister said a while ago would seem to preclude such a possibility.  The Minister stated that if the holding company took any shares in a subsidiary company, possibly it might be a condition that the private affairs of that company would have to be discussed in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is certain confusion of thought in the Deputy's mind as to the manner in which the company will operate.  So far as I am concerned, it is not intended that this company would go out to try to establish concerns mainly because there is a possibility of making money in them.  If there is a possibility of making money in most of these concerns, I think the possibility should be left, in the first instance, to the general public.  If there are industries which ought to be established here, the establishment of which would seem to carry with them, in the mind of the public, undue risks which the public was not willing to undertake, then if sound propositions are put up to the Government, this company, as part of its ordinary functions, will undertake the financing of these projects in the initial stage, until success has proven to the general public that they constitute sound investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to bind the activities of the company to the extent of saying that if a group of persons feel that a hire purchase corporation might be started in this country, with the idea of helping existing industrial concerns, or manufacturing articles here, and if the people who had that project in mind came to the Corporation and asked it to make an investment, the Corporation should turn it down or reject it.  If persons come to the Corporation looking for financial assistance, they will have to bear in mind the possibility that people may come with wild cat schemes&mdash;that there is that possibility.  Speaking for myself, I can say that if I were a director of the company I would not look with favour upon such investments in very special circumstances, that the wisdom of that investment, the implications of that investment and the <Col N="2357" /> consequences may always be questioned in the Dáil, and that the affairs of that particular undertaking may be brought under the public searchlight. I think I made my position clear, that if people want to start these things on their own they are quite entitled to start them, but, if they come looking for the investment of public money in concerns of that sort, they can only secure that investment on the understanding that, at any moment, the wisdom of it, and all the consequences of it, may be questioned in the Dáil; that the Minister may have to give an account of his stewardship to the Dáil in connection with the starting of the company.  I do not think we could proceed on any other basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point I am not going to commit myself about what the company will or will not do.  These are separate matters which will naturally arise.  We are dealing with this particular corporation, and I do not want to be carried any further than I can see my way clear at the moment. On the question raised by Deputy Cosgrave, in which he mentioned the procedure followed in connection with the hydro-electric development of the Shannon, as an example of the type of procedure he thought should be followed here, I should like to say that I do not think there is any analogy at all between these two undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, it is admittedly the usual practice when large constructional works are being undertaken, and when a company, a corporation or a syndicate has been floated to carry out these works, in order that after their construction they may become profit-earning concerns, where capital has been raised&mdash;and particularly where it has to be borrowed, as distinct from being raised in the ordinary way by a public subscription of ordinary shares&mdash;for those responsible for preparing estimates of the capital required to make provision in the estimates during the constructional period <Col N="2358" /> for interest upon the capital which has been raised, and to include the works out of the capital.  That is the course which was followed in connection with the Shannon undertaking.  I do not see how, if we were to follow the same procedure here, it would get over the difficulty which Deputy Cosgrave has in mind.  We should still have to present a true balance sheet every year, still have to show the losses made by the company, and still have to endure the possibility of a public misapprehension of the true position of the company because of the losses which the balance sheet disclosed.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that the only practical suggestion which Deputy Cosgrave had in mind, as far as I could apprehend, was that during three or four years that this company might show losses, that we should make provision for paying dividends out of the capital of the company.  Well, I think that that would be an unsound procedure.  As I indicated at the beginning, it is our desire that this corporation should be regarded as an ordinary commercial venture.  I think the first thing that would shake the confidence of any ordinary investor in any ordinary concern would be the suggestion that the dividends which that concern was declared to be paying from year to year were being paid out of capital. We could not set up any special reserve for the payment of dividends that would not be properly regarded by the House and by the ordinary people as a whole as making provision, in advance, for paying dividends out of capital.  If we were to do that, I believe it would be an indication to the general public that the operations of this company were going to be conducted on principles that have not met with general acceptance as sound financial and commercial principles. While admittedly the difficulty to which Deputy Cosgrave has referred may arise, we have got to shoulder the consequences of that, and to carry the company through the difficult initial stages without having regard to special devices which, I think, would only cause more trouble than they would be likely to prevent.</P>
    <Col N="2359" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless my recollection is very much at fault, I did not mention dividends at all in the whole course of my statement in connection with this Industrial Credit Corporation.  The Minister's statement is that he anticipates these losses.  Now, what are we at?  This is not a commercial proposition in the normal sense.  If it were, it would not require either this Act or the subscription of the Ministry to fund the company.  It is not a commercial proposition.  It is a proposition proposed by the Government, and the Government propose to take up most of the shares.  As was said earlier, the Government expects this company to invest money in certain new industrial institutions that are going to be started.  The Government expects, I presume, some attention on the part of the directors to the institutions into which their money is going to be invested in these new companies.  There is not to be one company.  There are to be several dealing with the sugar beet industry, a factory for the production of industrial alcohol, a paper factory, a cement factory and so on.  So far as I have seen from any statement made by the Minister it is clear, I think, that the money put up by this corporation is going to have to enter into all the difficulties which any ordinary company meets with in its first year.  The first charge, under the Money Resolution, will be one of £15,000.  There is no earthly hope whatever of earning that in the first year.  The other companies will be in the same position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, if this is not a regular commercial proposition, why not make the provision that is obviously necessary? I think if I were a director of this company or of any company like it, I would not stand for the payment of a dividend from the company for ten years.  I do not believe it will earn one inside the first seven years, with the best luck in the world.  If it is an investment, let it be an investment on the part of the people.  If you want the people's association with this show them a proposition in which at least they will not see their <Col N="2360" /> money disappearing.  In the normal course of events, one cannot look forward to seeing a dividend inside the first five or seven years and, then, possibly only 5 per cent.  Would the Minister, as a business man himself, invest in a concern of that sort?  I am afraid that with the amount of money at my disposal it would not permit me to indulge in such a luxurious proposition as that.</P>
    <P>The whole world to-day is looking for sound industrial concerns.  You want to make this Industrial Credit Bill a success from the start.  Do not shake public confidence in it.  Let provision be made for whatever difficulties there are.  We know they are going to be there, and then why not make provision for them?  If the Minister wishes he may be relieved from paying any dividend in the first three or five years, but that does not mean that the people who invest are going to lose their dividends.  If money is earned it will strengthen the reserves, and make more certain for the future any dividend-earning capacity that there is in the concern. I am sure the Minister does not expect people to invest in this in order to get immediate dividends out of it during the next few years.  Very good. Then there is no loss in keeping the capital of the company intact, and it can be kept intact if the necessary calculations and anticipations are made to provide for that.  I put this to the Minister: do not have the shares of this company quoted on the exchanges of the world at a big discount in its initial years.</P>
    <P>Section 11 agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before paragraph (d) (that the liability of the members of the Company shall be limited) to insert a new paragraph (d) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>that the total commitment of the Company, whether by loan or investment or both, in any one concern shall not exceed one hundred thousand pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2361" /> The effect of this amendment would change very radically the character of the company which the Minister is proposing to establish, but I think it would make it a company in which private investors would be far more likely to invest.  Deputy Cosgrave has just remarked that the company, as it now stands, is not an ordinary commercial proposition, and in that I thoroughly agree with him, though the Minister himself, about 20 minutes ago, used those very words himself, and said it was being started as an ordinary commercial proposition.  It certainly is not, for various reasons.  In the first place, it is an immense undertaking. The mere size of it makes it something other than an ordinary commercial proposition.  In the second place, the Government is tremendously mixed up in it, too much mixed up in it, for any business man to be happy about it as an ordinary commercial proposition.  In the third place, there is considerable confusion of mind as to what the company really is, as to whether it is out to make money or as to whether it is a sort of benevolent institution.  I was rather taken aback when the Minister said just now, in reply to Deputy Moore, that the company would decline to invest in undertakings so attractive that the general public might have them left to them.  That is what I understood him to say.  I had assumed that this company would invest not only in the shares of the new undertakings, but perhaps in the shares of old undertakings, especially undertakings that might wish to extend their activities and to raise new capital.</P>
    <P>Putting money into new undertakings is always highly speculative. There is no use shutting our eyes to that.  Even testators who allow trustees to invest in any type of security&mdash; ordinary shares as well as debentures or gilt-edged stock&mdash;will very often make a special proviso that there shall not be an investment in new enterprises. New enterprises are the most speculative thing that one could invest in.  One would certainly like to feel that a company of this sort was not going to be confined to new issues, but that it could invest in propositions <Col N="2362" /> that had some history behind them as well.</P>
    <P>One of the features that an ordinary investor would most insist upon, in putting money into a holding company or an investment trust, would be diversification.  The very first thing to see is that the investment company sticks firmly to the principle of spreading its risks over a large number of different concerns and that it should not put too much money in any one thing.  This company is proceeding on the very reverse of that.  It is to put £2,000,000 into sugar beet to start with. It is to put £500,000 into industrial alcohol.  It is to put £1,000,000 into mining projects of some kind&mdash;we do not know quite what.  It is possibly to put £750,000 into cement and to put £500,000 into a paper undertaking, whatever it is.</P>
    <P>All these are very large propositions. There is not that wide diversification of risks that one would like, and they are all new propositions.  Take the sugar beet proposition; to invest two-fifths of the company's capital in one proposition is enough to make the whole affair lop-sided.  I suggest that the sugar beet enterprise should be dealt with in an entirely separate Bill, and that a company be created for that purpose and no other.  The Minister has objected to any comparison between what we are doing now and the Shannon Scheme.  I am not familiar with a great many of the facts about the Shannon Scheme, but I would say that his beet proposition is certainly one that merits his former description of the Shannon Scheme, as a white elephant, because the beet company, whatever its merits, will be certainly a white elephant in the sense that it will be definitely an expense to the State.  A white elephant may have such merits as to make it worth keeping, but it will be, nevertheless, a white elephant.  I do feel that this is something which, from the very start, makes this company lop-sided, something which should be dealt with by a separate company altogether.</P>
    <P>I have another amendment down which, perhaps, I might deal with simultaneously, because it is very closely connected with this.  That is, <Col N="2363" /> that the total capital of the concern should be £2,000,000 instead of £5,000,000.  If there were such a limitation as I suggest of £100,000 for any one concern, £2,000,000 capital should be ample, and it should allow us to do what I think we ought to set out to do, and that is to encourage small industries all over the country.  On various occasions in the Dáil I have advocated the creation of a sort of investment trust, similar to that which is now proposed here, always with the idea that it would enable Irish investors to do what they cannot do at present&mdash;to put their money into a wide range of Irish industries, to enable industries to be started that do not require so much capital as to justify them floating a separate issue on the market.  If the amendments I put down are accepted they would enable us to create such an investment trust as that.  It might do a tremendous amount to fertilise Irish industry all over the country.  Instead of that, we have this extremely peculiar, lop-sided measure which does not provide diversification, which leaves the investor with the feeling that ordinary commercial interests may have to give way to Government requirements or to political requirements of some sort or kind.  He does not feel any security in going into a thing like this unless he knows that commercial considerations will always hold first place, and that he will have a reasonable chance of making a satisfactory investment.  The Minister will not get people to come forward and put their capital into what they know is simply a benevolent institution, but he may get them to come forward and put their capital into a concern, even if it is a risky concern, provided that there is a reasonable prospect of it turning out well, and that business principles are really going to be followed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to support these amendments, I must say that I think Deputy MacDermot has scarcely stressed sufficiently the effects which would be produced if his amendments were accepted.  The present proposal of the Minister practically means that there is to be a gigantic&mdash;because it <Col N="2364" /> would be gigantic for this country&mdash; underwriting corporation created which would stand or fall on the success of underwriting about four concerns. At first sight, Deputy MacDermot's proposal appears alongside that proposal to be almost too small, but certainly the question of spreading the risk is one that should not be lightly overlooked.  We are all familiar with the principles of insurance.  No insurance company would conceive taking on a risk which would imperil two-fifths of its capital, because that is really what the sugar beet industry is. They are talking about £2,000,000 and underwriting it.  That would be two-fifths of the entire capital of the company.  We are all familiar with gigantic insurance companies that would not think of holding more than a few thousand pounds risk upon particular properties.  I think that Deputy MacDermot's proposal is an eminently reasonable one.  In the face of our present finances, and the fact that we have to establish ourselves before our own investing public, this appeals to me as a proposition which ought to command the serious consideration of the Government.  Then, if after a few years it was found that the companies that have undertaken the underwriting in the earlier stages are successful, they can then proceed to bigger things.  But obviously the acceptance of this amendment, to my mind, would introduce a very desirable element.  It would bring in in association with this company other interests that would be invaluable in securing the success of the various undertakings which were being underwritten.  I have therefore great pleasure in urging the acceptance of the amendment on the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be disposed to support the amendment, too, but from somewhat different reasons.  From the debate we have had it strikes me what the Minister and the Executive Council possibly had in mind is that these industries, which they propose under this Bill, shall be established either entirely with publicly-subscribed capital or, on the other hand, with capital subscribed by the State.  In no <Col N="2365" /> clause of this Bill that I have read does it seem to me there is any encouragement at all given to any existing company, any existing syndicate, or any existing individual that may be engaged in the same branch of that industry, who would like possibly to start a similar industry in another part of the country or to extend an existing industry, or to encourage an outsider with special knowledge of any particular industry, to come in here and put a certain amount of money into that industry.  There is no encouragement at all, so far as I can see, for the Minister to open negotiations with such class of persons.  The public will much more readily subscribe to extending an existing established industry rather than subscribe to the establishment of an entirely new industry.  I think there can be no doubt about that.  Therefore I think it would be desirable, if we are anxious to get money from the public, that encouragement should be given to those people already engaged in industry to come forward with proposals. Let me illustrate one of the difficulties I see.  Take the establishment of a cement industry here.  We have no knowledge or experience whatever, that I know of, of the modern manufacture of cement.  We have not a modern cement manufactory within the whole of the State.  We have no people who have modern knowledge of that particular industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>If Wexford was successfully manufacturing cement, it would be in existence to-day.  The difficulty is this: we are now going to start in a large way in an industry of which we have no experience whatever.  Consequently, the ordinary investor will be slow to provide the money.  On the other hand, I do not think it desirable for the State to provide the money in the circumstances.  I think the proper thing to do would be to follow some of the lines adopted when we were starting the sugar beet industry.  We got that into the hands of people with a thorough knowledge of the industry. I said when I spoke before that capital is only one of the essentials of successful industry.  A knowledge of the industry, to my mind, is very much more essential.  In this Bill I see stress is laid only on capital and none on knowledge.  The knowledge is assumed. Any industry so based has a very doubtful future before it.  I would encourage the Minister not to jump into ventures too large, but to limit the amount he would put into any one industry.  It may be the amount proposed here by Deputy MacDermot, but I agree with the principle as laid down and that on the part of the State we should limit the amount to be put into any one industry.  From that point of view I think the amendment is one that should carry weight with Deputies in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting the amendment for other than the reasons given up to this.  This is one of the biggest proposals put before the Dáil in connection with public money.  The sum involved is £5,000,000.  On a previous occasion, when the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce was putting before the Dáil his proposals in connection with the electrification of the Shannon, he gave a very elaborate explanation of the whole scheme, elucidating it, I should say, for something over an hour, and exhausting the subject in every possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are invited to consider the expenditure of £5,000,000 of public money.  What are the assets we are <Col N="2367" /> getting in respect of employment in this connection?  How many people are to be put into continuous employment by reason of the expenditure of this money?  If we take the estimate given by the Minister in respect of the Sugar Beet Industry, the figure I think mentioned was £2,000,000.  The capital of the Carlow Sugar Factory is, I think, £400,000.  So that, we have as an estimate, in respect of two out of these five million pounds, five sugar beet factories like the one in Carlow.  We were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that in respect of that portion of the investment which would deal with sugar beet there were three methods which he proposed to employ in making it easy on the taxpayer.  He proposed in the first place, he said, to save money in expenses.  I calculated from the statement he made and from subsequent observations which fell from him that the £400,000 factory which had been established in Carlow would be likely to be installed there for a sum of £300,000 and that the four factories consequently would cost £1,200,000.  He stated that machinery was cheaper.  Obviously, we are not going to have four factories dearer than the one in Carlow.  I presume that the Minister for Finance will admit that.  If he denies that they are going to be cheaper than the one in Carlow, then the Minister for Industry and Commerce is wrong when he says that they are going to save something in expenses, unless he meant the running expenses.  What amount of employment is going to be given in respect of the costs of the sugar beet industry or in respect of the cement industry?  We had an estimate by Deputy Good, who has some experience in connection with building materials and so on.  I remember the time when the cement factory was put up at Crumlin&mdash;at least it was called Crumlin, though it was not exactly Crumlin: it was on the canal bank.  It afforded at that time the worst paid employment in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

That will come up at a later stage.&rdquo;  We are handing the money out now.  Is it to be said that we are not to discuss the question of the advantage to be derived as a result of the expenditure of this money?  That kind of thing is not done.</P>

      <P>We are voting it now, and this is the relevant stage of this Bill.  Every stage in the whole Bill depends on this £5,000,000, and I am entitled, on the discussion of the expenditure of that money, to see what advantages we are going to get from it.  The Minister simply told us what the sums were.  I can take him on the question of the cost of a single factory, and he has a Deputy beside him who sits for that constituency in which the present factory is.  Will he deny that the capital cost of the factory is £400,000?  The Minister says that we are going to spend £2,000,000 on sugar beet.  Then we are going to have five factories and not four.  Where does the £2,000,000 for sugar beet factories arise in connection with the provision of four sugar beet factories?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard that before, and we were not very well satisfied with what we waited for or what we saw.  That was the unhappy observation of a great man, and the results were eminently unsatisfactory for the speakers and for the hearers.  In this case £5,000,000 is the sum that is asked for and one of the items making that up is £2,000,000 for sugar beet factories.  How is that going to be expended and where?  It is to cost £500,000 notwithstanding the statement of the Minister that they were going to save money on expenses.  We will go on to the other items.  £750,000 are for <Col N="2369" /> a cement factory.  How many people is that going to employ in view of the amount of money that is involved?  We are entitled to ask ourselves in connection with the whole scheme whether or not it has been thought out at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit in this connection that the House is perfectly entitled to assume that £1,200,000 is quite enough as an estimate for sugar beet, assuming for the moment that the Industrial Credit Company has to put up all the money.  Is it to put up all the money?  Does the Minister expect any money from outside?  It would be a very small estimate to assume that 33? per cent. should be put into industrial activities.  We can leave over the amount of public subscription until we see what is the amount involved.  Say, £1,000,000 for sugar beet, and £750,000 for cement. £750,000 is a very costly estimate for cement.  Then there is the question of industrial alcohol.  I must admit that my knowledge of the costs of industrial alcohol manufacture is very limited.  I cannot remember what sum the Minister stated would be required in that connection, but £500,000 seem to me to be a very exaggerated estimate of the cost.  We have now arrived at £2,000,000.  For paper-making let us say £500,000. That, too, I would regard as an overestimate. I think £250,000 would be quite enough in that case.  That is £2,250,000, and I find that I have just about half the Minister's estimate of £4,500,000.  Let us assume for a moment that we add on a little more, and make it £3,000,000&mdash;£1,000,000 to be provided by public subscription and £2,000,000 to be provided by this Bill.  That is about as large a sum of money as an indulgent Dáil, in its most optimistic mood, bearing in mind the difficulties of collecting that money and, perhaps, of paying interest on it, is entitled in these very difficult times to risk, having regard to the very small amount of information we have got as regards the amount of employment that is likely to be given, the success that is likely to be achieved and the results likely to accrue from the investment of such a huge sum of <Col N="2370" /> money as that.  It is most unlikely that, within the next twelve months, more than the plants for two sugar beet factories are going to be laid down.  How many people, well versed in that particular business&mdash;and it is a highly technical business&mdash;are to be employed in finding out the suitable sites with all the necessaries that are essential for a successful campaign and for making it an economic proposition? How many people are going to be engaged in finding out these places, in getting the plant and doing all the other things that are necessary?</P>
    <P>The Executive Council have on many occasions declared their desire and anxiety to develop industry in this State, and to see that a fillip is given to industrial expansion.  It can be overdone.  Much damage can be done if unwise investments are made.  Is it likely that four separate and distinct sugar prospectors are going to come here within the next twelve months, or is there to be a single company?  In the case of the other activities envisaged in connection with this proposal, has there been due advertence to the present economic position of the country, and whether the strain will not be too much for the main industry of the country in view of the costs that are falling on it and the costs that are bound to be entailed by different things, and that the advantages which may be derived in providing employment in one direction may not be counter-balanced by the losses sustained in another direction?  We have not got in respect of these proposals before us a single report from a single expert or technician recommending the inauguration of these particular things.  I know the Ministers have taken it up with the best will in the world, and have made a study of it and all the rest of it.  But, I venture to say, without disrespect to any person, that the commitments that the Ministers themselves will be involved in in connection with this will be with due regard to their own resources.  I say that, realising the difficulties of the present situation, the whole world position, the economy of this State at present, and the desirability of conserving whatever resources <Col N="2371" /> we have, we are not entitled to take risks which would possibly entail costs on those who come after us and impose a burden on them in future difficult years which would be almost impossible to bear.  I am just as anxious as anybody else to see industry developed here, but what man, if he were going to run a business, would not employ the best experts to advise him, would not go beyond whatever resources were immediately at his hand to ensure that whatever money he put into the business would be money well spent and give good results?</P>

I am not going to wait and see the money of the people disappear without making sure that, as far as my responsibility is concerned, there is a good case made for the expenditure of public money, and taking just as much a care as I would take in the case of my own money.  I am not entitled to do anything else.  Will the <Col N="2372" /> Minister say that the country is as well able to undertake the risk in this connection to-day as it was this day 12 months?  Will he say the country is as prosperous as it was 12 months ago? Will he deny what the Minister for Agriculture said in Claremorris last week that he knows the times are bad, that the farmers are getting poor prices, that labourers find it difficult to get employment, that shop keepers are being hard hit?  It is on these people and no others that the ultimate cost of this, if it is not a success, is going to fall.  I wonder whether, in all the circumstances, having regard to the money involved, we are going to get compensating advantages in connection with the expenditure of such a huge sum.  I am certainly not satisfied from the figures presented by the Minister. This is the last grip that this House has got in connection with this £5,000,000 other than the other stages which this measure must go through. This is the last opportunity they have of limiting it and of ensuring that it is a properly thought-out, well-planned undertaking from beginning to end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Second Stage I do not consider that it is good finance to embark upon a scheme estimated to cost £5,000,000.  I consider that it would be much better business to make it £2,000,000 and to come to the Dáil in six months, nine months or 12 months and ask for more money.  The Minister is sure of 76 votes in the Dáil and there is no danger that he will not get it.  In all the circumstances, what does he want?  Does he not want to secure stabilisation here, and to secure confidence on the part of the people, in respect of any proposals that come up here; that when a business proposition comes up here it will receive fair examination and be presented in better order than this was on this day week?  This is a proposal which vitally concerns the Minister for Agriculture and he is not here.  Ought he not to be here?  Is there any reason why he should not?  Two-fifths of the £5,000,000 is to be spent in connection with one branch of that industry which he is supposed to protect and ought to protect.  Why should he not be here to explain in detail all the items that <Col N="2373" /> go to make that up?  Two-fifths of the whole sum and the Minister is not here!
