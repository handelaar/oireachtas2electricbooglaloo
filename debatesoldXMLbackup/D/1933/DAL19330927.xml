      <P>As the question of the future administration of Irish lights is still the subject of correspondence between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State, I cannot at the moment make the statement referred to in my reply of the 9th August.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state why a blind pension has been refused to Michael Scanlon, Cloghan, on medical grounds, although a qualified oculist certifies that one eye is completely blind and that there is only one-sixth of normal vision in the other eye.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence before me showed that the ability of the claimant to work had not been impaired by any defect of vision.  The claimant did not accordingly fulfil the statutory condition as to blindness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not quite get the end of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, or indeed any part of it.</P>

      <P>The evidence before me showed that the ability of the claimant to work had not been impaired by any defect of vision.  The claimant did not accordingly fulfil the statutory condition as to blindness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that reply, I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he is seriously suggesting to the House that when a man has one eye completely blind and has only one-sixth of the normal vision in the other eye that he does not come within the provisions of the Old Age Pensions Acts?  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary must have an opinion of his own on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not accurately informed as to the degree of defective sight in this case.  The certificate says that the defective sight is one-fourth in the good eye and not one-sixth.  From the information at the disposal of the Department it appears that the claimant is, in fact, following his normal occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I inform the Parliamentary Secretary that I myself saw the medical certificate which stated that with the assistance of glasses some improvement can be made?  There is no reference to spectacles in the relevant statutes.  In addition to that, I want to ask is the <Col N="1626" /> Parliamentary Secretary aware that the applicant is a small farmer who derives a large part of his income from labouring on other farmers' land and can he seriously suggest that a man blind in one eye and with one-sixth, or even one-fourth, defective vision in the other is fit to earn a living working on a small farm in the west of Donegal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state what steps are being taken to adjudicate appeals on blind pensions in County Donegal; and how many such appeals are awaiting decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given him on the 7th June last regarding the position of blind pension appeals in this county.  In addition to the two tours of inspection in the county referred to in that reply, 96 claimants have since been examined in the county by the Department's Medical Inspector.  It is expected that about one-half of the outstanding cases will be decided at an early date on similar reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, might I ask if he has overlooked the latter part of my question&mdash;how many such appeals are awaiting decision in blind pension cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he can state <Col N="1634" /> whether licences to import fibre suit cases free of duty have been given to certain traders while other traders in competition with them have had to pay duty imposed on these articles by the Finance Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not the intention, when the Customs duty was being imposed on cardboard containers, that fibre suit cases should come within the scope of the duty.  Subsequently, however, the Revenue Commissioners decided that they had no option but to include these articles as, in their opinion, they came within the scope of the duty.  On the matter being brought to my attention I decided that in all the circumstances it would be reasonable to operate a general licensing provision.  Since 27th July, 1933, all importations of fibre suit cases have been admitted without payment of duty under licence.  As regards importation prior to that date on which duty was paid, I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners will repay such duty on application being made to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following Commissions and Committees of Inquiry affecting the Civil Service have been set up since March, 1932:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  The Committee of Inquiry into the question of temporary reductions in the pay of public servants;</P>
      <P>2.  Committee of Inquiry into the cost-of-living index figure; and</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> Final reports have been received from the two committees.  It is not proposed to publish the reports of the first-mentioned committee.  The report of the Committee on the cost-of-living index figure has already been presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  No report has been received from the Commission of Inquiry into the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>As to the last part of the question, I would refer the Deputy, in regard to the first-mentioned Committee to the statement I made during the debate on the Second Stage of the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill. Certain aspects of the report of the Committee on the cost-of-living index figure have yet to be considered, and it is, therefore, not possible to say at the moment what the final outcome of the Committee's labours may be.  As to the Commission of Inquiry, the objects which it is hoped to achieve are indicated in its Terms of Reference, which have already been published in the Press.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the old age pension granted to Mrs. Catherine Coughlan, Knocknamanna, Minane Bridge, Carrigaline, County Cork, is being withheld to recover an overpayment stated to have been made between April, 1921, and December, 1929: if he is aware that <Col N="1637" /> when proceedings were taken for the recovery of this money the Circuit Judge did not give a decree against Mrs. Coughlan, and whether in view of the circumstances of the case and pensioner's age he will consider having the remainder of the overpayment remitted and pension restored to Mrs. Coughlan immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  The Circuit Court Judge gave a decree last January for the amount of old age pension overdrawn with costs, payable by instalments of 1/- a week, the first payment to be made on the 1st of March, 1933.  No payments were made by Mrs. Coughlan under this decree.  Payment of her current old age pension is now being withheld in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 (3) of the Old Age Pension Act, 1911, to recover the amount overdrawn.</P>
      <P>There does not appear to be any good reason why recovery of the balance of the debt outstanding should not be enforced.</P>

      <P>The British additional import duties (No. 19) Order, 1933, under which an ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. on dead poultry imported has been decreased to 3d. per lb. came into operation on the 15th instant, and no information is yet available as to the effect of that Order on prices.  The object of the Order is, I understand, to increase the prices for dead poultry in the United Kingdom, and if this object be achieved, exporters from this country should obtain an increase in price as an offset to the additional duty.</P>
      <P>It is not, therefore, proposed at present to vary the existing rate of bounty on exports of dead poultry from the Saorstát.</P>

    <P>1. Section 1.  After the word &ldquo;was&rdquo; in line 44 to insert the words &ldquo;agreed upon or&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>2. Section 4, sub-section (5).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(5)  The Minister for Finance shall, by regulations made by him under this Act, provide for the immediate redemption of new land bonds transferred by order of the Judicial Commissioner in redemption of land purchase annuities charged on lands acquired by the Land Commission under the Principal Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two recommendations from the Seanad and it is proposed to ask the Dáil to agree to both of them.  The first is an amendment to Section 1 and proposes to insert the words &ldquo;agreed upon or&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;was&rdquo; in line 34. Paragraph (d) would then read &ldquo;untenanted land which hereafter becomes vested in the Land Commission under Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923, but the price of which was agreed upon or fixed before the passing of this Act&rdquo;.  It is considered probable that the paragraph in its original form might be held not to be sufficiently wide to include cases in which the price has been agreed upon between the Land Commission and the owner but in which there has not been an actual fixation by publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  The words are inserted to overcome that difficulty.</P>
      <P>The Dáil agreed with the Seanad in recommendation No. 1.</P>
      <P>Message to be sent to the Seanad accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The second recommendation is to insert a new sub-section before sub-section (5) of Section 4.  The new sub-section is set out on the Order Paper.  Section 14 of the Land Act, 1923, provided that where <Col N="1646" /> land, which is subject to a purchase annuity has been acquired by the Land Commission under that Act, then in such case the annuity for the repayment of the original advance shall be regarded and dealt with as a claim attaching to the purchase money of the land advanced under the Act of 1923. This meant that the purchase annuity set up under the earlier Acts had to be redeemed by means of a payment in land bonds.  With land bonds fluctuating in value it would have been practically impossible to fix with any accuracy the amount of land bonds required to redeem the annuity. It was consequently provided in Section 1 of the Land Act, 1923, that regulations to be made by the Minister for Finance for the drawing of land bonds should provide for the immediate redemption of bonds transferred by order of the judicial commissioner in satisfaction of death duties or in redemption of land purchase annuities. The amount of bonds transferred in satisfaction of the death duties was very large, and the sinking fund portion of the Act was quite insufficient to provide redemption money for these bonds.  The result was that considerable draws had to be made on the Guarantee Fund and the grants had to be withheld from the local authorities. Section 3 of the Land Act of 1931 provided that bonds transferred in satisfaction of death duties were no longer to be drawn for immediate redemption.  This provision was made possible by the fact that the land bonds were then over par and were not likely to fall below par, and that consequently there was likely to be no loss of revenue.  There is no necessity for providing for the further redemption of land bonds tendered for death duties, but there remains the problem of purchase annuities that may be charged upon the land acquired under the new Land Bill, and it is proposed in that case where payment is made under this Act of 1923, that there shall be immediate redemption as in the case of former land bonds.  In the case of the redemption of purchase annuities any serious draws on the Guarantee Fund are unlikely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I move that the Unemployment Assistance Bill be read a second time.  The principle of this Bill is that all able-bodied persons who are involuntarily unemployed, and have either no means at all or insufficient means to maintain themselves and their dependents, should be given a statutory right to assistance in the manner in which the Bill proposes.  I presume that it is not necessary for me to enter into any elaborate or lengthy explanation or defence of that principle, as it is, I understand, fully accepted by all Parties in the House.  The question upon which difference of opinion may arise is as to the manner which will prove most effective in carrying that principle into operation.  We have had that question under examination for a considerable period, and have arrived at the conclusion that the type of machinery and the mode of operation now enshrined in this Bill is likely to be the most effective in giving early and complete operation to the principle I have mentioned, and which we all accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing provisions for dealing with the relief of unemployed persons here are inadequate, as all Deputies have agreed.  The main provision, of course, the Unemployment Insurance Code.  The benefits available, however, under the Unemployment Insurance Acts are subject to two important limitations, and consequently cannot be regarded as adequate for dealing with the unemployment problem as we now know it.  In the first place, unemployment insurance benefit is restricted to one week's benefit for each six contributions paid <Col N="1652" /> in respect of the insured person; that is, a person must be employed for six weeks before becoming entitled to one week's unemployment insurance benefit, but no matter how long a person has been employed, or how many contributions have been paid in respect of him, he cannot receive benefit of more than 26 weeks in any one year; consequently when insured persons have exhausted their right to benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts they are&mdash;for a period at any rate&mdash; left without any further assistance from that source, even though they may still be unemployed and still in need of that assistance.  In addition to the restrictions I have mentioned, it is, of course, common knowledge that the Unemployment Insurance Acts do not apply at all to persons ordinarily employed in agriculture, although it is clear that an agricultural worker, when unemployed, is probably not less in need of assistance than the worker following an insurable occupation.</P>
    <P>In cases of actual destitution local authorities are empowered, under the Poor Relief Acts, to give assistance to able-bodied persons.  The assistance given by local authorities varies from the area of one authority to another, and is in most cases altogether inaccurate, apart from the fact that there is associated with it a taint of pauperism which has deterred many persons entitled to that assistance from applying for it.  In recent years various local councils have, from time to time, passed resolutions setting out the opinion of their members that the relief of able-bodied unemployed persons should not be a local but a national charge.  The effect of the Bill now before the Dáil is, of course, to transfer from local authorities to the national exchequer the obligation of providing for the relief of able-bodied persons, subject to the conditions of the Bill.  The Unemployment Insurance Acts and the Poor Relief Acts provide at present the legislative provisions for dealing with unemployment, but as Deputies are aware the State has had to supplement the operation of those Acts in recent years by the voting of money for the organisation of public works in various <Col N="1653" /> parts of the country, so as to provide employment for persons who are without it.  While the organisation of those works served a very useful purpose, and it is proposed to continue them so long as the need for them exists, it is clear that they cannot be so arranged as to deal with all the unemployed.  The works themselves must be of a useful nature, and it is frequently not possible to find, in areas where distress is greatest, works which can be usefully carried out and which are of sufficient magnitude to deal with the unemployment problem in the area concerned.  In this country, as Deputies are aware, we suffer not merely from the effects of misgovernment in the past and the growth of a defective economic organisation, but also&mdash;due to historical causes&mdash;from the mal-distribution of our population.</P>
    <P>Parts of the country which are richest in natural resources are frequently the least densely populated while the areas which are bereft of natural resources&mdash;areas along the Western seaboard and parts of the South&mdash;are very densely populated indeed.  That disproportion in population as between areas as well as the fact that the most densely populated areas require help most urgently, while at the same time they offer natural difficulties to the affording of that help, make it necessary to have some over-riding provision for dealing with distress which will ensure that any gaps left by the other schemes designed to deal with unemployment will be filled in some manner, and the distress alleviated in consequence.  Relief works also provide only for the needs of a certain type of worker.  No doubt the workers who find employment upon these different works are the most numerous in the country, but there are other workers who, because of their physical strength or their previous training, or for some other reason are unable to avail of these opportunities of employment.  No other provision is made for them, if they are not entitled to benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts <Col N="1654" /> apart from the provision made by local authorities under the Poor Relief Acts.</P>
    <P>When one comes to consider the manner in which the principle of State unemployment assistance should be applied, one has to bear in mind the facilities of organisation that exist at the present time and to ensure that any new organisation that may be created will fit as closely as possible into that which is there already.  I am sure that Deputies opposite, like Deputies in other parts of the House when they decided that the principle of the Bill was one to be supported, have been giving consideration to questions arising out of the practical application of that principle, and like the Government have decided that the most effective means of applying it in a practical and efficient manner is to use as fully as possible the machinery that is there already.  I refer particularly to the machinery established under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  One could conceive various methods of applying this principle which would be somewhat less cumbersome in appearance than that proposed in the Bill and which might be applied in a country where no unemployment insurance scheme operated and where, one might say, the field was clear for the creation of a new organisation. Here in the Saorstát we have got an organisation of employment exchanges and a number of State officers trained in administering a scheme of unemployment relief along certain lines.  We decided at the beginning that we would endeavour to model the new scheme as closely as possible on the old one, so that it could be administered not merely through the same offices, but by the same officers as in the case of the older scheme.</P>
    <P>The proposal, therefore, is to give to every person in this country who complies with certain conditions, set out in Section 10 of the Bill, the right to apply for what is called a qualification certificate.  The person need not be unemployed when applying for that certificate.  The certificate is merely an indication that such person complies with these conditions; that he is a citizen of Saorstát Eireann; that he is over 18 and under 70 years of age, <Col N="1655" /> that his means, calculated under the Act, do not exceed £52 in a county borough or the borough of Dun Laoghaire or £39 elsewhere; that his parents or other relatives are unable to maintain him, and would not ordinarily be expected to maintain him, or, in the case of a married woman, that her husband is a dependent or that she has one or more dependents and, in the case of a widow or spinster, that she has one or more dependents.  The applications for qualification certificates will be examined by unemployment assistance officers to be appointed under the Bill.  To prevent misunderstanding, I should say at this stage, that the unemployment assistance officers to be appointed under this Bill will, in the main, be Employment Officers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts or, in certain cases, old age pension officers under the Old Age Pensions Act.  The term &ldquo;unemployment assistance officer&rdquo; is used, but it does not necessarily imply a separate individual or a separate group of individuals to the group of officers now administering other Acts.</P>
    <P>It will, of course, be necessary to give full effect to the scheme set out in the Bill to extend the organisation of the employment exchanges, to open additional branch offices in certain districts and to substitute exchanges for branch offices in other districts. That will involve undoubtedly an increase in the clerical staff, but the new scheme will be fitted into the old so that it will be administered from the beginning by persons trained in the administration of a scheme of this kind.  When a person has applied for his certificate the statements of fact, which he makes with his application, are verified by the unemployment assistance officer.  If the unemployment assistance officer disputes the statement of fact and refuses a certificate, or in some other way acts contrary to the applicant's opinions of his interests, an appeal lies from the unemployment assistance officer to a committee to be appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, a committee which will be appointed on somewhat similar lines to the Old <Col N="1656" /> Age Pensions Committee in the Department of Local Government.  The decisions of that committee upon questions relating to the qualification certificate will be final.</P>
    <P>One may ask why it is necessary to have these certificates at all; why it could not be possible to devise a method by which a person, when unemployed, would make his claim, establish his right to it and become entitled to assistance forthwith.  The purpose of this certificate is to enable the scheme to be brought into conformity with the unemployment insurance scheme.  The certificate will, in fact, be similar to the unemployment insurance book.  When a person is employed the certificate like the insurance book will be in his possession; when he becomes unemployed and decides to claim assistance or benefit he will lodge the certificate with the exchange in the same way as he lodges his insurance book at the present time. The device of the certificate not merely makes it possible to bring the scheme of organisation into conformity with the unemployment insurance code but it also ensures that no impediment will be placed in the way of workers moving from one part of the country to another in search of employment. The mobility of labour will not be impaired.  It also provides a very useful method of preventing fraud and particularly the possibility of a person claiming and receiving unemployment assistance in two places at the same time.</P>
    <P>There are provisions in the Bill for the modification of the certificate and for its revocation in certain circumstances. It is not necessary to discuss these at this stage as they will arise for consideration in the Committee Stage.  My aim now is merely to give a general picture of the type of organisation which it is proposed to set up in order to implement our common principle in the matter.  When a person holding a certificate becomes unemployed certain things happen. First of all, if he is insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, he makes a claim under those Acts for benefit and he does not become entitled to unemployment assistance under this Bill until his claim to benefit under the Unemployment <Col N="1657" /> Insurance Acts has been exhausted. That affects the majority of industrial workers.  The agricultural worker, however, who is not insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts and not entitled to benefit under those Acts comes directly to make his claim for unemployment assistance under this Bill.</P>
    <P>When a person insured under the Insurance Acts has exhausted his right to benefit and makes his claim for assistance or when a person not insurable becomes unemployed and makes his claim, he has to establish certain things to the satisfaction of the unemployment assistance officer. The first is that he has been continuously unemployed for at least six days.  We have inserted in the Bill a provision similar to that which exists in the Unemployment Insurance Acts which provides that two days employment or two periods of unemployment of not less than two days each separated by two days during which the person has been employed is regarded as a period of continuous unemployment.  In other words, if a person while waiting the six days to become entitled to assistance succeeds in getting one day's casual work, he does not have to start the six days all over again.  The six days are regarded as continuous for the purpose of Section 15.  Having established that he has been unemployed continuously for six days in accordance with the definition in the Bill he must next satisfy the officer that he is capable of work.  In other words, this Bill applies only to able-bodied persons; persons who are prevented by physical or mental infirmity from earning their livelihood are not affected by the Bill. The Bill is designed only to ensure the provision of assistance for persons who are capable of work.  He must also satisfy the officer that he is available for and genuinely seeking but is unable to obtain employment, that is, suitable employment having regard to age, sex, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances. If a person leaves his employment voluntarily or loses his employment through his own fault or refuses an <Col N="1658" /> offer of employment when an offer is made to him he becomes disqualified from receiving assistance under this Bill for the period set out therein.</P>
    <P>A person may refuse an offer of work on the grounds indicated in paragraph (b) sub-section (1) of Section 15 that the work is unsuitable for him having regard to age, sex or physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence or family circumstances, but a decision, in the case of a dispute between the officer and an applicant, given in the appropriate manner against the applicant would debar him from receiving assistance. He must also satisfy the officer that since the qualification certificate was issued there has been no change in circumstances or no other event has happened which has invalidated the certificate or which would, if known to the officer, have disentitled him from receiving the certificate.  There is another provision which at the present time is merely a pious hope but which we will endeavour to translate into reality at some later stage.  It is, that a person receiving assistance under this Bill must, if required to do it by the Minister, attend at a course of instruction appointed or approved by regulations under the Bill.  That proviso is put in there so as to ensure that there will be no legal barrier to the adoption of some scheme of training unemployed persons in skilled or semi-skilled occupations.</P>
    <P>There is another provision which is important and it is that nobody can get unemployment assistance in any of the county boroughs, in the borough of Dun Laoghaire, or in any of the towns over 7,000 in population unless he has been either residing in these areas for one year or has had not less than three months continuous employment in them.  The necessity for that provision is obvious.  The rate of assistance payable is higher in the cities than in the smaller towns and higher in the smaller towns than in the rural areas, and there must necessarily be some deterrent to people travelling from rural areas into the cities in order to get these higher rates of benefit, and the deterrent is that they do not become entitled to <Col N="1659" /> benefit at all unless they have resided in one of the towns or cities for at least 12 months or have had three months continuous employment there. If there is any feeling amongst members of the Dáil that the periods specified in that paragraph are not sufficiently long we can consider extending them.</P>
    <P>Persons are disqualified from receiving benefits under other circumstances which need not be debated at length now; when they are out of Saorstát Eireann, when occupants of a prison or occupants of an hospital, infirmary, lunatic asylum or anything of that kind.  Similarly they are debarred from receiving Unemployment assistance when they are entitled to unemployment insurance benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  A person who is convicted of an offence under the Bill or who is convicted of any offence involving not less than two weeks imprisonment becomes disqualified from receiving assistance under the Bill for a period of three months.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that one of the conditions for receiving a qualification certificate was absence of means exceeding £52 per year in the county boroughs, or £39 per year elsewhere. If a person has means less than £52 per year in the county boroughs, and £39 per year in the rural areas, he is entitled to get only the rate of assistance set out in the Schedule of the Bill, less his means, the first 2/- in the weekly valuation of his means being ignored.  In other words, a person entitled, according to the Schedule, to 15/- weekly and having means of 10/- would get the 15/-, less 8/-.  In calculating the weekly value of a person's means the nearest shilling only is taken into account. There are various provisions providing for the payment of assistance to persons entitled to it, all of which are similar to those contained in the Unemployment Insurance Acts.</P>
    <P>In addition we are providing that a person dissatisfied with the decision of the unemployment assistance officer as to his availability for work, as to the reasons why he left employment, <Col N="1660" /> and as to his claim under the Bill, or in similar matters, may appeal to the same courts of referees and the same Umpire as operate under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  As Deputies are aware, under these Acts there is an appeal from the Employment officer to a court of referees and, under certain circumstances, from the court of referees to the Umpire.  We propose to use the same machinery for determining appeals under this part of the Bill, now before the Dáil, in relation to appeals from the unemployment assistance officer. An appeal as to the qualification of a person to hold a certificate is, however, taken to an appeals committee similar to the Old Age Pensions Committee to which I referred.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the cost of the scheme will be defrayed from three sources.  In the first place we propose to take £250,000 per year from the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  There is another Bill, now before the Dáil, to enable that Fund to make the contribution. The rates of contribution payable in respect of insured persons are being increased to the level at which they stood on the 31st December, 1931.  From that date the rate of contribution was decreased, because the Government in office at that time did not consider it necessary that the debt of the Fund should be liquidated at the rate at which it was then being liquidated.  Whether the cut in the contribution was too severe is a matter that may be debated.  In any event the raising of the rate to the 1931 level will yield us £250,000 now in consequence of the increased number coming under unemployment insurance. I may say that the rate when raised will be still lower than the prevailing rates in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland.  We propose to levy upon the county boroughs and borough of Dun Laoghaire a rate of 1/6 in the £ on the poor law valuation.  That figure is arrived at by taking what was the average of the poundage rate equivalent to the total cost of home assistance in the year ended 31st March last, in these five areas.  The average equivalent rate for the five areas corresponding to the total cost <Col N="1661" /> of home assistance was 1/6 in the £. It is anticipated that that rate will bring in roughly £185,000.  It is proposed also to levy an amount equivalent to the produce of a rate of 9d. in the £ on the other districts, where the medium rate of assistance is paid; that is in towns other than county boroughs and the borough of Dun Laoghaire, the population of which at the latest census exceeded 7,000.  The average equivalent rate in these areas for the last year was 1/5. In the majority of cases the new rate will represent a very considerable reduction in the old one.  The balance, whatever it may be, will be provided from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Deputies will no doubt be anxious to know what the total annual cost of the scheme is likely to be.  It is, of course, impossible to state with any degree of accuracy what the total cost is likely to work out at.  One can make estimates and be reasonably satisfied as to their accuracy, but no one should lose sight of the fact that they are no more than estimates.  In the calculation of the estimated cost of the scheme which we prepared there were no less than 15 estimated figures.  There were 15 points in the calculation, where the figures used were estimated figures, any one of which may have been inaccurate.  We determined that the scheme to be prepared and submitted to the Dáil should cost on the basis of existing unemployment roughly £1,000,000 per year.  We tried to prepare a scheme which would involve that cost, and that cost only.  However, in working out the scheme in detail we found it impossible to adhere strictly to our original idea of the cost and there is reason to believe that the scheme before the Dáil on the present basis of unemployment, will cost more than £1,000,000 yearly, leaving out the cost of administration.  Roughly speaking, every thousand persons who, on the average, over the whole year, become entitled to assistance under this Bill will involve a cost of £30,000.  The number of persons registered as unemployed, in the week when the highest number of persons registered was recorded, was 104,000.  One week <Col N="1662" /> in January of this year 104,000 persons were registered as unemployed.  That figure was reached after an intensive drive to get persons to register, after it had been announced that unemployment relief funds would be distributed as between areas according to the number registered, and after the provision of additional facilities for registration.  It probably represents very accurately the number of persons in that week who were willing to take work if it were offered to them.  There must, however, be deducted from that figure 26,000, representing those who were entitled to unemployment insurance benefit and also some other figure, difficult of calculation, representing the number of those registered who were landholder and possessed land of such a valuation that their means, as calculated under this Bill, would be sufficiently high to exclude them from benefit.</P>
    <P>There must also be deducted a figure in respect of persons in receipt of pensions and other forms of remuneration in excess of the means limit fixed by the Bill.  A certain number of those registered were, of course, juveniles, and some others of them would not be entitled to assistance under this Bill on one or other of the grounds set out.  The lowest number of persons registered as unemployed in the present year, under similar conditions was, roughly, 55,000.  From that figure similar deductions must be made in respect of persons entitled to unemployment insurance benefit, persons holding land or other property yielding an income in excess of £52 or £39 per year, persons in possession of pensions, juveniles and others.  Making these calculations and trying to strike a figure which would represent the average for the year, a certain conclusion was arrived at.  In order to check the accuracy of that conclusion, it was cross-checked by a calculation based on the home assistance figures.  The total number of persons on home assistance on the last Saturday of March, 1933, was 130,614.  Much more than half of those were children under 15 years.  About 20,000 of them were men and women permanently disabled by old age or <Col N="1663" /> infirmity from earning their livelihood. About 4,000 of them were persons temporarily disabled by sickness or infirmity from earning their livelihood. Seventeen thousand of them were wives of men receiving assistance.  The total number of able-bodied men on home assistance on that date was 14,817, and the total number of able-bodied females was 6,085.  The corresponding figures for the present date are lower in each class, as one would expect.  The number on home assistance would vary in the same way as the number of persons registered as unemployed would vary.  Proceeding upon the basis of these figures and allowing what appears to be a reasonable margin for error, one would conclude that the average number of persons who would probably become entitled to assistance under this Bill would be less than 40,000&mdash;that is, on the average for the year.  The figure would be lower at certain periods of the year and higher at other periods. It may be that that figure contains too wide a margin for error but it will be only when one shall have had experience of the scheme in operation for a year or two years that one will be able safely to calculate what the annual cost is likely to be over any period. It is because, for a year or two, the scheme must be regarded as experimental, we are making provision in the Bill for variation of the rates of benefit by Order, the intention being to ensure that if the cost is likely to exceed considerably that which we have estimated, some variation in the rates or some diminution in the number of classes entitled to benefit may be made, and vice versa.</P>
    <P>One other provision of the Bill requires to be explained.  In Section 4, sub-section (3), it is provided that the Minister may make Orders declaring any period of the year to be, in respect of any class or any district, an employment period.  If such an Order be made, no person of the class or in the district concerned will be entitled to unemployment assistance.  In preparing a scheme of this kind, one must naturally try to visualise the difficulties that will arise.  One of the difficulties <Col N="1664" /> that most obviously will arise is the assessing of claims for assistance made by the holders of uneconomic farms, As Deputies are aware, that difficulty has arisen under the Unemployment Insurance Acts and that matter has been frequently ventilated here.  It is not always easy to determine when a person who holds land of small acreage and who supplements his earnings from the land by earnings from road work or some other class of work, is employed on the land or not.  In order to overcome that difficulty and to get a clear and simple method of dealing with it, it is proposed to take power to make Orders providing that for certain periods of the year people of that class or some similar class will be regarded as employed upon their holdings or in whatever other occupation they may be engaged.  That power of making Orders might also have to be used if it were found that the other provisions of the Bill were not sufficient to ensure that every person obtaining assistance under the Bill would genuinely seek and take, when available, whatever work was offered within the limits of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Certain criticism has been offered concerning the rates of payment which it is proposed to make.  The only answer to this criticism is that the total cost of the measure now before the Dáil is estimated to reach the maximum limit of the amount which can be provided for this purpose.  Any increase in these rates, any amendment of the Bill designed to secure increased expenditure, would defeat the whole purpose of the measure as it could not then be proceeded with. If we find that our calculation as to cost has been grossly inaccurate, that the number of persons entitled to assistance under the Bill proves to be considerably less than we assumed, or that for some other reason the cost was likely to be reduced, then these rates can be reconsidered.  But until that has been proved by experience we must assume our estimates to be correct and cut our cloth according to our measure.</P>
    <P>We are providing in the Bill a scheme of unemployment assistance which is an innovation in this country <Col N="1665" /> and which will ensure to every person who is involuntarily unemployed, and consequently deprived of adequate means of livelihood, a statutory right to assistance, assistance which is much more considerable than that available to such person under the Poor Relief Acts at present.  I do not know that it is necessary to give any general review of the rates of home assistance available in different districts.  It would take a very long time to read all the figures, because the most remarkable thing to be learned from them is the very considerable variations that occur from one district to another.  Under this Bill, of course, there will be uniform rates in similar districts available to everybody.  I do not propose to deal at this stage with any of the criticisms of the Bill which have been made outside the House.  Presumably those who have been making criticisms of the Bill outside the House will be able to inspire some Deputies to voice their ideas here.  I notice, however, that one gentleman, who, I understand, the Deputies opposite have now accepted as their Leader, said that this Bill indicates the failure of the Government's industrial policy, and that another gentleman, speaking at a Sinn Féin meeting in O'Connell Street last night, said the same thing.</P>

      <P>The comment of the Leader&mdash;I hope I am correctly describing him&mdash;of the Party opposite, however, seems to indicate that he has not taken any trouble to ascertain the previous political history of his new colleagues.  If he had merely endeavoured to trace back their activities since they ceased to be a Government he would not have made a statement of that kind.  He would discover that within five weeks of this Government coming into office, before its industrial policy had an opportunity of indicating what results it could produce, a motion was moved by a member of the Party opposite, a member of the executive of that Party, asking the Dáil to accept the principle that is embodied in this Bill, a motion that was carried unanimously by this House.</P>

      <P>Our view, however, is that, apart altogether from the industrial situation which exists here, some provision of this kind should be made; that it is necessary and desirable social legislation.  In some other countries corresponding provisions do operate; in others they do not.  But, in our view, in this country it is necessary to ensure that where the social or economic organisation is incapable of providing an opportunity of earning a living by work for everybody who is able and willing to work, then some provision must be made to assist them to live.  That is the principle embodied in the Bill.  If there were no factories at all, or if there were only an odd factory here and there, or if there were a very substantial number of factories throughout the country, the necessity and the justification for this Bill would remain precisely the same.  We shall discuss on some other day, I hope, some of the wild statements that Deputies opposite committed themselves to in relation to our industrial situation.  I advise them quite early to check up that new Leader of theirs.  There is a lot of things he is saying that I am quite certain Deputies opposite will not be able to stand over.</P>

They may disagree with details of it, and whether Mr. O'Duffy or anyone else calls it a pauper Bill, or whether in fact Deputies opposite think that any scheme for providing for the unemployed must necessarily be condemned on that basis, I want them to tell us exactly how they stand in relation to the measure.  They have been pretending to press for provision of this kind for some time&mdash;not all of them, I admit; the new conglomeration represents so many different viewpoints upon all matters that I cannot possibly attempt to speak of them collectively.</P>

      <P>Quite right there.  If, however, the Party opposite can formulate a policy on anything, I ask them to try to make up their minds to formulate their policy on this, or let us have a frank admission from Deputy Morrissey and his colleagues of the now extinct Cumann na nGaedheal Party that they have deserted their previous policy on this matter as upon other matters.  It is the view of this Party, however, that the existing provision for dealing with unemployment is inadequate.  It is inadequate for several reasons.  First, because I do not think it is possible at the present stage of human development to perfect any type of organisation which will automatically and immediately provide work to the extent needed in the localities where work is required.  There must be, therefore, in addition to schemes for the provision of work, provision for maintaining the unemployed in some other manner, certainly in the best manner which our resources will permit until the organisation that will provide the work can be got going and the necessary schemes prepared. The more work that we provide, the more factories we establish, the greater the degree of industrialisation or agricultural productivity, the less the <Col N="1668" /> need for this Bill will be, and I think that we can hope that at some stage this scheme will finance itself without any provision from State funds; that the contribution available from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, plus the contribution from the local rates, will be sufficient to provide for those persons who are unemployed and who are not covered by the unemployment insurance code.  We are getting to that direction.  The number of persons unemployed in the country to-day is less than it was a year ago; certainly less than it was two years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>His remarks during the last five minutes were the only really relevant remarks on the Bill. What does it matter to this House at this stage of this measure to find out whether you are to use the present unemployment corps of officials or whether you are to have some more recruits of the Minister's own people brought in to administer this scheme? The real thing to be discussed is what stage we have reached in industrial activity and what is the position with regard to employment and unemployment at the moment.  When we ended the Dáil a few months ago we ended on what amounted to pandemonium on the President's statement that we had lost one market as he said for ever, thank heaven.  There is not so much cheering about that now.  But in the two months that have elapsed we do not see any great indications of the alternatives.  We had Deputy Geoghegan going down to his constituents in Longford-Westmeath and saying that they expected him to come there in a white sheet and a nightlight but that instead he had come there triumphant.  He was triumphant, he said, because they had so much in stocks of food in this country this year.  You can imagine the glee there is in America when the people there find they have so many million bushels of wheat for which they can get no market and of which they cannot get rid.  Deputy Geoghegan had a right to be triumphant.  Another Minister told us that the people were not down and out yet because they could get a bit of butter in here and a few eggs in there and some other thing in some other place, and that was to be the substitute for the market that the President had so cheerfully announced had disappeared entirely.  On the occasion on which the President made that announcement here Deputy Norton made an appeal to the Government to get a thinking box.  I do not know whether he himself thinks he is now filling that role&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We will see now in the course of this debate whether there is more sense or substance in me or in Deputy Norton.  We will take that as the test.  We will leave those people on the Government Benches out of competition because we know where they stand.  Deputy Norton did make another appeal to the Ministers.  He said they reminded him of a number of men each in a canoe going round in a circle, nobody having any idea as to where they were going.  Coming in here to-day I saw that they had got a boat for themselves, dug out from the second century, brought up here from the bogs of Westmeath.  That is the boat in which Deputy Norton is now sitting.  There is going to be a heap of baling before that craft is going to venture on the industrial development sea in this country.  Whether the Deputy is the kidnapper or the kidnapped I do not know.  But that remark by Deputy Norton might more aptly be applied to the three last months.  The Deputy said on the 9th August:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The more he listened to the speech of the Minister the more he was reminded of the defence of the small timid boy who whistled in the dark in order that he might still his fears.  It seemed to me that in spite of the buoyancy, largely artificial, which was displayed by the Minister, there were streaks of despair and patches of cold feet in the industrial policy upon which the Minister has mainly relied so far.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will, I hope, hear the Deputy later on, developing that theme.  The Minister previously spoke of casualties and of relieving people who had been put out of work by his efforts.  Let us, adopting the war phraseology, realise that we are down to the iron ration in this matter.  The people are driven back to their last resources.  We have entered, in this country, for the first time since it was set up on its own, on the dole policy.  That is the painful fact, and it is on that the Minister has wasted one and a half hours in explaining that the unemployed are so numerous and that unemployment has gone up so much he is abandoning the first <Col N="1671" /> part of Deputy Morrissey's motion&mdash; work or maintenance for the unemployed. The idea of work has been now given up and we are back on maintenance. I do not suppose that the &ldquo;promises sheet&rdquo; is out of date yet. Does the Minister remember what was promised in a small group of industrial activities in this country?  Does he remember that 86,041 persons were to be put into employment by the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The promise was that 86,041 people were to be put into employment.  We will pursue some of these groups this evening.  On the 9th August this year the Minister told us that with regard to a very big number of industries &ldquo;our job is done.&rdquo;  What percentage of the 86,041 people who were promised work, not the dole, has got work since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office?  The Minister told us, with all the available statistics, that there was great industrial activity, more industrial activity than ever before.  Let us take one that jumps to the eyes in this measure.  In my time unemployment insurance got to be graded in such a way that we found we were paying off annually the old debt.  A sum of £300,000 had at one time accumulated. What did that mean?  That the contribution of income over expenditure was greater by some £300,0000 per annum. We decided when we came to the last £300,000 that rather than pay it off in one year we would reduce the contributions exacted from the employer and the employee so that they would get the benefits of that sum, and that we would fund the debt and pay it off in eight or nine years.  The calculation we made was that by reducing the contributions that would be demanded we would save the employer and the employed in this country £250,000 per annum.  Now what does the Minister do?  He puts back the rates of contribution to the old figure and says he is going to get that sum extra from the employers and employees.  He says <Col N="1672" /> that it could not be got otherwise. Why does he not get it from the 300 factories he tells us about?  There should be more people put into employment in these 300 factories in the last year.</P>

      <P>No, surely not.  The Minister is taking an additional £250,000 from the employers and the employees.  The Minister was challenged here on the 9th August as to industrial activity in the country.  I have here a series of excerpts from the debate on that date which I am going to read to the House.  Here is one:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the confectionery trade we have completed our job.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton took that up later. Completing the job was evidenced by the Minister to his own satisfaction by this, that there used to be imports of confectionery &mdash;there was in the year 1931&mdash;to the value of £550,000, and those imports had almost entirely disappeared. The only conclusion that suggested itself to the Minister's mind was that there was the same demand and consumption at home for the confectionery, and it was being supplied at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;The country's requirements of confectionery of all kinds are now being supplied from Irish factories.&rdquo;  When the Minister was away we got figures from his colleague who was representing him, and we found that there were 151 extra people employed in the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Until March of this year.  We all know how the famous calculation of 86,000 was arrived at. The Census of Production showed that on an average the wealth produced by each worker was £220 per annum.  If you wanted to find out what workers could be employed in this country, according to the Minister all you had to do was to get the imports, divide them by 220 and, like a wave of a magician's wand, the workers were <Col N="1673" /> there.  Let us apply that test in this instance.  The 151 extra workers would produce £33,000 worth of goods, but the imports have gone down by £550,000.  What about the £517,000? We know nothing of that.  The Minister for Agriculture is a man of subtle calculation.  In the case of the land annuities there is a sum of £2,000,000 gone somewhere, and in this instance there is a sum of £517,000 gone somewhere else.</P>

      <P>The Minister as a statistician is a joke.  I suggest it is not the immediate conclusion to be drawn that there are so many people in industrial occupation in the confectionery business when you say there used to be an import of half a million and now there is no import.  I suggest that there is a lack of purchasing power in this country to the extent of £517,000.  Taking the Minister's own figures, we have no reason to believe that the 151 extra people employed in the confectionery trade are producing that half a million that used to come by way of imports.  The Minister said that so far as the confectionery trade is concerned they have completed their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes on: &ldquo;The importations of bread and buns, which were valued at over £200,000 in 1931, have also ceased. All the country's requirements are now being supplied from bakeries in the Saorstát.  We ended that job in the last week or the week before... Deputies are familiar with the Government's proposals in relation to sugar. ... In this month&rdquo;&mdash;he is referring to the month of August&mdash;&ldquo;the job in relation to that product will also be completed....  In the case of glass bottles and jars, we have also completed the job....  In the case of constructional steel, the job is also completed....  The same applies to wire manufactures of all kinds.  Again, I can say our task is done....  In respect of galvanised ware, considerable progress has been made.  Concerning many classes of galvanised products I can again say <Col N="1674" /> that the job is done.  In relation to the others, it will be complete in the very near future.&rdquo; The Minister places the value of such imports in 1931 at over £200,000.</P>
    <P>He told us that in so far as commercial vehicles were concerned the task was completed long ago.  Talking of the many industries for the working of timber, all important and all eminently suitable to the country, he said: &ldquo;In connection with them we have also a story of continuous progress to record.  Last month we shut down finally upon the importation of planed and dressed timbers.&rdquo; In relation to those industries he said that many firms had to build extensions and instal considerable machinery in order to enable them to produce the requirements in their own works.  He told us that they had done that; that job was done.  He went on: &ldquo;In relation to the furniture industry, the job has also been done.&rdquo; These are all quotations from the Minister's speech on 9th August.</P>
    <P>He went on to say: &ldquo;In relation to the industry for the manufacture of cordage, cables, ropes and twine, we took the first protective measures in May of last year.  I remember Deputy Mulcahy asking them was this intended to be a revenue duty I told him that though it might produce some revenue it was not designed for that purpose. I am glad to say that in the very near future it will not produce any revenue at all because the industry has been developed with remarkable speed and a market value at over £120,000 a year was retained for Irish workers... In relation to men's clothing of all kinds, the job is finished.  We can shut down on imports and probably will. I can state with confidence that the existing concerns can more than supply all the country's requirements.  In relation to women's outer garments, the same is not yet true although very considerable progress in that very difficult industry has been made.  In the case of hosiery I said here some time ago that we had in 12 months doubled the production of the home industry and would, in this year, double it again.  I am glad to say that our expectations have been realised, and <Col N="1675" /> I hope that in a very short time we shall be able to say in relation to that branch of the apparel industry that we have also finished our job.  In respect to soap and candles the job is completed....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he got tired.  One might very well get tired after that tale of heroic endeavour and achievement.  He said: &ldquo;I could continue naming industries of this description.  In those to which I have referred we have transferred to Irish factories from foreign factories, within a period of slightly more than 12 months, trade valued annually at over £5,000,000 and we hope to double that figure within the next 12 months.&rdquo; The job was done in relation to imports of £5,000,000 and they hoped to have the job done in relation to another £5,000,000.  What should that represent in the way of workers on the old calculation of £220 per industrial worker per annum?  There should be 23,000 or so more people employed in this country than before.  When the other £5,000,000 job is done we should have 46,000 more people employed.</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's speech on 9th August, yet at that time the cloud was hanging over him.  The Minister for Education, who was acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce, said that we were facing this winter with the knowledge that there would be 60,000 able-bodied unemployed unable to get work and without the benefit of unemployment insurance.  In the debate on the 9th August the Minister for Finance gave the same figure of 60,000 people.  Now we are getting a scheme which, according to the Minister, is likely to cost the country over £1,000,000.  There are many calculations to be made, and I think the £1,000,000 estimate is to be taken with reservation.  Certainly £1,000,000 is not enough if the 60,000 figure is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education definitely gave the figure of 60,000.  Let us now take the Minister's calculation that every 1,000 people cost £30,000.  What will the 60,000 people cost?  Not £1,000,000, but £1,800,000.  Deputy Norton complained rightly that after all the promises of work, it was a poor thing to present nothing better than relief schemes in which men are employed at 24/- a week.  Even that work has now been abandoned; relief work has been abandoned, and it is now a case of unemployment assistance at the rate of 20/- for a man with five children dependent upon him.  I agree that with a falling revenue, with purchasing power being depleted, with old markets not open and new markets impossible to find, even the 24/- a week could not continue to be paid on relief schemes if all the people in need of work or maintenance have got to be served.  And so the Government decides that it is carrying out the promises made in this House in answer to Deputy Morrissey's motion that it should provide either work or maintenance. It should provide either work or maintenance&mdash;considering that it is carrying out its promises in that respect by abandoning work, and when it comes to maintenance by throwing the burden on to other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have £450,000 for what remains of this year for the relief of unemployment by way of this unemployment assistance.  I wonder when does the Minister expect that these certificates will be issued, and when people will begin to draw on the £450,000?  If I take it that the calculation of £1,000,000 is for the full year, then it certainly means that the £450,000 is not good for more than five months of this year&mdash;for something between four and a half and five months.  It will not start until November.  When we do get into a full year how are the subventions to be made?  The person who is in employment at this moment is going to have the deductions made from his wages increased, while the man who is paying him is going to have the exactions imposed upon him for that employed person increased, and the difference is going to be put into <Col N="1677" /> the fund not for the benefit of the people who have paid but for other people who are not in insurable occupation at all.  So that industry in this country, which we are supposed to be fostering, is going to have to bear the burden of some at any rate of the agricultural people who cannot get employment on the land because of the policy the Minister pursues in, what he calls, the national interest.</P>
    <P>The next subscriber to this fund is to be the rates.  In Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Dun Laoghaire £185,000 per annum is to be raised in addition to everything that is being raised from these people at the moment.  Dublin is going to pay £142,000 for this scheme in addition to what it pays at the moment.</P>

      <P>Dublin is going to pay £142,000 extra per annum in addition to everything it pays at the moment, and it is going to collect that sum from the ratepayers of the city. But the folk whom the ratepayers elected to represent them in the City are not going to have the distribution of that sum.  That is another new principle introduced here.  The Dublin City Council and every other elected body who will have the odium thrown upon them of collecting this sum of money will not have the distribution of it.  The distribution will be taken in hand by some other people, possibly some people who presented themselves for election to the City Council of Dublin and failed to get elected.  They will come in now by another door. Then in a full year the State will make up the difference between the £250,000 which is raided from those who are engaged in industrial occupations and the £200,000, roughly, to be taken from the ratepayers.  The State thinks that is an answer to Deputy Morrissey's motion which was primarily work for the people who are out of work, and only secondarily maintenance, and as regards maintenance it was to be maintenance from the Government who would have the odium of collecting this money as well as the political advantage of distributing it.  That is the situation that we have reached in this country.  There used to be an Unemployment Insurance Fund and that fund was solvent.</P>

      <P>The Minister made his appearance in 1932 with all his promises thick upon him.  He has told us that he has carried out some of those promises.  If he had carried out even one-tenth of the promises that he says he has there should be more people in insurable occupation in this country and more money going into the fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And there should be less people drawing from it.  Yet the fund is going steadily into bankruptcy. According to the Minister, when he puts the contributions back to the old rate from which I reduced them, he only argues that he is going to get £250,000 to save industry.  Where is the new industrial situation?  Where are the thousands of workers who were to be employed in the lists of industries that we have been given?  The Minister, with tiresome repetition, on 9th August, said: &ldquo;We have completed the job.&rdquo;  There was provision made at one time for relief work which could not be given at the ordinary trade union rates.  That used to be objected to.  The rates were brought down against fierce clamour to 24/-, and even <Col N="1680" /> to 22/- and to 21/-, and they are being abandoned also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Who told you that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have some idea now of the calculation that must be running through the mind of the Minister at this moment in relation to this £1,000,000 for a full year.  At one time the Minister used to say that such a sum as that was not anything like the provision that ought to be made. But he now tells us, in a phrase that he used to deride, it is as much as we can afford.  A colleague of the Minister's, the Minister for Finance, spoke in November, 1931, in reference to the sum of £250,000 that had been voted for the relief of unemployment.  His calculation, and as finance expert he ought to know, was that that was equivalent to two weeks' employment for the poor of the country about Christmas time.  £250,000, according to the Minister for Agriculture, meant two weeks' work.  On the calculation that Deputy Briscoe made you would want £1,000,000 or more.  The President of the Executive Council has a different view because, speaking of the same Vote, he said that we were giving an annual dole of a quarter of a million pounds, a sum that would not provide three weeks' work for the unemployed. It would not give three weeks' work, according to the President, and would only give two weeks' work, according to the Minister for Agriculture.  We now get £1,000,000 and eight weeks' work, or perhaps 12 weeks, according to the calculation of the President. But it is necessary in the situation that has occurred.  I hold that the time will come when this Bill will prove to be a definite recognition from the Government that they cannot make progress in industrial development while there is an economic war going on.  Deputy Norton may say that a tariff policy cannot lead anywhere and that it is not in itself sufficient under the conditions in which we are living here.  There is almost a declaration here that provisions for getting work in the country are to be abandoned and that relief works will also have to go.  The ranks of the unemployed <Col N="1681" /> will be very greatly swollen if it is believed that the citizens would have to pay the amount now doled out by way of relief against destitution.</P>
      <P>There is a calculation which the President is fond of making, and which we might go into at this stage.  He has pointed out that the taxable capacity of this country, in relation to Great Britain, is as one is to 66.  We get that trotted out time and again if there is a discussion about the land annuities. He is in the habit of pointing out that the payment which used to go to Britain would be equivalent, at the rate of 66 to one, to the payment that Britain makes to America.  I turn that round another way, and there I get new items of calculation.  Supposing a British party went before the British electorate promising them a reduction of £132,000,000 per annum in taxation. That is the equivalent of our £2,000,000 multiplied by 66.  Suppose, on securing office, instead of reducing taxation by that £132,000,000, they increased it by £412,000,000, which is the equivalent of the £6,250,000 extra bill put upon the people of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have, but I do not pay much attention to it.  The equivalent figures, as I say, for Britain would be £412,000,000 extra taxation as against the earlier promise of £132,000,000 reduction.  And having done that suppose they went into Parliament and said: &ldquo;We propose this year to raise for unemployment assistance £66,000,000 or something over that,&rdquo; would that party have failed to carry out its promises?  That is what we are presented here with from Fianna Fáil at the moment.  This is the biggest confession they could <Col N="1682" /> make of the failure of their industrial plans.  Not only have we this confession from the Minister, of the failure of their industrial plans, but, also, of the failure of their relief works. He finds himself to-night driven to state here to the House, in support of the policy of his Party, that there were a number of people unemployed who were in need of assistance of any type in this country.  We have the statement made of the very big number that appears at a first glance to be lacking assistance.  And he deducted from that people in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit&mdash;a very proper deduction.  He went on to say there must be a number of smallholders, people having small bits of land, who were outside this Bill, or rather outside it if their means mount up to a certain point.  They were not returned as in work when the industrial section of the census of production was published.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain number of them said they were not working&mdash;up to 40,000.  The Minister said that under this Bill he is taking out people with pensions, but he would not have had that power before.  He is right to take these people out and he will get quite a number of people who want to work and are unable to get work and these are the people who ought to be helped. It was Deputy Norton I think who said, on the 9th August, that if it was announced that there was to be a relief scheme for all unemployed the figure would rise from 60,000 to 100,000 overnight.  I do not think that Deputy Norton should be blamed for this Bill as he is blamed in the country.  We are moving towards getting out of every decent attempt that was made to <Col N="1683" /> provide work and we are depending almost entirely upon this.  It is always a calculation which might be made that so overwhelming is the number of unemployed that it is easier and cheaper to give away a certain amount of money per week than to try and get work done for it.  If in nothing else you would get out of the cost of material.  Deputy Norton thinks that a Bill like this is not a substitution for work.  I am afraid he will find it is made a substitution for everything, and that necessarily so.  You cannot have a country with its markets destroyed and its purchasing power depleted and taxed in the way this country is without having a great number of unemployed. That is the lesson that is being learned, and that clearly stands out from this measure.  Deputy Morrissey and other people have to welcome this Bill, because it contains the second part of the recommendation made in Deputy Morrissey's motion, when it was before the House; but it only contains the second part and the least wholesome part.  People have pleaded here that if it was ever possible it would be better to be really more extravagant if you could actually put people to work even at greater cost to the taxpayers.  I take it we need not talk any longer about it.</P>

      <P>Circumstances are forcing us to it.  Circumstances are cutting down a whole lot of people in this country.  Circumstances have developed unemployment in the country. That is why this second and worst half of Deputy Morrissey's recommendation to the House has got to be <Col N="1684" /> accepted in principle.  When you have people beaten out of their work by a fatuous policy, ignorantly pursued, innocent people should not suffer.  While accepting the principle we can say at this early stage that we do not accept the idea that any portion of this money should come through the ratepayer. If the ratepayer is going to have to subscribe to this, the ratepayer or the ratepayer's representatives should have the right to say how the money is going to be distributed.  As for the other Bill, I presume it cannot be referred to at this moment.  It is also a confession of weakness that you have got to charge the people whom you are pretending to favour with the upkeep of their less fortunate brethren.  The principle of the Unemployment Insurance Bill is objectionable.  There should not be any raiding of that fund. It should be raised&mdash;if it has to be raised at all&mdash;just to the point that will make the fund solvent, so that it can meet its day-to-day outgoings, and pay off the debt it has accumulated. Whatever else there is should be met by the Government.  The Government should have the odium of raising the money if they are going to have the advantage of spending it.  If we go back for a year or two it is possibly not of so much disadvantage.  Industry would suffer at any rate.  The Minister should remember that his attitude at that time was that greater benefits should be given to the people who are paying into this fund.  He deprived himself of the chance of fulfilling his own promise.  He cannot give greater benefits.  He is going to increase the contribution, and there is to be this sum of £250,000 to be raised.  It is no pleasure to accept either of those Bills, but in the circumstances there is nothing else for it.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, if one did not know Deputy McGilligan when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce one would be inclined to be deceived by the debating points and the welter of dialectics to which he has treated the House this evening.  Some of us who know Deputy McGilligan longer than some of his new found friends, can remember that he was almost an industrial tank in this country during his period as Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;levelling one industry after the other; and coming back fresh from the victory of having closed a distillery here, a brewery there or some other industry which had survived many generations. If we did not know that Deputy McGilligan was engaged in that campaign; if we did not know he was cheered on at the time by the disciple of low wages, the colleague who sits on his left, we would be inclined to believe that some of the speeches delivered from those benches were really intended to be a definite profession of sympathy for the poor and needy in this country; but we all know Deputy McGilligan's attitude and his record as Minister for Industry and Commerce. We all know perfectly well that Deputy McGilligan's speeches in this House, so far as they express an opinion on a matter of this kind, are not inspired by a desire on his part to make a better and more effective provision for the poor and lowly.  We know that Deputy McGilligan is concerned with doing one thing&mdash;establishing himself in this House, even at the expense of the reputation of some of his colleagues. Being a first class orator and the leader of the new United Ireland Party debating society, Deputy McGilligan tells us that the situation now is a very serious situation indeed.  The country is facing <Col N="1686" /> inevitable ruin, and he wants to tell us about the Elysian and prosperous days which existed during the period when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He has got a Deputy in his Party now, Deputy Morrissey, who said on the 30th October, 1924&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will come to a later period if the Deputy wishes.  Deputy Morrissey was then concerned with the relief of unemployment.  Seconding a motion in this House at that time he referred to the existing unemployment problem, and to the very bad position which existed in agriculture. He said: &ldquo;The result is that the farmers are not in a position to pay men to work.  Consequently, there is a disappointed hope which is leading to despair on the part of the workers. They have been expecting day after day, especially for the last three years since they got their own Government, that something would be done to try to give them a chance of earning a livelihood in their own country.  Those hopes have been disappointed, and they have been led to a certain amount of despair.&rdquo;  This was in the good old prosperous days of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  This was in the days when there was no economic war.  This was in the days when the milk and honey turned on by Deputy McGilligan was flowing around the country, threatening to drown anybody who endeavoured to impede its passage.  Deputy Morrissey went on to say: &ldquo;We who are daily in touch with the want, the misery and the wretchedness that is in the country know the conditions that prevail. Apparently very few Deputies here have any real knowledge or regard of these conditions.&rdquo;  Subsequently, Deputy McGilligan challenged that latter statement by Deputy Morrissey, only to find Deputy Morrissey not one iota repentant for what he had said.  There was another Deputy in this House who, before he was swallowed by the Cumann na nGaedheal octopus, was leader of the then Farmers' Party.  Deputy MacDermot may be interested in that <Col N="1687" /> gentleman's views of the position of affairs in those so-called prosperous days&mdash;October, 1924.  Deputy Baxter, speaking in this House on the 30th October, 1924, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have misery, we have want, and we are fearing the winter in many of the poorer rural districts. I might suggest Connemara, Donegal or parts of Cork and Kerry and parts of my own county where I know people are looking on the coming winter with feelings of as deep despair as any of the workers in the city.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was 1924.  We got agreement then of both Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Baxter.  When it was politically right then, they were agreed on this: that there was poverty, want, misery and distress in the country in 1924.  That was at a period when Deputy Morrissey was pleading on behalf of his Party to the then Cumann na nGaedheal Party, of which Deputy McGilligan was a member, to do something for the relief of unemployment. If the position at that time was as bad as Deputy MacDermot's predecessor said it was, or if it was as bad then as Deputy Morrissey said it was, surely there was some obligation on the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy McGilligan, to make some effort at any rate to try to relieve the want, the misery, the destitution and the poverty which, according to Deputies Baxter and Morrissey, existed?  Deputy McGilligan was pleaded with and asked to face up to his responsibility in that regard.  He wants other people to do it now.  He wants it done generously now, but he had ten years to do it himself in a very generous way.  So far as I am concerned, I would support him in doing it in a generous way, but Deputy McGilligan had ten years in which to do it.  He, at all events, cannot complain that he had never an opportunity of introducing a better scheme because he had ten years to do it and he failed utterly to do it. What was the Deputy's mentality on the matter?  Again, on the 30th October, 1924, he delivered himself in this <Col N="1688" /> House of a speech which I think ought to disgrace any Christian public representative. Replying then to Deputy Johnson, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To-day Deputy Johnson says &lsquo;feed the people this year even though they may go hungry next year.&rsquo; I suggest that that is not what could be called statesmanship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He did not want them to choke altogether.  He did not want them to die from overfeeding.  He wanted the thing done by slow stages, spread out as long as possible.  He goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You have to look over a period of years and you cannot take measures this year which may lead to more people going hungry next year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was asked by Deputy Johnson:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But if they die this year?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McGilligan, replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are certain limited funds at our disposal.  People may have to die in this country and may have to die through starvation.&rdquo;</P>

There was no question then of anything extravagant or any generous expenditure such as the Deputy suggests might be tried under this Bill. Deputy McGilligan has changed a good deal since then.  His seat for instance has changed.  It has produced a bigger change in the Deputy than almost anything else that happened in his lifetime. I read recently of where there was a certain shortage of water in this city and all over the country.  I would imagine that if the borough engineer in this city had come into this House and had taken Deputy McGilligan and his seat out and got him to talk about the needs of the poor and the other matters to which he referred to-day, there would have been a rainfall in this country such as would keep it safe from drought for the rest of his lifetime.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill, and I make no apologies for it.  I am prepared to defend the principle of this Bill in any constituency in this country.  I shall make no apology whatever for the sound principle which I believe is to be operated under this Bill.  Everybody knows that we have been passing through a serious unemployment crisis, where the existing Unemployment Insurance Acts, because of their inadequacy, because of the fact that agricultural workers were excluded from the provisions of the Acts, were such as to make it impossible for these Acts to provide for the serious unemployment crisis with which the country is confronted.  It is not an unemployment crisis of recent growth.  The unemployment crisis <Col N="1691" /> which we are experiencing here is a crisis which has existed for many years. The census taken during the period of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government showed clearly&mdash;I am quoting from the official figures&mdash;that there were then 78,000 unemployed people in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And I will prove it&mdash; that there were 78,000 unemployed persons at that period.  The Deputy wants to get into a battle of dialectics about &ldquo;gainfully employed&rdquo; and all that kind of thing, but the Deputy can walk around that trap himself as often as he likes.  It is because the Unemployment Insurance Act has utterly collapsed in face of the unemployment crisis we are experiencing, and because of the fact that local rates are utterly inadequate to maintain those deprived of benefit under the existing Unemployment Insurance Act either because they are outside the scope of the Act or because they have <Col N="1692" /> exhausted their claim to benefit that it is absolutely imperative for the State to step in and endeavour to relieve these destitute persons from the misery and poverty and suffering which they are enduring.  I personally would welcome a much more generous provision for them, but at this stage I want to discuss the principle of the Bill.  The Bill is an admission of the claim which has for a long time been made by the Labour Party that it is not the duty of the local authority to relieve a national unemployment crisis.  The responsibility in that regard is a central responsibility and ought to be discharged by the central Government.  This Bill is a definite attempt to relieve local authorities of the burden of relieving able-bodied unemployed and to the extent to which it takes the able-bodied unemployed off the local rates and to the extent to which it makes provision for certain benefits for the able-bodied unemployed, I think every Deputy in this House will be in agreement with the principle of that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the unemployment crisis attained its present severity local authorities have been endeavouring to relieve destitution and hunger by a scheme of home assistance.  That scheme of home assistance was altogether inadequate and, in many cases, the circumstances surrounding the administration of home assistance or outdoor relief were degrading and were reducing decent unemployed men and women to the level of mere paupers&mdash;persons who were prepared to spend all day with some relieving officer hoping that they might eventually soften his heart and induce him to part with some miserable sum in the form of some kind of partial insurance against what seemed to be inevitable economic death.  That was the position in which the able-bodied unemployed were placed, due to the severity of the unemployment crisis and to the fact that no State provision whatever had been made for the relief of unemployment.  This Bill changes that position completely.  This Bill will take on to the central State funds those able-bodied unemployed who have been relieved in the past from <Col N="1693" /> the rates and, in future, it will be possible for them to receive unemployment benefit not in the degrading pauperised way in which they have received that benefit in the past but at the employment exchanges throughout the country and free, as I said before, from the degrading circumstances surrounding the administration of home assistance in many counties, and free also from the insulting remarks and gibes which are often hurled at them by those who are paid to administer to their physical needs.</P>
    <P>That position will now change and these people in the future, instead of begging at the heels of some home assistance officer, instead of trying to induce a stony-hearted board of health to part with a few miserable shillings, will be able to go into the local employment exchange and with their heads up claim a State pension, State stipend or gratuity so long as they are unemployed, anxious to work and unable to obtain work.  They can go in and do that, as I say, without in any way demeaning their manhood or their womanhood or without in any way being subject to the jeers and gibes of people from whom one would expect much better when dealing with people in that unfortunate position. That whole situation will change, and it is a very desirable change.  It is a change that Deputy McGilligan agrees to because he knows that he dare not oppose it, but it is a change which Deputy McGilligan, over ten years, never once thought of making.  It is a change in respect of which Deputy McGilligan, although the circumstances during his period of office demanded it, never once made any attempt whatever to introduce a piece of useful machinery or legislation. That, in my opinion, is a very desirable development under this Bill.  It makes unemployment and the maintenance of able-bodied unemployed a charge on the central Government instead of a charge on the local ratepayers who are unable, because of the incidence of unemployment, to bear, as the State could bear, the heavy charges which long continued and widespread unemployment inevitably inflict upon them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1694" /> I say, therefore, that the principle of this measure is good.  The principle of this measure will have the support of everybody who wants to see better provision made for the relief of able-bodied unemployed.  It will have the support of everybody who wants to see, at the earliest possible opportunity, a complete scrapping of all that pauperism that is associated with the poor law institutions and with the administration of poor relief in this country.  I should much prefer this Bill to be part and parcel of a genuine attempt to reorganise industry.  I should prefer this Bill to be part and parcel of a scheme for stimulating industrial development and stimulating agricultural development in a much more effective way than, in my view, it has been done in the past, whether under Cumann na nGaedheal or in the recent past under Fianna Fáil.  I should prefer this to be part of a definite emergency attempt, rendered more urgent because of the British challenge but necessary in any case, to grapple with our industrial, our agricultural and our economic problems in a much more comprehensive way.  I should prefer the main stimulus to be the provision of work and, as I said before in this House, and I have no reason to change my view on the matter, even though Deputy McGilligan thinks that I would do so, I do not believe that tariffs of themselves will give this country a passport to prosperity or to success.  They have not done it in any other country in the world and, in my view, it is expecting the impossible if you think that tariffs are going to bring about that result here.  If you will, tariffs are an aid to industrial and agricultural development, of themselves tariffs will not bring to this country the prosperity which they failed to bring to every country which has resorted to them as the sole means of industrial and agricultural expansion.</P>
    <P>On the Adjournment Debate I stated, and I repeat, that there is not merely the need but the unrivalled opportunity here for tackling our industrial and agricultural problems in a vigorous way.  I know, of course, <Col N="1695" /> that many methods that could be suggested will be labelled as revolutionary and will be described as sheer Bolshevism. It will be said that these are a departure from the good old beaten track of industrial development, that track that is adorned with workhouses, with jails, and with men and women, struggling to make ends meet, who have been denied a decent standard of life.  That is the beaten track we have been taking.  It is the beaten track we ought to get away from, if we ever want to aspire to industrial and agricultural development which will give our people a decent standard of life.  I do not believe, and Deputy McGilligan's speech to-day was proof, that merely producing here our commodity needs will absorb our industrial workers.  There is the easy remedy for employers who want to do things in a big way, and to cheapen cost, and that is to instal more efficient machinery.  Often the complete manufacture here of commodities which we need for ourselves might conceivably give less employment than by producing part of our needs here and exporting the other part.  I think if the Minister will look up the statistics regarding brush-making and furniture-making he will find, in respect of these two industries, that the mere manufacturing here of all our needs, under these two headings, will not absorb more workers, and that, in fact, it has led to a diminution in the number of employees engaged in these two industries.</P>
    <P>Whatever hopes one had of endeavouring to persuade this Government to march along the road of grappling with our industrial, economic and agricultural problems in a big and in a vigorous way, the prospect of persuading the Cumann na nGaedheal Government to do so was very poor indeed. Deputy MacDermot may provide some new blood, may be the spell-binder of the new Party, and may induce it to walk in future a road that it consistently refused to take in the past.  I hope he will aspire to and perhaps fill the role of spell-binder in relation to the Party, but having regard to the way the Cumann na nGaedheal constitution <Col N="1696" /> digested three leaders of the farmers, I have considerable doubt whether Deputy MacDermot will be able to guide the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in the future&mdash;and that is the real name of the Party notwithstanding what is suggested in the title&mdash;on a different industrial bent to the one they had in the past.  I hope the Government will not be satisfied in making this provision for the relief of the unemployed.  I hope, in conjunction with this, and indeed as an inevitable corollary, that the Government will endeavour in respect to industrial activity to make provision for the absorption not merely of a greater number of people in industry, but for the elimination of the child labour which unfortunately has been allowed to drift into industry, especially during the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that considerable progress can be made in that respect.  It seems to me to be nothing short of industrial and economic lunacy that we should be asking some sections of workers to work 48 and more hours a week while there is a considerable number of workers able and willing to work portion of that 48 hours per week, but denied an opportunity of doing so. Would it not be the more sensible thing, if we have thousands of workers unemployed, to put them into industry by reducing the working week, so as to ensure the absorption of a greater number of persons into productive employment?  Of course, I will be told that that would impose a heavy charge on industry.  I am then tempted to ask whether man was born for industry or industry born for man.  Surely it is more important to provide for the human needs of the man than to get the 1932 conception of the valuation of capitalistic methods of production.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not stop at this Bill, and that we will have from the Government some definite effort, not merely to sustain these people in idleness, but to put them into productive employment by reorganising industry and ensuring that those able to work will be provided with employment at the price of reducing the present hours of labour.</P>

      <P>I am tempted in that respect to believe that many of the evils from which modern man suffers to-day are due to the outlook of people like Deputy Dillon, having beguiled him from the simple path where he worked and got what he produced to the position where he now works,but does not get a fraction of what he produces.  Primitive man only worked when there was a scarcity, and only then did he work long hours.  You have modern man in this country in many industries working long hours as if there was no one else available to help.  You have the State standing for an industrial system that asks people to work 48,56 and 60 hours per week, while thousands of unemployed people are available to assist in producing the commodities that are required.  I hope it will not be long until we see the Government tackling that problem on somewhat similar lines to that upon which the problem has been tackled in America.  In that mad house of capitalism, and of the capitalistic system of society, the American Government has found it absolutely necessary to cut down the hours in industry in order to ensure employment for those who are idle.  In order that there should be no diminution in the demand for goods that Government has insisted, not merely that those employed will be guaranteed a continuation of the previous rates of wages, but that in many industries these rates of wages must be raised in order to ensure not merely a continuance of demand, but that there may be a greater demand in industry for what those newly imported into industry produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government would tackle the problem of industrial development on these lines, I believe that, in many respects, the benefits produced would <Col N="1698" /> be even much greater than those provided under this Bill.  If the Government would tackle the problem along these lines I think it would be possible to pay to the unemployed person with whom this Bill deals, a much bigger rate of benefit than is to be paid.  Bad and all as these rates are, low as they are, in many respects they are often higher than the home assistance provided in many counties.  If Deputy Minch were in the House I would ask him to name the number of single men in Kildare to-day who are getting 6/- weekly to sustain them.  Every one knows that it is almost impossible for the single man to get any relief whatever. Every one knows that the attitude of the boards of health and the attitude of the relieving officers, with honourable exceptions, is to screw down to the lowest possible level the amount of home assistance which is being paid.  Every one knows that the rates paid in home assistance throughout the country are much lower than the rates to be paid under this Bill. With the exception of Dublin, the rates of benefit under this Bill are probably higher than the rates of assistance in any area in the country. That is not necessarily an endorsement of these rates of benefit.  In my opinion, they are altogether inadequate, and I hope it will not be long until the Minister exercises the powers conferred on him and increases the rates of benefit to persons with whom this Bill deals.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that there are one or two anomalies in the Bill, and I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to those so that they may be considered before the Committee Stage is reached.  Under the Bill, neither a spinster nor a widow without dependents will receive any benefit whatever.  I do not understand why it is proposed to give benefit to a single man without dependents and to deny it to a single woman or a widow without dependents.  If there is a case for including the single man without dependents&mdash;and clearly there is&mdash;there is a case for bringing in the spinster or widow without dependents. That appears to me to be an inexcusable omission.  It may be that an <Col N="1699" /> effort is being made to keep out a certain kind of person who, if admitted as a class, would impose on the State a burden which it might not be conveniently able to shoulder to-day.  While that may be the position generally, there is a class of worker who ought to be brought within the provisions of this Bill.  I refer to the unemployed industrial worker.  Take the case of a spinster or widow who works in a factory or in a laundry or who is in any kind of employment that brings her within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  If unemployed, that person is entitled to draw benefit at the Exchange for a maximum of 26 weeks in any one year.  At the end of those 26 weeks, it is, presumably, intended that she will get no benefit under this Bill, that she will be compelled to go to the local home assistance officer and exist on whatever that person or the board of health may give her.  That is entirely unsatisfactory. Under the other Bill to be introduced, dealing with the rates of unemployment insurance contributions, that industrial woman-worker is going to have her contributions increased. Portion of that contribution is to be utilised to finance the fund created under this Bill.  You are taking from this woman an increased weekly contribution and putting it into your unemployment insurance fund.  You are taking it out of that fund under this Bill and giving it to a class of person who formerly was not in insurance and you are doing that at the expense of this industrial woman-worker. It seems to me to be unreasonable that a woman in industry should be asked to pay more so that her contribution can be handed over to provide benefit for an unemployed single man who is not in industry.  In my opinion, that woman has as much claim to come within the scope of this Bill as has that single man or anybody else dealt with by this section. I hope that between now and the Committee Stage the Minister will arrange to make provision for the spinster or widow without dependents. It would be a grave hardship, and it <Col N="1700" /> would be a serious blot on this Bill, if that class of person were omitted.</P>
    <P>I find difficulty in understanding another portion of the Bill.  It is provided that a man with a dependent wife and five other dependents will get 20/- benefit a week.  For instance, John Murphy, with a wife and five children, will, if eligible, receive 20/- per week.  But if John Murphy's wife is the claimant and if she maintains her husband and five children, she will get only 18/-.  I find it difficult to comprehend how in one line of the Bill John Murphy, with his wife and five children, is entitled to 20/, whereas in another line John Murphy's wife, John Murphy and five children are entitled to only 18/-.  If the rate is based on their needs, there is no case for cutting down the allowance by 2/- merely because the name of John Murphy's wife is put first.  If the rate is based on their physical needs&mdash;it can hardly be based on anything higher&mdash;there seems to be no case for discriminating against the family merely because the wife makes the claim on account of her husband being dependent on her.  That is an inconsistency in the Bill and the Minister should look into it between this and the Committee Stage.  It may be that not many persons will be affected by it and, in ordinary circumstances, it might, perhaps, be dealt with otherwise, but it is important that the Minister should look into the matter and provide the same scale of benefits while the family circumstances are precisely the same.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these blemishes and other odd blemishes in the machinery of the measure&mdash;the main blemish is that the Bill does not go far enough&mdash;I think that, especially under existing circumstances, the Bill will commend itself to everybody who wants to see the State assume responsibility for relief of unemployment. That vital principle has, I think, been established in this Bill.  I believe it will do much to impart to the unemployed an element of independence and dignity which was undermined by the previous method of ministering to their physical wants.  To that extent I welcome this Bill.  While the financial <Col N="1701" /> provisions are not, in my opinion, adequate to the needs of the people, nevertheless, I think the Bill will be welcomed and by nobody more than the unemployed.  It will do something to help them and to relieve their needs.  I venture to express the opinion that, with all its shortcomings, they will see more benefit in this Bill because it means something to them than they will see in the advice&mdash;the spurious advice&mdash;given to them by their inevitable opponents at election times.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan made certain observations in connection with this Bill which were not only inaccurate but were definitely intended to mislead not only Deputies but people outside.  He said, and repeated, that the 1/6 to be levied on the Borough of Dublin was to be in addition to the amount already paid for the relief of distress.  I told him that that was not correct but he repeated it.  That was done for one reason&mdash;because the Deputy and the rest of his Party were schooled as to what their attitude on this Bill should be before they came in. They had decided on a different line of action in another place, where a motion, sponsored by a member of that Party, is down, disapproving of the action of the Government in going on with this Bill.  The Deputy found that he had to support the principle of the Bill here and he had to have some way out.  So far as his Party is concerned, they can have one attitude here and a hostile, or opposing, attitude outside. It is quite clear&mdash;probably more clear to Deputy McGilligan than to anybody else on that side of the House&mdash;that where able-bodied men get relief under this measure they cannot, at the same time, get relief from the city or from any other authority.</P>

      <P>The Deputy went a long way from the Bill.  I do not think he spoke of the Bill at all, because he did not understand anything about it. <Col N="1703" /> If a man is getting relief from the Dublin relief authorities when he gets relief under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, he will no longer be on the rates of Dublin City and the contribution of the ratepayers will be reduced accordingly.  I cannot give the exact figures.  Deputies opposite for a long time in this House and outside have been warning the people of Dublin that the policy of the Government was bringing about such a situation of increased unemployment that the rates were going to go up, not only by 2/6 or 3/-, but by as high as 5/- in the pound for the relief of distress because of people thrown out of work. That was their cry then.  Now their cry is that the City of Dublin is going to be asked to pay 1/6 in the pound, instead of the 5/- that they spoke of, for the Government to take this over as a State responsibility.  The ratepayers of Dublin now know that, as far as this particular item is concerned, the contribution is going to be 1/6 in the pound, not 5/-, as Deputies opposite said it was going to be. The objection that Deputies opposite have to this Bill is that for the first time what can be described in no other words but as a measure of absolute decency has been introduced into the House&mdash;maintenance for those for whom employment cannot be found. The policy of Deputies opposite, as Deputy Norton pointed out, was poor relief on a small scale, if at all, unemployment relief money in negligible amounts, emigration as fast as it could go on, and starvation for the remainder of those at home.  People did die of starvation in this country during the Cumann na nGaedheal regime.  I say that with all the emphasis I can as a member of the House.  The matter was raised in this House.  If Deputies go to any institution in Dublin or any other part of the country, whether it is a union or a hospital or any class of home where the working classes, particularly those who are destitute, have to go when ill, they will find out the percentage of deaths from illness due to under nourishment, and they will be surprised.  At the same time, if they look up the statistics for last year, <Col N="1704" /> for instance, of the deaths of children under a certain age, they will find an improvement in the figures&mdash;that a greater number lived.  The Deputy opens his mouth and says nothing.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey should be the last man to speak in this House.  This Government when it came into office realised that the destitution of the people over such a long period left them under-nourished and, to the horror and indignation of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, as a start off they gave free milk to the children of the destitute poor&mdash;the one thing that made the difference between life and death to these children.  That was a horrible thing according to Cumann na nGaedheal.  Charges of Bolshevism and Sovietism were hurled at us because the Government provided free milk for the children of the destitute poor.  Now there is a grievance because the Government is definitely taking upon themselves to do what they promised to do at the last two elections when they declared that it was the duty of the State to maintain those who were willing and able to work, but for whom work could not be found, as best it could in accordance with its resources until work was made available for them.  That is what the Bill does.  Deputy McGilligan talked about factories and industries and everything else except about the Bill.  One thing he did say was misleading and incorrect.  He definitely said that this 1/6 in the £ is going to be in addition to the amount already paid by Dublin City.  I told him it was not and I say again that it is not.</P>

He got up to curse and, like Balaam with the ass, he blessed.  Every word he uttered in order to try to <Col N="1705" /> sabotage that industry has reacted in its favour.  I am now able to tell him, much to his regret I am sure, that it is doing very well and improving every day.  One brilliant idea I got from him was a nice trade name for the products of that concern.  Everything that he tries to curse is blessed.  As far as I am concerned, when he says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; I always interpret it as being &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</P>

Deputy Mulcahy talked about figures and talked about the number of persons who are going to get unemployment assistance and who are not in insurable occupations. He tried to jumble up a lot of figures. The Deputy knows that it was under his administration that persons who were subscribers to the Unemployment Benefit Fund, persons such as railway workers, became members of non-insurable occupations.  The same thing applies to the tramway workers and workers in other occupations.  It was under his administration that these men became unemployed in great numbers and they got no unemployment money or relief because they were in non-insurable occupations. This measure says that any person who has any benefit to his credit or any person who is in an insurable occupation is entitled to benefit if willing to work and unable to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were certain points raised by Deputy Norton.  I hope the Minister will deal with them.

That is a matter that I think should be looked into for if the argument that is put up is correct, if single girls are to contribute to this fund it is only fair that they <Col N="1708" /> should be given relief.  I do not know what the Minister's explanation will be on that point but I am in full agreement with the arguments put forward by Deputy Norton.  As to the amount paid to the married woman with a dependent husband and five children compared with the amount paid to the married man with five dependent children and a wife I do not understand the discrepancy. Possibly the Minister may be able to give some explanation.  As Deputy Corry says, any man should be entitled to have 2/- less if he allows his wife to wear the trousers.  That is something on which we would like to get information.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill from many points of view.  First of all it contains what I advocated when this Government introduced a large sum of money for unemployment relief.  I advocated that there should be some connection between the relieving officers and the registration officers.  I argued that the relieving officers were the best authority as to the necessity of the individual.  He visits him when he is giving relief.  That person should be considered when persons are applying for work on unemployment schemes.  This Bill deals with the matter in a far better way than it would be dealt with under the method I advocated because it now takes the whole under one roof.  As to what the Bill will cost in its administration I cannot say and I suppose the Minister cannot tell.  But the Bill is bringing them together under one roof.  In that way we will not have two bodies dealing with the same matter.</P>
    <P>When the unemployment relief was being debated in this House I advocated that there should be some means of joining up the work of the two bodies.  I welcome this Bill because it adopted better than I was able to express it the idea I had at the time. The administration of relief under this Bill is going to be far better for the country as a whole.  It is going to be far better and more humane for the individual and it is going to save councillors a whole lot of bother and trouble in dealing with cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1709" /> I can understand the attitude of Deputy Mulcahy and his Party about this Bill.  They recently captured the administration of relief in Dublin to the exclusion of the Fianna Fáil councillors because they believed it was a good thing to secure votes through the administration of relief.</P>

      <P>Any body of men who took into their own hands the relief on behalf of the citizens in the way the Deputy's Party took it, to the exclusion of others on the council, may find that that may be good politics but it certainly is not very honourable.  As Deputy Donnelly, who is an old political war-horse, says, it may be good politics, but in this case it has turned out to be bad politics because persons belonging to all Parties may be in distress.  In the administration of relief the matter should be upon an even keel and no preference given to anybody because of politics.  The people opposite give preference to their own supporters against all others.  That was good politics but it was most dishonourable, and it turned out in the end to be bad politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is giving fair treatment even to Deputy Dillon's followers.  I do not know what they are now.  They were farmers some time ago.  It is really a mystery Party over there.  Some time I will remain awake all night wondering about the Party to which the Deputy belongs. This Government has set a good example in so far as State resources are concerned.  Every person will be entitled to his share.  No longer will <Col N="1710" /> we have examples of the giving of coal to poor people in the winter time because they happen to support a particular Party during elections.  In the past the other fellow could freeze or go hungry.  We have now reached the point when there is going to be a fair deal for all.  The people of this country did well when they chose Fianna Fáil a second time.  I do not know how many times they will continue to select them, but I do know that Deputy Dillon will have a very long wait before he dons the mantle of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <P>The last time Deputy Norton spoke in this House he said he had come to the conclusion that Fianna Fáil mentality was as daft as a halfpenny watch.  When I was worming my way through Deputy Briscoe's oration to-day, I began to feel myself in agreement with Deputy Norton.  It is extremely difficult to grapple with the mentality of a Party which views things from the standpoint of Deputy Briscoe.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when speaking on this Bill to-day, said this was the Fianna Fáil redemption of the undertaking given when they accepted the principle of Deputy Morrissey's motion calling for work or maintenance for the unemployed. It is well to remember that we began by undertaking to provide work for 86,041 people.  We have had the blessing of a Fianna Fáil Government in this country for 18 months and they have not found work for these people.  A Bill is now brought in to provide maintenance.  I venture to prophesy that if we have the blessing of a Fianna Fáil Government for another 18 months there will be no maintenance, because every man and woman in this country will be on the dole.</P>

      <P>We will want somebody who will be equal to the situation of <Col N="1711" /> rescuing this country from the catastrophic conditions Fianna Fáil has brought upon it.  To my mind it would be fortunate that we should have another 18 months or two years of Fianna Fáil Government, because there are some young gentlemen marching about this country, and Deputy Brady is one of them, and they are so charmingly naive that nothing but hunger will bring home to them the folly of a Fianna Fáil administration.  They are quite content now to sit at the feet of the Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Ryan, while he is endeavouring to sell a few little fowl in one place, a piece of butter in another place, and a couple of eggs somewhere else, and they proclaim him to be the greatest Minister for Agriculture that ever was.</P>

      <P>It would require something drastic to teach people like Deputy Brady where this country is going.  So far as they are concerned, they do not bother to find out; they simply wander along, trusting to God that something will turn up to-morrow or the next day.  When you fall down in relation to the provision of employment you produce a Bill for the provision of maintenance.  You trust to God that something will turn up also in that respect.  I agree that the introduction of this Bill is very necessary. When men are hungry, they must be fed.  When starvation stalks the country, you must do something to arrest its course.  I quite agree that starvation and destitution threaten a very large number of our people and I am glad the Minister realises that and realises that the most drastic and the strongest possible action must be taken to avert the calamity that threatens the country. I am glad the Government realise that even the last penny must be paid rather than have any of our people <Col N="1712" /> die of starvation as a result of Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
      <P>What is the cause of all this?  Surely it is far more sensible, when we are face to face with a crisis of this kind, to look for the cause and try to correct the cause rather than endeavour to cure the symptoms.  Providing doles will do nothing to cure the situation which makes the doles necessary.  I agree it is necessary, while something is being done to remedy the cause of this situation, that doles should be provided, but it is madness to look forward for evermore to having a large part of our population mendicants, crawling to the Government for the wherewithal to keep body and soul together.  Since Fianna Fáil came into office one section of this community has been reduced to the position of mendicants, crawling to the Government for a dole and for the right to live. Farmers have been brought down to a condition when they have to eke out an existence through relief schemes. The people are now becoming dependants of the Government. Gradually every individual in the country will become a charge on the Central Fund until there is no Central Fund to support them and then perhaps Deputy Briscoe will lead us to the Promised Land, wherever that is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is at the root of this trouble? In 1931 the trade of this country was £91,935,000.  In 1932-33 the trade had been reduced by Fianna Fáil to £55,000,000.  Our exports in 1931 amounted to £39,250,000.  Our exports this year over the same period amount to £19,250,000.  The adverse trade balance on our trade of £91,000,000 was £11,000,000.  The adverse trade balance on our trade of £55,000,000 was £14,250,000.  We are going to remedy that situation by a dole.  We might just as well be pouring water into a sieve.  Deputy Norton described, with a break in his voice, the jibes and the jeers that were hurled by the relieving officers at people who were industrious but who were compelled to seek relief.  Does Deputy Corish endorse that?  Does Deputy Corish state that the servants of the public authorities in this country were <Col N="1713" /> allowed to jibe and jeer at the poor when they went for the relief to which they were entitled by statute? I doubt if he would.  I never heard any such complaint made and I should be very interested indeed to hear Deputy Corish substantiate or repudiate that allegation.</P>
    <P>But what has escaped the attention of a good many people is this: When Deputy Norton talks about people going in with their heads up to get what they are entitled to by statute, does he realise that up to the time of the necessity for this Bill the working men and women of this country were providing their own unemployment insurance and they were beholden to nobody for a penny that they got? They paid for it.  There was no question of going with their hat in their hand to anybody, but now every man and woman in this country who earns his bread is going to be converted into a mendicant and a beggar living on the Government.  They are going to be beholden to the State for what they provided for themselves in times gone by.</P>
    <P>We are told that Fianna Fáil has improved industrial conditions in this country.  Deputy Norton gets up and talks for an hour and says nothing. A month ago he said a good deal: &ldquo;I might as well be frank,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is no use in burying our heads in the sand&mdash;the unemployment problem to-day&mdash;I have no hesitation in saying it, because we gain nothing by dodging facts&mdash;is as serious as it was twelve months or two years ago.&rdquo; That quotation will be found in column 1568, vol. 49, No. 4 of the Official Debates.  Then he went on and said that it was exasperating to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce talk about factories.  Deputy Norton said that some of these factories &ldquo;might be put in inverted commas... They are in kitchens, cellars, basements, lofts and in back lanes, the workers existing under conditions that even in ancient Babylon would have excited condemnation.&rdquo;  That is not all either, because Deputy Norton went on to say that he advised the Fianna Fáil Government not to presume &ldquo;too long on the sympathy and <Col N="1714" /> credulity of our people.&rdquo;  I endorse most heartily what the Deputy said. Deputy Briscoe got up to-day and held himself out as the man whose heart is perpetually bleeding for somebody.  His heart is bleeding for the poor of Dublin and for the starving people of Adrigole.  In fact it bleeds in a most embarrassing way all over the place.  The old stock lie about the people dying of starvation in Adrigole was dug up again to-day. It is an old political gag that if you tell a lie often enough and loudly enough you will get somebody to believe it, and if you dig it up sufficiently frequently, you will dig it up sometime when there will be nobody there to nail it.  Deputy Briscoe was trying that on to-day. What astonished me particularly was that Deputy Norton took a leaf from his book and actually had the impertinence to quote part of an extract from the Official Report with a view to creating the impression that Deputy McGilligan laid it down as his view that, in certain circumstances, men ought to be allowed to starve.  I remember Deputy Briscoe doing that about twelve months ago.  He was taken to task for it and made swallow his words.  It seems strange that Deputy Norton should do the same thing again, but he was made swallow his words just as Deputy Briscoe was. I wonder is that lie dead or will it be necessary to slaughter it again?</P>

      <P>It is interesting in that connection to notice that agricultural wages in this country have been steadily falling since Fianna Fáil came into office.  The average has now reached the absolutely deplorable figure of 20/6 a week.  I am glad to see that the agricultural labourers who are being squeezed out of their employment by the condition of affairs brought about by the Fianna Fáil Administration are going to get consideration under this Bill.  They badly need it, and they will need it more and more as time goes on.  I am alarmed lest the introduction of legislation of this kind should create in the minds of any members of the House the feeling that anything really constructive is being done to deal with the problem against which the Bill is being directed.  There is only one way of restoring a decent standard of living for our people, there is only one way of securing employment for our people, and that is by returning to economic normalancy in this country: by recovering the markets in which the surplus agricultural produce of our main industry can be disposed of.  There is no use in building factories in Dublin, Cork and Limerick if the agricultural community, which in this country is the consuming community, are destitute.  So long as Fianna Fáil politics keep our agricultural community in a state of bankruptcy, so long will there be unemployment and economic disaster on every side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been proved beyond all doubt that the only profitable market we can find for our agricultural surplus produce is the British market.  The President has declared here that, having sought for alternative markets up and down the world, he has not been able to find them.  The Minister <Col N="1716" /> for Agriculture at Skibbereen said the same thing in other words.  We have got to face the problem that if we want to relieve the condition of our people, who are suffering sorely and who will suffer more throughout this winter, we cannot do that effectively unless and until our export trade is returned. That is what is destroying this country at the present time.  There is no use imagining that factories described so accurately by Deputy Norton as &ldquo;existing in kitchens, cellars, basements, lofts and back lanes in Dublin&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He knows there were more people plunged into unemployment and destitution in three months by Fianna Fáil conditions than were employed by all his new factories.

Unless they put their hands forthwith to the removal of the real cause of the present unemployment and destitution in this country either they will get thrown out of office or else the country will be brought to such a condition of bankruptcy and ruin that there will be neither funds to meet the demands of unemployment nor of anything else.</P>

      <P>It is rather amusing to hear Deputy Dillon in his new mood. He has not yet got over the effect of the economic war.  I am very glad he made a change over to the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches.  There he will find as soon as they did in ancient Babylon that they are talking divers tongues.  I am very glad the Minister <Col N="1718" /> has seen fit to introduce this Bill now. We had any amount of wild talk last year about the increase in the rates on account of paying home assistance to able-bodied men, but we heard nothing about these things during the Cumann na nGaedheal régime.  Now that the ratepayers are being relieved and people are not going to be allowed to die of starvation in this country, Deputy Dillon is wild about the agricultural community, and about our markets.  I had one of Deputy Dillon's followers at a meeting of mine last Sunday.  He asked me &ldquo;What will I do with my bullock?&rdquo; I advised him to &ldquo;go and ride it to Duffy's Circus.&rdquo;  I find that the farmers of my constituency are better off under the Fianna Fáil Government than they would be under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government despite the organised effort made by certain representatives of the Centre Party during the last twelve months to force farmers to reduce the wages of their employees or to sack them.  Deputy Dillon, with the most humbugging smile and in the most humbugging way, talked about the effect of the Government's policy upon wages.  In reality the reduction of wages was a very definite part of the Centre Party's policy and Cumann na nGaedheal policy.  Within a fortnight of the last General Election, in the parish I live in, every single farmer of the Centre Party notified his employees that he was reducing their wages the following week.  Surely this sudden wave of depression did not come on the eve of the election or on the eve of the poll. In one parish nine men were dismissed because they would not vote as the Centre Party wished.  Not only were these labourers to work 48 hours a week but they were to work 84 hours a week.  Their very lives were to be the property of their task-masters, and, certainly, their votes were not to be their own.  We hear this simulated wail now all over the country about the economic war and the effects of the economic war.  It is enough to make one smile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the real facts?  I take the ordinary farmer in the country with 40 acres of land and try to see where <Col N="1719" /> all this depression that caused so much unemployment comes in.  This is the farmer that Deputy Dillon speaks of who has got to sack his men or reduce their wages.  This farmer would have six cows, six calves, ten sheep, one and a half acres of potatoes; two acres of turnips; two acres of mangolds; four and a half acres of lealand by the road with two and a half acres in wheat and two acres in barley.  We ask where is the necessity for that farmer to reduce the wages of his men or to dismiss them.  Let us take his case and examine it, and every word that was uttered from the benches opposite in the last twelve months I will give them credit for.  He sells six calves and pays a tariff of 50/- a piece.</P>

His two and a half acres of wheat would yield two and a half tons.  The world price, and Deputy Cosgrave's and Deputy Hogan's price for wheat, was £6 a ton.  The Fianna Fáil price is £9 10s.  He gains £8 15s. on his two and a half acres of wheat.  He has two acres of barley.  If he sold it in the free open English market he would get something between 10/- and 10/6 per barrel.  He would get 15/6 from us, so that he gains £5 on his barley.  He gets a 50 per cent. reduction in his annuity, which amounts to another £10.  He gains £48 15s. under Fianna Fáil legislation and he loses £24.</P>

      <P>The argument has been used here, by Deputy McGilligan on a small scale and altogether throughout the length of Deputy Dillon's speech, that the reason why this Bill had to be introduced and the real cure for unemployment in this country was to get back for the farmer this market which it is alleged that the farmer has lost through Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was here when Deputy McGilligan spoke.  I was not here when Deputy Dillon addressed the House.  Such an argument advanced by either Deputy was quite legitimate, but a discussion of the whole economic condition of this country and a prolonged debate on the economic war and the condition of farmers is not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave it at that, a Chinn Comhairle.  I am quite satisfied with what I have said.  We find that another portion of the complaint of the Opposition was the burden of rates.  The burden of rates is largely relieved under this Bill.  The ordinary country ratepayer is suffering no increased rates under it.  The ordinary farmer ratepayer is being relieved of an enormous burden, the burden of providing home assistance for able-bodied unemployed.  As Deputy Norton has said, this Government has realised that that is a burden which should not fall on the local bodies. No longer in this country will we have unprovided for those who were forced out of employment because their politics were not the same as their <Col N="1722" /> masters'; nor will we have those unfortunate people hungry by the roadside, with no hope of employment and no hope of bettering their condition. Those people will now at last be provided for.  Those people will not die of hunger until we have time to deal with their particular cases, and with the particular cases of the people who have put them out.  We had Deputy McGilligan dealing largely with the industrial side.  We also had Deputy Dillon speaking about the factories that were closed down.  I am very glad that my constituency has come out pretty well in that light.  The two flour mills that were being closed down under Deputy McGilligan's rule are now working overtime and giving an enormous amount of employment. In regard to the third flour mill, which Deputy McGilligan solemnly assured the House here in 1927 could never be reopened&mdash;he said it was an inland mill and that inland mills were finished&mdash;it is now working three shifts, night and day, and giving an enormous amount of employment. The unemployment problem in my constituency is not so bad.  There are at least 100 people working now, for the mills alone, who would have been idle had Deputy McGilligan had his way. Those 100 families would be starving. We have the same position in regard to our waterproof factory, which Deputy McGilligan had closed down. Since the last time I spoke that waterproof factory has undergone further improvement.  There are now 140 persons employed in that factory, which was idle when we came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which I alluded to here some time ago was an application made to Deputy McGilligan's department for a small loan or grant towards the development of a mine down there.  There was a grant given last year of £250 for the development of that mine.  It only cost £250 to develop it.  That mine is now giving employment to 50 persons and they are not children either; they are able-bodied persons.  Those are the changes that have taken place in one little constituency, and I am only concerned with my own constituency.  I am giving the facts as I know them in my <Col N="1723" /> own constituency.  I say that the change which has been brought about by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to finding permanent employment for our people is a change that was very much needed and a change of which he has every right to feel proud.  My reason for alluding to these matters is because of the statements that were made in regard to the unemployment problem. I am glad that the coping-stone is now being put on these efforts by providing that those who are now unemployed will at least get enough to maintain them until such time as they can get employment.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly efforts have been made during the last 12 months, and if I might say so scandalous efforts, by men who should have used their time better or found some other use for their time, to advise people in this way: &ldquo;There is no use in starting an industry; it is going to go down; Cumann na nGaedheal will come in to-morrow or after and will close it down.&rdquo;  You ought to know very well that you will never come back; you are finished.  Owing to efforts of that kind and the dread that people have of putting money into industry, the wheels have been delayed somewhat, but they are going ahead now and going ahead very quickly.  I believe that within the next 12 months in my constituency, the unemployment problem will be practically wiped out and there will be then practically very little occasion for this Bill or very little money, which is the main thing, spent under it.  I am glad that the Minister is grappling with the problem in this manner and is providing that the unfortunate children of the poor and the unemployed people are going to get at least enough to live on, something to support them until such time as we can get permanent employment for them.  I should certainly prefer to see these people provided for by employment, but owing to the manner in which legislation is being held up, for instance, in regard to the Land Bill&mdash;a Bill under which we could have found plenty of employment for these people on the land&mdash;<Col N="1724" /> these people have been kept waiting and we must provide for them until such times as we can get the decks clear.  These are people who are made the victims of a wretched conspiracy, and I can call it nothing else.</P>

      <P>Might I rise for just one moment only.  I want to give a flat contradiction to a statement made by Deputy Corry at the beginning of his speech.  If I heard him aright, I understood him to say that representatives of the Centre Party had conducted a campaign for forcing farmers to dismiss their labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>He stated that representatives of the Centre Party had gone round the country threatening farmers to induce them to dismiss their employees.  I flatly deny that statement.  Deputy Corry offered no evidence whatever to support it.  He went on to say that immediately after the election some men had been dismissed by the farmers.  That may be true.  I do not know.  I think it is very possible that farmers may have kept on employees in the hope that the General Election would result in the reopening of their markets, and that they have been forced to dismiss their employees when they found what the result of the election was.  I know nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement of Deputy Corry went further than that. He said it had been the deliberate policy of representatives of the Centre Party to go about calling upon farmers to dismiss their labourers.  That is a statement that should be made only if it can be specifically proved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

      <P>On a point of explanation, the statement I made was that nine men in my own parish were dismissed from their employment on the day of the poll because they would not vote for the candidate put up by the Centre Party.  I make no statement I am not prepared to prove.  I am prepared to bring Deputy MacDermot to <Col N="1725" /> the nine labourers who were dismissed and to the nine farmers who sacked them.  Furthermore, within one week of the result of the General Election being known, practically every supporter of the Centre Party within a four-mile radius of me informed their labourers that they were reducing their wages by three or four shillings per week.  These are the facts.  Surely they did not all dream of it together in one night?  Surely they were not all inspired suddenly in a fit of depression to reduce the labourers' wages in the one week?  Deputy MacDermot need not think that we do not know what is behind the movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to make a few observations on this Bill.  It is, I understand, to make provision for unemployment assistance for people who are capable of work and who cannot obtain employment.  In other words, it is a substitute for the many industries which we are told would be the outcome of a Fianna Fáil Government. As far as Dublin is concerned, the Bill will place a very heavy burden on the citizens.  They will be asked to shoulder what I consider a most unfair burden.  The principle of the Bill, as already explained by other speakers, we all support but there are certain points in it that I think the Minister ought to take into consideration before it reaches its final stages.  The contribution of Dublin we have been told is to be 1/6 in the £, which will be based on the gross valuation, but owing to the fact of the full valuation not being effective in many parts of the city, the rate will undoubtedly come to at least 1/8 or 1/9 in the £. Secondly, Dublin citizens will be asked to contribute a large proportion of the Government contribution to the fund, and with national taxation and all the other items which go to make up the burden on the taxpayer, I think the Bill will weigh very heavily on the citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two points on which I should like the Minister to throw a little light when he is replying. Section 10, dealing with qualification <Col N="1726" /> certificates states in paragraph (e): &ldquo;that his parents, children or other relatives are unable to maintain him and that he is not or would not ordinarily be maintained or maintainable by them.&rdquo;  The phrase &ldquo;or other relatives&rdquo; will need to be defined because from my experience of a number of people who are in receipt of outdoor relief, I can say that there are a considerable number of them in regard to whom it would be very hard to ascertain information from either parents or children and if they had to rely on &ldquo;other relatives&rdquo; there would be no such thing as giving them relief.  Paragraph (a), of Section 15 states: &ldquo;that such holder proves that since the date of his application for unemployment assistance he has been continuously unemployed for at least six days.&rdquo;  Take for instance the case of a man who would be employed on Monday and who is discharged and paid on Saturday, receiving his 20/- or whatever amount is given to him. He cannot make application for unemployment assistance until he can prove that since the day of his application for unemployment assistance he has been continuously unemployed for the six days.  I should like to know who is to support a man during the course of the inquiries which, in some cases, will be prolonged.  I know that there are people dealing with this matter and who are competent to deal with it but they I am sure would find it very difficult to comply with the terms of some of the clauses in the Bill.  Take the case of a docker who may be employed only on one day out of six. His case will deserve special consideration which is not provided for here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we will hear further about it at a later stage.  The Minister has not made it clear how this Bill will relieve the payment of assistance under the heading of able bodied relief.  Is the Bill intended to be a substitute for the existing Act of 1929?  If it is, I can only say that it is a miserable attempt to deal with this side of the unemployment question, and I feel, in view of the Government's promises, that the <Col N="1727" /> putting of another £1,000,000 on the country to meet this problem is not dealing in a proper way with unemployment. I can only hope that on Committee Stage some effort will be made to improve it to some extent. There is this certainty about it&mdash;it does not go near meeting the relief already given through the 1929 Act. With these remarks, I will support the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

      <P>In the circumstances, we are all prepared, I think, to support this Bill and, in fact, we rather welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain the circumstances in a moment if the Minister will have patience.  We regret that notwithstanding the lavish promises of two years ago as to the numbers to be employed and the method of employment, as to the growing number of factories and, according to the Minister, the increasing number of people who were being employed in those factories from time to time during the past 22 months, this Bill should be necessary.  It is a lamentable illustration of the hopelessness of the Minister's policy for providing employment for the people.  The Minister, I think, estimated the cost to the people of this Bill at about £1,000,000, but I very much fear that £1,000,000 will fall very short of the amount that will be necessary to put this Bill into effect if it is to be put into effect in the manner proposed by the Minister.  In his opening remarks, the Minister said that the people eligible for relief under this Bill fell into two classes (1) the people with no means at all and (2) the people with insufficient means to support their dependents.  I am rather afraid that many people will come under those headings whom the Minister or his advisers did not take into account.  Deputy Corry devoted the main portion of his speech to proving to the satisfaction of the House that the farmer&mdash;and, incidentally, the farm labourer, because if the farmer in Cork is in such condition of prosperity as was painted so glowingly by Deputy <Col N="1728" /> Corry, the labourer in Cork must be in a pretty good way as well&mdash;was prosperous and also that the industrial position in Cork was very sound. Employment was increasing by leaps and bounds so that altogether in Cork this Bill was not very much needed. I do not suppose that there will be from this side of the House any speech so strongly against the Bill as was Deputy Corry's.  I do not propose to oppose it as completely as Deputy Corry.  I regret that the Bill is necessary&mdash;that the Minister has been forced through the failure of his own policy to bring in this Bill at the end of two years when everybody and particularly our unfortunate unemployed expected that work would have been found for 86,000 people and that those who could not be provided with work would be such a small proportion of the population that it would be possible to provide very easily for them in other ways.  I should like to point out to the Minister that this Bill will not suffice at all.  The Minister, later on in his speech, said that the taint of pauperism deterred many from seeking relief.  If the taint of pauperism in bygone days did have that effect, I can assure the Minister that any deterring power of the taint of pauperism has long since vanished and has vanished much more rapidly during the 22 months' administration of the present Government, than ever before.  There is now no man in this State ashamed or afraid to declare himself a pauper.  In fact, it is rather popular for people to admit that they are paupers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Men who three or four years ago might have been ashamed of the taint of pauperism are now, as a direct consequence of the Minister's policy, reduced to a position in which they are neither ashamed nor afraid that they are in that unfortunate condition and the farmers themselves, despite Deputy Corry's vain attempt to prove them well off, are in just as necessitous a position as the labourers.  Under the conditions set out by the Minister as to those who will be eligible for <Col N="1729" /> assistance, I can assure the Minister that thousands of farmers and their dependents will be looking for the 6/- to 14/- relief provided under this Bill and that they will have to get it. Deputy Corry tried to paint a glowing picture of the profits to be made out of milk and grain.  He would not give us figures but the Minister has given us figures and they show the danger of a person who does not know the subject stepping out of his own sphere and giving figures about a particular subject.  The Minister as late as last Sunday in my constituency tried to prove that the farmers were well off&mdash; he was thinking, I suppose, of this Bill he was to introduce to-day and endeavouring to deter some of us farmers from availing of its provisions as it will be necessary for some farmers to do.  He told us in Newcastle West that we were very lucky because we were getting 1/- a lb. for butter which was being retailed in England at 8d. per lb.  Danish butter was being retailed in England, he told the farmers in Newcastle West, at 8d. per lb.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>You are reported to have said it.  Perhaps you are wrongly reported, but you are reported as saying it.  If the Minister had looked up the daily papers he would have seen that Danish, New Zealand and Irish butter was being sold in the wholesale markets in England at 110/- to 112/- per cwt.  Still, the Minister knew so little of his subject as to expect the Newcastle West people to swallow that bait that butter was being retailed in England at 8d. per lb.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that it was being retailed in England at 8d. per lb.  We want some better exponent of agriculture than the Minister and Deputy Corry to prove to this House that farmers are not in need of relief. If I was not afraid of the Ceann Comhairle, that I would be out of order if I enlarged too much on the economic question, I would undertake to prove, even to the Minister, that farmers have <Col N="1730" /> been reduced to the position that they have no means at all, that they are destitute, and that of necessity when the 1st April comes, when this Bill comes into operation, if a certain settlement is not made with a neighbouring country in the meantime, they will be compelled in very large numbers to seek relief under this Bill.  Some of us are rather sceptical about the administration of relief generally.  To the knowledge of many Deputies the administration of local relief work has been such that destitute farmers who cannot provide food or proper clothing for their families have been debarred from such work just because they are farmers.  That cannot be denied.  In many districts, struggling farmers have been denied relief work just because they were farmers.  They will be afraid that under the terms of this Bill they will also be debarred from relief, because the administration is going to be taken out of hands which might have some sympathy with them, and is placed in the hands of assistance officers appointed by the Minister.  If they are tainted with any of the colours&mdash;outside of blue&mdash;upon which the Minister has hitherto appointed officers, some of us know what chance people with certain political opinions will have of receiving any benefit whatever under the Bill.  Deputy Doyle stated that there is going to be a charge on the rates in Dublin for a certain amount of the finances of the Bill.  People in the City of Limerick, that I represent, will also have to contribute. As these people are already contributing an amount that is almost beyond their capability to pay they are now to have an additional burden.</P>

      <P>It might.  I rather respect this particular Minister's assurances.  He assures me that this Bill is going to relieve the ratepayers of Limerick.  If the Minister gives me some little assurance in that respect I will go home a little bit easier in my mind.  He said that the Bill only applied to the able-bodied.  The destitute poor is a rapidly increasing body, particularly amongst the farming classes.  By the time this Bill comes into operation the number of sick and infirm, particularly amongst the farming classes, will have so increased that there will be a great addition to the cost of outdoor relief.  I notice that Deputy Norton was in a different mood to-day than when he spoke on the adjournment debate, and that the Minister was very sharp in retort to certain facts quoted by the Deputy. The Minister and his colleagues on the Front Bench were silent when Deputy Norton gave Fianna Fáil the greatest castigation that they ever got in this House.  Deputy Norton's speech on that occasion might possibly be described as the greatest vilification of the Government, because he was carried away by his anger, and made statements, for which, if made by Deputies on this side of the House, they would be howled down by every member of the Fianna Fáil Party. When Deputy Norton made these statements those on the Government Front Benches and on the back benches were silent.  However, Deputy Norton pounded his drum and the Government fell for it.  This Bill is what Deputy <Col N="1732" /> Norton's speech has produced.  Neither Deputy Norton's speech, nor the speeches of any member of the Labour Party, has made the Government attempt to fulfil the promises they made to the electors two years ago, promises that they repeated in this House on several occasions, to find work for the unemployed.</P>
      <P>What the unemployed need more than any dole or help is work.  If the Minister can in any way help, even gradually to find work for some of the unemployed we, on this side of the House, will rejoice.  Despite the numerous factories, and the growing numbers employed in them according to Deputy Corry, we find the unemployed being added to every hour and every day, and in this the twenty-second month of the Minister's reign, he is compelled to bring in this Bill as a sop to the unemployed, in order to try to get them to forget the glorious promises repeatedly made to them.  Of course, we will not oppose this Bill.  Even if it offered greater help to the unemployed we would not oppose it.  We rather welcome it in the unfortunate circumstances that have arisen.  We welcome the fact that some provision is even now to be made for the unemployed.  What was stated in this debate, and what has been stated for months, will bear repetition, that the only solution for unemployment in this country is the reopening of negotiations with people on the other side to end this unfortunate economic war, because until this war is ended, neither the dole nor any other action of the Ministry, will be of any comfort to the mass of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to welcome this measure.  I do so with a good deal of pride because it is, in my view, a corollary of the motion moved in the Dáil last session by Deputy Morrissey and seconded by myself.  In that motion we demanded work or maintenance for the unemployed.  To me, and I think, to the majority of the honest working people of this country, work would be preferable to doles, and if any objection could be raised to this Bill, it would be that the dole is over-emphasised in it.  I sincerely hope that <Col N="1733" /> before this Government comes to an end it will get away from doles and provide work instead.  I also support the measure because when we have a number of necessitous unemployed people.  They must be maintained by somebody unless they are to starve. In the majority of cases, they would be maintained by the ordinary ratepayers. Now, it will be made to appear that they will be maintained directly out of Government funds. That is true to the extent that this Bill will probably relieve the ratepayers of portion of their direct expenditure by way of rates.  I am not at all satisfied with some of the provisions with regard to the means test, but I shall reserve any comments I have to make on that for a future stage of the measure.  I feel that this test will cause endless difficulties and be a source of inconvenience to the officials who will be administering the Act.</P>
      <P>While welcoming the principle of the Bill, and giving it my wholehearted support, I recall that we had in former Dála criticism levelled by members of the Fianna Fáil Party and other persons in opposition against the Cumann na nGaedheal Government for creating what was described as &ldquo;hordes of officials.&rdquo;  That was the term used in relation to the increases in the Civil Service staffs.  Here, again, we shall have a large number of officials appointed and most of them will figure permanently on our Civil Service Estimates.  That, in my view, is not a proper thing.  We know that much of the criticism that was levelled against former Governments because the staffs of certain Departments were altogether out of proportion to the responsibilities of these Departments was well deserved.  One of the most eloquent speeches delivered in this House by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce was that in which, when in Opposition, he criticised very keenly the large number of civil servants required to manage the business of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard Deputy Bennett mention that another Deputy spoke of the state of industry and employment in the City of Cork, and that a very rosy picture was painted of the conditions <Col N="1734" /> in relation to employment in Cork.  I represent the borough of Cork, and so does the Leader of the Opposition, ex-President Cosgrave.  I am sure he will bear me out when I tell the House that I never remember so much unemployment in Cork.  I can assure the Minister that I am not exaggerating&mdash;I do not use the language of hyperbole in this House&mdash;when I say that, within living memory, there was never such unemployment in Cork as exists to-day.  That unemployment stretches to a large extent, over the whole of County Cork.  I know many farmers who are employing less labour than they ever employed.  Many men who work as agricultural labourers are in receipt of less money than they ever received previously in return for their labour.  I must be allowed to contradict the statement that Cork is prospering, and that there is less unemployment there now than there has been heretofore.</P>
    <P>Comment has been made by Deputy Norton that while Cumann na nGaedheal were in office they did not introduce a measure of this character to deal with the unemployment problem.  As one who has been, and still is, a student of industrial matters, I say deliberately that this measure is a confession that never before in the history of this country was the labour market in such a bad state, that this is an attempt, and merely an attempt, to remedy that state of affairs.</P>

      <P>I should much prefer to see the Minister putting his axe to the root rather than lopping off a branch here and there.  I feel that this measure is only a palliative or a temporary remedy.  Even so, I support it in the hope that all the industrial development promised by the Minister in his election speeches and in his speeches in this House will be fulfilled. I do not care whether it is the Fianna Fáil Party or the Party led by Deputy Cosgrave that brings in legislation of the character I have just indicated, it will have my hearty support and co-operation and I shall help in every way I can.  At the same time, there is a method by which I <Col N="1735" /> think the Minister might usefully spend some money on employment. Article 11 of the Treaty provides and prevents certain things.  A good deal of land, formerly held by the British forces in this country, is lying idle because lettings are precluded or prohibited by Article 11 of the Treaty. Since the present Government can so easily remove certain Articles from the Constitution&mdash;Articles which are, in the main, quite innocuous&mdash;I suggest that they might seriously consider the advisability of revising, if not altogether eliminating, after negotiation with the other Parties to the Treaty, that Article.</P>

It is brought about, not by any motion introduced by Deputy Morrissey and supported by Deputy Anthony, but by the industrial and general economic position of the country, caused by the action of the present Ministry during the last 12 months or thereabouts.</P>

      <P>The Government have driven this country to the Plimsoll line and the people who want <Col N="1736" /> assistance are told that they cannot expect to get any more.  When Deputy Anthony said that unemployment was never more widespread than it is at present, the Minister interjected &ldquo;tripe.&rdquo;  That is in keeping with the general line that the Ministerial Party take up here, and it is the complement of their treatment of those who criticise them politically outside the House.  Deputy Norton, as Deputy Anthony said, gets up with a very different tune from the tune he had the last time he spoke here. When he spoke here the last time it was at the highest point of a rising tide of criticism by the Labour Deputies of the conditions that existed in the country.  The Minister heard Deputy Corish say that things had arrived at such a point as a result of the condition of employment that the life of a public man was impossible in this country.  Deputy Murphy (Cork) said there was a blizzard of unemployment passing over the country, and I think Deputy Davin echoed his appreciation of the fact that that was so, and gave a statement of his own.  Deputy Norton now gets up with a completely changed tune. He has to run away from the position in 1933 and the prospects of 1934 to go back to 1924.  Going back to 1924, he has occasion to discuss and criticise Deputy McGilligan for certain alleged consequences of his actions when Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He likened him to a tank that was sweeping over industry in the country.  If Deputy Norton were talking as a Labour man, following the Minister's style of language in referring to Deputy Anthony's remarks as &ldquo;tripe,&rdquo; we could say that Deputy Norton was talking through his hat.  But, as he has come into the Fianna Fáil fold now in fortnightly conversations we simply have to say that he was talking through his sombrero, because that is what Deputy Norton was doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton described the effect of Deputy McGilligan's policy in this country as that of a tank going over our industries.  Deputy Norton can refer to the statistics published with <Col N="1737" /> regard to that period.  He does not believe in tariffs.  Nevertheless, as a result of tariffs, Deputy McGilligan was able during that period to add 13,000 odd persons to industries which before the application of tariffs simply employed about 8,000 persons.  Where 8,000 were employed more than 13,000 additional were added in tariffed industries. In the years from 1926-27 to 1930-31, the last year for which figures were available in the statistical abstract, there were 49,000 persons added to insured employment in this country by the &ldquo;tank&rdquo;; 34,000 were men, 11,000 women, 1,300 boys and 3,200 girls.  Deputy Norton can compare the proportion of additional juvenile and adult employment given during those years, and he can go and get something else to talk about when he wants to avoid discussing the present economic situation in this country than the record of Deputy McGilligan or the other Deputies on this side of the House during that period. 49,000 was the increase in insured occupations between 1926-27 and 1930-31. But when we turn to the Minister, as Deputy McGilligan already pointed out, the Minister during the greater part of one and a half hours talk shirked the realities of the whole position, and then for a few minutes began ducking bricks that he expected to be hurled and that he knew very well should and could be hurled if people were convinced that discussing anything with him here could do anything to change him from, as I said before, the callous attitude he adopts towards the situation here.  The Minister replies to criticisms here by reckless misrepresentations of the situation and tries to stifle criticism of the policies pursued by the Government by that kind of attitude, just as the Government try to stifle criticism outside by the blackguarding of public men, by attacks on Irish journalism, daily and weekly, and by an endeavour to suppress organisations that stand for a proper examination of Irish affairs and the sound criticism of them.</P>
    <P>Arthur Griffith once pointed out that if the writings of Swift and Mitchel were obliterated from the memory <Col N="1738" /> of the Irish people there were certain publications still existing that were as powerful in seditious things as the writings of Swift and Mitchel and that these were the statistics published by the British Government.  If public men outside could be blackguarded from platforms, if Irish journalism could be suppressed and Irish organisations could be broken up, there exists in the statistics and figures published by the Fianna Fáil Government to-day as powerful an amount of sedition as ever existed to stir the Irish people into reaction against the oppression and the blundering that is going on This document to-day is the culmination of a long line of seditious documents that have been printed for the last two years.</P>

Deputy Corry told us the farmers in Cork were never better off; that they are much better off under the Fianna Fáil Government than they were under Cumann na nGaedheal.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume you, sir, will not prevent me from dealing with the statistics published by the Department of the Minister showing the position of our agriculturists to-day; the position of our industrialists to-day, and the general position of our people who are called upon, in the first place, to provide the <Col N="1739" /> taxation that this Bill makes provision for, and seeing the future that is before the people that are being promised an existence by taxation without work under this measure.</P>
      <P>I say that the publication issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, headed &ldquo;Trade Statistics, Irish Free State,&rdquo; is a document that, from the point of view of the present Government, is highly seditious to them.  It is a document that should be more thoroughly understood in the country.  It ought not be possible in a country in which this publication is issued, that a person standing as representative of an Irish constituency in the Irish Parliament would be able to get up and say that the Irish farmers are better off to-day than they were 18 months ago, because the document that is issued by the Minister in respect of December shows that the Irish farmer has lost £9,000,000 last year as against the year before.  The last document of the kind that the Minister has issued is the document for July.  I do not know why the document for August has not been issued already, except that it is being delayed in order to cook the position&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the officers of my Department would not lend themselves to such a thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I would be very interested to see the treatment the information contained in the Minister's issue of that publication for August will receive in the Presidential Press.  I say that because the figures of English trade that were apparently available in the middle of September have been peculiarly treated by the Presidential Press, and are headed: &ldquo;Distinct Recovery in Free State Figures for Anglo-Irish Trade.&rdquo;  I said that the document for December showed that the Irish farmers lost £9,000,000 in their export trade for the 12 months.  Irish farmers for the seven months, according to the Minister's figures for July, lost in live animals alone £4,000,000, and lost under the heading of feeding stuffs of animal origin, £1,250,000.  When we come to <Col N="1740" /> deal with the figures that are available from English sources, figures that the Presidential Press published with so much pride as showing a distinct recovery in the Free State figures for Anglo-Irish trade, we find that the Free State figures show that Irish farmers were selling their cattle during that month at least £2 12/- less than they got 12 months before, that they are selling their pigs for half of what they got 12 months before, their butter for nearly half and their eggs for half.</P>

      <P>Listen to what the Presidential Press calls a distinct recovery in Anglo-Irish figures. Farmers are getting £2 12s. per beast less than they got under the conditions the Minister brought about in the previous year; they are getting half for their eggs, half for their pigs and almost half for their butter.  Thus an attempt is made to cloak over the seditious influences that these figures might and ought to have against the Fianna Fáil Government.  It is no wonder when we consider those facts that the next seditious document that I want to refer to, the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> for 1933, records that the wages paid to agricultural labourers in every province of this country are less than were ever recorded since this State was set up.  Further seditiously in these references the Journal points out that although the Irish farmers in their cattle trade, particularly, have lost £6,000,000, Irish cattle stocks to-day are only up by 3.7 per cent. and that in spite of what they have lost in the sale of pigs, cows, sheep and poultry the stocks of these have gone down except in regard to poultry where there is an increase of 2 per cent.  In spite of these losses, stocks have gone down too.</P>

      <P>I am talking of the seditious document and it shows that the increase of poultry in the country is 2 per cent.  But it is not that alone.  There is a loss of income because there has been a holding of capital.  These figures show that the capital is not there.  On page 106 Deputies will find a considerable lot more reading of a very seditious character.  Under the heading of &ldquo;Agricultural Prices&rdquo; there is a whole page of very forcible seditious writing.  The Minister, in speaking of Deputy Corry's references to the Centre Party dismissing their men, challenged Deputy MacDermot across the floor that men were dismissed.  I would like to ask the Minister whether he has ascertained in respect of any men who were dismissed from amongst agricultural workers whether they were dismissed through political victimisation on the part of their employers or whether they were dismissed as a result of receiving communications from inspectors of taxes such as those that were previously referred to in this House where Deputy Bennett had a complaint that in his area farmers had got communications like this from the inspector of taxes: &ldquo;I consider the wages paid to so-and-so are excessive&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister said, by way of challenge to Deputy MacDermot, that farmers did sack their labourers.  Deputy Corry says that they reduced their wages.  Will the Minister say if he has examined in any way whether unemployment is brought about more by political victimisation than by the receipt of communications like that or by the conditions reflected in the statistics he gives in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i>? The Minister says that the present unemployment insurance code does not deal with agricultural labourers and that therefore this Bill is necessary. No wonder it is necessary when millions of pounds are taken out of the farmers' pockets&mdash;and there is no capital in the way of stock lying there for the farmer to capitalise some time or other&mdash;and when the general conditions are such that officials of the State are able to address communications like that to farmers.  It <Col N="1743" /> is not an act of decency.  I say again it is an act of contrition.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry talked of the flourishing condition of the agricultural community in Cork.  I would ask him to refer to the figures issued to-day in response to a question.  Those figures show that in the last week of July as compared with 1932 the total number of unemployed in assistance districts had risen from 3,668 to 7,272.  I would ask the Deputy to look at the Cork figures and he will observe that in regard to assistance given to able-bodied persons there was an increase of 1,019 in the number in Cork City and County.  Those people had to get relief.  If agriculture is in such a flourishing condition in Cork I wonder why it is necessary for the board of health to give so much assistance to able-bodied men in the city and county.  Deputy Corry is a member of the Cork County Council and, no doubt, he is a member of the board of health, or at any rate he has direct approach to it.  Perhaps he can give us some explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you turn to the industrial position, notwithstanding all the promises, the picture from my point of view is even blacker than is the picture in the realms of agriculture. Sedition is, however, covered over somewhat.  In the <i>Trade Journal</i> issued by the Minister in September there is reference to the ready-made clothing industry.  Deputy Norton might look it up when he talks of Deputy McGilligan acting as a tank, steam-rolling industry out of the country.  That article, put together in the Minister's Department, shows that an industry in which there were 800 employed in 1924 and in which employment increased to 2,500 in 1929, gave employment this year to 3,370 people.  The Minister was able to say, a month before the publication of this document in which the sedition is hidden, &ldquo;In relation to men's clothing of all kinds, the job is finished.&rdquo; Employment in that industry, we are told, had risen to a figure of 3,370. That sentence should read &ldquo;Employment in the industry has fallen to a figure of 3,370,&rdquo; because employment <Col N="1744" /> in the industry had reached the figure of 2,500 in 1929 and 3,733 in September, 1931, the last figure that the Minister was able to give us for the late Administration.</P>

      <P>When the Minister and Deputy Norton talk in terms of imports they can say that imports were falling, but they were not falling simply because there was a lack of purchasing power here; they were falling because the employment in the industry was increasing.  The imports fell from £835,000 in 1924 to £207,000 in 1931.  Deputy McGilligan dealt with other sets of industries.  The Minister can gloss these two and the sooner they are glossed and put perfectly straight, so that there can be no equivocation about them, the better, because to-day they are highly seditious.  The Minister told us that in <Col N="1745" /> relation to the furniture industry the job had also been done.  The Minister promised that 492 additional persons would be put into the furniture industry.  The Cumann na nGaedheal administration raised the number of persons employed in that industry from 482 in 1925 to 1,600 in September, 1930. The figures for 1931 are not available. The Fianna Fáil administration has reduced them by 145.</P>

      <P>When we are presented <Col N="1746" /> with a Bill like this that asks all kinds of people to the enormous extent outlined, to come to the relief of the unemployment that has been created in the country and to meet a situation that has been clearly expressed even by Deputies of the Labour Party, we might be persuaded that the figures were not comparable or did not mean anything.  But what I have said represents the position with regard to the furniture industry. The Minister challenged Deputy McGilligan on the position with regard to the confectionery industry. The Minister will remember saying on 11th May, talking of the confectionery industry: &ldquo;Employment in it has been doubled, the output has been more than doubled and it is still increasing. Progress has not yet stopped in that industry.&rdquo;  The Minister has been asked to come down to earth in the case of an industry in which his Party promised to put 1,620 additional persons into employment.  We, in our time, found 3,728 persons employed in that industry in April, 1924.  We left the industry with 5,247 persons employed in it in September, 1931, the last date for which we have figures. The Minister tells us that he added 151&mdash;in an industry in which he promised to add 1,620.  Evidently the figures that he gives us now are not at all comparable, because we got from him the statement that employment in that industry had been doubled.  On 9th August we got the statement from the Minister that, as regards the confectionery trade, &ldquo;we have completed our job.&rdquo;  As I have said, the Minister challenged Deputy McGilligan's statement on this to-day. If we are to place any reliance on the Minister's interpretation of any of the figures that he gives us he ought to reconcile his statements.  One hundred and fifty-one additional persons have been employed in an industry in which we left 5,247 persons employed. The Minister's statement was that employment in it had been doubled; that the job of finding additional employment in it for the 1,620 persons, as promised by the Minister, had been done.  I am afraid the Minister would want the assistance of Deputy Norton <Col N="1747" /> to reconcile those figures.  They are figures which he has given us explicitly and definitely here.  It is the same in the case of the soap and candle industry.  In that case he promised that 154 persons would be given employment.</P>

      <P>The Minister can remember the fires.  When he is measuring up and counting the fires, I would refer him again to his promises and statements about additional factories and see if he can add any of them so as to get a correct position. If our people are to face the burden this Bill is going to put upon them, the Minister ought to encourage them and inspirit them with as much hope as he can, but the statements that he has made up to the present have been such as to cut off that hope, because the workers generally in the country have been told that there is no more work to be got in the manufacture of soap or candles: that that job is completed. The Minister shakes his head.</P>

      <P>Between 1929 and 1931 &mdash;that is the last two years that Cumann na nGaedheal was in office&mdash; the output of the soap and candle industry in this country had fallen off by about £25,000.

I would be glad if in those industries&mdash; the brush-making industry, soap and candles, ready-made clothing and the furniture industry&mdash;which show that the Minister's policy has brought about a reduction in employment, he would give a list of the number of fires that have taken place, the amount of employment that is going to be given building these factories again, as well as the amount of employment that he may expect to be added in relation to them so that we may rightly interpret what the Minister means when he says in respect of them &ldquo;the job is completed.&rdquo;  He has said that &ldquo;the job is completed&rdquo; as regards quite a whole string of things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's job.  Nothing is known for certain as to what the Minister means when he says &ldquo;the job is completed,&rdquo; because he says it in respect to the confectionery industry where he added 151, although his promise was 1,620.  He said it in respect of the men's part of ready-made clothing.  In respect of the ready-made clothing made in this country the promise was 10,501.  Now I am quite sure, knowing the simple tastes and modest kind of civilisation that the Fianna Fáil Party have in mind for this country, that when the Party promised that they would put 10,501 persons into the ready-made clothing industry all that employment was not intended to go into the manufacture of clothing for women: that some small percentage of it was meant to be a promise that employment would be given in making ready-made clothing for men.  So that when the Minister says in respect of men's <Col N="1749" /> clothing of all kinds that the job is done, and when he questioned me as to what the job is, I say I really do not know because there are 500 people less employed in that trade to-day than when the Minister took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The Deputy should not ring the changes on those figures.  If he does not understand them let him admit it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an indication of the position of things as far as the industrial side is concerned.  One need only walk through the streets of Dublin to hear the complaints of people losing their employment in commercial and manufacturing businesses and to see the other side of the question. One need only walk down the docks and talk to the dockers there, and he will find people who have lost their employment completely, or talk with men who used to have a full week's wages, working on the ships, for the last 15 years and who are now reduced to three days a week, two days a week or one day a week, as the case may be.  When the Minister tells us the financial burden his Bill is putting upon the country is the biggest financial burden this country can bear we believe him.  We do not know whether the country can bear that burden or not.  When we look upon another of the special documents issued by the Minister and see the taxation that is put upon the country we find that people who promised £2,000,000 reduction in taxation last year implemented that promise by putting additional taxation to the extent of £3,900,000 upon the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are told that additional taxation is coming from the workers and industry, through the increase of the unemployment rates, probably to the extent of another £1,000,000, which is going to be put upon the country in order to bear the cost of this new measure.  The unemployment returns which the Minister has given are most confusing. I would like to ask the Minister, who spoke of the way the figures for unemployment went up to something like 104,000 in January last, what account he is going to keep, under this new Bill, in the districts in which this expenditure is going to take place. The Minister knows well that the figures for unemployment in certain areas went up by leaps and bounds when, as he said, the inducement was for people to register by promises that public works would be established in the various areas, according to the number of persons registered as unemployed, with the result that between January and June last while the total fall in the number of registered unemployed in the north-western section of the country was 23,000, the total fall in the Leinster counties was about 8,000. Are we to understand that the same type of expense and registration is going to be done under this Act, as was done under the machinery the Minister has for recording unemployment? Are we going to get an account, per county, of the amount of money spent periodically in the various counties under this Act?  Because it seems to me from the experience the Minister has of the record of unemployment figures it is absolutely essential that we should have that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not per county!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly essential that there should be available periodical records, in respect of each district, of the total amount of money paid out there.  Again we have reason to criticise the Minister for <Col N="1751" /> the promise he gave that an analysis of the figures in regard to unemployment would be made and published. We have reason to complain of his going back on that and declining to give us the analysis of these very extraordinary figures.  The figures he has given as regards the number of persons registered as unemployed in various parts of the country have been absolutely unsatisfactory.  He draws a moral from them when it suits him, and he runs away from them when he sees they are not comparable with anything else that ever existed.  He stood there upon information which if properly understood or examined would have prevented the Leader of the Labour Party, in discussing the present conditions in this Bill, having to go back to the figures for 1924 and to avoid taking the figures for 1933 or 1934.  The Minister holds it out as a kind of bait to certain local authorities that they are going to be relieved by the operation of this measure of certain taxation.  I would like, whatever may be said about Dublin City and Dun Laoghaire, the Minister to tell us how he brings himself to say that the people of Bray, who are to be asked to pay annually £1,400 for this measure, or the people of Galway who are to pay £4,100 for this measure, or any of those urban district councils that are being levied at 9d., are to pay less in future because of the operations of this Bill than they are paying at the present moment.  The Government's policy has created a state of affairs that renders this necessary. True to the Minister's general attitude, he turns to Deputies in the House who deplore the saddling of the country with this additional taxation and says, &ldquo;You have not the moral courage to oppose it.&rdquo;  No one would wish to deny to the victims of the Ministry's agricultural or industrial or financial policy the very small bit of help that this measure is going to bring them.  Because small as the bit of help that it brings them this year is going to be, it is going to bring them nothing next year if there is a continuance of the industrial or agricultural or financial policy that <Col N="1752" /> brought about the situation that drives the Ministry to these expedients in order to relieve distress in the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Party may endeavour to stifle criticism in the country; they may endeavour to choke down the Irish daily Press and the Irish weekly Press; they may endeavour to suppress organisations throughout the country, but those figures alone would be sufficient to drive an intelligent electorate into such a state of vigour as would fire out the present Government, even if there were never the effects in the homes and on the people's lives, both in town and in country, that there are as a result of the Minister's policy.  It is a very poor assistance to them to get this small measure.  It is an outrage to saddle industry, and particularly those people who are working to-day at reduced wages, with any cost or any part of the cost of this measure.  I hope the Minister will change his mind, and say that that part of the cost which is falling on those who are working and striving to maintain industry will be taken off and put on the State in some way or another, because it will inflict a serious injury on industry as it is at the present moment.  The enormity of the cost of this measure to the country will be obscured by not putting the charge where it ought to be put so that it can be seen, that is, on the taxpayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It looked to me from this discussion as if the new Opposition were developing a new technique in debate.  The keynote of the new technique is, I think, indirectness. Every speech to-day was an acknowledgement that the principle of this Bill is correct, but was an indirect attack on the Bill.  Even with regard to the particular things dealt with the method of proving the statements made was a strangely indirect one; for instance, Deputy Mulcahy's method of proving that there has been no industrial improvement since the new Government came into office, that there has been in fact retrogression, is an outstandingly indirect method.  He endeavoured to prove it by the unemployment <Col N="1753" /> figures.  Why is he not able to quote some manufacturer in support of his statement?  Why are they all so mute on this question?  If they are not getting a fair chance, if they are not getting a market for the goods they manufacture, why is it that not one of them can be mentioned as stating that?  The furniture industry is supposed to have remained stagnant, or perhaps to have gone back.  It must have gone back for individual manufacturers, because it is admitted that there have been new factories, and if there has been no increase in the total production it must have gone back as far as individual manufacturers are concerned.  Why are those poor men afraid to speak out and say: &ldquo;This Government is ruining us.  A while ago we had a market for our goods; now we cannot get it?&rdquo;  Where are the confectionery people who are in the same position?  If there has been a reduction of £500,000 in imports, and it is asserted&mdash;as it was asserted by Deputy McGilligan&mdash;that that reduction probably represents a reduction of purchasing power, surely the Irish manufacturers must also have been affected by the reduction in purchasing power.  Is there none of them at all friendly to the Opposition, seeing that they are afraid to give the chance to the Opposition of making use of their case against the Government, or what is the explanation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a Federation of Irish Industries.  I do not know whether it is dominated by supporters of the Government, or whether it is dominated by supporters of the Opposition. I think there is a fair sprinkling of both.  They meet regularly.  Every other day we see Press reports of their meetings.  Why is there not one mention at those meetings of a stagnant market or a decreasing market?  Why is there not a demand from those people to the Government: &ldquo;Give up your present policy, and go back to the policy that prevailed under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government?&rdquo; A statement from one of those people would be much more convincing than all this talk about figures of employment and so on.  The whole method, as I say, was so indirect that <Col N="1754" /> it seemed to me it must be founded on some theory that a new technique was required with regard to attack from the Opposition.  I think as a matter of fact that the principal thing which an impartial observer would gather from the Opposition speeches, when boiled down, is that this Bill would not be required, that there would be practically no unemployment in the country if the economic dispute with England did not prevail, and we were able to send cattle, butter and so on to England at the prices that would normally be procurable.  That is a fairly big assumption.  Surely Deputy Mulcahy and everybody else on the Opposition side would admit that, even if there never had been an economic dispute, prices would not be as good in England to-day as they were at the time Cumann na nGaedheal were in power.  Surely they would not urge that they are as good to-day for the English farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreeing with all that, I simply want to get at the truth of the thing.  What is the summary of the statements of the Opposition with regard to the present condition of things in this country?  So far as I can see, as I have stated already, it is that if there were no economic dispute the farmers would have so much money, and the purchasing power of the country would be so splendid that everybody, or practically everybody, would be in employment, and there would be no need for a Bill like this. I, for one, do not believe anything of the kind.  I believe that if the change which has taken place since the present Government came into power had not taken place, if there had not been a big reduction in imports, if there had not been this effort to get industry going in the country, and if there had not been the system of relief works which has been put into operation since this Government came into power, the position would be a great deal worse.  If you come down to examine it in a concrete way I think it is obvious that there would be the <Col N="1755" /> same need for the Bill if there never had been an economic dispute.</P>
      <P>Take, for instance, a town which Deputy Mulcahy referred to, the town of Bray.  You have there something like 12,000 population.  I know that the officials of the Department which Deputy Mulcahy presided over when he was Minister thought that that was a problem during his time as it is a problem to-day.  You have there a town without an industry, without any considerable agricultural life around it, and you have an unemployed population of probably 600 or 700 people for the greater part of the year.  The question for the Government then is can they provide continuous relief works for those people, or would it not be better to establish a system like this, where there would be unemployment relief available for the people intermittently with such jobs as they are able to get in a town like that, where there is a constant change of jobs, and where a great many men are doing work in spasms, the spasms being as often as they can possibly get work? It is perfectly obvious, I think, that if Deputy Mulcahy and his colleagues were in power to-day they would have to face that problem.  The question for them would be whether, under the changed circumstances, they could leave the burden of maintaining those people on the rates; would it be fair to the farmers of County Wicklow and the other counties, and would it be fair to the unfortunate men themselves that they should be dependent upon the report of a home assistance officer for the existence of themselves and their families?  Is this not a much better system?  Regrettable as it is&mdash; and it is very regrettable&mdash;that such a Bill should have to be introduced, is it not a much better system that those men will at least have that as a definite guarantee, rather than that a perpetual dispute should be going on with the home assistance officer, and that there should be for the ratepayers the perpetual problem as to how to meet that demand upon them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care what promises were made.  I do not care what guarantees <Col N="1756" /> were given as to employment.  It is my impression that no matter what Government is in power, for a considerable time we shall have in towns such as the one I have mentioned a while ago, in Dublin and all over the country, a considerable unemployed population.  It is inevitable, I think, under mass production.  Mass production to my mind is the enemy of employment, and if the present Government are going to establish industries on the basis of mass production, I doubt very much if they will be able to keep their promise to bring the unemployment figures to a very low standard.  At all events, the Bill is to be welcomed as a Bill that will mean a great improvement in the lot of unfortunate people who are not able to get regular work.  I think there will be certain difficulties with regard to the administration of it and particularly with regard to the question of what is suitable work.  For instance, it is going to be a very big job for the unemployment officers to determine whether an applicant has had a chance of suitable work or not.  Will a road worker, for instance, be able to say, where farm work is available, that farm work is not suitable work for him?  There is a lot of farm work that is skilled work. Will he be able to say that he does not know how to plough, that he does not know how to make stacks, and so on?  In that way, will he be able to claim unemployment assistance if such work is available for him?  I know that in a certain part of the country there was a reluctance on the part of certain men who had been in good public employment all the year to accept farm work for a period when they were idle.  I think things like that are going to make the Bill rather difficult to administer, but, no doubt, means will be found of getting over them.</P>
    <P>I should just like to ask the Minister whether the Bill will prevent a man who is drawing the unemployment benefit provided for in this Bill taking any supplementary help from a local authority.  Does it mean that that is his total allowance from any public authority, or will the local authority <Col N="1757" /> be still at liberty to supplement the allowance he will get under this Bill when it becomes an Act, either directly or indirectly?  I welcome the Bill.  I think the best sign that it is a useful Bill is the fact that the criticism of it has been so very indirect, so very diffuse, and to a large extent so vague. Everything possible has been talked of in regard to this question, but the one thing that cannot be said with any conviction is that the Bill is due in any way to anything the present Government have done.  It has to be admitted that it is greatly to their credit that they have been able to supply so much more a humanitarian method, so much more an economical method in my opinion, to deal with this big question of unemployment relief among able-bodied people than has hitherto prevailed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore said that it is greatly to the credit of the Government that they introduced this Bill.  I cannot conceive the present Minister for Industry and Commerce taking any credit to himself for having introduced this Bill when we remember that the Minister a couple of years ago told us that the unemployment problem in this country could be solved and that a Fianna Fáil Government would solve it in six months.</P>

      <P>It was reported in all the newspapers, in the Minister's famous week-end speeches.  The President himself told us that it was comparatively easy to solve the unemployment problem in this country, that it could be solved and that Fianna Fáil would do it.  Here we are, after a year and a half of Fianna Fáil government, and it has to be admitted and is admitted by everybody in the House that there is more unemployment <Col N="1758" /> to-day than there was 12 months ago.  It has to be admitted that there is more destitution in the country than 12 months ago and that that destitution is growing and that therefore this Bill has had to be introduced.  The Minister and several other speakers seem to suggest that in this Bill the Government are carrying out the obligation which was placed upon them in this House last June 12 months when the House unanimously decided that it was the duty of the Government to provide work or maintenance for the unemployed in this country.  They have not provided the work and they are not providing the maintenance in this Bill.  Deputy Briscoe talked about the Government carrying out the promise they made and said that when they could not provide work they were providing maintenance.  They have not done that and even the Minister did not suggest it.</P>

I do not want to delay the House on the matter or to go into all the by paths into which other speakers went, but I should like to say this to my friend Deputy Norton, who quoted to-day from a speech made by me in 1924 referring to this question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. The Deputy is drawing away from the point again.  That is by the way, however. I do suggest to the Minister on this point that he will need to be extremely careful in the administration of this and in the setting up of the machinery to deal with it.  I would <Col N="1760" /> suggest to him that he ought to take care to see that in the working out of this particular part, he is not going to put a strain on the machinery for dealing with ordinary unemployment insurance that it will not be able to bear. Of course, the Minister, I am sure, is advised that if this is to be administered in the proper way it would be necessary to open up a very large number of what might be called branch or sub-offices throughout the country.  As many members of the House are aware, at present an exchange may have to cover an area of 15, 16 or 18 miles in parts of the country and unless there were a number of sub-offices it would be almost impossible to see that this was carried out.  One of the things I am afraid of is that in order to prevent abuse of the Bill when it becomes law it will be necessary to have a very large number of officials.  I quite concede that the Minister or anybody else could not possibly make it watertight but it is a Bill which will lend itself to a certain amount of abuse.  I am afraid that is inevitable but I suggest to the Minister that he ought again to examine that motion that was passed here.  I am prepared to accept this as a half loaf and that is all it is.</P>

On the one hand, they have the instructions of one of their leaders&mdash; the one who is not here&mdash;to oppose the Bill, together with their natural inclination to oppose the Bill.  On the other hand, there is the clear fact of which I was careful to remind them in opening the discussion that they had supported Deputy Morrissey's motion in April of last year and the clear realisation that opposition to the Bill was not likely to increase their political chances.  They are torn between these two conflicting sets of impulses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us get a few facts arrayed for the information of Deputies opposite because they want them badly.  They are working on theories and fallacious theories at that.  There is nothing which provides a better cure for an overdose of fallacious theories than a few commonplace facts.  The argument was advanced, first by Deputy McGilligan, and, then, in chorus by each of the minor leaders of the Party opposite, that this Bill really represented the failure of the Government's policy.  Deputy McGilligan said that we had started out with an industrial programme and a policy for the direct provision of work on State schemes of employment and we failed in one and found the other too costly and, consequently, we were falling back on &ldquo;this device of the dole&rdquo; as he called it.  Deputy McGilligan did not try very hard to prove that the industrial policy of the present Government was a failure and Deputy Mulcahy, no doubt, seeing the weakness of Deputy McGilligan's position, came in with a whole collection of ill-digested statistics and flung them out to the Dáil in the belief that they proved something in support of what Deputy McGilligan had said, whereas, in fact, they proved nothing of the kind.  I shall have seriously to consider the advisability of preventing Deputies opposite from getting into their hands statistics which they do <Col N="1762" /> not understand.  Misunderstood statistics in the hands of public people can be very dangerous and until Deputies opposite either undertake to attend, say, a class at the technical schools or in some other way to equip themselves to deal with statistics, we may have to ration their supply.</P>

      <P>There is no use in teaching them.  There are only eight present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Even those eight, if they learned the lesson properly, might be able to influence the others.  Let us get their contention right first and then see if the statistics support it. Do they contend that we have lessened industrial production in this country since 1932?  Is that contended?  No answer to that.  Is it contended that we have not increased it; that we have merely maintained the position as we found it in March, 1932?  That is not contended.  It is admitted then that we have increased industrial production, but not to the extent that we ourselves anticipated we would do. That, I gather, is the argument. Before going on to deal with that argument I should like, first of all, to warn Deputies opposite not to place too much reliance on figures relating to external trade.  Deputies opposite, with their eyes on foreign markets to the neglect of the home market, and with their eyes on other countries to the neglect of this country, always attach too much importance to figures relating to external trade.  If the total of our external trade went down they assumed that the country was suffering economic losses, whereas the reverse might have been the truth.  You could have a diminishing external trade with very prosperous conditions here and, on the other hand, you could have, as we had got, an increasing external trade with increasing poverty at home, but even assuming that the figures for external trade alone are the only index of our position, let us find out what they are.  Deputy Mulcahy quoted from the current issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i>, but he took good care not to turn over an additional page, because if he had done so he would have found that his argument was entirely destroyed by certain figures <Col N="1763" /> which are there published, figures the accuracy of which we are not responsible for because they are published by the League of Nations.  The argument is that Fianna Fáil by its policy has lost the export market for our goods, has destroyed in part our external trade, and that the damage thus done could be repaired if Fianna Fáil quitted office and the conglomeration opposite came in.  That is the argument, and it is based on the theory that this is the only country in the world with a diminishing external trade, whereas, in fact, the external trade of this country is diminishing less than the average.  That is what the figures show.  there are 26 countries in Europe&mdash;that is information for Deputies opposite; write it down&mdash;and in 16 of these countries the percentage decline in exports last year as compared with the previous year was greater than it was here.  In nine of these countries it was less than it was here.  The decline in exports from the Irish Free State was relatively less than the average decline in all European countries.  The decline in imports was greater in the case of 22 out of the 26 countries than it was in the Free State.  In the case of only three countries was there a smaller decline in imports than in the case of the Irish Free State.  Even if we take the figures for external trade as an index of our position, those that are available show that the world depression has had a lesser effect upon this country than upon the majority of the European countries.  That is the position, despite the economic war to which Deputy Mulcahy referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that the farmers' exports last year were valued for £9,000,000 less than in the previous year.  I feel inclined to ask: what is the mere matter of £9,000,000 in relation to the damage done by Cumann na nGaedheal during their period of office?  Let me tell you something about it.  I do not propose to take the whole period, only the two years between 31st December, 1929, and 31st December, 1931, and to study the position. I want Deputies to bear in mind that the important thing in relation to economic affairs is the value of the production <Col N="1764" /> that takes place here, not the value of the goods we send abroad. The more of our total production we can find a market for at home, the better it is.  It is the total production that really matters, and it is in relation to the production that took place here, when there was no economic war, and when Cumann na nGaedheal was responsible for our affairs, that I am going to enlighten some Deputies.  In these two years the value of the production of bacon in this country decreased almost by 50 per cent., from £4,700,000 to £2,700,000.  The value of butter produced in the Free State in these two years decreased from £7,000,000 to £4,200,000.  Taking the group of commodities which represent foodstuffs of animal origin alone which happen to be first on the list, the value of the production in the Saorstát decreased from £14,000,000 in 1929 to £6,800,000 in 1931.  There is the economic war for you!  The whole of the decline in the value of agricultural exports from this country during the economic war is offset by the decreased value in production in one of the 20 industrial groups here. On these figures, and on certain others that I will give Deputies opposite, I am sure a great many of them will come to the conclusion that a Cumann na nGaedheal peace is worse than any economic war.</P>
    <P>The next group we have bears relation to the production of cereal products and feeding stuffs for animals.  The first item is wheaten flour.  In two years the value of wheaten flour produced here decreased from £3,000,0000 to £1,800,000.  In the total group there was a decrease in that period of £3,000,000 in the value of output.  In the next group, miscellaneous articles, there was a decrease in value over the period of £700,000.  That includes confectionery that all the talk has been about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot hear me unless he keeps his mouth shut.  What I am trying to explain to the Deputy is that the decline in the value of Irish exports of all kinds between 1929 and 1931 was 28.9 per cent, and that 16 out of 26 European countries had a greater decline in the value of exports than that; that on the average our exports declined less in value than any other European country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are back to quantities again.  I said that the textile group showed a decline.  The apparel group showed a decline of £50,000; vehicles, a decline of £600,000. They all show a decline and Deputies can try to calculate them for themselves when the figures are published. Let us turn to agriculture.  Again it is the volume of production that matters, particularly when we are relating that production to employment. Generally speaking it takes the same number of people to produce the same quantity of any class of goods as it took in 1929, and even though the goods may have declined in value, the employment should not have declined, unless production fell off.  I have explained that in relation to almost every group of industrial production there was, during the last two years of the Cumann na nGaedheal rule, a decline in the value of output much greater than the total decline in our agricultural exports during the economic war, and that without referring to agriculture at all.  In the two years there was a decline in wheat of 8,000 acres; oats, 44,000 acres, and in barley of 2,000 acres.  The total decline in corn crops <Col N="1767" /> was 54,000 acres.  There was a decline in potatoes of 16,000 acres; turnips, 6,000 acres, and in all root crops of 37,000 acres.  The number of cattle in the country decreased by 93,000 head. That was the position we found when we came to office.  Deputy Norton talked about Deputy McGilligan going around the country like a tank crushing industries out of existence.  He was assisted by Deputy Hogan who, presumably, represented the poison gas, destroying agriculture.  In 1924&mdash;the period Deputy Norton was talking about&mdash;that tank was in fairly good order.  The destructive forces of Cumann na nGaedheal could direct it wherever they wanted it to go and could destroy any industry they wanted to destroy.  By 1929, it had begun to get a bit &ldquo;wobbly&rdquo; and it went careering about the country, out of control, destroying indiscriminately even where they did not want it to destroy.  In that way, they left us in 1931 with a rotten industrial organisation which we have been trying to repair ever since.</P>

      <P>We have been told that we have not succeeded in establishing in this country the degree of industrial activity we undertook to the electorate to establish.  That is true. But we did not reckon upon a crowd of nit-wits running around the country and starting civil war scares every time there was a prospect of industry developing.  They do not appreciate the damage they did.  They went round the country with these stunts and foreign correspondents came over and wrote flaring headlines about the &ldquo;new war.&rdquo;  One report of that kind does as much industrial damage as a month's hard work can repair.</P>

      <P>You may not ask the Minister anything until I am finished. If there is a slowing up of industrial activity, it is due to the element of instability which was deliberately created for party purposes by Deputies opposite.  Just as they prolonged the economic war, which they pretended to deplore, by their treacherous activities of a few months ago, now they are trying to prevent industrial development by jack-acting. By keeping silence they could do the best service they ever did to the country.</P>

      <P>The best service Deputies opposite could do this country for the next five years would be to go home and stay in bed until the five years are over.  Despite the destructive activities of Deputies opposite, we have succeeded in securing a greater degree of industrial development in the past 12 months than the Cumann na nGaedheal Party succeeded in establishing in ten years. That is going on.  The reason this Bill is now before the Dáil is that we have seen the end of the depression. We can reckon from this day forward that unemployment will continuously decrease.  We can assume that whatever this Bill costs in the first week of its operation, that will be its maximum cost.  We have broken the back of the opposition to industrial development here.  It was very strong, very wealthy, and it controlled avenues of propaganda which it did not hesitate to use.  Although our wealth and our population had been declining for many years, there was here a small but powerful section which battened on the national decay and accumulated reserves of wealth and influence which have been behind the Party opposite and which have been used against the Party which reversed that policy that, though it meant wealth for them, meant ruin for the country. Day by day and week by week, we have been building up the resources of this country and we have reached <Col N="1769" /> a point at which we can plan for the future with the knowledge that each succeeding period is going to lessen the problem and lessen the cost of dealing with the problem.</P>
      <P>A number of statements were made by Deputies opposite.  Some of these statements were relevant to the discussion and some were not.  I am not going to try to follow Deputy McGilligan.  It was quite obvious he had not read the Bill.  If Deputies opposite would take the trouble of reading the measures proposed for their consideration as carefully, say, as they read the three-years-old speeches of members of the Fianna Fáil Party, they would come here, perhaps, able to take an intelligent part in the discussion. But when we have Deputies&mdash; particularly a Deputy like the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash; coming here and making speeches which show complete ignorance of the measure before the Dáil, it reduces this assembly to the level of a mere debating society.  If this is intended to be a legislative assembly, a deliberative body, Deputies opposite must realise that they have a part to play in securing that and that their first duty is to learn something about the business under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan attempted to lead the Dáil to believe that this measure was a substitute for relief works.  It is nothing of the kind. The main solution of the unemployment problem in the minds of the Government is, and always will be, the provision of work.  We have been striving, within the limits of our resources, to utilise every avenue open to us to provide work.  I explained here that it was probably beyond human ingenuity to devise a type of administration which could provide work in each district at the moment it is required and in the volume required.  That cannot be done and there must be some over-riding provision for the relief of distress or destitution wherever it exists while the best organisation that can be devised is operating in the preparation of plans <Col N="1770" /> for the provision of work in preference to the provision of relief.</P>
      <P>I see where the leader of the Party opposite&mdash;I am assuming he is the leader of the Party; he is the man who is described as leader, Mr. O'Duffy&mdash;in the course of one of his many perorations said this was a Bill to pauperise labour.  It is quite the reverse of that.  Deputy Norton described the position fairly when he said that at the present time a man unable to get work, not through his own fault, but through the fault of society, and who is not entitled to unemployment insurance benefit, has to go to the relieving officer and establish his destitution in the presence of that officer before he becomes entitled to the very small measure of relief the local councils can afford. We are changing that.  That is the pauper system and that is what we are abolishing.  In future, these men, involuntarily unemployed, are given a statutory right to this measure of assistance.  They can go to the branch offices or exchanges with their heads up to get something they are entitled to&mdash;entitled to in law as well as in justice.  They will have as much right to draw that unemployment assistance, when unemployed, as Mr. O'Duffy will have to draw his pension or any Deputy opposite will have to draw his salary.  The basis of authority behind the three payments will be a law of the Oireachtas.  These unemployed people have a better right to that provision than any of the Deputies opposite have to their salaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it is necessary to deal with any of the other general points made in the debate by Deputies opposite.  Some matters relating to the actual terms of the Bill were referred to by a few Deputies, but they were a minority of the Deputies present.  Most of the Deputies who spoke took good care not to refer to the Bill at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say, however, in relation to what Deputy Norton said, that I fully agree with him that tariffs <Col N="1771" /> alone cannot produce the industrial development we want here.  It is futile to think that we can get by tariffs alone the measure of industrial activity we are aiming at.  It is also futile to think that we can get that without tariffs.  I say that we must first of all secure that the market is available for Irish producers in the products we want them to produce.  That is the first step.  When I said here in the Dáil that we had completed the job in relation to confectionery or readymade clothing, or some other class of goods, I meant that we had now reached the position where the demand of the people was for goods produced in Irish factories and that foreign producers were no longer supplying that demand.  It will take some time before we have industries here that can supply the goods we require in the varieties we require them, but until production has reached the point of providing these varieties we shall have to be satisfied with what varieties are available.  We must also recognise the fact that it is impossible on any day to look forward and say what any degree of industrial activity will mean in employment unless we can take into account the various technological improvements likely to take place in the meantime.  They are taking place in these days with considerable rapidity, so that very frequently a very substantial increase in production in a particular trade can be secured without any increase in employment at all. But we have succeeded in every trade in increasing employment and it is increasing still, although the first effects of our policy and of the stimulating efforts of the Department of Industry and Commerce produced results in the industries that were easiest of establishment, which required the smallest capital investment, and the smallest degree of technical skill and organisation.  That was covered and we got to the stage of larger units requiring greater capital investment, a greater degree of technical knowledge and managerial skill. That is being provided and one by one trades and industries marked out for development here are being established. There is not a day in the week <Col N="1772" /> that Deputies cannot read that in the Press for themselves.</P>
    <P>On the matters relating to the Bill which were referred to, I want to say a few words.  Deputy Norton referred to two matters of considerable importance which might have usefully engaged the attention of other Deputies as well.  It is to be noticed that the Bill does not provide for assistance to single women without dependents.  The particular difficulty which necessitated the deletion of provision for single women without dependents is the absence of employment for such women outside certain very easily defined centres.  All over the rural areas, particularly in the West of Ireland, there is a large number of single women who can claim to be seeking employment but who are unable to find it because, in fact, employment, apart from domestic service or employment of that kind, would not be available for them, and we are not anxious that it should be specially made available for them, say, at the expense of adult made labour. In so far as the families of these people are being provided for, they are being secured, I think, against serious destitution.  To include them in the Bill under a separate heading would, so far as we can estimate, increase the cost of the measure by almost 50 per cent. and we do not believe the amount of relief which would be secured for that additional payment would be commensurate with the cost.  There is a class of female worker who is in a different position and that is the female worker who ordinarily follows an insurable occupation.  It is conceivable that such a worker might become unemployed, exhaust her rights to unemployment insurance benefit, and have either no one to support her or no one depending on her.  In such a case she would not be entitled to assistance under this Bill.  The addition of that class to the Schedule of the Bill is a matter which will have to be very carefully considered because, as I have said, the total cost of the measure has already, so far as we can estimate, reached a point in excess of our original intentions and it is not possible to contemplate any increase in that cost, so that <Col N="1773" /> the addition of another class might necessitate some counteracting changes elsewhere.  However, it will be possible to estimate with a fair degree of accuracy the number of people likely to be affected by an amendment of that kind because, of course, the statistics will be available in the various offices of the Department of Industry and Commerce and when information is available decisions can be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton also referred to an apparent discrepancy between the second group of cases and the fourth. In one case a man with a dependent wife and children is given relief at the rates set out.  In the other case a wife with a dependent husband and children is given relief at a lower rate.  If strict logic were to apply in the preparation of that schedule in the Bill, the class to which Deputy Norton referred, that is the sick husband, permanently incapacitated, with a wife and two children, would not be covered by this Bill at all.  Ordinarily, the powers of the local authorities should be used to provide for the sick people who are in need of assistance.  This Bill is designed only to deal with the able-bodied unemployed.  There is, however, a type of case which is intended to be covered there and which cannot be left entirely uncovered no matter how logical it might be to do so. Deputy Norton referred to Pat Murphy with his wife and children, Pat Murphy being entitled to 20/- a week if unemployed. That 20/- supports Murphy, Mrs. Murphy, and the five young Murphys.  If Mrs. Murphy claims, she only gets 18/- and that supports Mrs. Murphy, Pat and the five children. That is not quite correct, because in order to effect that change we must assume that Pat Murphy changed himself from a healthy able-bodied man into a man who is permanently disabled by sickness from supporting himself and having no means of supporting himself.  Now it can be argued that we must relate in some degree the rates of assistance set out here (1) to the ordinary earning capacity of the person concerned; and (2) to the rates of assistance payable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  I do not say that when we relate these rates to <Col N="1774" /> earning capacity that we should do more than do so in a very general manner and take into account the cost of living in rural areas.  It will, I think, be agreed that the average earning capacity of a female worker is lower than the average earning capacity of a male worker and it was on that basis that a lower scale was fixed in the case of female than in the case of male workers.  The male worker with one dependent gets 12/-, with two dependents 13/6, with three dependents 15/- and with four 16/6.  The female worker with one dependent gets 11/-, with two dependents 12/6, with three dependents 14/-, and with four 15/6.  However, these are details which we can discuss more usefully in Committee.</P>
    <P>We have to bear in mind what the possible cost of any suggested change is to be.  If there were adequate money available there is not one here I am sure who would not be prepared to suggest an increase in these scales. But we have to bear in mind that any substantial increase in the burden of taxation might have results other than we desire.  Deputy Doyle referred to the condition in relation to the qualification certificate, which requires that an applicant must be in the position that his parents, children or other relatives are unable to maintain him and that he would not ordinarily be maintained or maintainable by them.  I have been considering this particular section of the Bill since it was drafted and I think that we can achieve the same purpose as is designed in that paragraph in a more satisfactory manner and certainly in a fairer manner by deleting it from that section and inserting it in the section relating to the means provision, a paragraph providing for the taking into account of the value of any benefit received in kind by the applicant from relatives.  It is quite obvious that we do not want to put the son of a man with £1,000 a year in the same position as the son or the relative of a poor man.  It is obvious that the son of a man with £1,000 a year should not be in a position to claim unemployment assistance.  It must be possible to take into account the fact that the <Col N="1775" /> applicant's father has £1,000 a year and that he is well able to maintain him and should do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle referred to the condition in Section 15 which requires that before assistance is given the holder of the certificate shall prove that he has been six days continuously unemployed. The Deputy referred to the case of a docker who might get one or two days' work in the week.  Well, we have provided that two days of unemployment followed by two days' work, followed by two days of unemployment is a continuous period of unemployment.  That provision is intended to cover the case of a man who gets casual work for a day or two. One or two days' casual work do not disqualify him.  It will not mean a break in the continuity of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle asked if this were a substitute for the 1929 Act and other Deputies referred to the possible effect of this measure upon local authorities. It is not a substitute for the 1929 Act. If the Dublin Corporation wishes to make provision for able-bodied unemployed over and above the provision that is made in this measure they are at liberty to do so.  That is a matter they have to decide.  If they think that the amount of assistance provided under this Bill is adequate or is as much as can be afforded that is the matter for them.  If they want to supplement it by a contribution from their own resources they are at liberty to do so.  That applies all over the country.</P>
    <P>When you arrange a scheme of organisation like this it is almost inevitable that it is going to leave out individual cases that should be covered.  It is not possible to provide in a national scheme for every possible type of case that may arise, and local authorities who give assistance following personal examination may continue to deal with cases that may not be covered by this measure.  They may fill any gaps in the scheme that may necessarily arise because of the fact that it is designed for national application dealing with easily recognisable and easily definable types of cases.</P>
    <P>The effect upon the rates in any district <Col N="1776" /> will again depend upon the local authorities themselves.  If the information which has been furnished to me is accurate it is clear that assuming a local authority does not wish to make provision for able-bodied unemployed out of its own funds, then in the majority of cases the enactment of this measure is going to mean a reduction in the rates even after the contribution under the Bill has to be paid.  If the local authority decides to supplement the rates under this Bill or to make provision for relief of destitution which they are entitled to do on a more generous scale than in the past, then the effect upon the rates will be what their action occasions.</P>
    <P>I think there can be no good ground whatever for criticising the Bill because of the local contribution set out.  Unemployed persons in the City of Dublin and in other boroughs will be paid at a higher rate than unemployed persons elsewhere.  Unemployed persons in towns over a 7,000 population will also be paid a higher rate than the unemployed in rural areas.  It is because these additional payments are being made as well as the fact that it is necessary to ask the local authority to contribute that that section stands in the Bill.  I would ask Deputies to bear in mind that if the Central Funds did not provide in previous years for the relief of unemployment, a considerable scale of rates would have been leviable in order to deal with the destitution.  Local authorities will find that this measure will be a considerable relief to them, because not merely will it mean a simpler system of dealing with able-bodied unemployed, but it will also provide that uniformity of operation which will have its effect upon the character and morale of the unemployed.  There is also the fact that classes are provided for in this Bill that the local authorities in the majority of cases cannot deal with at all&mdash;classes that cannot be helped out of the local funds except in institutions.  I am glad that the principle of the Bill has received such an unanimous acceptance from the House, and I hope that the Party opposite will have got new orders from their Leader so that they will have mustered moral <Col N="1777" /> courage to deal with the Bill on its merits.</P>

      <P>When a Bill was introduced in 1931 for a reduction in the rates of unemployment insurance contributions, Deputy Morrissey opposed that Bill very strongly and urged that instead of reducing rates of contributions the value of the benefits payable under the Act should be increased.  He was supported in that attitude by numerous Labour organisations throughout the country that have from time to time made representations to me of the same nature.  We have had under consideration the manner in which increased benefits might be provided if contributions were increased. When, however, it was decided to extend the legislative provisions for dealing with unemployment it was felt that the best help that we could give to insured persons who became unemployed would be to ensure for them continuity of benefit payment no matter how long the unemployment lasted.  If, in fact, we had decided merely to abolish the 26 weeks in one year rule, applied under the existing insurance scheme, it would have involved an increase in contribution as great as that which is provided for.  It would have involved a considerable increase in the cost of that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, in fact, doing that and more in the scheme now before the Dáil.  We are ensuring to each insured person that when his right to unemployment insurance benefit is exhausted he will have available from another source, as a right, other payments <Col N="1779" /> somewhat lesser in amount but continuing indefinitely as long as his unemployment continues.  It is incorrect to say that the persons who make the higher contributions get no benefit. They do, because the increased contributions make possible the payment of unemployment assistance at the rates set out.  If this £250,000 could not be provided in this way it could not be provided at all and either the scheme as a whole would have to be dropped or considerably reduced rates provided.  That fact should be clearly borne in mind.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party, like Deputy Morrissey, opposed the reduction of the rates in 1931.  Increasing the rates to the level at which they then were does not impose any unreasonable burden on industry.  We ask employers and employees in industrial occupations, most of which are in some way assisted by the Government either in the form of tariffs or otherwise, to make this contribution towards the general assistance of unemployed persons. It would be possible to increase these rates and use the additional revenue for the purpose of increasing the amount payable weekly to insured persons who would be entitled to benefit, or extend the period of 26 weeks to 39 weeks, or in some other way give them the full benefit of the amount; but we think, from the national point of view as well as the point of view of employed persons, that the best provision we can make in return for the increased contribution is the provision that is made in this Bill.</P>

      <P>In regard to this Bill the proposal to increase the rates of contribution would bear an entirely different aspect if it was not connected with the other Bill which we discussed here to-day.  I think it has been rather the pride of the working men in this country ever since unemployment insurance legislation was introduced that they have consistently kept the Unemployment Fund in actuarial solvency.  They were paying their share and were beholden to nobody for what they were getting.  According to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, <Col N="1780" /> employment has greatly increased in this country since his benevolent dispensation began.  If that be so, the Unemployment Fund ought to be actuarily far more sound than when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government went out of office, because there are more people in employment according to the Minister and more people contributing.</P>

      <P>The Cumann na nGaedheal Government rates were not economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fund was solvent when they went out of office and on the old basis of contribution they were paying off an existing debt at the rate of £300,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why then did they demand a subsidy for it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When Cumann na nGaedheal went out of office the fund was solvent on the basis of the existing contribution.  With the increased employment, if that does exist, the fund ought to be building up a surplus. Now we are going to increase the contribution vastly and bring it back to the old scale.  We are going to take over the surplus and put it into the Unemployment Relief Fund for the provision of this very necessary dole for people who have been rendered destitute by what has taken place in this country during the last 18 months. I think it is a mistake to mix these two things up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember Deputy Corish once throwing heavy emphasis on the importance of the fact that the workmen were getting no more than ordinary insurance, that they were keeping their fund in actuarial solvency and the psychological effect of that was very good.  There was no suggestion of charity or anything else about it.  I think it would have been very much more desirable to have maintained that state of things and met the emergency that has arisen entirely with the other Bill.  I believe it would have been a more prudent and more sensible procedure.  Whether it would not have been necessary in any case to raise subscriptions, I very much doubt.  I think probably if the fund <Col N="1781" /> were to be kept in actuarial solvency under present circumstances it would have been necessary to raise the subscriptions because, as I see the situation, unemployment is increasing instead of decreasing and the burden on the Unemployment Fund is becoming greater.</P>
    <P>In that event it would have been necessary to increase the subscriptions, but from the other point of view it would have been much better in my opinion to go out and say frankly: we desire to maintain the solvency of the fund and for that reason we had to increase the subscriptions, because unemployment was presenting a graver difficulty at present than it did two years ago.  Subject to that, I have no objection to the Bill getting a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered another aspect of the question, and that is to ask numbers of people in this country who are in sheltered occupations to provide weekly sums for this fund?  I know some of them who would be prepared to do that.  The effect of it might be to relieve some of those in industry who are paid small wages from having to pay heavy contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one question that I want to put to the Minister. It might, perhaps, have been raised more appropriately on the Unemployment Assistance Bill.  The Minister proposes to increase the contributions from certain industrially insured classes.  The increased benefit which these people are going to receive is to be by way of continuous unemployment benefit once their claim to benefit under the existing Unemployment Insurance Act lapses.  Under paragraph (b) of Section 13 of the Unemployment Assistance Bill it is provided that all income which such a person may reasonably expect to receive <Col N="1782" /> during the succeeding year in cash is taken into consideration in ascertaining the means of that person.  In connection with that, I want to put this to the Minister.  It is provided, I think, in Section 109 of the National Health Insurance Act of 1911 that where a person is in receipt of national health insurance benefit not in excess of 7/6 per week, the local authority is prohibited from taking the 7/6 into the calculation of means for the purpose of home assistance.  I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that since these people will be deprived of home assistance once they are getting benefit under the Unemployment Assistance Bill, the section in the National Health Insurance Act to which I have referred will be respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously a person getting national health insurance benefit is not available for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of the case of national health insurance benefit in the case of a wife where the husband would be the claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel certain that is provided for: that the husband being the claimant will get his benefit regardless of the income of his wife.  If his wife has an income she may not be classed as a dependant, and consequently the husband would be getting no additional payment on that account. The husband's means would be his own and not his wife's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister would make sure of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time men who are locked out or are on strike are prevented from receiving unemployment benefit, and I want to put to the Minister that he should amend this measure in such a way that their case will be met.  The Minister may remember that when a strike took place on the Great Northern Railway there were men who were precluded from receiving unemployment benefit although they were not a party to the strike at all.  As the law stood they could not get benefit.  The case was referred to the umpire and the decision was against the men.  I put down a <Col N="1783" /> question to the Minister asking that a member of the Executive Council should introduce legislation to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act so as to enable men placed in that position to receive unemployment benefit in the future.  The British Government recognised the justice of meeting the case of men placed in the same position in Great Britain as the railwaymen in the Free State.  There amending legislation was introduced in 1924 which made it possible for men such as I am speaking for to receive unemployment benefit during the period of a strike, provided it could be proved that such men were not active participants in the strike or subscribers to the funds of a trades union the members of which were engaged in the strike.  I think the present Bill affords a most suitable opportunity for the Minister to introduce an amendment which would remove the grievance I speak of, especially in view of the fact that increased contributions are to be asked from these men in order to strengthen the fund established to meet the needs of those unemployed.  The present position inflicts a grave injustice on those for whom I speak.  At the present moment they are working short time as a result of the present position of the railways.  Now they are to be asked to pay increased contributions, and yet if a strike or a lock-out takes place, to which they are not a party, they are prevented, as the law stands, from receiving unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister himself is very sympathetic to railwaymen.  At least he gave that impression during the general election.  Most of the railwaymen down in the area that I refer to voted for the candidates of the Fianna Fáil Party at the last general election because it was stated, and I suppose rightly from the point of view of the Fianna Fáil Party, that the Party was sympathetic to railwaymen in general.  I think it is up to the Minister now to show that.  I am anxious that the Minister should preserve the confidence of the men down there and I suggest to him that he should amend this Bill in the way I suggest.  Unless he does that, then, I would like to warn him that he will <Col N="1784" /> have a very rough time down around Dundalk the next time he comes to talk to railwaymen.  It is only a member of the Executive Council who can introduce such amending legislation. I am raising this question, but I am quite willing to give the honour to the Minister of introducing the necessary amending legislation and to let him have all the credit for it.  I do not want to take any for myself.  It will simply be doing an act of justice to a large number of men, and I hope, now that the Minister has the opportunity, he will see that the grievance I speak of is removed at once.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to have to destroy Deputy Coburn's optimism on this matter.  If he looks through the Bill that was discussed earlier he will find that the Minister has been very careful to incorporate in it the prohibition clause that the Deputy is so anxious about.</P>

      <P>Under sub-section (5) of Section 16 such a man is disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance if he is out of work because there is a labour stoppage at the factory, workshop or other premises at which he was previously working. The Minister has been careful to put that in, and why Deputy Coburn should think that he is going to remove it now after he had carefully put it in I do not understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought Deputy Norton might have elaborated the position and got on his feet when he made an interjection as to the condition of the fund.  The fund was actuarially sound.  It had, for about five years prior to 1930, been paying its way and not merely paying its way but paying off a big debt the amount of which was not contracted during the Cosgrave administration. There had been a period in which, owing to the fact that British legislation was taken over here and did not <Col N="1785" /> extend certain benefits, when the fund was not paying all the calls made upon it.  But from 1924 the fund was not merely paying all the calls made upon it but it was paying off an accumulated amount of £1,300,000 at the rate of £300,000 per annum.  And in the last few years there were so many people paying into the fund in comparison to the total drawing out of it that the day was approaching when that £300,000 would be wiped out in another year.  We decided to give industry the benefit and to fund that sum for a period of nine or ten years.  In that year I calculated that the reduced contribution would save some such sum as £300,000.  Portion of that, roughly about £50,000, was to be saved to the State because the State contribution goes up or down according to the amount of contribution from the employer and employee.  All the calculation was that the employer and the employee by reason of reducing the contribution were going to gain between them £250,000 on what the Minister in those days would call rather a small number of employed people in insurable occupations. Now we find that after two years of his magnificence, with all the new factories scattered all over the country and the wages earned in them, going back to the old contribution he is only able to exact the sum of £250,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly is behaving like the industries of the country&mdash;he is leaving.  That was the calculation made.  I asked a question here on one occasion to find out what was the income of the fund and how it was going from year to year; whether the decreased contribution had made any effect upon the contribution income of the fund, and what the contribution was estimated to be after the rates had been reduced.  I <Col N="1786" /> find that through all these years, from 1926 to 1930 inclusive, there was an increase per annum in the fund, sometimes £30,000, sometimes £40,000, and sometimes £60,000.  That continued year by year.  The fund was growing, and the fund could only grow if there were so many people paying in and the calls made upon it relative to the amount paid in were small.  It is only then there is a surplus.  That surplus was getting greater year by year.  The Minister had his first cheap answer, and it was the one naturally he would fall for, that the increased payments into the fund in these years were due to better compliance.  In order to stop up that I asked, on a later occasion, if the Minister would give an estimate of the expenditure and income or increase owing to better compliance. The only answer I got to that was that it was difficult to find any exact measure of the extent to which the Unemployment Fund had increased as between one year and another by reason of better compliance.  He gave an estimate and that estimate showed that in 1923, 1924 and 1925 better compliance affected the fund to the extent of about 8 per cent.; that in 1925, 1926 and 1927 it dropped to about 5 per cent.; that in 1927, 1928 and 1929 it dropped down to 4.6 per cent., and in the last years, that is 1929, 1930, 1931 and 1932, it was about 3 per cent., so that the compliance excuse cannot be taken into account in the receipts.</P>
      <P>The Minister is very pleased with this position, and the fund got over it up to the beginning of 1932, showing these two characteristics, first that it was increasing each year over the preceding year&mdash;that was in gross income &mdash;and secondly, when one looked into it and subtracted any calls made by unemployed persons capable of getting insurance benefits the surplus was growing year by year, and extra amounts drawn into the fund by reason of better compliance were being reduced year by year.  In these circumstances, which the Minister was so used to complain of, namely, the poor employment and the poor industrial circumstances in the country, there was an attempt made to benefit the industry of the country to the extent of £250,000.</P>
