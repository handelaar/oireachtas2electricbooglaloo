      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>put the following questions: To ask the President if the anxiety which on 28th September he told the Dáil he had to see disproved the particular charge made by himself against Deputy Mulcahy has been completely satisfied by what has since happened in connection with this charge, or if he has any proposal to make in order completely to remove any suspicion attaching to Deputy Mulcahy and completely to discredit those responsible for inventing and recklessly publishing the charge.</P>
      <P>To ask the President if the particulars furnished to him in regard to the alleged meeting of Deputy Mulcahy with the British War Minister indicated, as insinuated by the President on 28th September in the Dáil, that the alleged meeting was for the purpose of furthering either (a) a coup, (b) the suppression of representative institutions here, or (c) civil war; and, if so, will the President give the portion of the report alleged to have been received by him which evidences any or all of these purposes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has received representations from the managers of employment exchanges <Col N="706" /> regarding their inadequate wages, and conditions of employment, and whether he will use the opportunity which will be presented by the passage of the Unemployment Assistance Act to improve the wages and conditions of these officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received any representations from managers of employment exchanges regarding their salaries or conditions of employment, but the branch managers, who, unlike the managers of exchanges, are part-time and unestablished officers, have complained of the inadequacy of their remuneration and of the conditions of their employment.  The question of the future remuneration of these branch managers is at present being considered by my Department in the light of the additional work and responsibility which will fall upon them in consequence of the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, when the question of implementing the new Act comes to be considered by his Department, bear carefully in mind the long-standing complaint by the persons concerned against their inadequate remuneration, and will he sympathetically consider the question of improving their wages and conditions in view of the opportunity now presented by the passing of this Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he made any representations to Cómhlucht Siúcre Eireann, Teoranta, requesting that certain trade considerations be taken into account before the contract for the erection of the three sugar factories at Mallow, Tuam and Thurles, and, if so, if he will state what these considerations were in the case of each county in respect of which trade considerations were to be taken into account, giving in each case the value <Col N="707" /> (annual or otherwise) expected to accrue to this country as the result of the making of the contract.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain consultations took place between the Board of Directors of Cómhlucht Siúcre Eireann, Teoranta, and my Department with reference to the placing of the contract for the sugar factories at Mallow, Tuam and Thurles.  These consultations concerned the possibility, subject to the overriding considerations of the price and efficiency of the machinery and equipment to be supplied, of securing from the countries interested advantages for the Saorstát's export trade consequent on the placing of the contract.  I do not consider it to be in the public interest that the other information asked for on the question should be given at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>The allegation is that the contract was given to a firm that was £150,000 above the next tender. If that be so, is the Minister satisfied that the trade considerations guaranteed are sufficient to cover that very big difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The substance of our conversations earlier in the day yesterday was that about two hours would probably be necessary for an adjournment debate.  There was no agreement good, bad or indifferent.  I was in touch with the Deputy at 10 o'clock last night.  I did not inform <Col N="713" /> the Deputy until 10 o'clock&mdash;I was not in a position to inform him sooner&mdash; what matters were to be discussed on the adjournment.  There was no settlement with regard to time.  I had a telephone communication to the effect that it was proposed to spend three hours on the adjournment.  That was conveyed to me, not by the Deputy but by someone on his behalf.  There was no reference as to the definite time that would be taken for the discussion on the adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood clearly from the conversations I had with Deputy Mulcahy that he was not agreeable to accept merely two hours for the debate; if we arranged for three hours he would be satisfied and he admitted that the Government was entitled to three-quarters of an hour in order to reply to questions.  He said that the debate would be more or less in an interrogatory form and it was obvious from the conversations that time must be given to the Government to reply.  He admitted that two hours would be sufficient for the Opposition. I took it that there was a substantial agreement.  At a late hour last night the Deputy was speaking on the adjournment and I tried to get in touch with him afterwards, but it was only to confirm what was a substantial agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Confirming a substantial agreement is another matter. I think the Deputy will admit that I usually try to come to very definite conclusions and I then stand over them.  There was no definite decision arrived at last night with regard to the time that would be spent on the adjournment debate.  It was 10 o'clock before I could tell him what was going to be discussed on the adjournment.</P>

      <P>At any time we are prepared to make arrangements, but we are not prepared to accept this form of arrangement indicating to us <Col N="714" /> that we are going to be allowed two or three hours.

      <P>It seemed to be the wish of the Opposition to have a prolonged <Col N="715" /> debate on the adjournment and I was inclined to economise time and so did not speak, for I presumed the Minister for Agriculture would speak on this Estimate.  This Estimate for Forestry is necessitated by the fact that it is proposed to increase the area to be planted this year from 3,500 to 6,000 acres in the immediate future with the ultimate object of reaching 10,000 acres to be laid out under forestry annually later on.  For the purpose of reaching to this programme it is necessary to acquire this year additional suitable land for tree planting.  This is in addition to sub-head C (1)&mdash;Acquisition of Land (Grant-in-Aid) for Forestry.  The original Estimate for that sub-head was £10,000 and now it is proposed that of this present supplementary estimate an additional sum of £25,000 will be made available so as to extend the planting to 6,000 or 7,000 acres this year, that is in the current financial year.  It is not possible to foretell yet whether negotiations for the purchase of suitable land for that amount will he completed before 31st March next. The provision for this £25,000 may accordingly be regarded to some extent as conjectural.  However, the Vote is a Grant-in-Aid and any additional sum that may be over will not be surrendered at the close of the financial year but will remain in the Grand-in-Aid Fund and be available for the following year.</P>

      <P>How is this additional sum to be expended? Under sub-head C (2)&mdash;Cultural Operations, Maintenance, etc.&mdash;there is a sum of £47,000.  We are told that the old rate of 3,500 acres a year is to be kept on until further land is acquired when it is to reach 6,000 or 7,000 acres a year.  How is this 6,000 acres to be reached this year when the services for planting and reclamation are the same as last year and other years?  I should like to know where the £25,000 comes in there. Unless my recollection is strangely at fault, the Minister, when introducing the original Estimate here, said that tree planting could only go on at the rate of 3,500 acres because at the <Col N="716" /> moment there were not sufficient seedlings in the country to plant more than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must have misunderstood me.  I did not imply that the maximum area of land to be planted this year would remain at 3,500 acres.  I indicated that it was our purpose to increase the rate of acquisition of land for the purpose of planting from 3,500 acres at present to 10,000 acres per annum ultimately but that in the immediate future we thought we should be able to bring it up to 6,000 or 7,000 acres per annum.  Some of that land will be immediately acquired and it will be ready for planting.  The money in the Estimate is for the purpose of planting that land which, though not yet acquired, will be available for planting as soon as we get it.</P>

On how many acres does he anticipate that this money is going to be spent?</P>

      <P>It will be quite easy to dispose of the £25,000 because we have a great deal of land to take over.  It is only a matter of finding the finances. This £25,000 can be spent to a good purpose.  With regard to the money for cultural operations I said we hoped to reach eventually 10,000 acres a year, but we could not do that next year or the year after because our own seedlings were suitable in this elimate while the imported seedlings were unsuitable.  We can, however, go beyond 3,000 acres.  We can go to 4,000 acres by using all the seedlings we have and going into the native nurseries for more so that we will be increasing our planting operations this year by 30 per cent. or more. <Col N="717" /> Naturally the £5,000 for cultural operations and maintenance in addition to the £47,000 is not out of proportion for this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be an advantage to the House to know where the Minister is to acquire the land.  On more than one occasion we were told that the difficulty of the Forestry Department was to find suitable land available for forestry; it is very necessary that the Minister should inform the House of the exact whereabouts of the land he has now in his eye for acquisition.  I think it would be well also if the Minister would inform the House of the general principles upon which he proposes to proceed.  Does he propose to acquire large blocks of land for considerable forestry undertakings, or will he pursue the policy of acquiring small and scattered plots and have a very large number of plantations?</P>
      <P>Under c (2) I would like to ask him if he is satisfied that the powers which he has under the Principal Act for preserving amenities in the shape of trees are being used to their full advantage. I understood that under the Forestry Act he had power to prevent any person cutting a tree where the cutting of it would interfere with the amenities of a district unless that person undertook to plant something in the place of what he took away; also that people may not cut trees at all without express permission from him.  I think it would be well if the Minister would enquire as to whether those powers are being adequately used.  Those are the principal questions upon which I would like to have information: the whereabouts, the general line of policy as to whether they are to be large blocks or not, and the approximate price per acre which he thinks it will be expedient to pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. S. Brodrick Mr. S. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have some information from the <Col N="719" /> Minister on the lines that Deputy Dillon has indicated.  I would like to know, for instance, the minimum acreage of the belts that will be taken for the purpose of planting.  Some years ago the complaint was made that the belts were too big, that is to say, belts of in or about 200 acres.  I have been down through the country and I think the people are being misled in connection with this forestry scheme. I do not know where the information is coming from, but I have met several people with 20 and 30 acres and they seem to be sure that their land is going to be taken over for planting. They have also been led to believe that the price they will get will be £4 10s. per acre.  I would like to know from the Minister the minimum acreage that will be taken for the purposes of planting as well as the price that will be paid for the land, and whether the land will be freehold. I believe myself that belts of 300 acres will be difficult to get from one person. Certainly the planting of small plots of, say, 30 or 40 acres is going to be very costly.  Personally, I would like to see belts of in or about 100 acres. In the case of planting, I want to make an appeal to the Minister that the needs of the West of Ireland will be attended to.  Alongside the agricultural station at Athenry you have a belt of about 600 acres.  I believe the Forestry Department tried some years ago to make a deal in connection with that, but it was not completed.  I would appeal to the Minister to see that areas in Connemara are planted, such as the Maam Valley and other areas.  It would be of great benefit and certainly would afford shelter in that part of the country.  I have been informed also that the land there is very suitable for planting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago, when the present Government was in Opposition, the members of it said that when they got into office their scheme of planting would be 10,000 acres per annum.  The scheme carried out under the late Government was in or about 3,000 acres, but the best that we can get from the Fianna Fáil Government, now in office for almost two years, <Col N="720" /> is a scheme for 4,000 acres.  I am afraid promises of the same kind must have been made around the country because there are people with 10 or 15 acres of bogland who have been led to believe that it will be taken from them for planting purposes and that they are going to get £4 10s. per acre for it.  These are the sort of promises that were made by the present Government when in Opposition three or four years ago.  They then told the people that if they got into office they would plant at the rate of 10,000 acres a year.  The Minister for Agriculture made the admission to-day that their scheme is one of in or about 4,000 acres.  I hope the Minister, when replying, will let me have the information that I have asked for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's notice that it has been conveyed to me that in part of my constituency planting is not being carried out on as extensive a scale as in former years, and that as a result there has been a reduction in the number of men employed on planting. People in the rural areas consider, and rightly so, I think, that planting is one of the best means that could be provided for solving the unemployment problem in the country districts.  I listened last night to the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in which he referred to all that the Government had done for the relief of unemployment.  I can assure the Minister that if he were present at a county council meeting yesterday, as I was, he would have a different story to tell as regards the solution of the unemployment problem.  Men from every part of the district attended the meeting and appealed to the county council to press for the carrying out of relief works so that something might be done for the large numbers of unemployed.  I have intervened in this debate for the purpose of bringing under the notice of the Minister the appeals made by people in my district.  They feel, and they are in a position to know, that forestry and planting work should be pushed on with greater expedition than it is at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise for a moment to ask the Minister to give more consideration than his Department has yet given in connection with afforestation to the deplorable plight of a small but very old and steadily prosperous Irish industry.  I refer to nurserymen who had their business completely wiped out by the economic war under the tariffs that have been imposed by the British on young trees. These men had hoped, in view of the developments in connection with afforestation in this country, that the Forestry Department here would buy these young trees from them, but so far they have met with no success in their representations.  The particular people for whom I speak live, for the most part, round Summerhill and elsewhere in the County Meath.  The Forestry Department seems to take up in regard to them a red-tape and non possumus attitude.  As they have been in the habit of making their purchases from other sources on a large scale, they do not want to be bothered with the case of these little nurserymen.  In view of the fact that these people have made, father and son for a hundred years back, a steadily good living on very small holdings of land out of this business, I think it is a tragical thing to see it wiped out in the name of our new economy and I would press the Minister to persuade his Department to exercise a little more humanity, a little more consideration and commonsense in dealing with these people.</P>

      <P>I think it is only right that a protest should be made that on the introduction of an Estimate for over £30,000, indicative of a considerable new departure, the Minister who introduced that Estimate announces his intention of retiring from that office six hours after getting the money. I think it shows discourtesy to the House that Senator Connolly should not have attended and answered here for what is virtually his Estimate.  It means that this money has to be provided, and that the man responsible for its expenditure has not afforded this House an opportunity of questioning him, or hearing him, as to what his intentions are.  This is a new <Col N="722" /> departure in this House, and I think it is greatly to be deplored.</P>

I think it is the duty of the outgoing Minister to try to get the money that he has committed his Department to.  However, I suppose Deputy Dillon was not serious in the point he raised.  If he was serious it was a foolish point.  Deputy Dillon wants to know where the land is.  There are some rather large areas, two of them ranging from between 2,000 and 3,000 acres, in South Tipperary and Waterford, so that Deputy Curran will have no more cause of complaint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have quite sufficient power to preserve these trees.  Deputy Brodrick was anxious about the minimum to be taken over.  The minimum considered by the Forestry Department is 350 acres; we would prefer 500 as a minimum.  It is impossible to announce what is the minimum we would take for particular persons.  If there are many persons together we might take ten or 20 acres to make up the minimum.  If we <Col N="723" /> have a forestry station in the vicinity we might take over the land or small holdings if the average price did not exceed £3.  There may be cases where £4 10/- would be paid to get a good bit of land beside a nursery or where there was standing timber.  That price of £3 means getting the place as a freehold. The seller is to redeem whatever might be due to the Land Commission or other such charges.  As regards afforestation in the West of Ireland, the Forestry Department is run, more or less, on commercial lines.  We try to make it a commercial proposition, and so far we have not departed to the point of taking over an area that would be uneconomic for forestry, because of other considerations, such as the need for relief work and things like that.  One of the reasons why the Department is handed over to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries is that a slight bias might be given in that direction to Gaeltacht forestry. I do not know how far the Minister might go, but, at any rate, in that Department there will be more consideration given to the Gaeltacht than has been given up to this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible. Deputy Brodrick spoke of our programme of a few years and 10,000 acres.  That is still our programme, but, as I explained, we have got to get the seedlings, and we will not have them for some years.  This year we will only have seedlings sufficient to plant about 4,000 acres.  I might, in fact, also say in answer to Deputy MacDermot that we are prepared to go outside the State nurseries and to take whatever seedlings are fit for planting from other nurserymen in order to get the biggest areas under plantation this season.  We have only enough seedlings to do about 4,000 acres this year.  The following year we may go in for 5,000 or 6,000 acres, but it will take at least <Col N="724" /> three years before we reach the 10,000 acre mark.  With regard to the question raised by Deputy Curran about less employment in forestry in South Tipperary, I am not sure whether he is right, but I will look into the matter that he has raised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate is made up of various items.  In sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;an additional sum of £5,659 is required for additional headquarters staff, necessary for the administration of export bounties and subsidies and the functions under the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1933, and the Agricultural Products (Regulation of Export) Act, 1933. These two Acts were put through the Oireachtas during the year and additional staffs were found necessary and were required to deal with their administration.  Travelling expenses, particularly of officers attending at sales of heifers, were also required, and for inspectors engaged on the work in connection with the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act.  Under sub-head E (3) there is an additional sum of £36 required.  The necessity for this provision arises out of the report of the Imperial Committee on Economic Consultation and Co-operation, <Col N="725" /> 1933, which has been adopted by the Executive Council and approved by Dáil Eireann.  Sub-head K (1) is a contribution to the Irish Agricultural Organisation Societies.  The original provision was based on the assumption that the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society would have been superseded by the 31st December by the new statutory body contemplated under the proposed Co-operation Bill. We had only provided a grant to the Society for nine months in the hope of the Bill becoming law by the date I have mentioned.  The necessity for the postponement of the Bill again arises and we must provide for the last quarter of the financial year by this grant.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M (1)&mdash;Miscellaneous Work &mdash;This sum is required for advertising and publicity expenses in connection with the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act and the Agricultural Products (Regulation of Export) Act, the heifer loan scheme and the scheme of loans to farmers in County Wicklow for the purchase of Wicklow sheep.  M (4)&mdash; Loans for Agricultural Purposes&mdash;This is an amount advanced to the Credit Corporation for loans to County Wicklow farmers for the purchase of Wicklow sheep.  This scheme was considered necessary as a result of representations that were made after the snowstorm which took place early this year.  Numbers of farmers in County Wicklow lost a considerable number of sheep.  Some of them, I believe, lost up to 50 per cent. of their entire stock. We sanctioned a scheme of loans through the Credit Corporation to farmers who wanted to replenish their stock.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;thinking that the Co-Operative Bill would become law <Col N="726" /> by 31st December.  As soon as that Bill became law there would be a different body in control there.  The present body as such would go out.  Seeing that the Co-Operative Bill cannot possibly be through by 31st December we have to provide a grant for the last quarter at the usual rate.  The functions, of course, of that society are to supervise the co-operative societies of the country in general.  It takes the place of a sort of federation headquarters. Where people in any part of the country think that they should cooperate for any agricultural purpose it is the function of the Agricultural Organisation Society to send down an organiser to advise them on what are the necessary steps to be taken, and also to give them general advice with regard to the particular proposition which they have in mind.  They have been particularly useful in the organisation of creameries, and also in the re-organisation of the whole creameries scheme.  They have also taken a hand in the organisation of certain other societies, recently tobacco societies, and at other times they organised credit societies and also turf societies.</P>

      <P>No.  They are not the same body.  Sub-head M (6)&mdash;Scheme of Loans for the Purchase of Heifers&mdash; £350.  This scheme will also be administered by the Credit Corporation.  We supply some of the inspection work under the scheme, and also there is a certain guarantee given to the Credit Corporation with regard to interest charges and repayments.  There is no payment, however, anticipated in the current year.  This is taken as a token Vote.  Sub-head M (7)&mdash;Grant in respect of additional sugar beet grown in the Cooley district&mdash;£350.  The Cooley people have been restricted in their operations with regard to the sale of potatoes.  As Deputies are aware, it is a black scab area, and they are not allowed to sell potatoes inside the Free State.  They must export them. For some two or three years past they have been growing beet as an alternative, in order to give them a chance of <Col N="727" /> not depending altogether on the potato crop.  The State had to give the company in Carlow an additional grant in order to take it, because it was an extra acreage.  For 250 acres of beet in Carlow, grown this year and being delivered at present, there is an allowance of 4/- per ton.</P>
      <P>The next matter is sub-head M (8)&mdash; Oats Purchase Scheme.  This is also a token Vote, because no payment will fall due during the current year.  A guarantee is given to the merchants, if they purchase oats under the scheme, bushelling 40 pounds or over at 9/-, that for such oats remaining on their hands in June next the Minister for Agriculture will take it from them at 10/6 a barrel.  It is not anticipated that there will be any loss under this scheme, because under the powers which the Minister for Agriculture has under the Cereals Act, he can compel maize millers to absorb as much oats as will remain on the merchants' hands before that date.  The difficulty in this matter arises from the fact that although it was quite easy for us to have all the corn in the country absorbed for feeding stuffs during the 12 months, it was difficult to get somebody to hold the oats&mdash;to take the oats from the farmer in the meantime. The farmer, for want of cash and want of storage, was anxious to get rid of his oats.  The merchants and maize millers were not inclined to take it until it was required, and the difficulty we had was to try to get the merchants to take the oats from the farmer at a reasonable price.  Eventually a scheme was adopted by the merchants&mdash;about 120 of them I think&mdash;guaranteeing to work this scheme of taking good, white oats bushelling 40 pounds from the farmers at 9/- a barrel, and selling it as best they could to maize millers or for any other purpose, we giving them a guarantee that if the oats are left on their hands we would take them back in June at 10/6 a barrel.  It is only a token Vote because, even if the Minister for Finance has to pay up under this scheme it would not become due until the next financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head M (9)&mdash;Butter Purchase Scheme.  About the middle of September <Col N="728" /> last we had a meeting of representatives of the butter trade, and gave them warning that under the Stabilisation Act we intended to close down on exports except under licence. We calculated at that time that we would have sufficient butter in the country to supply our own needs in addition to the continental market. Again, we had a slight difficulty there; the creameries were not inclined to hold the butter indefinitely, or rather over a period of four or five months, as they had to pay their suppliers, so we had to give a guarantee to the creameries at that time that the Dairy Disposals Board would be prepared to take the butter from them at the current market price.  This is a token Vote to cover any loss that might arise under the scheme.  There is no fear of a loss because there would be no surplus of butter in the market before the 31st March.</P>
    <P>Sub-head O (9)&mdash;Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act.  A sum of £50,000 is provided to pay the bounty on wheat. Five thousand pounds is also provided in order to enable advances to be made to reputable merchants who sell wheat to farmers in accordance with a scheme approved by the Minister for Finance. This scheme we are familiar with. Last year, we brought in a scheme for the supply of seed wheat and manures for those who intended sowing wheat. The purchaser of seed can go to his own merchant and give him a written authorisation to the Minister for Agriculture to pay the bounty to the merchant when it becomes due, up to the amount of credit given to the purchaser.  Last year the scheme worked very satisfactorily, and the necessary authorisations were given to the merchants by purchasers of seeds.  The Department of Agriculture then, with the approval of the Department of Finance, gave certain advances to the merchants, as soon as the deals were completed.  There is £5,000 for that purpose under this sub-head.  Of course this is only by way of loan.  The amount will be repaid afterwards when the wheat is marketed at the end of the cereal year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> Sub-head O (10) provides £18,443 under the Agricultural Products (Regulation of Exports) Act, 1933 Arising out of quotas, when applying for quotas on bacon to Great Britain we had before us statistics of our exports of live pigs and carcases for conversion into bacon, but we had no statistics going back for eight or ten years.  We made a calculation of what would be in the future our surplus for export of bacon, live pigs for conversion into bacon and carcases for conversion into bacon, as the case might be, for each month from the middle of September, and then for October to the end of February.  Having made out the surplus, we applied for that quota to the British Minister for Agriculture. He was not prepared to give us a quota on that basis, but gave something like 47,000 cwts. for October, going down to 20,000 cwts. in February.  He told us we would have to level it out, as otherwise he could not provide for supplies to the British market.  That appeared to us to be reasonable.  We tried to work it out by bringing down the amount during the high months, and bringing it up during the slack months of production here.  It meant that we have to store a certain amount of bacon from October and November, which is going on the market from January to March, the slack periods in the production of bacon.  The factories, while approving of the plan, were, on the other hand, inclined to sell as much bacon as possible on the home market rather than store it, being, in the first place, out of their money during the storage period, and not knowing what way the market might go.  Perhaps if prices dropped there might be a serious loss on the bacon by February or March.  If they had to proceed to do that by trying to place more bacon on the home market than it could absorb, naturally there would be a cutting of prices and a serious decline in the price of bacon on the market followed by a very serious decline in the price of pigs. In meeting the Consultative Council of the Agricultural Products (Regulation of Export) Act we discussed this matter, and after some negotiation we agreed to give a certain guarantee <Col N="730" /> against loss in storing the bacon. Whether the guarantee will be called upon or not is a question we will not know before the end of the financial year.  I am inclined to think that part of the sum, at any rate, will be required; perhaps not the whole of the £17,500.  There will certainly be some loss caused by the cost of storage and shrinkage, and in order to cover that there will be an increase of prices on the home market of 14/- or 15/- per cwt. to meet it.  There is always an increase in the price of bacon in February and March as compared with November and December.  The increase is not likely to be as high as 14/- or 15/- a cwt., and if it is not we are not likely to be called to pay some part of the money.</P>

      <P>The destruction of this pest is being carried out with vigour. On the last occasion I inquired, about ten days ago, I was told that 200 had been trapped.  From experience in the district it is estimated that there are between 5,000 and 10,000 of these rats there.  It is a rather slow procedure and, of course, the trappers are only being trained.  It is doubtful if we will ever get rid of this pest completely, but, at least, we can check them spreading.  There are estimated deficiencies in the Appropriations-in-Aid. In the original Estimate the deficiency was estimated as £9,150, but that is offset by estimated receipts amounting to £700, made up of £300 registration fees under the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, and £400 refund by millers and registered wheat dealers of bounty paid to them in respect of millable wheat sold for use as seed. The total additional expenditure provided for in this Supplementary <Col N="731" /> Estimate is £89,639, to which must be added the net estimated deficiency in Appropriations-in-Aid which realised £8,450, making a total of £98,089.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This very large Supplementary Estimate has, to my mind, one peculiarly interesting aspect.  It ought to bring home something to the country, and that is that after two years of Fianna Fáil administration every branch of agriculture in this country has become a mendicant depending on Government charity. Two years ago the farming industry was carried on by independent, self-supporting men, who had not to ask anyone to help them along.  Times were admittedly hard, and world conditions were pressing heavily upon them, nevertheless, they were able to stand on their own feet and to make their own way.  Fianna Fáil came to their rescue and the net result of Fianna Fáil activity is that every single branch of agriculture is now in receipt of outdoor relief in one form or another from the Government. Oats, bacon, cattle, eggs, pork, wheat, every branch of agriculture I could name is being carried on with the assistance of Government doles and grants.  There is not a single self-supporting farmer living in the length and breadth of the land.  Is not that something that a Minister for Agriculture might be proud of?  It is bad enough for the farmers themselves, but the general effect that it is having on the morale of our people must be perfectly appalling.  There are men running with their hats in their hands to every Government Department for relief&mdash;men who would never have dreamt of looking to a Government Department five or six years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> It is becoming a universal practice to expect the Government to keep you. It is common knowledge that nothing is more demoralising to a working man than to be for a protracted period employed on nothing but relief works.  Every farmer in this country is in a position analogous to the working man working on relief works. They all know that in order to be able to carry on, they have to get doles or grants from the Government and they all know that if the Government would get out of their way and let them do their work, they would be able to get on without anything at all except the fruits of their own exertions.  The Government first comes in and destroys their business and then turns them all into the bond slaves of whoever happens to be in office.  That, to my mind, is the most striking element in this Supplementary Estimate.  If that fundamental fact is not recognised and remembered, before very long a damage will be done to the fundamental industry of this country that our generation will be unable to repair.  We all remember the Minister for Agriculture, on one occasion when I challenged him that his colleague was adding hordes of officials to the pay list of the Civil Service, replying &ldquo;Yes, and I am doing it every day.&rdquo;  He is; he is calling the tune and now he is beginning to ask us to pay the piper. £5,659 for additional personnel to the Civil Service&mdash;and that after it was found necessary to introduce legislation to reduce the salaries of civil servants only a few months ago. Having effected a saving on behalf of the State at the expense of existing civil servants, we are now going to spend that saving on new civil servants. As the President himself said, outside Bedlam was there ever greater insanity embarked upon?</P>
    <P>Under sub-head E (3) we have an item tactfully described as &ldquo;Subscriptions to International and other Research Organisations,&rdquo; but if you open the Estimate&mdash;and I do not want Deputy Corry to faint away when I read this out to him&mdash;you find that the &ldquo;Other Organisations&rdquo; are the Imperial Agricultural Bureau.  If that is not high treason to the glorious <Col N="733" /> principles of Fianna Fáil, I do not know what is.  If that is not fighting England's battle, if it is not playing England's game, I do not know what is.  Apparently, it has become fashionable to play England's game since President de Valera got involved in a little scrap up in South Down. He has discovered to his horror that, in the opinion of some of his fellow-countrymen, about whose welfare he is particularly solicitous when he has them locked up in Arbour Hill, he is playing England's game.  It only shows you that that is a relative matter but it also only shows that it is a very convenient weapon with which to wallop your political opponent when it is convenient to do so.  The weapon broke in the hands of President de Valera and his Party because the people of this country came to realise that it was a gross and dishonest libel, and what broke in his hand has been picked up by the I.R.A. to wallop him.  I hope he will like it and I hope that he will rebut the charge levelled against him by the I.R.A. as effectively and as definitely as we rebutted it and destroyed it when it was levelled against us by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head M (8) there is a token Vote.  We all know what a token Vote means.  A token vote usually means &ldquo;The figure is so monstrous that I do not dare put it down and I am not going to tell anybody about it until I have the money spent and then, when the horse is gone, you can try to lock the stable door as much as you like&mdash;I do not care.&rdquo;  This is to provide the dole that is made necessary for the tillage farmers of this country by the Fianna Fáil wheat policy.  I often remember that Deputy Corry used to get up here and sing &ldquo;Alleluia; the day of deliverance is at hand and at last, the industrious tillage farmer is going to come into his own.  Now he will see the price he will get for barley and for oats.&rdquo;  People would be clamouring at his gates to get the grain crop that he would raise, but by the Lord Harry, he discovered that when he had it raised, there was no one to buy it.  His colleague, with <Col N="734" /> great gallantry, I must say, took the field and the burden on to his own back and announced that he would fill the breach.  But he is afraid to tell us what filling that breach is going to cost and in my opinion we will probably never know what filling that breach is going to cost, because when he comes to realise the situation that his policy is creating for the tillage farmers of this country, he will try to push up the oats content of the maize meal mixture and as he pushes up the oats content of the maize meal mixture and prescribes the use only of dehulled oats, he will push up the price of the maize meal mixture and will leave the price so high that he will reduce the consumption of maize meal still more than he has already reduced it.  He will find that the introduction of such a measure of home grown cereals into the maize meal mixture will bring that mixture so near in quality to flour milling offals that the people will go to the flour milling offals and that no matter how high he pushes up the content of the maize meal mixture, he will not get rid of a single additional oat.</P>
    <P>It sounds so simple&mdash;we cannot sell the oats so we will make them use it&mdash; but it is not so simple in practice. It sounds quite simple to blend all the surplus oats of the country into the maize meal mixture and think that they all automatically go into consumption but they do not, and the Minister is finding that to his cost already.  Not only will he bring wheat offals into competition with the maize meal mixture by reducing the maize meal content too low, but he will also have to contend with the effect of his own policy on the feeding industry for which maize meal is used.  He knows that the fowl industry is practically wiped out; he knows that the egg industry has been reduced by, at least, 25 per cent., if not more, and he knows that the bacon industry is in serious jeopardy.  If these three industries vanish, the use of the maize meal mixture will practically stop. What placed the bacon industry of this country in the greatest jeopardy? Was it not the failure of the Minister himself to foresee the quota which this <Col N="735" /> country would require to absorb all the pork and bacon that we could produce?</P>
    <P>We have got to remember that so far as pork itself is concerned, which is intended for consumption as pork in Great Britain, the quota does not apply.  It only applies to pig carcases sent to Great Britain for conversion into bacon or pigs consigned to Great Britain to be cured as bacon. The Minister said here to-day that he examined the figures in consultation with his experts and he made up his mind that they would fluctuate, I think, between 47,000 cwts. down to 20,000 cwts.  The only reply he got to his application for a quota was &ldquo;All right, we will give you that but level it up and consign it in equal monthly quantities.&rdquo;  This, mark you, from the country with which we are engaged in a deadly economic war, a country that is trying to trample us into the ground and destroy everyone of us! That reply to the application for a quota was not what you would expect from a nation that was determined to wipe us out.  But they said &ldquo;All right, you estimate that to be the surplus. Very well, we will take it, but level it out over the months.  Keep in cold store what you have in October and what we do not want until February.  We will take your surplus.&rdquo; That is the reply from a market in regard to which President de Valera says &ldquo;Thank God, we have got rid of it.&rdquo;&ldquo;We will take all your surplus&rdquo; and, presumably, if the Minister for Agriculture had a little more enterprise and had asked for double the quota, and had not crippled the pig trade of this country, we could have got it too.</P>
    <P>We could have kept so many more people in this country at work and in profitable production if the Minister for Agriculture, instead of wasting his time at Ottawa trying to persuade the public there and elsewhere that he was a Republican and that he was not a Republican&mdash;that if you turned him up one way he was a Republican, and that if you stood him the other way he was not&mdash;had addressed himself to the practical considerations that arose <Col N="736" /> there, not only could we have got twice as much, but we probably could have got more than twice as much of a quota.  We could have created an artificial scarcity of bacon, an artificial scarcity of bacon at a price to be fixed by the British Government as remunerative for their farmers, because they were going to fix the quotas for foreign countries at such levels that they would only let in so much bacon as would fill the requirements of the British public at a price that would prove remunerative to the British farmer.  Now we have got a quota of 33,000 cwts. per month, and Canada, if you bring their quota into comparison with ours with reference to their previous shipments, has three times as much, because they were looking after their business at Ottawa, preparing the ground and cultivating this valuable market.  Is it any wonder that the word &ldquo;Bedlam&rdquo; occurs to the mind of President de Valera when he contemplates this country after two years of his administration?</P>
    <P>At present the situation in connection with the bacon industry is extremely difficult because as a result of the quota we have got, it has been necessary to restrict sales in this time of abandoned production.  But, of course, restrictions can only be enforced where you have got factories of a reasonable size with a reasonable organisation.  The result of that is that half the butchers in the country very prudently are each buying four or six pigs, curing them and selling them as bacon.  I need hardly say that they are selling them a few shillings cheaper than the price which the curers are in a position to offer. Where that will end or how it will end is difficult to know, but this much is certain, that a very chaotic and difficult situation has been created in the bacon trade.  The only reason it is not worse is that the production of pigs was reduced enormously last January by the preposterous prices that were then ruling&mdash;about 24/- or 25/- per cwt. and, in some cases, less. The pig population of the country was reduced by about 25 per cent.  That has contributed to relieve the present situation, but if the industry were <Col N="737" /> maintaining anything like the same number of people it was maintaining 12 or 18 months ago, real chaos would prevail.  God knows, it is bad enough as it is.  The Minister said to-day, perfectly solemnly, that bacon cold stored for three, four, five or six months will not deteriorate.  Little he knows, but he need not be a bit anxious because the deteriorated bacon will not go to John Bull.  John Bull will take damn good care he will not take it.  We shall eat the bad bacon.  The cold-stored bacon will all be eaten by the simple Irish farmer and the new stuff will go over to John Bull.  If we do not want to send it to him, if we fall by more than 5 per cent. of our quota in any fortnight, he will take it off our quota.  Denmark is standing hat in hand at his doors begging him to whittle anything off other quotas, and drop it into their hat and they will be grateful and glad to get it.  So there will be no standing on our dignity.  We will send across the best we have or he will take off the next quota the quantity of deteriorated bacon sent across.  When the Minister for Agriculture feels a spasm of Republican enthusiasm passing through his body, he will want to go and shake himself two or three times before he enters into negotiations in regard to the quota and that spasm that passes over him will cost about 1,000 cwts. per month in the bacon quota.</P>
    <P>The Minister tossed off to-day as he was passing, the statement that the butter supplies were sufficient for the domestic and foreign markets, the Continental markets.  I wonder would the Minister get a little more confidential and tell us what price he is getting on the continental markets? I was looking at the trade returns and I was going down President de Valera's alternative markets to see how they were getting on during the 12 months of the bounty and I found two or three of them&mdash;Germany, I think, Belgium and one other&mdash;had increased their purchases in the Saorstát. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this really looks like business.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is on the job.&rdquo; Then I turned back to the kind of <Col N="738" /> detailed information that is contained in the indiscreet interior pages of the estimate.  I discovered that in every case in which there was an increase it was in respect of creamery butter. I wonder what price the Minister got for creamery butter in Germany, Belgium and other countries?</P>

      <P>Since the Minister put the extra penny on the lb. of butter a fortnight ago, I long to hear that he has found remunerative markets on the Continent, because I anticipate with alarming dread any other continental markets being found the result of which will be to put another penny in the lb. on butter sold in the Irish Free State.  I notice that the Minister said to-day in dealing with the musk rat menace which has manifested itself not very far from the Shannon embankments, that while every possible step was being taken to get it under control, he very much doubted if any measures could exterminate the pest altogether.  Am I incorrectly informed when I say that in parts of Canada, where the musk rat was, you might say, an article of commerce, it became exterminated?  Might it not be worth considering offering a certain price per head to anybody who is in a position to supply musk rats, say, to the local agricultural instructor for destruction?  This system of expert trapping, while it may be necessary, is naturally expensive, but I think there could be a good deal of useful assistance given by casual trapping by young people who have not much else to do, if they were given some material inducement to set about the work.</P>

It would be interesting to know, with a view to ascertaining whether it is worth going on with or not.  In theory, it looks very attractive and very sound.  It would be extremely interesting to know how it is getting on in practice.  However, these are details and, while detail is very necessary in normal times, deserving the most earnest consideration of this House in normal times, the bigger issues should concern us now.  I invite Fianna Fáil Deputies to consider the patent fact that while farmers, though admittedly suffering adversity two years ago, were still independent, self-supporting men, every single one of them is now a mendicant living on the public funds. It is an achievement to be proud of. In my opinion it is the greatest blow that was ever struck at this nation.  It is undermining, and it inevitably will undermine, the morale of our people. It would undermine the morale of any people.</P>

      <P>Quite the contrary.  I should like to see our people standing on their own feet, making their own way as independent men, citizens of an independent State, working for things that are worth while; not working for tinsel and cheap applause.  I think it would do the Deputy good, the next time he is making a peculiarly eloquent speech on the streets of a Leitrim town, to ask himself this question: How much of all this do I mean; if it was really hurting myself as much as it is hurting the small farmers in Leitrim, how long would I stick it; would I think it worth while? I very much doubt if he, or any Deputy, will answer yes.</P>

I have not the slightest apprehension that he will.  However, I invite Deputies to think it over, to ask where this country is going and where its principal industry is going under the patronage of this policy.  I think they will come to realise that if they do not change their line of action and change it quickly, this country is heading for straight and inevitable disaster&mdash;disaster of a character that we will not be able to remedy in our generation.</P>

      <P>No matter what good humour we may bring in here, Deputy Dillon's doleful tales will bring tears to our eyes.  There is no doubt that when he speaks in that doleful strain of his he would make stones weep.  We heard all about the miseries of the farmers from Deputy Dillon again to-day. Deputy Dillon has decided to move out of the House.  I was kind enough to wait for Deputy Dillon, but he evidently thinks it is better to run away.  However, Deputy Dillon told us about the independent farmer that <Col N="741" /> was there before we came into office. Deputy Dillon was not in this House at the time, but I had a little experience of these independent farmers.  I remember when I came in here first I had five or six of them every month coming to me looking for time to pay their annuities.  That was in 1927.  In 1928 I had from 15 to 20.  In 1930 and 1931, whatever time the Dáil adjourned for, I had to come up here every week with a bag full of such applications and go to the Land Commission looking for time for them to pay.  There was not one single item of agricultural produce in 1930 or 1931 that could be produced at a profit to the farmer. The gentlemen opposite, when they were on these benches, insisted upon one thing and that was, that no matter whether a farmer was able to produce it or not, farmers' produce in this country should be sold in this country in competition with the produce of farmers or ranchers all over the world. I admit I made a mistake.  There was one small change.  The late Minister for Grass made a death-bed repentance.  Four or five months before he went out of office he put a tariff on foreign bacon.  He strove to save the situation and endeavoured to stem the tide.  The tide swept him out. Deputy Dillon complains that he has to pay 1/4½ per lb. for butter.  When a poor farmer gets into legal difficulties and has the misfortune to fall into the clutches of Deputy Dillon, I am sure he has to pay Deputy Dillon's price for his legal assistance.  A price of 1/4½ per lb. for butter would work out at about 5d. per gallon for milk.  If you allow a penny per gallon of that for the creameries and for the cost of handling and sale, I am sure the retailer in Dublin would not be satisfied with 3d. per lb. profit.  Does Deputy Dillon maintain that the farmers should produce milk at less than 4d. per gallon?  If Cumann na nGaedheal were in office, the price of new milk at the creameries would be less than 2d.  With a free, open English market, the average price of butter was 70/- per cwt. during the last 12 months.  That works out at something less than 2d. per gallon for milk.  Would there be a single dairy <Col N="742" /> cow in the country to-day if Cumann na nGaedheal were in office and if the farmers had to produce milk at less than 2d.?</P>
      <P>Cumann na nGaedheal voted against giving the farmer 4d. per gallon for his milk.  They voted against the Butter (Stabilisation of Prices) Bill. The farmer was too well off then.  He was so well off that he could produce milk at less than 2d. per gallon&mdash;at least, Cumann na nGaedheal thought so.  They went into the Lobby and voted against that proposal.  Certain gentlemen came in here, sat for a little while on those benches and said they were going to remain independent of all political parties.  Deputy Dillon suggested that Deputy Flynn should ask himself how much of what he states at the cross-roads he himself believes.  How much of their speeches did these gentlemen believe when they told the farmers, when seeking election, that they were going to be an independent Farmers' Party?</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to give way to any gentleman who shifts <Col N="743" /> his seat so often as Deputy MacDermot does.  What is the policy of the Party opposite?  Are they prepared to go out openly and say that the farmer here is entitled to the home market for his produce?  If they are, what is the complaint?  Deputy Dillon referred to farmers being on home assistance. Why?  I will give you an instance.  I grew wheat from 1918 to 1926.  In 1926, I was compelled by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government to put my wheat on the market against wheat from the Argentine and Canada and other places where they were paying no land annuities to Britain and were paying no tribute to Britain.  I got £6 2s. 6d. per ton for that wheat.  I challenge any Deputy opposite to quote the figures regarding the tillage areas of the Free State from 1924 to 1931.  They say the farmers were upstanding and independent.  What was happening?  They were going out, one by one, and were being absorbed so that we would have the Free State represented by about three landholders or ranchers.  The country would have been turned into a complete grazing ranch for Britain, which was, apparently, the objective of the late Minister for Agriculture.  You could carry out his agricultural policy in one lot.  You would not want a farm to carry it out.  Let all the bullocks out on grass for the summer and drive them in for the winter.  Fatten them on the produce of foreign lands.  When you have that all done, go over to John Bull and say &ldquo;For God's sake will you take this beef and give us anything you like for it?&rdquo;  That was the position. John Bull paid us in 1931 £13,000,000 less for our agricultural produce than he paid us in 1926, and he got more of it.  The land is now going back to the plough.  The unfortunate labourers, who were looking over the fences at the bullocks fattening, are now getting a little employment in ploughing and tilling.  We were told the country is not suitable for wheat.  I know a neighbour of mine who was not formerly of my way of thinking and who is what we would describe as a Southern Unionist&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>He voted for the Party opposite the last time, but I think he has been converted.  He grew 35 cwts. of wheat to the statute acre this year. I refer to Mr. Bird, of Cobh.  Any Deputy may test that for himself.  The last Minister for Agriculture told us that wheat could not be grown.  Are our farmers entitled to the home market for their produce or not?  Are we going to have those who do not pay rates or taxes here entering our home market?  Are we going to throw the home market open to them as was done during the last nine or ten years? Giving the farmer at least the cost of production was described as putting the farmer on home assistance.  Wheat at £9 10/- a ton is about the cost of production, and the farmer is entitled to that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon talked about maize meal.  I am sure when he is sleeping the Deputy dreams about maize meal, because he talks of nothing else here. Those who feed maize meal are asked to feed a little of what the Irish farmer produces with that maize meal and we hear complaints even about that.  Deputy Dillon complained about the admixture scheme and about the price of oats. I know one gentleman who wrote several letters to the Press complaining about the admixture scheme. I, with others, interviewed him in order to get portion of a big store that he uses for fattening pigs. He told us he could not afford to accommodate us.  He said he had 800 pigs and he told me that he made £2,000 profit on pigs during the last 12 months.  I refer now to Mr. Frank Buckworth of Cork.</P>

      <P>We would need to inquire into your bank balance so as to see you are not profiteering.  Deputy Dillon had to have a crack at the beet. He said we were going to drive up the price of sugar and the poor were going to be made more miserable.  We are going to see that the farmer will get the benefit of the home market because we can protect that.  Deputy Dillon complained about butter and wanted <Col N="745" /> to know continental prices.  I can assure him that continental prices were better than British prices, and we made money by sending butter to Germany and Belgium.</P>
      <P>As regards the £50,000 for a bounty on wheat, I can assure the Minister that next year he will have to find four or five times that amount.  In my constituency farmers are sowing five times as much wheat this season as last, and farmers are not fools.  They are setting wheat now because they find it will pay them.  I think that in a few years we will spend very little on foreign wheat and flour.  Every shilling kept in this country is a shilling saved.  We heard doleful cries from the opposite benches.  Deputy Flynn asked which of them was going to negotiate for the famous settlement.</P>

I would like to hear Deputy Bennett who voted against his own Party on the mainstay of the whole industry, standing up here and defending the attitude of Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy McGilligan in walking into the Lobby here in favour of compelling the farmer to sell his milk at 2d. per gallon.  Let us have it out.  Why did not Deputy Bennett follow Deputy Cosgrave into the Lobby in favour of compelling the farmer to sell his milk at 2d. per gallon?  He would be torn in pieces by those who voted for him if he did so and he knows it.  If the farmers were presently under the lash of Cumann <Col N="747" /> na nGaedheal, producing milk at the price of butter in the free open English market, would there be a single cow in Limerick to-day?</P>

      <P>The value of butter in the free, open English market is 70/- per cwt. without any tariff.  That is the price of the very best Free State butter in the English market for the last 12 months.  That price is equivalent to 2d. a gallon for milk.  If the farmers of Limerick were getting 2d. a gallon for milk, we would hear Deputy Bennett moaning and groaning. He would leave the beloved ranks of Cumann na nGaedheal if they insisted on such a price.  At least he proved here by his vote that he did not believe that a farmer in the County of Limerick could produce milk for it, nor did Deputy MacDermot believe it.  I wonder when the next vote comes along will we have a split in the musical comedy over there at present composed of all mixtures, or will Deputy MacDermot swallow Deputy Mulcahy's proposal and vote for milk at 2d. per gallon or will Deputy Mulcahy swallow Deputy MacDermot's side and say Fianna Fáil are right?  Which of the two is to succeed?  When we hear this kind of claptrap here day after day and week after week we get about fed up with it.  There is a limit to human endurance.

That allegation is absolutely unfounded.  I challenge Deputy Corry or anybody else to produce a single pronouncement made by us in the time when the Centre Party existed that is inconsistent with the action which we have taken.  I certainly promised over and over again that the independence of the Centre Party was not going to be a sham independence and that as long as I was connected with it, it was not going to become the tail either of the pro-Treaty or the anti-Treaty political Party.  I think I can safely say that we carried out that undertaking and that while we did exist as a Party we made ourselves equally unpopular with both Parties.</P>

      <P>I did not catch that.  There was nothing at all to stop us as regards any speeches we made or pledges we gave from taking part in the formation of a new Party.  I regard the formation of the United Ireland Party as in no way a repudiation of the principles of the Centre Party.  On the contrary I regard it as a development and fulfilment of Centre Party ideals and so far from being ashamed of the merger I am proud of it and glad of it.  Another answer to Deputy Corry's charge of bad faith is that before the merger took place it was submitted to the most democratic assembly, representative of the Party, that we could collect and by them accepted practically with unanimity.  Finally I would like the Deputy or anyone else who makes these charges to indicate a single principle or a single policy which we sacrificed or to which we were false at the time that we engaged in this merger.  It was not a situation where, as in the case of the Labour Party, we would have had to swallow a measure like the Public Safety Act that we had denounced root and branch in the past.  Nothing of that sort came in.  There has been no sacrifice of any political principle and no betrayal of any political promise.</P>

      <P>As regards the rest of Deputy Corry's speech, the short answer to his contemptuous talk about the British market is that his own Government are paying millions a year in bounties and subsidies in order to get into that market.  That disposes of his argument.  As regards what has been accomplished in Germany and Belgium, I am glad that so much has been accomplished there and that the prices realised have been so high, but I ask the Deputy how much prospect there would have been of selling the quantity of butter we sold in those countries if we had not given enormous orders to those countries?  I would like to know how the value of the goods they took from us compares with the value of the goods we bought from them.  I fancy that the comparison would show we had paid a very big price, and I challenge Deputy Corry or anybody else to say that the Belgian or the German market or any other market in existence can compare with the British market as a market to which to export our agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>One observation fell from Deputy Corry which has been so often made here that perhaps it is time that it should be challenged.  That is the statement that every shilling that is kept in this country is necessarily a shilling gained to this country.  That is absolute nonsense.  On that theory no international trade would ever be justified.  Sometimes by sending a shilling out of the country you may get something into the country that is worth two shillings or three shillings, so that there is actually a gain to the country from not keeping it here.</P>

      <P>I regret that I was not in for the whole of the illuminating address the House heard from Deputy Corry.  The little of it that I did hear was instructive when properly interpreted. The Deputy laboured the point that the price of Free State butter in the British market, without the tariff being deducted, is 70/- per cwt., and said that is all we would be <Col N="750" /> getting for it here at present were it not for the bounty.  I agree, but is there not another side to that picture, and it is that when the tariff is deducted we are only getting 42/- per cwt.  In other words, we are subsidising the British producer to get our butter delivered into England at 42/- per cwt.  I cannot say exactly what the Dublin worker is paying for Irish butter now, but I dare say it is 120/- per cwt.  I am not sure what the wholesale price is, but the position at any rate is that this country is giving its butter to the British wholesaler at 42/- per cwt., or at about 4d. per lb. That is something for the working classes of this country to consider, the people that we hear so much about from the benches opposite.  It is something for my colleague, Deputy Kelly, who represents South City, to consider, the man whose heart bleeds for and who has spent all his life shedding crocodile tears for the workers of Dublin City.  That is the outcome of the policy of the present Government: that we are giving our best creamery butter to the English worker for 4d. per lb., while the Dublin worker has to pay over 1/4 a lb. for it.</P>

      <P>We will pass on.  Deputy Corry gave statistics about wheat growing which I agree with.  The return that he mentioned was a good one.  It was not an exaggerated return, 35 cwt. to the acre.  That works out at about 14 barrels to the statute acre, or between 22 and 23 barrels to the Irish acre.  A neighbour of mine grew this year, and marketed, 23 barrels of millable wheat to the Irish acre.  That is more than corroborating Deputy Corry on yield.  I would like the Minister to consider this, not from the political angle but from the agricultural angle. That wheat was Yeoman No. 2.  It was a marvellous yield for that strain of wheat, as I am sure the Minister will admit.  I doubt if it has been excelled in any part of the country.  While I do not agree with the way the Minister is pursuing his wheat policy, though I do agree with the goal he is making for, I <Col N="752" /> would like to see him giving more attention to the better strains of wheat if we are to be committed to bounties &mdash;to give a little more bounty to the better strains of wheat which, as a rule, are not as good yielders as the inferior strains.</P>

      <P>I am making my own speech and not Deputy Corry's nor Deputy Hogan's.  The Minister is asking for £75,000 to run his agricultural policy on sound tillage lines.  I want to put this to the Minister: Has he yet seen to it that under the Faculty of Agriculture there will be established a lectureship or a professorship in agricultural engineering?  He is probably, no doubt, aware that when that statute was passed in 1926, long before the Minister came down from the clouds to think about agriculture, and when he was swearing allegiance to thin air outside, provision was made that at some date in the future there would be established in that faculty a lectureship in agricultural engineering. Of course, if we were to have a policy of grass in this country that lectureship could remain in abeyance, but it is not understandable why it should be left in abeyance while the Minister is going out on a very ambitious tillage policy.  I think it was on Wednesday week last he stated in the House that he was looking forward to growing an increased acreage of wheat to the tune of 750,000 acres. I would like the Minister to think of what the growing of 750,000 extra acres of wheat is going to mean.  He knows enough about agriculture to understand that you cannot grow wheat after wheat for all time; that to grow wheat in an old country like this, where the land has been tilled for the last 1,000 or 2,000 years, you must adopt a system of rotation.  It is not prairie land we are dealing with. In that system of rotation he will probably have to adopt a six years' period, so that the increased area under wheat would be 650,000 acres, which would mean increasing the tillage area in this country by at least 4,000,000 acres.  I would invite the <Col N="753" /> Minister to look at the &ldquo;Census of Industrial Production&rdquo; publication, 1926 and 1929, which his Government has just published.  He will find on page 17 of the Preface, under the heading of Agriculture, the following statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Gross output (of agriculture) is taken to mean the value of the products of the farms which were (a) sold off farms or (b) consumed by persons in farm households together with (e) increases in stock between the beginning and the end of inquiry. In calculating the value of the gross output of agriculture the quantities of output are valued at farmers' prices.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The gross output so defined of agriculture in the year 1929 was estimated £64,865,000, distributed in four main classes as follows:&mdash;1, Consumed by the agricultural community in Saorstát, £21,026,000; 2, consumed or utilised by others in the Saorstát, £11,795,000, and exported.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, friends, Romans and countrymen, lend me your ears, for the market has gone for ever and to seek it, to quote the President, is like a baby crying for the moon.  In 1929, out of a possible agricultural production of £64,865,000, there was exported to the British market agricultural produce to the value of £31,834,000.  That market is gone and the Minister for Agriculture says &ldquo;good luck to it.&rdquo;  It is gone for ever.  The President says it is gone, and that any responsible person in this country who seeks to get that market back would be only like a baby crying for the moon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we have the Minister for Agriculture talking of increasing the area under tillage, while he knows the market to the extent of 50 per cent. of our agricultural production has gone for ever.  What is he going to do if he increases that production?  Leaving out the question of agriculture, let us consider it as a business proposition. Is any man in business who <Col N="754" /> has irretrievably lost 50 per cent. of his business, going to extend his business? Of course, not.  Would any man in the world, outside Bedlam, sacrifice 50 per cent. of his business, turn away 50 per cent. of his customers, although at the time he wanted to increase his business?  Taking 1931, in the statistical abstract we find that the acreage under wheat was 26,740 acres.  The total area under tillage was 1,458,465 acres.  The Minister knows, as we all know, that land under tillage will carry more live stock and more human beings than land in grass.  Now we are going to increase our tillage; it is the purpose of the Minister's scheme to grow 650,000 acres of wheat more.  The implication in that scheme is that we will increase our tillage to 4,000,000 acres, two and a half times what it is at present, and we have sacrificed half our market when we have only one and a half million acres of tillage.  If we had another 1½ million acres, it means five millions under tillage when we have only half the market that we had.  If we take 650,000 acres of wheat yielding 14 barrels to the acre, we get over 8,000,000 barrels.  I think the subsidy the Minister offers for that 8,000,000 barrels of wheat is 6/- per barrel. Where is the Minister to get that money to subsidise that wheat with half our present market gone?  What rotation would pay for the labour of growing that crop?  For fear there would be any danger of its being laid down in grass, the Minister has agreed to a tax on the import of grass seeds. Not 9 per cent. of the grass seed sown is grown in this country.</P>

      <P>The Minister does not see the decimal before the nine.  We have been challenged by Deputy Corry to contradict the statement that the farmer is in a better position now than he was when the previous Government were in office.  I do not know whether the Minister agrees with that or not, but he will say, I am sure, that he agrees with it.  But the farmer, when the previous Government were in office, had only to pay his annuities and rates once.  Now he has to pay both twice <Col N="755" /> to the British Government, and he has to pay half of the annuities to our own Government.  No wonder the discussion upon this, before Christmas, was blocked by putting up a ventriloquist speaker last night upon this motion.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who seems in a lot of things to run in double harness with the Minister for Agriculture, asked a question.  His query was a sufficient reply to Deputy Corry when he said that the farmer is better off under Fianna Fáil Government than he was under a Cumann na nGaedheal Government. The query put a couple of weeks ago by the Minister for Industry and Commerce was in effect this: &ldquo;Where could we get the money to put the farmer in as good a position as he was in under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government?&rdquo;; in other words: &ldquo;If we do not reduce the agricultural grant by £450,000, will any Deputy opposite tell us where we could get that?&rdquo;  While the present Government has been making money out of the sacrifices of the farmer, it has denied the farmer the grants that he was entitled to, and that would have placed him in as good a position as the present Government found him in.  Now, through Deputy Corry, they had the audacity to challenge us here to prove that the farmer is not in as good a position now as he was two years ago.  Will the Minister look up the Trade and Shipping statistics of 1932, and will he convey to the absent Minister for Industry and Commerce where the money could be got to place the farmer in as good a position as they found him?  On page 117 of the Trade and Shipping statistics the Minister will see where the money could be got.  When their predecessors agreed to give relief to agriculture to the extent of £750,000 in 1931, the Minister and his Leader, then out of office, said that was no good&mdash;that the farmer should get £1,000,000.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the increased production that the Minister visualises and ambitions in his speech. I dealt with the restricted market for them, and I was endeavouring to lead to the point that production would become impossible because of the restricted facilities given to agriculture by the present Government, thereby showing the impossibility of the policy the Minister is pursuing, and also the futility of throwing another £75,000 of public money down the sewer.  I just wanted to make a passing reference, if the Ceann Comhairle will bear with me for a moment.  If he sees me out-stepping the line, I will come back again.  To provide that £75,000 certain taxes were imposed.  The Minister will remember the 6d. in the £ on income tax, the ½d. per lb. on sugar and the 4d. per gallon on petrol.  He accused us of bad arithmetic the other day. I do not know whether it is perfect or not, but I will give the Minister some figures, and he can bring his arithmetical qualifications to bear on them.  The Minister's Government, out of those taxes, gave £1,000,000 last year.  I am not now dealing with rates as a rates question. I am dealing with overhead charges on agriculture from a production standpoint. I agree that I am on a very thin line, but I will not break the line if I can help it.  I am sure I will be so closely watched that I will not be allowed to stray very far.  In 1930, the year during which those taxes were imposed, the import of petrol was 32,000,000 gallons.  In 1931 the import <Col N="757" /> of petrol was 45,000,000 gallons, so that the old Government made well out of those taxes, and probably had out of the produce of those taxes about £1,200,000; they probably made half a million pounds over and above what they gave for the relief of rates on agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, whose Government did so well for agriculture last year, had an importation of petrol amounting to nearly 39,000,000 gallons.  If he calculates 4d. a gallon on that he will find that petrol brought in to the Exchequer last year, on that 4d. a gallon tax, £650,000.  He will find that ½d. per lb. on sugar brought in £373,000.  This is a conservative calculation, taking it on the basis of an importation of 80,000 tons.  6d. in the £ on income tax would bring in about another £350,000, so that we have about £1,350,000 brought into the revenue by taxation that was imposed specifically to give agricultural relief in 1931 to the extent of £75,000.  The produce of that taxation very nearly doubled the figure anticipated.  Now the Minister agrees that the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Local Government should reduce the grant this year by £450,000, and thereby increase the overhead charges on agriculture. The Minister for Industry and Commerce thumped the desk opposite and said: &ldquo;Will any Deputy opposite tell us where we will get the money?&rdquo; Yes, out of the taxes that were imposed to raise the money.  That is the place to get it.  Of course, if those poor, unfortunate, rebellious, mandamussed county councils budget for, say, £1,000 to do a certain job of work, and raise that money, they must use it for that purpose.  If not, they must carry it over.  The Government imposed taxation to raise £1,000,000.  I do not know exactly what the produce of that is, but based on the official quantity returns that I have read it should give about 40 per cent. more than the £1,000,000 required.  Yet the Minister for Industry and Commerce had the profound cheek and audacity to come here and say: &ldquo;Where are we to get the money?&rdquo;  I repeat, out of the produce of the taxes imposed to produce that money.  That was the <Col N="758" /> place to get it.  Of course, the squandermania Government took £2,000,000 out of the Exchequer without telling anyone what they were going to do with it, scattered and wasted it over the country in hare-brained schemes of so-called public works.  That was taken out of the fund that should have been allowed to trickle down through the main industry, to put it into a healthy condition.</P>
    <P>Then we have the old paraphernalia, the Department of Agriculture, and committees of agriculture throughout the Twenty-six Counties running schemes for premium boars, premium bulls, premium hens, ducks, geese, premium everything.  But there was no premium for a man who works a farm and makes it pay.  All your schemes fade into thin air unless the man behind the plough or the man milking a cow is paid for his work. They are not.  A sum of £75,000 was devoted to loans for the purchase of heifers.  The greatest joke ever perpetrated on the agricultural community was that same heifer scheme. I did not hear the Minister introducing this Vote dealing with loans for agricultural purposes.  Are we to take it that when we can get money in the City of Dublin in the open market at 3½ per cent., or £3 11s. per cent., to be accurate&mdash;and we got £1,000,000 this week&mdash;it is the intention of the Minister to help agriculture, to help his wheat scheme, so as to carry into effect the slogan, &ldquo;The land for the people and the road for the bullocks,&rdquo; by asking the farmer to pay 3½ per cent. or 3¾ per cent. without any loss to the State, or is it the intention to loan money at 5½ per cent.?  If it was borrowed in the open market it could be had for nearly 2 per cent.  I notice a solitary £5 note in the Estimate for the oat purchase scheme.  Is that what all the conferences the Minister had with merchants has boiled down to?</P>
    <P>There are subscriptions to international and other research organisations. I have no doubt the Minister is aware that the key to tillage, and the key to increased agricultural production is research work, plant breeding and seed raising.  I challenge the Minister to contradict this, that if <Col N="759" /> the foreigners refused to give us seeds we would not have a turnip, a mangel, a beet, a parsnip, or a carrot.  We have to import all these seeds.  I do not see anything here for national research organisation.  Is the Minister going to continue indefinitely having plant breeding here in the inferior position of a lectureship in the Faculty of Agriculture instead of elevating it to a professorship?  I wonder is he aware that when it was decided to have a lectureship instead of a professorship&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope when he mulled a pint the sugar we produced sweetened it well for him.  He would not mull many pints if he made as little profit out of them as we can make out of growing beet.  We are embarking on a scheme that has been heralded with a flourish of trumpets, one that is to produce an extra 80,000 tons of sugar at a cost of £1,600,000 or £1,700,000, while the same quantity of sugar could be bought in Dublin for £800,000.  I hope it will be a success, but I, as a pioneer in the introduction of the growing of sugar beet and the manufacture of sugar from beet in this country, have my doubts, and I am not afraid to express them.  I hope the Minister will explain how he intends to develop agriculture on the lines on which he is proceeding.  Let him not wave his hand and put forward the usual piffle&mdash;&ldquo;This is the sort of mentality we have to deal with; this is the ignorance we are up against.&rdquo; I want the Minister to realise that we are, figuratively speaking, on the spade and on the plough, and we know that it is not paying.

Let him realise that the moment the two-year-old bullock that changed hands in the Dublin cattle market this morning and is now at the lairages or on the boat awaiting shipment to Birkenhead or Glasgow, lands there, £6 has to be paid, and £6 below the ruling price for that beast in the English market.  Even if there is no profit at all, even if the bullock is carried over free and all incidental expenses&mdash;commission, tolls and everything else&mdash;are cut out, the difference between the price in the Dublin market and in Birkenhead is at least £6.  That is the minimum difference in price, and the Minister need not be taking out <i>The Farmer and Stock-Breeder</i> and reading it here.  It is humiliating for a Minister for Agriculture of this State to be going to a British trade journal, <i>The Farmer and Stock-Breeder,</i> and reading it out here as statistical proof of the contention he is trying to make, which he knows well is not true and cannot be true.  If his statement about prices is true, will he explain why Irish farmers bring cattle up to the Dublin market, to-day, for instance, sell them over to British traders, have those cattle shipped over to England and pay £6 apiece on their arrival there?  Why do they do that if there is as good a price, without cutting off the £6 here? The thing is unanswerable.</P>
    <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;Oh, but we give a bounty.&rdquo;  Yes, but for that £6 that is lopped off the Minister or some other Department gives 35/-, and there is a dead loss to the owner of that beast of £4 5/-.  I challenge the Minister to contradict that when he is replying. Leave <i>The Farmer and Stock-Breeder</i> aside.  Let him get away from the British connection, and let him talk of the facts we see here and not as handed out by British trade journalists &mdash;the facts we are up against and amongst which we are living.  Of course, he cannot explain them.  Then, with a loss per beast, he is running off to till another 4,000,000 acres, and he is asking, for the purpose of keeping up the machinery of the Department of Agriculture, another £75,000.  It would be much better for the Minister, while this so-called <Col N="762" /> economic war is on, to scrap the Department of Agriculture instead of asking for more money, and do as Pitt did 130 years ago.  &ldquo;Roll up that map of Europe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it will not be wanted for the next 20 years.&rdquo;  I would advise the Minister to roll up the Department of Agriculture and shut it down, because it will not be wanted until the Minister and his Government are out of office and until sanity once more rules in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Both at the opening and at the end of Deputy Dillon's speech, he referred to the farmer having, since the present Government came into office, become a mendicant and living on public funds.  The key-note of his speech was that that was the position of the farmer to-day and he wound up his speech with a burst of despair &ldquo;Where is the country going to?  Where is our principal industry going to?&rdquo;&mdash;apparently because of this position.  Mendicancy has a particular meaning, I think, and if it were true that the farmer was becoming a mendicant, if this Estimate showed that he was becoming a mendicant, it would be a very serious thing, but unfortunately, Deputy Dillon's speech did not reveal in what way he is becoming a mendicant and I rather think that Deputy Dillon simply confused mendicancy with State interference. Deputy Dillon objects, as, I think, we all instinctively object, to the State interfering either in agriculture or manufacturing industry unless it is absolutely necessary, but it is another thing to call that interference mendicancy.  In the Estimate before us, there is nothing that even suggests the word so far as I can see and I should like to know if Deputy Dillon or any other Deputy thinks that the bounties make the farmer a mendicant.  It is asserted, for one thing, by Deputies opposite that the farmer does not get the bounties.  It would be a queer thing if he was a mendicant because of a grant he did not get.  It was not on his application that the bounties were given.  So far as I remember, they were given, not in response to an application at all, but voluntarily by the Government which, of course, is the farmers' <Col N="763" /> own Government, created by the farmers themselves.  There is nothing in &ldquo;Subscriptions to International and other Research Organisations&rdquo; that would suggest mendicancy; there is nothing in &ldquo;Agricultural Societies and Shows, including Miscellaneous Grants-in-Aid&rdquo; to suggest mendicancy; there is nothing in the Vote for the I.A.O.S. and I do not think that there is anything in &ldquo;Miscellaneous Work,&rdquo;&ldquo;Loans for Agricultural Purposes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Loans for the Purchase of Heifers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was a great boast of the former Government at the elections in June, 1927, that they had established the Agricultural Credit Corporation to provide credit specially for farmers. What are the loans for the purchase of heifers but simply an extension, under the guarantee of the State, of that work to meet a particular position that will only prevail temporarily? The Oats Purchase Scheme could be done by any co-operative society of which a farmer would be a member and if it were, I do not think that he would consider himself a mendicant in taking advantage of it. Why should it be wrong for the State to do what a co-operative society might very well do?  After all, when Deputy Dillon or anybody else accuses the present Government of taking on too much responsibility for agricultural affairs and interfering too much in the farmers' business, they should remember that so strong an individualist as Deputy Hogan, when he was Minister for Agriculture, began this interference. I think, as a matter of fact, that, during the last six months of his office, he introduced protection for more than one article of agricultural production in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As everyone knows, he was responsible for the creamery scheme which was very definitely, not merely protective, but was absolutely prohibitory in its provisions.  If Deputy Dillon were here&mdash;I think he was here this afternoon when we were discussing the Estimate for forestry&mdash;he might recall that Deputy Hogan, the former Minister for Agriculture&mdash;strong individualist <Col N="764" /> as he is, and strongly as he resents State interference, or appears to resent it&mdash;introduced a Forestry Bill containing, probably, the most dictatorial and most arbitrary proposals that any Minister could be responsible for.  He made it an offence for a farmer to cut a tree on his own land, no matter what the circumstances were, no matter what harm the tree was doing, no matter what he required the tree for.  No matter, as I say, what the circumstances were, it was made a serious offence for the farmer to cut such a tree on his own land. I think, even as the Act stands at present, he cannot cut even one tree without the permission of the local sergeant of the Gárdaí.  I think Deputy Dillon must have been talking very largely for the sake of making a speech rather than because he felt there was anything sensible in what he was saying.  This State interference and State planning is, of course, a feature of government in practically every country at the present time.  In my opinion it will be a long while before Ministers here are given the power or take on the responsibilities to farmers that the President of the United States has taken on in recent months.  I think they have a good way to go before they are definitely committed to planning for agriculture to the extent that the Minister for Agriculture in Great Britain confessed he was committed in some of his statements last week.</P>
    <P>I have here a report of a speech in which he makes these remarks:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The difficulties in front of the Ministry of Agriculture are not difficulties of expanding production. The difficulty, as my honourable friend said, is that of planning the trade of this country.  Let him not think that no thoughts whatever are being given to this matter in the Department of Agriculture and in other Departments.  If we were willing to wash our hands of the problem we could not get rid of it because it knocks at our doors in in the morning and comes home with us at night.  Planning of the trade of this country is forced on us by the <Col N="765" /> necessities of the case.  We shall have to come frequently to this House, in the months and years immediately in front of us, to ask for sanction for wide and sweeping changes in the economic structure, changes that are forced on us by the necessity of that economic planning which is one of the major necessities of the life of this and other countries of the world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems very definitely to commit the country, in whose agriculture we have most interest, outside that of our own country.  It seems very definitely to commit the Government there to State control and State planning for that industry.  I think it must appear to every member of the House that, no matter what Government comes into power, it will have to undertake more and more duties to the farmers of the country and more and more duties, as a matter of fact, towards the general population.  To tell the truth, I am sorry that there must be so much State interference, but there seems no way to avoid such control in the difficult circumstances that prevail at the present time.</P>
    <P>I think there would have been a very serious charge against the Government if, in such a state of things as exists at present, they had ignored the possibilities of action on their part in defence of and for the benefit of farmers.  If they did not put the resources of the State in support of the farmers they would have been guilty of a very serious dereliction of duty.  After all, it would seem a strange thing if a State, upon the maintenance of which so much is spent, which is so jealously defended, to which everyone, irrespective of party and position, is expected to be loyal, in which everyone is expected to show pride, were not prepared to put its powers and its resources at the disposal of any section of the community who, through no fault of their own, but through circumstances over which they had no control, were in difficulties.  That would indeed be a very strange thing, a very anomalous position, and I am glad that it did not happen in this country.  Government interference, in <Col N="766" /> my opinion, up to the present, during the past 12 months or two years, has been very largely for the benefit of agriculture.  That is recognised by the great bulk of the farmers of the country, in fact by very many farmers who did not vote for the return of the present Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to intervene in this debate for a very short time. Deputy Moore who has just sat down, referred to the fact that the Government seemed to be taking great care of the farmers, that the Government was doing everything for the farmers, and that, no doubt, the farmers should be well off and should be well pleased with such Government intervention as has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say anything about their being well off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody is agreed that the farmers of the country were never in a more difficult position than they are at the present time.  I shall try to confine myself simply to the Estimate before the House.  I do not want to go into statistics or figures. They are not in my line, and I would not, even if I were able.  The Minister referred to the Estimate for credit loans for farmers.  Why are they necessary?  Why are loans necessary for the farming community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Why were they necessary in 1926?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>They are necessary to-day, and I want to tell the Minister that the greatest trouble which I have as a Deputy is making intervention on behalf of farmers who availed of these loans from the Government.  I put it to the Minister or to Deputy Moore or to any reasonable person just to take the case of the farmer who borrowed, say, £100 from the Agricultural Credit Corporation two or three years ago. What has he got to meet it at the present time?  Take the amount of stock he has.  The farmer's money is always represented in livestock.  When he got the loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation he required that loan probably to buy stock in many cases for his farm.  What is the value <Col N="767" /> of that stock to-day in comparison with what it was three years ago?  It is about 50 per cent. of what it was then. Yet the farmer is expected to pay the principal and interest of that loan.  I tell the Minister and the House that it simply cannot be done.  With that, I leave that aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the oats purchase scheme and to the fact that he had got, I think, 120 merchants to take up the scheme.  I want to tell the Minister that that scheme has been of very little benefit to the people of the country.  I saw one man take £1 in cash for four barrels of oats.  The Minister talks about 9/- a barrel being guaranteed to farmers for oats that would bushel 40lbs.  He knows as well as I do that the oats that is able to bushel 40lbs. is a very small percentage.  Perhaps if it were thoroughly cleaned and went through a very good process it would, but a farmer generally markets his oats as it comes from the mill, probably on the second day after it is threshed. I know farmers in my district and other districts who can only get 7/- a barrel for white oats.  There is no use in telling these people that the Minister's scheme is of any great benefit to the farming community. References have been made to-night to increased tillage and so on which I think were hardly relevant to the debate.  Nevertheless, I should like the Minister to cast his mind back to some years ago when there was a lot more tillage in the country than there is.  We all know that oats is a cereal which is adapted to practically every county in the Free State and outside it.  In the times I mention, before the war, how many hackney horses were there on the streets of Dublin?  How many were there all over the Free State?  All the transport of this country was horse-drawn.  To-day we have practically all motor transport.  You cannot get away from that.  In those days all the traffic of the country, with the exception of the railways, was horse-drawn.  These horses were fed on oats and hay grown on Irish land.  That is not there to-day. It is all motor transport and, <Col N="768" /> therefore, the market is not there for oats anyway, whatever else it may be there for.  There is no use in talking about increased tillage, dehulling oats and mixing one way or the other.  It can only be fed to livestock and the Minister knows that the livestock industry was never in such a position as it is at present.  He knows the reason why just as well as I do and I will not labour the point.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the butter scheme and what had been done.  On a recent occasion I gave the Minister my views in connection with Government policy as regards butter.  No doubt people living in Dublin who have to pay 1/4 a pound for butter think the farmer is getting the advantage of it.  I know suppliers to creameries who are getting from 3¾d. to 4d. per gallon for milk.  It takes 2½ gallons of milk to make a pound of butter.  I shall leave it to Deputy Kelly to make out what the farmer is getting.  It may be a revelation to some people to know that a dairy farmer milking 15 cows has a smaller income than a man working for the county council on the roads with a horse or a jennet.  That may seem very fantastic or far-fetched but it is true.  The farmer is expected then to pay labour and rates and taxes and meet his ordinary expenses out of his dairy.  Dairying in itself is not a paying proposition and it scarcely ever was, except during the war period. What the dairy farmer depended upon was the raising of livestock and selling them.  He sold the calves he bred as yearlings or two year olds and he had some profit out of them.  That was what made dairying profitable and not the dairying itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the pig industry.  I like the note he struck in connection with applying to the British Government for a quota&mdash;that they were very reasonable.  I should like the Minister to do a little more in connection with agricultural products in this country.  He ought to see that the farmers get a square deal which I think they are not getting at present.  We have heard a lot about alternative markets.  I shall not harp very much on that at present.  I was <Col N="769" /> glad, however, to hear the Minister saying that the British were very reasonable, that they gave him the quota he asked for.  If he made a mistake in the compilation of the amount of bacon which we produced probably he cannot be blamed.  There might be over-production.  The pig population is a thing that rises and falls rather quickly.  I would appeal to the Minister to take a greater interest in the farmers.  It is his duty to see that the farmers are paid for their labour, which they certainly are not at present.  As I pointed out, the farmers are supposed to pay back loans, to pay rates and annuities and labour and to keep their household. I tell the Minister and the House that it cannot be done.  The money is not there to do it.  You cannot get money from the farmers because they have not got it at present and nobody should know that better than the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry repeated a statement to-night that he made on former occasions here, that the small farmer with five cows is better off now than he was before the present Government came into office. The agricultural industry is the most important industry in the country, and I have already issued a challenge to the Government to set up a commission to inquire into it.  The Deputy tried to counter that by saying that he would like me to produce balance sheets.  I am in a better position, owing to proximity to Dublin, than the unfortunate farmers down the country. The Deputy also referred to a man who had two acres of wheat.  One would imagine from Deputy Corry's statement that every farmer is able to grow wheat.  Anybody acquainted with my constituency or the poorer parts of Kerry knows that in some of the farms in these counties there is not an acre that would grow wheat.  I challenge the Minister to contradict that statement. Deputy Moore made an attack on Deputy Dilon because he said that the farmers were living on public funds.  In proof of that I shall quote a statement made by Deputy Stephen Flynn at the Leitrim County Council as reported in the <i>Cork Examiner</i><Col N="770" /> to-day.  The Council were considering the question of employment on the roads.  Mr. A. Mooney said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;People who were deserving were refused work on minor relief schemes when they applied, although the Order from the Board of Works was that those home help recipients were to get preference.  The matter would have to be referred to the county surveyor and if not attended to by him then to the Board of Works.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The county surveyor was responsible for the carrying out of the minor relief schemes as they gave him their authority to do so.  The men who are entitled to the work are not being employed.  People with stocked farms and money in the bank are being employed and if that system prevailed the work should be stopped.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is what Mr. Stephen Flynn said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The county surveyor was the sole authority.  The Government started the relief schemes to relieve unemployment and home help recipients, but the farmers say that they should get the work, as they are keeping these poor people all the year.  If they don't get the work they will start a revolution.  They insist on getting the work and say it is for them.  They claim, as a matter of fact, that they are entitled to the work and no other one.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister and Deputies on the Government Benches what is driving those small farmers in Leitrim into starting a revolution if they do not get this employment.  Is not the reason that their means of livelihood has been taken from them?  We have heard a good deal about wheat growing and grain growing.  I myself have some experience of farming and, as I said on a previous occasion, grain growing gives little employment if you have a fine season and the grain stands up.  I had this season 22 or 23 acres of oats and my son cut the whole lot, unaided, with a reaper, binder and tractor.  A farmer with cows has always to keep his employees.  In proof of that, compare the figures for Limerick with those for Wexford.  We have spoken so often on this question <Col N="771" /> that there is nothing for it now but to wait and see.  I venture a prophecy which I want placed on the records of the House&mdash;that this country will go headlong into bankruptcy.  The Minister admitted here that the more tillage we have the more cattle we ought to have.  But what is the good in having tillage when there is no market for the cattle you produce?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear that speech from Deputy O'Leary as he is one of the most consistent interrupters in the House.  I think that it is the first time he made a speech. He made a prophecy&mdash;that the country is going to disaster.  His colleagues have been making that prophecy for the last 18 months.  Bankruptcy was due in 1932.  Then it was to come in September, then at Christmas.  Last Spring, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that we could not go on until the harvest.  The harvest is over and we are still going to disaster.  Deputy O'Leary makes his first speech and wants his prophecy, that we are going to disaster, placed on record.  He has not added very much to what was said on the subject.  Neither has anybody else in this discussion.  Deputy Belton spoke for quite a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered you over and over again, but every time the Deputy gets up he makes these wild statements. I tried to instruct him on a few occasions, but he is evidently unteachable and uninstructable.  In addition to making his old speech, the Deputy tried to work in the speech he had ready for the derating motion.  He said that we were producing 5 per cent. of our grass seed.  We are producing about 90 per cent.  He was just as near the truth in that statement as he was in any statement he ever made. He is about as close to the truth as that, as a rule.  When he referred to wheat, he said that what we wanted <Col N="772" /> were hard wheats.  I told him the other day that we would want some hundreds of thousands of acres of wheat before we would start in on hard wheat.  He did not go back to that statement to-day, so I suppose he is accepting it.  Gradually, we shall get him to understand something about agriculture.  He takes a lot of teaching. The farmers of County Dublin knew that he knew nothing about agriculture. He had to come into a city constituency to get a seat.  Yet, he never speaks here on anything but agriculture.  I think it is a shame to allow these city men to talk on agriculture, with the exception, of course, of Deputy Kelly, who knows something of what he is talking about.  Deputies like Deputy Belton, who pretend to know something about agriculture but do not, should not be allowed to speak on that subject. The place where he should speak is Gloucester Diamond.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon says that in this Estimate we are looking for money to pay salaries, wages and allowances.  He says that, having got the House to agree to the Cuts Bill, we come along and appoint other men and spend the money that was gained by cutting the salaries of existing staffs. Is not that very good policy?  It was considered that we could afford to take a little off the existing salaries.  We spend it in bringing in other men, giving them employment and getting more work done, because five men will do more work than four.  The four civil servants there before were doing their best.  They could not do any more. If we take on an extra man and have five men working, we are getting more work done for the same cost, which, I think, is good policy.

      <P>In spite of Deputy Belton's objection, I shall have to come back to the <i>Farmer and Stock Breeder.</i>  Deputy Belton and Deputy Dillon spoke on several occasions about offals being dear here as a result of our legislation, while they were very cheap <Col N="774" /> in England and across the Border. Yesterday, I brought in the <i>Farmer and Stock Breeder</i> and gave quotations for the English markets.  Deputy Dillon objects to my quoting from the <i>Farmer and Stock Breeder.</i>  It might destroy some of his arguments but, of course, he will use them again. Deputy Dillon said that our cereals plan was a failure, that we had to bolster up the price of oats, barley and other things.  If we had followed on the old course and had no tariffs and no bounties, what would we get for our oats and barley at present? How do the prices under our policy of trying to bolster up the market for oats and barley, instead of importing maize and taking what price the farmer could get, compare with the price the farmer would get if there were no tariffs on produce going into England, no bounties, no economic war&mdash;just free trade and friendly relations between the two countries?  What would the farmer get for his oats and barley going into England in these circumstances? I have here the Mark Lane prices, which are exchange prices and retail prices.  What we would get here in sending across to England would be something less.</P>

      <P>For imported barley, at Mark Lane the price would be 5/- a cwt.  I do not know what we would get here if we were sending it to England instead of finding a market for it in the maize-meal admixture. We would probably get 8/- a barrel instead of the 12/- or 14/- or 15/- that has been got.  If we had free trade, we would get 8/- a barrel.  Ten shillings is what they are paying in Mark Lane.</P>

Deputy Dillon wants to have the British market open to us instead of the cereals plan we have adopted.  I could also quote what the English and Scottish farmers are getting in their markets.  In Aberdeen on Friday last they were getting 4/6 a cwt. for the best white oats and 4/4 for second-best. In Perth they were getting 3/4. That is what we would get if we sent our oats and barley across, and yet that is the course advocated by Deputies opposite.</P>

This is a token Estimate and apparently Deputies opposite do not understand <Col N="776" /> what a token Estimate is.  We put down this Estimate in order to give the House an opportunity of approving or rejecting the scheme.  It is not going to cost anything now.  In the 1934 Estimates the estimated cost will be set out.  If the House agrees with this Estimate, then it means that the Dáil approves of the plan.</P>

      <P>Up to the present it has proved correct in regard to various forecasts.  The Deputy says that we have no idea what this will cost.  We will know in June, if the Deputy is here then.  I hope he will be; I do not wish him any ill.  The Deputy said there was a failure on my part to foresee what would happen in the case of pigs. We forecasted what the production of pigs would be, and up-to-date our forecast has been absolutely correct.  We also forecasted what the home consumption would be, and that also has been absolutely correct.  We forecasted something like 47,000 cwts. of bacon.  We were asked to put an even figure all through for the whole five months.  That is why the necessity arose to store some bacon in the flush periods so as to have it for the slack periods.  Deputy Dillon tries to make out that there was some mistake made. There was no mistake made and, above any other Deputy, Deputy Dillon knows that.  He said he knew all about the bacon industry, as he was connected with a bacon factory.  If he is minding his business in the bacon factory he knows already all that I am now saying, because it was all told to the bacon factories.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said we have crippled the bacon industry.  We have not.  The number of pigs has not gone down, but has been increasing this year all through the country.  In making our Estimate last July or August we were aware of that and we increased our Estimate to allow for the increase in pigs.  At the July meeting the representatives of the bacon factories told us we were asking too high a quota.  We said that we knew the number of pigs was going up, and that was why we asked for the high quota.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon said Denmark is there, waiting at the door.  Of course, Denmark is there, because she built her agriculture up in that way, depending entirely on an export market.  What position is Denmark in now?  Her exports have been cut down drastically in the British and other markets.  She has no way of getting rid of her bacon and her cattle. That is the result of building up your hopes on an external market.  Denmark has not been able to maintain the external market and now she is paying the price.  If we were to do as Deputy Dillon encourages us to do, and tell the farmers that they could get a larger quota and advise them to rear pigs, Britain would soon say: &ldquo;Now we can supply our own market and you can go out.&rdquo;  That is the position that Deputy Dillon would like to see our farmers put into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> The whole world&mdash;and England and those two bacon-importing countries in particular&mdash;have adopted this quota method and are trying to get as quickly as possible into the position of supplying their own market with their own bacon.  It would, therefore, be a foolish thing to rush our farmers now into the production of bacon.  We have estimated for an increased production in the quota for which we have applied, but we should not go into it in a foolish way or in the way that Deputy Dillon has advocated, and then come back in a few years time and say &ldquo;those pigs cannot be marketed.&rdquo;  That is the position at present in Denmark.</P>

I know he has no intention of doing it.  He knows the bacon would come out of cold-storage just as good as any other bacon.  The Deputy knows very well that when cold-stored bacon is put on the counter it is sold as bacon, and gets the same price as bacon which is put on the market after <Col N="779" /> ten days.  That is what is being done. Deputy Dillon talks as a politician, but he will sell bacon as the owner of a bacon factory&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The price of butter in this country is much better than the price in England.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), page 4, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;order,&rdquo; line 9, to the end of the sub-section and substitute the words &ldquo;all fishing gear found on board the sea-fishing boat from which the offence was committed, to be forfeited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in substitution of the words &ldquo;any fishing gear used or attempted to be used in contravention of the by-law, the contravention of which constituted such offence, to be forfeited.&rdquo;  I feel that these words would make it rather difficult for the prosecution when a case would come before the court to prove the actual use or the attempt to use any particular gear.  The substituted amendment of mine is undoubtedly drastic to this extent that these trawling boats carry a big supply of extra gear in their holds to provide against accidents to their trawls.  At the same time if you leave the section as it stands I imagine it would be very difficult for the prosecution to establish the fact that a particular gear <Col N="781" /> had been used or was going to be used.  However, since the Bill is intended to be drastic in its penalties I think the Minister might well consider accepting the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill as it stands follows a general principle, I believe, of these Acts with regard to punishment and penalties.  As a general principle only the gear in use has been forfeited.  For instance it is thought that it would be a great severity on a boat to take the warps that might not be used at the time, because the boat would have to limp back to its own port of origin and be re-geared before doing any fishing at all.  It is a matter for consideration.  But we ought not to depart from the usual procedure in fishing laws in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not pressing the amendment.  I had in mind what the Minister said, that it was objectionable, but it used to be said in the past that after a boat had been fined £100 or so it went back and while still within our limits threw out its nets and recouped itself.  From my experience that is grossly exaggerated.  Fish are not entirely so plentiful in our waters that in one haul when departing from our waters they could recoup themselves to such an extent.  I am not pressing the amendment if the Minister objects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 4, the prohibition of certain methods of trawling, the Minister may remember that I suggested some time ago that he would make prevention effective by getting some sort of agreement that would make charges in our court effective in Great Britain and France.  I draw his attention to this, that there may be some difficulty in issuing summonses or whatever papers may be necessary to support legal procedure outside the jurisdiction of the Saorstát court if the offence is a summary offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will observe that in line 37 it is provided &ldquo;such boat shall be guilty of an offence under this section <Col N="782" /> and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof.&rdquo;  If the Minister thinks this is not the time when he will be able to get the reciprocal arrangement that I suggested to him, then I think it would be well to put into the sub-section, when the Bill goes to the Seanad, a provision expressly giving the Minister power in the case of fishery offences to issue a summons outside the jurisdiction, notwithstanding the fact that the offence is one punishable on summary conviction.  It is a matter that I think the Minister might look into with the Attorney-General.</P>

      <P>The words proposed to be inserted are used in the Sea Fisheries Act of 1883, but somehow they were omitted in this particular Bill.  It is necessary to have those powers.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that I think it would be better if the section were omitted altogether, because the effect of it as it stands is, to my mind, to render this Act of 1909 absolutely useless.  I read yesterday the long Title of that Act.  It is, &ldquo;An Act to prohibit the landing and selling in the United Kingdom of fish caught in prohibited areas of the sea adjoining Scotland and Ireland.&rdquo;  I pointed out that the Act had some effect as a deterrent when poaching boats had their normal market in Britain, but that if you substitute for the United Kingdom, Saorstát Eireann, you render the Act absolutely useless. One can hardly conceive that boats invading our waters would, in ordinary circumstances, be landing their catches here.  It may be that the Minister may <Col N="784" /> think that, as the law stands at the moment, the Act does not apply to the Saorstát.  If that is so, then it is to meet that point of view that I put in my amendment: to keep its application to the United Kingdom, and at the same time to make sure that it applies to fish landed in the Saorstát.  The time may come when, by some arrangement with the British, it would be desirable to have this Act operative. They may agree, for instance, with us that trawlers caught poaching in our territorial waters and landing fish in Great Britain should be made liable to the penalties prescribed for an infringement of the Act.</P>

There seems to be some doubt on the point.  They say that the Act is no longer in force between the two countries and, therefore, it was thought well to put in this particular section.  As Deputy Lynch has said, it is unlikely that any ship, particularly a foreign ship, fishing in the prohibited area, will land fish on our shores.  In such a case the Act is not likely to be effective.  We have thought it right to put in this section. If it is adopted we can seize the captures of any steam trawler, British or otherwise.  While I have no objection to the amendment it does not appear to me to be required.  If the Deputy wishes I will undertake to have the draftsman consulted again, and if he thinks that the amendment will strengthen our hands in any way then we can have it inserted in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few remarks on this Bill as a whole.  I take it that the object of it is to preserve the fish and the fishing around our coast for the benefit of the Saorstát.  Reading the Bill, it seems to me as if it had not got as far as the fish or the fishing.  I do not know how far this may be part and parcel of other Bills that are to come along, but there is no doubt that the trawling industry is passing through a very difficult time.  The present fleet of trawlers in the Saorstát is, I think, down to about seven.  The Government, apparently, have not very fixed ideas, because from time to time they have hired other trawlers to supplement the catches of the Sea Fisheries' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not objecting to that policy, but I would like to urge upon the Government that they should make up their minds as to the direction in which the trawling industry is to progress. Is steam trawling a thing of the past?  Are we coming on to smaller trawling boats and concentrating on smaller boats?  Has a case arisen for getting out a quite different type of trawler, possibly driven by diesel engine?  I suggest that is a question that possibly the Minister cannot answer at the moment.  But a considerable amount of money is being spent upon the preservation of the fish and the Government might very well apply subsidies for the production of a trawler that is likely to be the type to be adopted for the future.  For instance, if the Government could see their way to provide funds for one or two trawlers of an experimental type, quite a lot of useful ground could be covered and possibly yards of talk and discussion saved if it was found that vessels that certain people think <Col N="786" /> are good, in the future were suitable or unsuitable.  I am merely taking this opportunity on this occasion to urge that view upon the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Dockrell is justified in asking as to policy in regard to the future of the fisheries. I thank him for letting me off lightly, by saying that he could not expect to get an answer to his questions right off.  During one stage of this Bill I said that the best thing, and the most important at the moment, was to get powers to deal with foreign trawlers. Having got the powers we shall try to use the equipment and force we have to good effect.  If it is not sufficient, we might have to apply for an increase of the patrol service.  That is only so far as the protection of our fisheries is concerned.  There is another side to the fisheries question, that is development.  The Sea Fisheries' Association was set up for the development of our fisheries and they are a couple of years in being now.  They have made some progress, and we hope that they will improve as time goes on and that we will get our fisheries upon a good foundation.  There is also the matter of marketing.  Up to this, of course, the market was for herrings and mackerel, and that was a foreign market.  Our Irish and Scottish fishermen, depending on foreign markets, are meeting bad times.  The Russians, who took a lot of our herrings, have developed their own fisheries to a great extent.  So have the United States and a good many other countries to which we exported fish.  It appears, for the time being, these markets are gone but against that we are trying to organise our own home market for white fish.  It may go some way to replace the loss we have had on mackerel and herrings in the foreign markets.  Our own fishermen are being driven more to inshore fishing instead of going out for herring and mackerel as they used to do for the foreign markets.  These matters are getting attention and will continue to get attention until we have improved the lot of our fishermen.</P>

I then pointed out to him that the quality and production of the Irish Glass Bottle Company left nothing to be desired.  But there was some difference with people who applied for bulk purchases which they proposed to distribute in small lots.

The paragraph in question, as Deputies are aware, gives a concession in respect of horse-power tax on cars over 16 horse-power where these cars are assembled in this country.

Is not that so?  Has it not been done in certain cases?</P>

I do not say cotton socks in particular, but some of the things mentioned in the Schedule to this Bill.  I forget if cotton socks was one of them.  I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that that is a highly dangerous departure.  I suggest that the Minister ought to be cautioned that he should strictly restrict his activities under that Emergency Bill to the purposes for which he asked those powers, and that he should not go on to use them as a weapon for usurping the most valuable functions of this House &mdash; the imposition of tariffs and the levying of taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is incorrect. Every tariff that is confirmed by this Bill was imposed by the ordinary method.  A financial resolution was introduced here, came into effect on that day, was subsequently discussed on Report within the ten days limit, and is here being confirmed in this Bill.  The point which I think the Deputy is referring to is that, in respect of a minority of the duties covered by the Bill, action had been taken under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act before a resolution was brought to the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But the emergency duty thus imposed was repealed simultaneously with the enactment of the ordinary duty which is now being confirmed by this Bill.  The Deputy is not being asked to strain his conscience in passing this Bill, because it is following a time-honoured procedure.  On the point as to whether we should use the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act for the purpose of affording protection to industry I say there is no question about the wisdom of doing so. I informed the Deputy yesterday that in 1929 our predecessors took precisely similar powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; under a Bill which was limited in its operation for two years, and which expired shortly after the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act came into operation.  If the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act had not been passed, we would not have allowed the other to expire, but there was no sense in having two Acts conferring the same power.  As we have the power under one Act, we are using it for any purposes which are considered justified.  In every case where it is decided that a duty should be a permanent one the ordinary procedure follows, even if the enactment of an ordinary duty by resolution necessitates the cancellation of the existing duty imposed by emergency order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask about the First Schedule, item 3, studs made wholly or mainly of leather.  One <Col N="791" /> cannot think that that was really an item for which an emergency duty had to be passed.  I do not know whether it was one of those particular duties which were passed in that way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>But I should like to bring to the Minister's attention the fact of this continual day to day alteration of the duties, and the effect on the community.  I suppose the shipping companies would take a 12 months period to get clear of the stuff which has piled up, due to misunderstandings about the tariffs and various other matters.  I should like to mention to the Minister that the delays entailed are reacting most unfavourably in a lot of instances.  Though the parts are considered trivial, they hold up other essential parts of a building or machinery, or work in progress.  I should like to ask the Minister to try and regulate those duties to some periods of the year, and to give the ordinary community a breathing space in which to familiarise themselves with what is dutiable and what is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy succeeded in making a very general speech in reference to item 3 on the First Schedule.  It is, of course, desirable in the interests of the trading community, that as few changes as possible in customs duties should be made.  I think that general remark applies more to duties in operation than to new duties.  Obviously you cannot impose a new duty too soon &mdash; I mean before production has commenced, or before the duty is justified &mdash; and it certainly is very undesirable to impose it too late.  The practice is to impose it at exactly the time that seems best suited.  The imposition of duties in that way is much less likely to cause congestion than to delay all the duties until you have a large number of them, and then impose them all at the same time.  When a large number of duties was first imposed under the Budget of 1932, there was congestion in the shipping companies' stores and offices, but there is no evidence that there is congestion now.  The statement made <Col N="792" /> by the Deputy that those companies would take 12 months to clear out the stuff accumulated in their stores is not, in my opinion, correct.  In fact, the information at my disposal is that there is no evidence of any congestion at all arising out of these duties or any other duties at the present time.  The imposition of duties from time to time as the necessity arises is much less likely to cause congestion than any other method which can be suggested.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister assure me that shipping companies are now normal?  I am painfully aware that that is not the case.  If the Minister goes down the quays he will see them piled with empty cases which the shipping companies are unable to ship.  In fact I do not see how he can describe the position as normal when the shipping companies will not take empties for return to the other side. I think if the Minister looks into it he will find that, so far from being normal, the position is most abnormal.</P>

    <P>On the Committee Stage the discussion ranged around the clear intention of the section to limit the compensation which was to be paid to a person partially dependent on the earnings of a deceased workman.  It was suggested to the Minister that the effect was to make it more difficult for people to get compensation, and that, <Col N="796" /> in addition, the amount of compensation would be based on an extremely narrow margin.  It was mentioned that if a son was contributing £1 or 30/- weekly to the family wages fund, where he was living with a father or mother, they would have to go to court to show that the money was, in fact, necessary, and was spent on the necessaries of life for that household. Unless the father or mother were able to convince the court that the money was so spent, and that no portion was saved, it would not be possible for them to obtain compensation in respect of any portion of the income from the son which represented either savings to the family, or expenditure on commodities which could not be described as necessaries of life.  The Attorney-General, on the last occasion, came to the assistance of the Minister and told me particularly that I ought to be quite satisfied with this particular section, as drafted, because he said the Labour Party in Britain had been quite satisfied with this particular section.  I think the Attorney-General made three speeches on it and in each of them he took great pains to tell me that this section represented all that was desirable from the point of view of the British Labour Party and that, as a matter of fact, they apparently did not desire anything better.  Not having the information at my disposal then, I did not contradict the statement of the Attorney-General, but I have since been able to get some information to show what the British Labour Party's view is on it and what the view of the Trade Union Congress in Great Britain is.</P>
    <P>While the Attorney-General would have us believe on the last occasion that the viewpoint of the British Labour Party that this phraseology borrowed by the framers of this Bill from the present Act represented everything that was ideal, I have discovered that, in 1927, the publicity department of the British Trade Union Congress issued a pamphlet described &ldquo;The New Bill for Workmen's Compensation as framed by the General Committee of the Trade Union Congress General Council and Parliamentary <Col N="797" /> Labour Party.&rdquo;  This might well be held to represent the thoughts and views of the British Labour Party on that matter, and these thoughts, on the last occasion, were very acceptable to the Attorney-General.  He was quite willing to take them as reasonable, because he conceived them to be views expressed on sub-section (2), but I can give him evidence now that that is not the view of the Labour Party at all, and when they came to draft their own particular amendment and Workmen's Compensation Bill, they drafted a section very much wider than the section in this particular Bill.  On that occasion they did not stop, as this Bill does, with a reference to the provision of the ordinary necessaries of life, but went on and included amenities, setting out categorically certain specific kinds of amenities that should be included.  If the Attorney-General still has the same high opinion of the British Labour Party as he had on that occasion, I hope that he has induced the Minister to accept this amendment.  The purpose of it is to leave the existing position in respect of workmen's compensation alone, to leave alone the position that has existed for 30 years in which a person, going into the courts and seeking workmen's compensation, knows where he is, because of the judgments which have been recorded on the clause in the 1906 Act.</P>
    <P>Under this section, it seems to me that the father of a deceased son, who previously received a certain weekly income from the son, will, in future, not merely have to go into the court, tell the court his son has lost his life and that he was partially dependent on him, but in addition will have to bring in a family budget and a family balance sheet, and will have to be able to show that in respect of that son he did not save one farthing from his income.  If he should have got, as I said before, 30/- from the son and could show that he spent only 25/- on necessaries, the other 5/- will not be allowed for the purpose of computing his compensation, and it will not be necessary to say that it was spent on getting any kind of delicacies or amenities other than necessaries <Col N="798" /> for the family.  If the Minister wants to clarify the existing position, he should certainly not clarify it against the dependants of an injured workman, and if he cannot see his way to leaving the existing position alone, if he is going to amend the existing position, he should do it in such a way as to include not merely the bare necessaries of life but should also make provision for including amenities which, in my opinion, will not be included in the phraseology in the Bill.  This amendment is a very reasonable one. It merely asks that the amenities of life ought to be regarded as something to which the dependants of a deceased workman were entitled and the specific amenities are not amenities that anybody could reasonably object to. I hope the Minister will see his way to accept this.</P>

      <P>Since this matter was discussed in Committee here, Deputy Norton is not the only one who has been carrying out researches.  I have been carrying out certain researches, too, and I find that, in fact, I am the only person in the House who has taken a consistent line in this matter throughout.  Deputy Norton should not have stopped at 1927.  There was a Bill introduced here in 1929 by Deputy Rice &mdash; a Private Members' Bill &mdash; to amend the Workmen's Compensation Act and that Bill, having got a second reading here, went to a select committee, of which I was a member.  It was only after the debate here that I remembered what had happened there. I had been somewhat confused by the vehement assertion made by Deputy McGilligan, and supported by Deputy Costello, that the inclusion of a sub-section of this kind in any Bill for which they were likely to be responsible had never been decided upon, and I think that Deputy Costello told us that he would have vehemently opposed it, while Deputy McGilligan said that if I had found such a section in a draft Bill in my office when I became Minister, it represented very hasty thought and was in no sense to be regarded as the final and considered opinion of his Government or his Party.  Having left the Dáil after that debate, I knew there <Col N="799" /> was a catch somewhere, and I found the catch when I remembered what had happened at the meetings of the select committee on Deputy Rice's Private Members' Bill, when, on behalf of Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Rice proposed the insertion in that Bill of precisely this section, word for word as it appears in the present draft.  The proposition was carried, and carried unanimously, with the approval of the official representative of the Labour Party present on the committee.  That committee met in 1929 and I must assume either that he had never heard of the British Trade Union Congress Draft Bill in 1927 or that if he had heard of it, he did not agree with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is no good making points of that kind except merely to emphasise that any objection to this section has, so far as I am aware, developed only since the Bill came before the Dáil.  Its inclusion in the Bill, based as it was on the recommendation of our committee, the recommendation of the British Committee and the unanimous support given to it by all Parties in 1929, appears to me to be thoroughly justified.  Since the discussion, however, I have had an exhaustive search made of the various decisions which have been given in Great Britain, arising out of this section.  I referred to the fact that the section was originally copied from an American statute, and I indicated the nature of the interpretation which had been placed on the same phrase in the United States courts.  It is quite clear from the decisions which have been recorded in the British courts that the section has not operated to the detriment of the workman.  It has, in fact, been interpreted as if the words suggested by Deputy Norton were added, with one exception, and I agree that in respect of that exception, there is a case for amendment of the section.  In one of the British judgments it was held that any part of the family expenditure on insurance premiums could not be regarded as expenditure on a necessary of life in <Col N="800" /> respect of which compensation would be payable.</P>
    <P>I gave that matter very considerable thought and I think there is a case for an amendment here.  One can picture the case of a family consisting of a father and a number of sons as well as other members, in which the father as head of the family would have insured himself by taking out a life policy for the purpose of securing that a certain sum would be payable to his dependants on his death, thus providing them against hardship.  His ability to pay the premiums on that policy could conceivably depend upon the contributions given him by his sons.  If one of his sons is killed in an industrial accident, and the contribution is consequently cut off, it might not be possible, or it would not be possible with the same ease, to maintain the premium payments on that policy.  I think there is a case there, that whereas the section might have been interpreted to cover such cases, we must have regard to the fact that in a particular case in Great Britain a decision to the contrary was given.  That being so, I think we should put the matter beyond doubt here by an amendment of the sub-section. I am having that matter considered with a view to producing a suitable amendment and having it inserted in the Bill in the other House.</P>
    <P>I should like it to be clear that the amendment would be designed to secure that the expenses of the family in the payment of premiums on insurance in respect of life policies, whether ordinary life or industrial life, would be regarded as outgoings on the necessaries of life.  The other matters mentioned are old age, sickness and infirmity, and other provisions of a like nature.  There is, of course, a certain provision made by the State against old age, and I doubt very much if it is the practice in any workingclass family to insure against old age. There is compulsory State insurance against sickness and infirmity and in these cases the necessity for insurance does not exist, at least, in so far as the necessity for insurance exists, insurance must take place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Quite.  There I take it the person may pay into a particular society but that society, although in effect carrying out the same functions as an insurance society, would not be classed as such.  Quite obviously the insertion in the Bill of the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; would be taken as meaning a lot more than that because these words would make it possible for a dependant to claim that any provision which he was making for anything was in some sense a provision against old age, infirmity, funeral expenses, and other expenses of a like nature.  I do not think the term &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; is necessary. I think the obvious interpretation of the section, and the interpretation put upon it by the British court, make it quite clear that the term &ldquo;necessaries&rdquo; does not mean those articles of diet or clothing which are to be regarded as the minimum necessary to sustain life.  In fact the wording of the section itself and the various decisions make it quite clear that that interpretation cannot be put upon it. The British court decisions have made it clear that the wording is effective to that end.  I would suggest therefore that the Deputy might consider the withdrawal of his amendment on my assurance that an amendment will be inserted in the Seanad designed to secure that the provision made by the family for insurance will be taken into account when the amount of compensation is being assessed.</P>

      <P>I should like to urge on the Minister when he is considering this amendment that as it stands it is far too wide.  For instance, &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; might be held to cover the case of a workman, with two or three sons in good employment, who owned a motor car which they used partly for pleasure and partly for bringing them in to work.  I can see a whole lot of possibilities opened up under the heading of &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; unless it is considered very carefully. I should like also to point out to the Minister that if a workman is in a position to make these provisions he is certainly in a very favoured position these hard times.</P>

      <P>I disagree with my friend and colleague, Deputy Dockrell. I take the view that if a workman is in receipt of some contribution from his sons or daughters which enables him to get the advantages of so-called amenities and that if as the result of a death these contributions are taken away from him, it is only proper that he should be compensated for the loss of such amenities.  The Minister has changed his front slightly at this stage as compared with what it was on the last stage in respect to this matter, because on the last day he stated that there was no case at all to be made for the amendment down in my name. I support Deputy Norton's amendment here because it really endeavours to effect the same purpose as I endeavoured to effect by my amendment, to leave the position as it has been in this country for 30 years.  The Minister suggests that he is the only consistent person in this matter and he threw out some suggestions about Deputy McGilligan and myself in reference to some draft Bill that had appeared in the various Departments.</P>

It is not a matter that should be decided on a question of consistency or inconsistency, on a question of whether Deputy Rice had a Bill before the Dáil previously, whether Deputy McGilligan approved of a Bill in his office or whether I approved of a draft Bill.  So far as I am concerned, I did not approve of any such thing as a draft Bill.  My practice was, when I was in office, to allow the Department concerned with the instructions for the drafting of a Bill, to have the matter out with the draftsman and when they had fought it out and thought that they had got what they wanted in the Bill, and when the draftsman thought that he had given them what they wanted, it came to me for approval.  Then I started operating but this Bill never reached that stage.  It never got to the stage when I could start operating on it.  That stage was never reached.</P>

      <P>I do not care whether it was in draft or whether it was approved by a commission.  Even if it were, that should not matter.  It should not be necessary in order to make a case for this Bill to say that somebody had been inconsistent.  The case has been made for this amendment, in my opinion an unanswerable case, to leave the position as it has been in this country for 33 years. Everybody knows where they stand in reference to it.  The Minister, in his justification of the provisions of the Bill, is going a slight step further than he went on the last day.  He suggests that decisions on the meaning of the word &ldquo;necessaries&rdquo; in America and elsewhere have not operated against the interests of dependants of workmen. They have not so operated because the judges are doing in reference to the English Acts, the recent English Workmen's Compensation Acts, what they did with the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1906.  In other words, they are legislating by judge-made law in favour of the workman or are giving it a wide interpretation.  If the Minister says that this section is not operating against the interests of the workman because of judicial decisions what he is really saying is, &ldquo;We will trust the judges to decide this in favour of the workman.&rdquo;  He has an opportunity, and the House has an opportunity, of making explicit what we want to put in the Bill as being in the interests of the workman.  This House ought not to leave it to the discretion of the judges to make judge-made law in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The inclusion of insurance premiums does not at all go to meet the case made for this amendment. The Minister says that a certain interpretation was given to the phrase &ldquo;necessaries of life&rdquo; in the American courts and that there is a certain interpretation on that phrase as far as the British courts are concerned. What is the use of an injured workman, or the dependants of a deceased workman, going into court <Col N="804" /> here with an American judgment in one hand and a British judgment in the other hand?  They will have no effect whatever on the judge in influencing him to take the same view. If we want to ensure that &ldquo;necessaries of life&rdquo; will get a reasonable interpretation then, as Deputy Costello suggests, it is better to put in the phraseology so as to ensure that we shall get a reasonable interpretation rather than to trust to the judges to give that reasonable interpretation and hope that they will act in accordance with some American or British precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main Workmen's Compensation Act is the 1906 Act.  It is 27 years ago since that Act was passed.  That Act, for all essential purposes, is the fundamental structure on which workman's compensation in this country has rested for the past 27 years.  It will probably be another 27 years or more before another Act is introduced.  It seems to me to be very desirable at this stage that some definite provision should be made in this Workmen's Compensation Bill, seeing that it is not likely to be amended for another 27 years or more, to safeguard the interests of the workman. I am keenly interested in this matter frankly from the point of view of the workman.  I want to make sure that his dependants will get everything they are reasonably entitled to.  It is because I want to ensure that the workman or his dependants will obtain what is reasonable that I put down the amendment to try to get away from the narrow interpretation which &ldquo;necessaries of life&rdquo; has in the ordinary mind.  The Minister can give no assurance that the judges here will take the same view as the judges in Great Britain or America.  I am willing to withdraw the amendment if the Minister is prepared to agree to the inclusion of &ldquo;necessaries of life and amenities of life&rdquo; without any specific reference to those other things, on the assumption that it can be argued, and probably can be reasonably contended, that &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; will include these things.  It is absolutely imperative that &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; should go in, in order that the workman will not be deprived of the compensation he can <Col N="805" /> get to-day clearly under established judgments, but which he cannot get if the Minister's phrase stands.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Norton is wrong in stating that I made three speeches on this matter on the Committee Stage. I was interrupted by Deputy Norton on three occasions, but I only spoke once.  I do not think that what I did say is substantially contradicted by what Deputy Norton now says.  I merely drew attention to the fact that this section first found its place in the 1923 Act in England and was re-enacted in 1925.  During the time that the Labour Party were in power in England they did not seek to amend the legislation and, at the time the Bills were going through the House of Commons in England, they did not introduce any amendment or oppose the enactment of this section.  The fact that they had drafted a Bill subsequent to that period I confess I was unaware of. However, I do not suppose that matters very much to the question of the discussion here now.  I have heard Deputy Costello, both on the Committee Stage and here now, repeat a statement which I do not think is borne out with regard to this particular section, as far as I have been able to discover.  He seems to suggest that the courts in England have strained the law in favour of the workman.</P>

      <P>I recollect pretty clearly that the Deputy said that on the last day.  He pointed to the fact that the judges in England had always interpreted the law in favour of the workman.  He argued then, and he is arguing now, that we ought to do what the judges might be expected to do, and put in explicitly and clearly what the judges may put in by interpretation and in decided cases.  I have looked at some decisions in England on this particular section.  I find one case decided in 1927.  I do not know whether it was before or after the draft Bill <Col N="806" /> Deputy Norton referred to now.  It seemed from that decision that the House of Lords found no difficulty in construing the section in the British Act.  They referred to it as being absolutely clear.  There was no difficulty whatever about construing it. The words of one of the judges were: &ldquo;&lsquo;Necessaries of life&rsquo; is a common and well-understood expression.  It indicates food, clothing, shelter and the necessary concomitants thereto. But to extend it to such a thing as saving or, what is the same thing, insurance, is in my opinion to do violence to the expression.&rdquo;  There has been, as far as I can discover, no difficulty in interpreting it in England, and I do not think there is any case made for altering the wording in the section when we put it into the Bill here.  How far you are to go is a matter of policy, and I suppose the Minister relies on the argument that this Bill in many ways improves the position of the workman.  The benefits extended by this Bill are far in advance of those extended by previous Acts and, in fact, I am told are more generous than in practically any country in the world. While we may all be anxious to improve the lot of the workman, as I said on the last occasion, the original Act of 1897 seemed merely to entitle the workman's dependants to be compensated for loss which deprived them of the necessaries of life.  The decision which was given in 1900, which gave to the word &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; a different meaning, and which continued down to 1923 in England, was really a straining of the law in favour of the workman. This section, as it stands, does justice as between the employer and employee, and I do not think any case has been made for anything more than the Minister is offering to give, that contributions for insurance should be taken in and included either as a necessary of life or in some other way, and that it should be made clear in the section that they can be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It was generally agreed in the discussion on Committee Stage that there is a gap in the scheme for providing compensation for injured workmen &mdash; a gap which this amendment is designed to fill.  But it is quite clear that the most satisfactory method of dealing with the situation which the Deputy has in mind is by way of international reciprocal arrangement, rather than by way <Col N="809" /> of an amendment to our legislation, such as the Deputy suggests.</P>
      <P>I will ask the Deputy to consider the fact that the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation considered the matter in all detail and, after collecting the observations of the Governments of all countries. The delegates attending the Conference were aware of the laws operating in all countries; they were familiar with the difficulties and the circumstances that should be taken into consideration and unanimously they came to the conclusion that the best method of dealing with the matter with which the Deputy's amendment is designed to deal was that provided in Article 2 of the Convention.  All this is set out in an Appendix to the Report of the inter-Departmental Committee.  Article 2 recommends that it should be left to the countries which were parties to the Convention to arrange with one another to ensure that compensation shall be paid in respect of accidents occurring in a foreign country.  I think it would be most inadvisable, even if it were practicable, for any single country to adopt a system different from that which the Conference representative of all the countries affected recommended as the best system. There is, of course, no reciprocal arrangement at present, but under this Bill we are taking power to enter into such a reciprocal arrangement and it is proposed to exercise that power, in all cases where it is necessary, as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I strongly urge that this matter should be left to be dealt with in that way as it seems to be altogether the most satisfactory way.  The Deputy by his amendment undoubtedly does attempt to deal with the situation, but in making that attempt he creates a number of other difficulties which would not arise if the method of reciprocal arrangement were adopted.</P>

      <P>I am clearly and strongly of the opinion that the circumstances which the amendment endeavours to cover require no international arrangements whatever.  I want to know where does the necessity for an international arrangement arise <Col N="810" /> in a case in which an agricultural labourer is employed on a farm, portion of which is in the Irish Free State and portion in Northern Ireland.  Let us say that the agricultural labourer lives with his employer in the Irish Free State.  If he meets with an accident in one field he is entitled to get compensation, while if he meets with the accident in another field over the Border, a matter of a few yards away, the Minister suggests that such a situation will require an international arrangement in order that the man may be enabled to sue his employer with whom he is living in the Free State.  It seems to be perfect nonsense to suggest that.</P>

      <P>The Northern legislature can give a workman power to seek compensation just as we can give our workman power, without any international convention.  So far as the British Parliament is concerned, take the case of a rich man travelling with his valet on the Continent.  Suppose the valet meets with an accident arising in the course of his employment in the South of France.  It is quite competent for the British Parliament to legislate so that the servant, if he meets with an accident, is entitled to sue his master in the British courts. That requires no international arrangement nor does the kind of transaction I envisage come within the scope of an international arrangement.  An international arrangement has no relation whatever to that set of circumstances. Unless this amendment is accepted, or some amendment like it, we will have this condition of affairs existing until there is an international arrangement with Great Britain or Northern Ireland, whenever such can be effected &mdash; Tibb's Eve probably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Say there is a chauffeur driving a motor car from County Monaghan to County Donegal.  The shortest way is through Northern Ireland &mdash; it is an hour's run in a car.  If the chauffeur meets with an accident on the bridge at Strabane he has no right of action <Col N="811" /> against his employer, no compensation; but if he meets with an accident in Lifford he is entitled to get compensation. To suggest that it requires an international arrangement to provide that in such circumstances an Irish workman living in Ireland cannot bring proceedings for compensation against his Irish employer, who lives in the Free State, is somewhat absurd.</P>

      <P>Because there is no satisfactory way of meeting the situation by amending the law of this country.  A general conference of all countries was held and a very definite declaration was given and embodied in a convention which we have ratified. There is the fact that the Inter-Departmental Committee recommended that the matter should be dealt with by reciprocal arrangement.  There was a recommendation made by Mr. Justice Hanna, whom Deputies have admitted is an authority on this law.  There are numerous cases that could arise and that require international action. There are cases where the interests of our citizens are definitely involved.  If, for instance, a Northern employer goes to Sligo, employs workmen, and one of the workmen is injured, the Northern employer can go back to Northern Ireland, and it may not be possible for the Sligo workman who has been injured to get compensation from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A variety of cases can arise which can only be effectively dealt with by reciprocal arrangements.  My point is <Col N="812" /> that reciprocal arrangements are essential.  It is the only method of dealing with anomalies and, obviously, it is the best method.  It is the method recommended by Mr. Justice Hanna, it is the method recommended by the Committee set up to consider workmen's compensation, and it is the method recommended by authorities in other countries.  That is the method which we are empowering ourselves to adopt by this Bill.  In fact, the case for urgency is not such as has been conveyed by the Deputy here, because there is a working arrangement at present between insurance companies by which compensation to Saorstát employees injured in Northern Ireland can be paid.  The fact that that working arangement is there is, in itself, an important factor to be taken into consideration.  The consequence is, therefore, that the number of cases where failure to obtain compensation is likely to arise is much fewer than might be assumed to be the case.</P>
    <P>We are not responsible for the fact that there has been a delay in making these reciprocal arrangements.  We are not responsible for the fact that it is only in 1933 a Workmen's Compensation Bill is before the Dáil to implement the report brought in by a Committee set up in 1926.  When the Bill is passed by the Oireachtas we will try to get reciprocal arrangements not only with the countries mentioned by the Deputy, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but with all countries.  The Deputy has been thinking only of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  There is some doubt as to whether the enactment of this amendment would enable an injured workman to get workmen's compensation twice if the accident took place in Great Britain.  The balance of opinion seems to be that he could not get workmen's compensation twice. There are, however, other countries involved, and if the amendment were passed it is possible that in a number of these countries the employer could be made pay twice for the same injury. Nobody wants that situation to arise, and it is precisely because there are all these difficulties in the case that it is obvious that this matter has to be dealt with in the manner recommended <Col N="813" /> by Mr. Justice Hanna, by the Committee set up to inquire into the matter and by every expert body that has considered it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go over the ground that I have already gone over on the Committee Stage, but I cannot allow some of the statements of the Minister to pass unchallenged. It is news to me that there is a working arrangement between the insurance companies by which there will be paid to the dependants of an injured or deceased workman compensation in respect of an accident arising in Northern Ireland or in England.  The only case I know of that has come up in this country in the last 12 or 18 months was a case in which I was engaged myself on behalf of the employee.  That case was fought by the insurance company and they raised this very point that the injury occurred outside the Free State.  That case is at present under appeal.  That is the only case that has occurred in the last 12 or 18 months.  The insurance companies took up the point that it occurred outside the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that the working arrangements are made by insurance companies known as tariff companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pretty sure that this was a tariff company.  It was a very big British company.  However, that is only a side issue.  I want to press on the Minister this fact that he has not appreciated that the necessity for reciprocal arrangement between this country and Great Britain or Northern Ireland or any foreign company arises out of one fact &mdash; the desirability and the necessity for having machinery to make effective the award of compensation.  That is the only necessity for having an international arrangement.  The cases that I have put to this House and that I have envisaged in my amendment are cases in which there is no necessity for international arrangement, if there were effective machinery to give effect to the judgments of the courts.  Take the case where the workman is living in the Free State and the employer is living in the Free State.  The service of any documents can be effected under <Col N="814" /> the rules of court under the law of the Free State, and if a judgment is given, that judgment can be given effect to in the ordinary process by the courts of law in the Free State.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a Northern Ireland employer coming to Sligo and employing a workman there as the reason why it might be necessary to have an international arrangement with Northern Ireland, as you have no machinery at present in existence by which you can serve that man with a process to enable him to be brought before the courts.  That is in the first case and in the second case you have no machinery to give effect to a decree of the courts if a decree is obtained. In such cases arrangements with Northern Ireland are necessary, but cases that require no international arrangement and which if international arrangements are made will not come within the scope of this arrangement are cases in which the workman and the employer are living in the Free State and the accident takes place outside the Free State.  There is no necessity for reciprocal arrangements in that case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the contract of service were made in Northern Ireland, a workman injured in Northern Ireland has an action against the employer, and if the employer has assets there, these assets can be distrained, and if that is done here again, and the man gets compensation twice, are we acting fairly to the employer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say not, and the amendment I put down will cover that.  There should be no double right of action.  What I want to impress on the Minister is that you are dealing with a purely domestic matter where a contract of service is made in the Free State between an employer living in the Free State, and a workman living in the Free State, the only element of extra territoriality in the entire transaction consists of the fact that the accident takes place outside our jurisdiction. Everything else is within our jurisdiction and to state that in such cases an international arrangement is necessary is, to my mind, stating a thing that I cannot understand.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the arguments of the Minister and I really fail to understand his objection to the amendment.  He mentioned the necessity for an international agreement and he quotes Mr. Justice Hanna and the Workmen's Compensation Committee in support of his objection.  Will we not have precisely the same result as regards Workmen's Compensation if we wait for an international agreement?  I fail to understand why workmen who are employed under contract in this country but who are outside the jurisdiction of the Free State should not be protected in regard to injuries arising outside the Free State.  I think in the case to which Deputy Costello referred about an employee in Liverpool meeting with an injury there in the course of his employment and who is the employee of a man living in this country that he should be entitled to recover compensation in this country.  Why should he not be entitled because his employer raises the point that the accident occurred outside the jurisdiction of the Saorstát courts?  I think that the number of cases where accidents may occur outside of Great Britain or Northern Ireland to a person who has no contract with an employer here will be negligible.  I would urge on the Government that it is their duty to protect our own nationals.  I cannot see why the Minister must wait for an international convention to enable him to say why a workman here who in the course of his employment meets with an accident in Northern Ireland or Great Britain should not be compensated as a workman in this country.  I think the Minister ought to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether he anticipates that any difficulties will arise in connection with the setting up of machinery for making this reciprocal arrangement as between Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State.  These are the countries that will be chiefly affected.  I can see that there is a strong case for doing something in this Bill for meeting that sort of a semi-domestic problem around the <Col N="816" /> Border, a case for doing something in respect to a certain amount of interchangeability between employment here and employment in Great Britain. I can see also that the matter will not be dealt with fully by Deputy Costello's amendment.  In many respects the Convention which was ratified by the Free State some five or six years ago will provide machinery for enabling all those international matters to be dealt with in a much more comprehensive way, but it may take quite a considerable time to bring that about.  As a matter of fact it may be impossible to do much in respect to some countries, unless there is a certain amount of interchangeability. Perhaps the Minister would examine the matter before the Bill goes to the Seanad, and see if it would be possible to get the Convention arrangement into working order so far as Great Britain and Northern Ireland are concerned, and if no abnormal delay seems likely to arise perhaps he would reconsider the question in relation to both these Administrations.</P>

A number of suggestions are made in the Report of the Committee. It embodies what was conveyed to it by Mr. Justice Hanna, and gives an indication of the type of matters which would naturally form the basis of such an arrangement.

There are certain circumstances in which a workman will not get compensation for an accident.  That is a matter for reciprocal arrangement.  I do not anticipate that there will be any difficulty about that because obviously it would be more to the interest of Great Britain and Northern Ireland than it would be to us that such an arrangement should be made.</P>

      <P>I suggest for the Minister's consideration that even if my amendment is too wide, at least a case has been made which he might consider should be met on this Bill.  The case which I have suggested to him will not form the subject matter of any article or any agreement in an International Convention.  If the Minister could see his way to make specific provision in this Bill for a state of affairs where an accident occurs outside the jurisdiction of this State to an Irish Free State workman, living in the Irish Free State and employed under a contract of service made in the Irish Free State with an employer living in the Irish Free State, then I suggest to him that state of facts could be very easily covered by a simple amendment.  I suggest to him that state of facts could not be envisaged as coming within the scope of any international arrangement.  It does not require to come within the scope of any international arrangement. A very simple amendment would meet that state of facts.  I think the very least the Minister can do is to provide in the Bill for a workman meeting with an accident in circumstances such as I have outlined.  This is a matter on which I personally feel very strongly.  Possibly the amendment is too wide.  I put it down in very wide terms in order to draw the attention of the House, and of the Minister in particular to the problems that have to be met.  I would be quite satisfied if, in this Bill, provision could be made for what I say would not under any circumstances form the subject of an international agreement.</P>

      <P>In page 11 to delete Section 24 and substitute the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this section if a workman, who has so far recovered from the injury as to be fit for employment of a certain kind, has failed to obtain employment and it appears to the court either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that, having regard to all the circumstances, it is probable that the workman would, but for the continuing effects of the injury, be able to obtain work in the same grade in the same class of employment as before the accident; or</P>
      <P>(b)  that his failure to obtain employment is a consequence, whether wholly or mainly, of the injury,</P>
      <P>the court shall order that the workman's incapacity shall be treated as total incapacity resulting from the injury for such period, and subject to such conditions, as may be provided by the order, without prejudice, however, to the right of review conferred by this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  No order shall be made under this section if it appears to the court that the workman has not taken all reasonable steps to obtain employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Every order under this section shall be made subject to the condition that it shall cease to be in <Col N="821" /> force if the workman receives unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>(4)  An order under this section may be made notwithstanding that any order or orders under this section has or have been previously made in relation to the same workman in respect of the same injury.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Dillon wishes to press his amendment No. 15 he can do so.  I do not think he will, because the point he wishes to make is covered by sub-section (4) of the proposed new section.  The purpose of Section 24 is obvious.  It is to insure that where a workman who is drawing benefit recovers from his injuries, and is capable of performing light work, but is unable to obtain that work, and his failure to obtain it is attributable to his injuries, the court has power to make an order entitling him to receive compensation as if totally incapacitated. That is the object of the section.  A similar section was inserted in the British legislation in 1923 but some time ago a decision was given in the House of Lords as to the interpretation of that section which completely nullified its effect and made it inoperative.  The decision became a matter of considerable controversy. Subsequently in Great Britain an attempt was made to find a form of words to get rid of the House of Lords' decision, and, at the same time, to provide against the obvious danger that would arise from the operation of a section like that.  They brought in a form of words similar to those that we propose to insert into this Bill.  I do not know whether they are satisfactory or not.  This part of the Bill has given more trouble than any other part.  No attempt we could make here could produce a better form of words.  It became a matter of trial and error.  That was the form adopted in Great Britain.  We have profited by their experiences and so we propose to insert a section similar to the British section.  It could be that we might take the risk of leaving Section 24 of the Bill as it stands and leaving our courts to give an interpretation. I do not think we should take that risk, having regard to the fact that <Col N="822" /> different interpretations were given in Great Britain, although there were a number of authorities held that it was a wrong decision.  I am satisfied that the best course to take was to change our legislation so as to make the law correspond in this respect to the latest attempt made a short time ago in Great Britain.  We have a different sub-section (4) to meet a point.  It does not exist in the British Act.  It is to meet a point raised in the course of the discussion on the initiative of Deputy Dillon.  It is to ensure where a workman got an order entitling him to full compensation, and becomes entitled to insurance benefit, or gets work, the order in such event becomes automatically inoperative. If he ceases to get the benefit or loses work then the workman can again apply to the court to be given full compensation if he satisfies the court as to paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (1).</P>

One of the circumstances that would prevent his getting full compensation is the circumstance that he is drawing full unemployment benefit.  Take a workman who earned £2 a week.  If he gets partial compensation, plus unemployment insurance benefit, and additional benefit because of his wife and children, then, between them, he gets more than he got before the accident.  So there is no case to give him full compensation and benefit at the same time.  The fact that he is getting benefit or has got work is a good case for giving him only the partial compensation to which he is statutorily entitled.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Minister is taking a case which would show that a man would get greater advantages with partial compensation or full compensation plus unemployment benefit.  Are there not intermediate cases in which that would not occur?  What is difficult to understand is that a man who pays his contribution towards unemployment insurance continues to pay while drawing his unemployment benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>For what?  If a man is insured he ought to be entitled to get the benefit of that insurance.  That case is altogether different from the other one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So it is.  If a man sustains an injury and is totally incapacitated he gets compensation on the basis of 75 per cent. of his preaccident earnings, but if he recovers sufficiently to be able to undertake light work and secures such work, then while he is at this light work he gets compensation on the basis of 75 per cent. or 80 per cent. of the difference between what he earned before and what he earned after the accident.  If he loses that work he becomes entitled to Insurance benefit.  But the case that is covered by the section is that of a man who, although recovered, is unable to obtain light work, and is unable to obtain that work because of his injuries.  He can go to court and get full compensation. If he gets work that full compensation ceases to be payable and partial compensation is payable.  And as I have said it is really in the interest of the worker that that should be so. The difference between partial compensation and full compensation is <Col N="824" /> in all cases likely to be much less than the amount of unemployment insurance benefit, to which a worker would be entitled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 12, before Section 25, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a workman sustains permanent disfigurement from injury by accident occurring in connection with his employment the court shall have such power to award such workman such lump sum as it thinks fit. The lump sum awarded under this section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other payment to which the workman may be entitled under this Act, but such sum as may be awarded for permanent disfigurement shall in no case exceed £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to make it possible for an injured workman who sustains permanent disfigurement from injury arising out of or in connection with his employment to obtain compensation in respect of that disfigurement.  The Bill as drafted makes no provision whatever for compensation in a case like that. Take for instance a shop assistant. A girl shop assistant may, in the course of her duties, be on a ladder taking down goods or boxes off a shelf; she may fall from the ladder and may suffer such injury as to cause permanent facial disfigurement. The girl may recover from the injury in, say, three weeks or a month. During that period she will get compensation under this Bill at the maximum of 30/- per week.  At the end of the four weeks she is fit to resume duty, but if she suffers any permanent facial disfigurement arising out of the accident that permanent facial disfigurement would not operate to entitle the girl to a continuance of workmen's compensation.  A person would be entitled to compensation so long as he was unable to carry out <Col N="825" /> his work, but a person might be permanently disfigured facially and be quite capable of carrying out his work. Because of the fact that he was capable of carrying out his work he would be entitled to no compensation whatever for permanent facial disfigurement. If you take an assistant in a shop, facial disfigurement may be a considerable barrier to that person securing employment at that particular occupation.  If a commercial traveller meets with an accident, and arising out of the accident sustains permanent facial disfigurement, he may find it quite difficult to secure employment as a commercial traveller again.  His disfigurement may not commend itself to the employer, who may think that he requires a man of a different kind to travel for his goods. I would suggest to the Minister, therefore, that he ought to make provision in the Bill for permanent disfigurement. I have in mind mainly facial disfigurement. I suggest that it should be possible to recover compensation for that kind of disfigurement, because of the fact that it may result in the person not merely finding it very difficult to secure employment after meeting with the accident but in many cases may result in his finding it utterly impossible to obtain employment in the particular industry in which he was formerly employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workmen's Compensation code is designed to provide compensation for workers who lose their lives, or have their earning power reduced by industrial accidents. If the nature of the injury is facial disfigurement, the worker is fully entitled to compensation if he can show that his earning power has been ended or reduced by that injury.  The mere fact that the person may be less satisfied with life, or something like that, does not entitle him to compensation under this Bill.  If the earning power is lessened the person becomes fully entitled to compensation. It is not claimed that the amount payable is full compensation for the injuries received.  In that connection there is an attempt made to hold the balance as between the employer and the worker.  We should <Col N="826" /> bear in mind that we are making the employer liable &mdash; and liable in all circumstances. I mean that the existing law provides for making the employer liable.  Even if the worker is injured while doing something which the employer ordered him not to do, even if the worker is injured while doing something contrary to the law but doing it in the course of his employment, even if the worker is injured while doing something in defiance of every regulation made by the State and by his employer, nevertheless the employer is liable to pay compensation.  Because of that, because the onus to pay compensation is put on the employer and the worker is assured compensation no matter what the circumstances, provided the injury arose in or out of the course of his employment, the code in this country does not provide for full compensation for the injuries. The compensation paid is an attempt to meet the loss of earning power which results.  It covers all cases, even cases of facial disfigurement, if&mdash;and only if &mdash; the loss of earning power is there.  In so far as Deputy Norton stressed the point that in particular trades facial disfigurement might mean loss of earning power, my answer is that that is met by the Bill at the present time, in so far as the Circuit Court Judge would, no doubt, take into account the nature of the trade and the qualifications of the worker to earn a livelihood, having regard to the disfigurement.  If he is satisfied that the disfigurement is liable to cause a lessening of the earning power then compensation is payable.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister suggesting, for example, that if a man injured his finger in scutching flax, and the finger as a result is disfigured, but physically efficient, the judge would take that into account in awarding compensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  The judge will take into account any lessening in earning power.  If that person was, say, a worker in metals, or a worker in some other skilled occupation which would require the use of five fingers in each hand, undoubtedly a reduction <Col N="827" /> in earning power would result, in which case compensation would be paid.  Compensation is not payable for disfigurement, unless such disfigurement, having regard to the nature of the occupation which the person was following, definitely resulted in less earning power.</P>

      <P>I think that, although Deputy Norton did not mention it when he cited the case of a female assistant in a shop who received facial disfigurement, he must have had the matrimonial market in view, because certainly the case is covered under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  Compensation is awardable for obvious disfigurement which reduces the chances of getting work; for example, the removal of an eye, whether its sight had been previously impaired (Martin v. Barnell, 1910) or whether it was previously but not apparently a blind eye; (Ball v. Hunt, 1912), when Lord Loreburn said: &ldquo;There is incapacity for work when a man has a physical defect which makes his labour unsaleable in any market reasonably accessible to him, and there is partial incapacity for work when such a defect makes his labour unsaleable for less than it would otherwise fetch.&rdquo;  The amendment as proposed introduces common law.  Who is going to decide what is disfigurement?  If a man lost the top of his finger or got a scar on his hand or face is that disfigurement? I think that the case is perfectly covered under the present law.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will remember that when this amendment was before the House on the Committee Stage I indicated agreement with it, more or less, and I suggested that if he withdrew it I might produce one of the same kind at this stage.  When I went into the matter I found that it would be most inadvisable to do so. The difficulty I saw was that the employer would have no effective means of knowing whether all the persons entitled to compensation as dependants were, in fact, associated with the agreement presented to him. This section only applies to cases where there are dependants.  Two or three people might come along saying that they were dependants of a deceased workman and that they had agreed amongst themselves on the compensation to be awarded.  They might be doing that fraudulently, by leaving out other persons with claims as good as theirs.  The employer would have no means of checking such an agreement, and consequently, I think it much better to leave the Bill as it is, requiring the agreement to come before the court.  The court has power to inquire into all the circumstances and if it passes an agreement the employer is secured.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 21, to delete Section 55 and substitute a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every redemption agreement, commutation agreement, and agreement by way of compromise shall be submitted to the court for approval before registration, and where it appears to the court that the lump sum is inadequate or that for any other reason that seems sufficient the agreement should not be registered, the court may make an order directing that such agreement shall not be registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be in the recollection of the Minister that I had an amendment in almost similar terms on the Committee Stage, and that acceptance of it was to be considered before this stage. This amendment is not in identical terms, for this reason, that the amendment accepted by the House on the Committee Stage was the Minister's amendment.  The Minister was anxious that his amendment would be accepted for the reason that he had in it the words &ldquo;for any reason which seems to him sufficient.&rdquo;  That is to say, that the court or registrar would reject an agreement not merely on the ground of the inadequacy of the sum but for other reasons.  I agree with the Minister that it is desirable to have that made plain in the section and I have embodied it in the amendment. The main principle of my amendment is that all these cases of redemption agreements and commutation agreements should come before the court because they are agreements finally determining a workman's rights.  As it is the most important event in his life after the man meets with an accident I think determination whether an agreement should be accepted or not should be a judicial act, and should not merely pass through the office under the supervision of the registrar. This is such an important matter for a workman that it should go before the judge instead of going through the <Col N="831" /> office as a matter of registration. There is a very strong reason why a different procedure should be adopted in England, where there are an enormous number of cases to be dealt with. In this country the numbers are very small and should go before a judge for sanction.  I should like to have particular attention directed to the adequacy or otherwise of the lump sum, and to have the words &ldquo;any other reason that seems sufficient&rdquo; determined by the judge.  That would not put any further burden upon the circuit judges.  It will result quite probably in a workman getting a fairer deal when he comes to have a redemption agreement or a commutation agreement dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not agree with the Deputy.  We must bear in mind the subject matter.  A number of people would argue that we should not be spoon-feeding people, and that if a workman enters into an agreement it is his job to see that he enters into one that is fair to himself. It has been suggested that workmen are occasionally tricked into agreements that are detrimental to their interests, and that consequently it is desirable to devise some means to ensure that a third party would come in and have regard to the nature of the agreement.  The Bill provides that the court registrar will be that party. He is given this power.  If an agreement comes before the registrar, if there is any case for reconsideration, he can refer it to the circuit judge. The proposal of the Deputy is that all agreements should automatically go before the judge, whether there was anything wrong with them or not, and whether the workman had got the best or the worst of the bargain.  That would be undesirable and would mean unnecessary litigation, certain delays, and costs which we should try to avoid. Deputy Rice perhaps would have a different opinion.</P>

      <P>I agree with the argument put forward by Deputy Rice and I think he has put up an unanswerable case.  I am surprised at the attitude the Minister has taken up.  No matter what he thinks, it is common knowledge that workers have been tricked in the past by insurance companies in agreements about compensation.  Prior to a final settlement being made, there is always a stoppage of the weekly alimony for, perhaps, three or four weeks and in some cases a couple of months, and when these people are offered £10 or £20 for a settlement they think it a fabulous sum.  They have possibly been on the verge of starvation in the meantime and without any advice from anybody who ought to know what the position should be, they accept that £10 or £20.  I submit that Deputy Rice's argument in this connection is perfectly right and that any agreement should be ratified by the Circuit Court judge.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides for a check on the agreement.  It provides for a cheap check on the agreement. It provides for a check which is not going to involve the workman in legal costs and is not going to involve him in delay.  Deputy Rice says: &ldquo;Bring the agreement before the Circuit Court judge.&rdquo;  That means litigation and it means cost and delay.  We say: &ldquo;Let the registrar do that work and let him do it without cost to the workman.&rdquo; It will be done much more expeditiously than would be the case under the amendment.  The check is there and <Col N="833" /> from the point of view of the workman it is obviously much more satisfactory that he should get that check provided without cost and without delay.</P>

Whether the agreement is brought into the registrar's office or put into the judge's list cannot make any difference.  The only cost in either event is the attendance of a solicitor.  That is all the cost there is in it.  It does not put any cost on the workman.  I could say a great deal more on this subject than I have said on it up to the present moment.  There are people employed by insurance companies whose business it is to go around to workmen and effect compromise agreements and I do not want to see those agreements put through without the protection of having a judge inspect them and seeing whether they are right or wrong.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to try to preserve the existing maximum of compensation at 35/- per week.  The Bill reduces the maximum from 35/- per week and fixes it at 30/- per week. The Minister in the course of the discussion on the Bill tried to defend many things on the grounds that they were recommended to him by the Committee.  The Committee, in this particular instance, recommended the continuance of the existing maximum of 35/- per week and in this particular respect the Minister has thrown overboard completely the recommendation of the Committee in respect to the maximum compensation.  The Minister tried to defend his action in this matter on the Committee Stage by saying that when the Committee recommended the continuance of the 35/- per week maximum, they did so in 1926 and the Minister stated that the cost of living was higher then than it is now and that probably if they were dealing with the matter now they would not have recommended the <Col N="837" /> continuance of the maximum at that figure.  While saying that in one breath, the Minister has also pointed out that he is not responsible for the shameful delay in introducing this Bill and putting into operation the recommendations of the Committee since 1926.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot have it both ways.  He should not reduce the maximum compensation from 35/- or he is not sorry that this Act was not introduced in 1926.  If it were introduced in 1926, the maximum of 35/- would have been inserted in the Bill in all likelihood because this reduction could not be justified then on the grounds that the cost-of-living index figure had fallen.  That maximum of 35/-, if it had been put into the Bill in 1926 or 1927, would be in operation to-day and would presumably continue in operation, taking no notice of fluctuations in the cost-of-living index figure from time to time.  I think that that case of the Minister is a particularly weak one because whatever figure had been put into the Bill would have taken no notice of the tendency of the cost-of-living figure any more than the figures which the Minister is now putting into the Bill will take any notice of movements in the cost of living once the Bill is passed.  The argument of the movement in the cost of living is a particularly thin one to use in support of his attitude.</P>
    <P>When speaking earlier this evening the Minister stated that he had discovered as a result of some researches which he had made that he was the one consistent member of the House. I fear I cannot congratulate him on having preserved that consistency.  I do not think the Minister is nearly so consistent as he imagines.  In 1929 when Deputy Rice's Bill was referred to a Committee, the Minister as a member of that Committee signed and presumably read the Report of the Committee.  The Minister knows he was on that Committee with Deputy Ruttledge as he was then.  During the discussion on Deputy Rice's Bill in Committee, Deputy Good moved an amendment to reduce the maximum compensation from 35/- to 30/-.  That amendment was defeated and defeated <Col N="838" /> with the support of the then Deputy Lemass and the then Deputy Ruttledge. All I want the Minister to do is to maintain consistency with his 1929 attitude.</P>

      <P>If the Minister thought in 1929 that a maximum of 35/- was desirable, and if he deplores that there was any delay in putting the Bill into operation, I can see no reason why the Minister cannot see his way to provide the same amount of compensation now as was provided in Deputy Rice's Bill when it was being discussed in Committee of the House.  I think there is a strong case for preserving the maximum at 35/-.  It is not a princely sum. Many people who would be compelled to exist on that weekly compensation would be people who would each already have lost a couple of pounds a week as a result of their enforced idleness due to their meeting with accidents in the course of their employment. The Minister may say that in respect to people who were receiving £1 a week or less that he is giving them something more than is given in Britain.  That is true, but he is not giving them any more than the Report recommended.  He is scaling down the compensation for people who are in receipt of over £1 per week.</P>

      <P>If the Minister looks at the Bill he will find that whereas these people get at present seven-eighths of their weekly wages, subject to a maximum of 35/- per week, the Minister is not providing for a payment of seven-eighths, but for a payment of 75 per cent., which is less than seven-eighths. Then he is cutting down the maximum from 35/- to 30/-.  I cannot understand in whose interests that is being done.  It is not being done in the interests of the workman who has earned more than £1 per week.  It cannot be done in the interests of the employers, because the representatives of the employers signed the Report in 1926 agreeing to pay 35/- per week. They knew then that that 35/-, if inserted in a Bill and passed through the Dáil as it should have been within <Col N="839" /> the next year or two, would have been in operation during 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932 and 1933.  The representatives of the insurance companies also signed the Report agreeing to a maximum of 35/-.  So you have got this position: that both the employers, the representatives of the insurance companies, and the other independent people who were on that Committee in 1925 agreed to continue the payment of compensation at a maximum of 35/- per week.  The Minister is seeking to alter it, but his case for altering it is a very poor case. The Minister is also scaling down the compensation payable to workers although the employers and the insurance companies agreed to the continuance of the present maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not quite stated all the facts.  The position is that under the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1906, a workman who was totally incapacitated was entitled to get 50 per cent. of his pre-accident earnings subject to a maximum of £1 per week.  That was the law in this country and in Great Britain until a very rapid inflation of prices took place towards the end of the Great War.  Because of that inflation of prices, there was introduced in 1917 an Act designed to operate for one year which increased the compensation payable by 75 per cent.  Every workman, who became injured, was entitled to get 50 per cent. of his pre-accident earnings increased by 75 per cent. subject to a maximum payment of £1 per week increased by 75 per cent.  The inflation of prices, as Deputies are aware, continued longer than the year for which the temporary Act was introduced and the Act had to be renewed in 1918, 1919, 1920, 1921 and 1922.  In 1922 the Free State was established and the course of events in Great Britain and this country took different lines.  In Great Britain in 1922 an inter-departmental committee was established which considered the law relating to workmen's compensation and brought in a report, one of the recommendations of which was that the War Addition Act should be repealed and that the maximum rate <Col N="840" /> of compensation of £1 per week should be increased to 30/- per week, but the method of calculating the amount to be paid was retained.  A workman was entitled to get 50 per cent. of his pre-accident earnings subject to that maximum. At the time the change in the law was made in Great Britain no similar change was made here and, in fact, the temporary Act has been continued from year to year up to date. We are changing the law now and, although we are reducing the maximum from 35/- to 30/, as the Deputy stated, it should be emphasised that the method of calculation is also being changed, and that the workman, under the Bill, is entitled to get 75 per cent. or, in some cases, 80 per cent. of pre-accident earnings subject to the maximum. That is, in my opinion, a fairer method of assessing compensation. The consideration that a substantial reduction in the cost of living has taken place since 1923, when the British reduced their maximum to 30/-, and since 1925, when the Committee met, has also to be taken into account. The Deputy is wrong in stating that we are only paying more compensation than in Great Britain to people whose earnings are less than £1 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said you were paying more than in Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons earning up to £2 15s. per week will still continue to get more compensation here than is being paid in Great Britain.  A person earning 55/-, who is totally incapacitated, gets the maximum payment of 30/- here and 27/6 in Great Britain. At 50/- he is still on the maximum here, but only gets 25/- in Great Britain.  At 40/- he is still on the maximum here, but only gets 22/6 in Great Britain.  Our scale begins to go down at 35/-.  He gets 26/3 and 21/3 in Great Britain, and so on down the scale.  In each case the payment here is greater than in Great Britain; in no case is it lower.  I do not think that either I or any member of the Government can be accused of being reactionary in matters of social legislation, but we have to consider a number of factors when determining the policy <Col N="841" /> to be followed.  It is reasonable to say that, although we are taking into account changes in the cost of living which have occurred, we are increasing substantially the compensation paid to workers who are injured and subject to the variations in the cost-of-living index.  The fact is that we are proposing to pay under the Bill compensation to injured workmen which compares very favourably with the compensation paid in any country in the world.</P>
      <P>I am quoting as to the legislation in other countries from the International Labour Office Report upon compensation for industrial accidents published in 1925.  I have explained that the percentage of the pre-accident earnings we are paying here is 75 per cent. in the majority of cases and 80 per cent. in some cases.  In no country in the world associated with the International Labour Office is a higher percentage than 70 paid except in one place, the kingdom of Yugo Slavia, where 100 per cent. compensation is paid with a very definite limitation as to the total amount payable.  In all other cases, the percentage of pre-accident earnings paid to injured workmen is less than we are proposing to pay here. In the majority of cases it is 66? per cent. and in a number of cases only 50 per cent., as in Great Britain.  We are proposing to pay 75 per cent., and in some cases 80 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all European countries except three there is a maximum payment. In the three cases where there is no maximum payment it is difficult to make a comparison with conditions here.  In Spain there is no maximum payment, but there is no weekly payment either.  The compensation paid to a totally incapacitated workman is his earnings for two years paid in a lump sum and then he is finished.  In Russia there is no maximum payment, but the percentage is 66? in all cases.  In certain particular cases it rises to 100 per cent., but the general percentage is 66?.  In part of Poland there appears to be no maximum payment.  The position in that country in the year when the report was published was, apparently, that no national law had been passed and in each part of the country the law which had operated <Col N="842" /> under the previous régime was still in operation.  In one part of it there was no maximum payment provided for, but again the percentage was 66? up to a certain figure, and 22 2/9th beyond that figure.  In all other cases the maximum payment, in so far as I have been able to ascertain the current rate of exchange, appears to be substantially lower than ours.  It may be that I have calculated the rates of exchange in some countries incorrectly. In some cases they appear to be extraordinarily low indeed and in no way to be compared with the maximum proposed under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think it is correct to say, taking all the factors into account, and taking into account the other changes which are being made in the workmen's compensation code, almost everyone of which is very definitely in favour of the worker, that the workmen's compensation code in this country is more progressive, more advanced, than that operating anywhere else.  It is, I think, not something that we can take special pride in that we are in the forefront of social legislation of this kind, because I hope we shall always be so.  I am satisfied that we are not inflicting any injustice upon anybody in effecting the change proposed in the Bill.  Taking into account that the reduction in the maximum is much less than the actual reduction in the cost of living over the period since the maximum was fixed in 1917, and offset by the fact that the percentage of payment has been increased from 50 to 75, I think that the Bill can be fully justified in every way.</P>
    <P>The fact that the operation of the Bill is likely to involve additional payment upon employers has already been generally recognised, and those employers who insure against their liabilities under this Bill have also taken that into account.  It may be that an attempt may be made to justify an increase in the insurance premium on that account.  I am not satisfied that there is justification for such an increase.  I mean that the existing charges are not unduly low, having regard to the risk that arises here.  We propose to take that matter <Col N="843" /> up with the insurance companies doing this business when the Bill is law.  We must, however, take into account that very frequently the operation of this law has for small employers almost a disastrous effect.  Cases have been known where a small employer, whose workman has been injured, has been completely ruined through the compensation he had to pay.  Deputies, I am certain, have experience themselves of that.  Of course, the rate of compensation fixed by this Bill is applicable in every case.  One must not always have in mind the big industrial concerns with large resources and with a large number of people employed.  One must take into account the individual who employs a man for a job or even the householder who employs a casual worker to clean windows or clean up his garden.  In each case there is a definite liability imposed under this Bill and the compensation payable is the same in all cases.  We must, therefore, not seek to move too fast in matters of this kind and I submit that in this legislation we are moving to the front of the world in this type of legislation and that we should be content to keep in that position without going too far ahead.</P>
    <P>I said there is no injustice because the new rate of compensation calculated on the new basis applies only in cases of accidents which occur after the Bill becomes law.  Any workman who has been injured prior to the passage of the Act and who gets compensation at the maximum rate provided for under the existing law will continue to get compensation at that maximum rate.  The Bill definitely provides that no reduction in the payments now being made to anybody can result from its passage.  The new rate applies only to new cases and, having regard to the different circumstances existing now from those that existed when the rate was fixed; having regard to the new method of calculation, which is more favourable to the worker, and having regard to the fact that the compensation is in any case higher than appears to be made in any country and, particularly, in the neighbouring <Col N="844" /> country of Great Britain, I think we can justify the provision in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is relying completely on what Britain does as his justification for this Bill.  That is an extraordinary philosophy for the Minister. He states that he is paying more under this Bill than Britain is paying under its Workmen's Compensation Act.  The Minister is, however, reducing the rates of compensation which exist to-day.  To-day, a person can get seven-eighths of his weekly pay, subject to a maximum of 35/- per week, if he meets with an accident.  The Minister says he is going to pay 75 per cent. That means that he is not only reducing the proportion from seven-eighths to 75 per cent. but he is reducing the maximum from 35/- to 30/-.  The Minister may say that he is paying more than is paid in Great Britain to-day but he is reducing the rate of compensation that is payable here to-day.  That is not justified by the statement that the Minister is doing something better than Great Britain, or as good as Britain, is doing.  The Minister read out a number of cases of legislation in other countries and seemed to get some satisfaction from what he read.  He should have told the House what the compensation is in Australia under current legislation. He should have told us what the maximum is in New Zealand.  He might have got a copy of the Workmen's Compensation Act which is in operation in the State of Ontario.  These do not make nearly as good a comparison as the quotations which he gave regarding Czecho-Slovakia or some portion of Poland.  If this Bill had been passed in 1927, as was intended, this 35/- a week compensation would have been continued and would be law to-day. Advantage should not be taken of the delay in introducing the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister quoted the case of a small employer who was ruined because he had to pay compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  I do not know what his purpose was in quoting that case.  If there were provision in our legislation for compulsory insurance, he would not be ruined. Anybody who has any experience of <Col N="845" /> workmen's compensation knows perfectly well that, while the insurance rates may be higher than they ought to be, they are not so serious as to cripple anybody.  If the man the Minister refers to took the precaution of insuring his workman against accident, as a provident employer would do and as an employer who had any regard for his workman and his dependents would do, he would not have been overtaken by the ruin which engulfed him.  The Minister states that he has a suspicion that the compensation provisions of the Bill will increase premiums.  The Committee which reported on the matter did not think that at all.  The Committee reported in 1925.  In 1929, the matter was referred back to them by Deputy McGilligan, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  On the 16th October, 1929, the Committee reported again.  This is portion of their report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We had reason to believe, at the time, that the changes we recommended would not, of themselves, necessitate any increase in premiums so far as could be foreseen.  Statistics now before us furnish some additional confirmation of the view we took in 1926 of the probable effect of the changes we recommended. Thus, the table on page 15 of the statistical return for 1927 shows that our proposed alteration in the waiting period may be expected to have the effect of shortening the period for which compensation is available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Report goes on to refer to the tendency in Britain to shorten the duration of absences from work by extension of the waiting period.  The Report proceeds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The same effects may be anticipated in the Saorstát and, of course, the shortening of the duration of cases means a reduction of the average amount of compensation paid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Committee were not only satisfied with what they recommended in 1926 but, on reconsideration of the matter in 1929, when apparently an effort was made to stampede them from their original report, they were satisfied that the changes in the law which they <Col N="846" /> recommended would not necessitate any increase in premiums.  They stated that they were reinforced in that view by the statistical return for 1927, which was then made available to them.  I do not think that any extra premiums which may become payable will be very serious.  The way to deal with that problem is not to reduce the compensation payable to the workman, but to devise ways and means of meeting any attempt by foreign companies to charge premiums in respect of workmen's compensation which are not justified by the risks involved.</P>

    <P>This is a more up-to-date table than the table in the Bill, which is taken from the superannuation statute of 1856.  This table has been prepared by the British Post Office.  The Post Office here does not do this class of <Col N="847" /> business and, consequently, they have no tables.  The improved expectation of life has necessitated an alteration in the table, and I think it is fairer that the more up-to-date table should be utilised.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us that this table has been taken from the British Post Office.  I understand that their tables are based on the ruling price of Consols.  What is the Minister basing this table on?</P>

      <P>We have actually taken the British tables.  The fact that we have no security corresponding with British Consols would make it difficult to prepare a corresponding table of our own.  There are possibly some slight inaccuracies in it, but they do not make much difference because the amount, in any event, is arbitrary.  The amount which a workman gets is either awarded by a judge or arbitrarily fixed by the Bill.  Any slight inaccuracy in the annuity tables does not matter very much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Dáil rises for two rather long and important midwinter months I think the occasion <Col N="849" /> arises when at least an attempt should be made to get from the Government Benches some clarification of the situation that exists in this country, some clear indication as to what the Government stand for, whether the Government's attitude as enunciated and proclaimed by various members of their Party at different times represents really the mind of the Government. Although this country is at the moment suffering acutely from financial depression as a result of the controversy between it and Great Britain, I think that we have to go somewhat deeper to find out the actual cause of the evil conditions that exist.  Speaking in no Party sense, I suggest that the fundamental cause of practically every evil of recent growth that exists in the country is to be found in the prevailing factors of instability and insecurity that are rolling over the country like an evil fog, passing over every class, every trade and every group in the community.</P>
      <P>I do not care very much to what particular class of the community you apply that standard, you will find the same old curse of instability and insecurity.  Take the ordinary worker. There is not a worker in this country who can look forward with any confidence three months hence.  There is not a single worker, particularly a rural worker, who can say with any confidence to his unfortunate wife that the job he holds now he will hold next March and that the wages he now has, bad and all as they are, he will have next March.  There you have the old curse of insecurity and instability. That worker drives his boss's few head of cattle to the fair and in seven cases out of ten he drives them home again. If he leaves them at the fair he receives a rotten price.  That man knows in his heart that if the boss's profits are being drastically reduced there is going to be less to go around; there is going to be less labour employed; there is going to be either a reduction in man power or wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you take the public servant, I do not care what particular office he holds, whether it is a high post or an humble post, whether he is highly paid or lowly paid, you have the same old <Col N="850" /> curse of instability and insecurity. You have economy Bills, cuts Bills, wage-slashing Bills.  Not a single officer, high or low, in the service of this State can look forward with any degree of hope or confidence.  He cannot feel that even if he does his job efficiently and in a thorough-going, honest manner he will hold that job in three months or that his rate of pay will be the same in three months' time. Take the professional classes.  Just the same thing applies to them.  Taxes are going up; incomes are coming down; expenditure goes on, leaving them mulcted to the left and mulcted to the right.  The Government and the Government's agents are boring in and tapping the barrel down below. Apply it to the trader with the hinterland all round ruined or practically ruined; with less money flowing in from the rural areas there is less money flowing through the tills.  There again you have the same old curse of insecurity and instability; you have the same old uncertainty.  No man, no head of a family, be he rich or poor, can face his family this Christmas with any hope in his breast or any happiness in his heart.</P>
    <P>That fog of instability, uneasiness, unrest and uncertainty does not just start at the bottom or the middle; it permeates right down from the head of this State; it permeates right through that Party opposite, from the President of the Irish Free State right through the country.  We have every evidence of vacillation and weakness, every evidence of instability on top, and that grogginess and shiftiness on top is what is permeating every walk of life in this country.  We have a Government elected over there to the cries of &ldquo;Up the Republic.&rdquo;  We have a team of men elected over there, elected mainly through one phase of their political career to the cry that everyone who entered this Dáil was a traitor, a national apostate; we have them sitting there drawing their salaries as Free State Ministers, merely securing that the difference between themselves and their predecessors is that they will be exempt from income tax when that tax has gone up.</P>
    <P>Last night, when we had a motion <Col N="851" /> before the House that would provide an opportunity for discussing the condition of what is, according to all, the main industry of the country, agriculture, we had one Fianna Fáil Deputy speaking pathetically about the length of time the particular motion had been on the Order Paper and he asked us for goodness sake to get finished with it.  That speaker was followed directly by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Finance, who absorbed the remaining portion of the time, something like an hour and 20 minutes, in a long, boring exhibition of buffoonery, in language that gave exhibition of vulgar, bad taste.  We had a comparatively wealthy man &mdash; I speak in no offensive term &mdash; with a comparatively big salary exempt from income tax, slapping his pockets and calling on those who spoke for the oppressed and depressed people of the country to give up being melancholy, to smile and be cheerful, to find some national anthem that would elevate them.  It was about as disgusting an exhibition as I ever listened to in this House.</P>
    <P>While I listened to that speech it reminded me of a cartoon that I saw many, many years ago.  It showed a burglar with a smile from ear to ear and a gun up against the nose of his victim, while picking the pockets of his victim he said &ldquo;Smile, damn you, smile.&rdquo;  There was never a more apt caricature of the exhibition we witnessed here last night by a member of that Government that has ruined, or practically ruined, one of the great big industries in the country, a Government that has brought about a condition of insecurity, instability and uncertainty on the people of this country, that Government that has increased taxation and decreased the household revenue of practically everybody except a few sheltered profiteers. It is a monstrous thing for any member of that Government to get up, slap his pockets and sneer at those who dare to put in a word for the people who are suffering from the reactions of Government policy.</P>
    <P>Admitting that we have to go through all this, that the Fianna Fáil wild oats has got to be sown, that the <Col N="852" /> crop has got to be reaped and that the country has got to suffer through the process, why put up a spokesman to jeer at the misfortunes of the people? It would be much better if they put up somebody, as I have listened to from that Front Bench who could at least realise and appreciate the hardships of the people, and give expression to some words of sympathy with them in their suffering, and hold out a little hope that some day they will have rounded the corner and have seen the end of this insane controversy between this country and this country's markets. Instability and insecurity are caused by something deeper down than the financial and political squabble.  They are caused by the ambiguity of the phrases given expression to by the President and Mr. Facing-Both-Ways kind of statements that are being made by members of the Government Front Bench.</P>
    <P>At least the Government should know where their centre of gravity is, where the centre of gravity of the country is and whither exactly they intend that the country is heading. The people in this country and the people outside this country do not know exactly whether this Government intends to work this State as it was handed down to them, or as it exists at the moment, or whether they are not in alliance with their late allies outside who still are persisting in declaring their determination to undermine, to stab and to scrap this State by any means in their power, legal or illegal, within or without the law.  One would think that, even having got into power on the shoulders of these allies, it is due to these allies outside and the people inside that a clear pronouncement should be made as to what is the policy on the major question of the continued existence, or termination of the existence of this State as it is constituted at the moment.  I should like if time allowed to press more fully for a clarification of the atmosphere even in that one respect.  I believe that if the atmosphere were clarified even in that direction, we would have taken a very definite step forward towards terminating the difficulties that exist in every commercial or mere material <Col N="853" /> sense in this country.  I believe that the troubles of a financial nature that exist between this country and the Government of Great Britain would be appreciably nearer a settlement if both the people here at home and the members of the other Government concerned knew exactly what is the policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>In expressing my opinion with regard to that, I am addressing my remarks more specifically to the President than to the members of his Government, because I do believe that certain members of his Government took certain courageous steps 12 months ago towards the reopening of the gates of the Irish farmers' market. If their efforts were not crowned with success it was not owing to the absence of moral courage on their part or their capacity to settle this question. It was because their efforts were scrapped and thrown on one side by a higher individual when they returned.  I believe that in playing this in-and-out miserable political game that in fact the thing that is most dreaded by certain political bosses is a settlement.  I would like before the Dáil adjourns to get something in plain, simple, clear language as to the attitude of the Government towards a settlement.</P>
    <P>Every time there is a General Election on whether here in the Free State or up across the Border in Northern Ireland we have Fianna Fáil Deputies put up saying to the people: &ldquo;We want your votes to terminate this economic war and to terminate it speedily.&rdquo;  One last vote of confidence was asked by the Government from the people last January in order to terminate the economic war and they got that vote of confidence. But what the people got after was the statement that it was a good thing that the English market was gone and gone for all time.  We want to know now and these people want to know whether, in the opinion of the present Government of the Irish Free State, it is a good thing to be rid of the British market for all time, and if that is their definite opinion, the people want to be informed why they are putting their hands into the taxpayers' pockets to <Col N="854" /> provide bounties and subsidies of one kind or another to get more produce into the British market which at other times the Government boast that we have lost for all time?</P>
    <P>There again we have that vague doddering kind of mentality.  You have one Minister after another, meaning well, bringing in a Butter Bill and various other measures.  We have seen these measures brought in ostensibly to help trade with the British market.  And at the same time we are told of our fatal dependence on that particular market for certain agricultural produce in this country, and we have from the other end of the same bench this little kind of cock-a-hoop, &ldquo;the British market is gone and gone for all time and that is a good job.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we are to make up our minds that it is a good job that that market is gone and that it is gone for all time, then, no matter how we might disagree with that point of view, let it go out and let it be stated clearly and let us know in what direction the country is going. Let that be announced in a clear voice and in clear language.  That situation and all these uncertainties affect the commercial life of the country, the domestic incomes of individuals in the country, and the continued existence of the greatest industry the country has or ever will have.</P>
    <P>We have growing up a bigger menace, or a graver plot, against the stability and security of the ordinary people in this country.  On the occasion of the last adjournment I took the opportunity to call attention to the Government's attempts to ban, bully and bludgeon an organisation of decent young men who were getting together in this country behind certain decent published aims and, if you like, as a reaction against other organisations that were getting together for the published aims and for the published objects of undermining and defying the laws of this State.  We had a laboured attempt made by the Minister for Justice here to justify the imposition of a ban on that organisation.  As I said then, I had often heard the Minister for Justice speak before and I was often impressed by him, but on that occasion he would impress nobody. <Col N="855" /> Such evident paper evidence as he brought forward to justify the banning of an organisation that existed in every parish of the Twenty-Six Counties, without minimising what was brought forward, it was simply evidence that an individual here and an individual there had been found with a gun or a bullet.  As I said on that occasion, if that were sufficient evidence to ban that organisation, because those individuals were members of it, the Minister might as well have gone further and banned the Roman Catholic Church in this country, because all those particular individuals were members of that Church.  There was absolutely a jump over an impossible gap, a laboured attempt by what he produced in this House to justify the ban, but the members of that organisation complied with the ban, every one of them knowing in their hearts and souls that it was an unjust ban.  Every one of them complied with it.  Not satisfied with that attempt to provoke the members of that organisation into lawless bodies, we had a very big parade called off. There you had two deliberate attempts, to my mind, to provoke the members of that organisation into violent opposition to the law.</P>
    <P>When those attempts failed we had a campaign throughout the country of beating them up and bullying them by the forces of the State, a further series of attempts to drive these young men into revolt, to make them go, through heat, passion or provocation, beyond the four corners of the law of this State.  At the same time we had your Broy Harriers, direct servants of the State, and a mob organised as a kind of militia, all your forces moving with the deliberate intention of provoking that organisation into breaches of the law or of provoking the members, or the majority of that organisation into violent conflict with the law.</P>
    <P>To-day we had a series of raids &mdash; I do not know how many but some hundreds of raids &mdash; on the homes of those individuals.  We had the wives of officers of that organisation treated in a way that no woman should be treated by people in the uniform <Col N="856" /> of officers of the State, with the idea: &ldquo;if we do not provoke an individual by what we do to him we will provoke him by the way we treat his wife at home.&rdquo;  It was about as despicable a series of raids as ever was carried out under the worst régime of Black-and-Tannery in this country. In those days at least they could advance the excuse that they were foreign people operating in a foreign country, that they were the agents of an outside power, and that something like war existed between this country and their country.  There was some little shred of explanation for the armed raiders and the uniformed raiders in those days, but no such explanation can be advanced for the raiders that were selected to-day.  I always understood that there was a police regulation to the effect that a policeman would not be employed within a certain distance of his own home, but to-day, and in recent days, we had members of this new force specially selected for special raiding: we had people in the uniform of the police selected to raid individuals who had arrested them in the old days of the civil war.  We had every attempt, and every evidence in the particular men selected for particular raids, to revive all the hatred, all the bitterness, and all the passions of that sad period. We had them in Dublin, in Cork and in practically every county.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is anxious to speak he will get ample opportunity to do so, but I would much rather that someone on the Front Bench would speak, because it is not just political clap-trap but a serious thing &mdash; it is a very grave matter &mdash; that we are discussing.  If the present policy, whether with the knowledge of the Executive Council or without the knowledge of the Executive Council, produces a result which would be the obvious and the natural result, then this whole countryside is going to have a very dismal Christmas instead of a happy Christmas.  When I bring up these things here to-night I am bringing them up in the spirit of a man who is anxious to avert even sporadic <Col N="857" /> bloodshed in the country or any further bitterness in arousing passions throughout the country.  The exhibitions that we had to-day, and the exhibitions that we have had over the past six weeks with the knowledge of the Government, can only have one result if they are allowed to go on.  I hope sincerely in the case of the men of strong will and of the clean civic sense who resisted all the previous attempts to drive them into armed or unarmed conflict with the law, that the law will still hold these men within the law.  But I would say this, that the actions of Government servants, as well as the actions and activities of Government supporters outside this Dáil, are making it very difficult for people to keep all that organisation and all that spirit within the law.</P>
      <P>Are we to have a continuation of the type of activity that we have had over the past five or six weeks?  I have here in front of me details &mdash; the Minister is welcome to see them if he wishes &mdash; of up to 100 cases relating to brutal assaults on individuals, either because they associated themselves with a U.I.P. branch or with a branch of the Young Ireland Organisation, cases in which old men and young men were pulled out of their beds and beaten. Reports appeared in the newspapers in regard to at least 20 of these cases. In the documents before me we have the names and addresses of witnesses, where there were witnesses, of those assaults, and every scrap of information that is in those documents will be sent to the Minister for Justice, and we will test out how far the militia is obedient to the will of the Commander-in-Chief. I put it to the Commander-in-Chief and to the Generalissimos and the rank and file that the activities of the past six weeks, culminating in the activity which we witnessed to-day, must, to any man knowing this country, be calculated only to produce one effect.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the members of that organisation not to play the Government game, and to show that this particular series of raids and beatings will not have the effect which I must say, clearly, I believe the Government is out to effect.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins has referred to the insecurity and instability that exists in the country.  There is one reason, if instability does exist, and it is the existence in this country of a certain set of conditions which I submit the Party opposite is not taking their part in trying to combat.  Reference has been made here to the activities by the Government in dealing with an organisation which I suppose I must refer to as the National Guard.  It is still referred to as the National Guard by members of the organisation opposite and still so described on its notepaper.  We have heard Deputy O'Higgins say that the ban on that organisation has been loyally obeyed. Does not Deputy O'Higgins know, if he is in touch with this organisation, that that is untrue?</P>

      <P>May I explain one point to the Minister in good faith? After the fusion of the parties there was a transition period before the fusion and absorption on top became effective right down along.  During that transition period notepaper, stationery, etc., was headed Young Ireland Association, National Guard in brackets.  Naturally officers in existence, secretaries and others, who had to carry on were National <Col N="859" /> Guards.  We had to continue during that change over.</P>

      <P>It does not matter very much so far as the name is concerned. But when the organisation was banned it was banned because of certain objectives, and the use of certain methods to obtain those objectives.  The organisation was banned on account of the methods it was adopting.  On paper at any rate it went by the name of the Young Ireland Association.  Were any of its objects changed?  We know what its tactics and methods previously were.  Were they altered?  I am going to put on the records of this House documents in my possession showing the activities of that organisation since then.  These documents will I believe convince anybody like some of the people opposite whom we know were straight about this matter &mdash; I refer to Deputy MacDermot in particular &mdash; will convince them at any rate that they were being fooled and that the Young Ireland Association was just merely a wing of a political organisation.</P>
      <P>Let us start with the very day that this organisation was banned &mdash; 22nd August last.  I do not propose to read all these documents in full but I propose to put them on the records of the House to show that they were available for everybody to read.  This document was issued by Comdt.  Cronin on 22nd August and was addressed to each district and company commander:</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>In the event of the National Guard being banned by the Government under the Constitution (Amendmen) Act, 1931, it will be the duty of every member to make a special effort to ensure that the work of the organisation continues without interruption, that its strength is increased and that it retains the sympathy and respect of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following line of action shall be pursued in all areas:&mdash;(1) A small number of active officers preferably single men in each division shall evade arrest and devote themselves to intensive organisation.  (2) No volunteer shall absent himself from <Col N="860" /> his home unless he is authorised to do so by the divisional director.  (3) Blue shirts shall be worn and meetings and parades shall be held as usual and while nothing must be done to court the arrest of members or any clash with the State Forces the organisation must not be allowed to be driven underground or to become furtive.  (4) Parades shall be held by every company at least once a fortnight and if possible once a week.  (5) Volunteers who may be arrested shall declare their membership of the organisation and if brought before the Military Tribunal they shall recognise it as a court and treat it with ordinary respect.</P>

      <P>They must not, however, give any information to the Tribunal or the police about other members of the National Guard or about their own movements or activities.  (6) Volunteers who may be convicted by the Military Tribunal or other court on any charge of being members of the National Guard or of participating in its work shall not pay fines or give bail.</P>
      <P>Is there any &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to that from people who talk about respect for the law and respect for the court?  The members of the National Guard were told that they must not pay fines and they must not give bail.  Was not that the kind of thing we heard so much about: that the people would not recognise our courts and that they would not give bail and that they would not pay fines?

      <P>&ldquo;The United Ireland Party (Fine Gael) having now been definitely established with General O'Duffy, the Director-General of the National Guard, at its head, as president, and with six representatives of the National Guard on its Executive, certain political activities heretofore a responsibility of the National Guard or of the National Association will pass over to it.  It is important, however, for all units to understand that whatever changes may be necessary as a result of the formation of the new Party the vital work on which the National Guard has been engaged must go on without slacking or interruption.  Volunteers while playing a leading part in the new body must also do their own work zealously and conscientiously under their own officers and their own headquarters.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the 13th September there was an order issued by General O'Duffy to each branch or parish unit of each district committee, constituency committee, county committee or other district unit of Cumann na nGaedheal, to the Centre Party or National Farmers and Ratepayers' Association, to the National Guard and to each Deputy. How it was addressed to the National Guard some weeks after it was proclaimed may be explained.  I am not going to read all of it.  As I stated, those documents will be available.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The members of the National Guard will form a special youth section in the new Party.  It will be called the Young Ireland Association, and will be under my own special direction.  They shall, however, also be ordinary members of the United Ireland Party.&rdquo;</P>

This letter is marked &ldquo;confidential.&rdquo; It is letter No. 2, headed: &ldquo;Cork City Divisional Headquarters, National Guard,&rdquo; and dated 25th September, 1933.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Re: Organisation of Divisional Intelligence Staff.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You will please forward to Divisional Headquarters within the ensuing week the name of a member in your district suitable for appointment as District Intelligence Officer. The best type suited for the duties of D.I.O. should be chosen from some members already engaged in a mobile occupation such as postmen, insurance agents, athletic club members, postmasters, lorry and bread-van drivers, milk vendors, carriers, etc.  Great care and discretion should be exercised for the appointment and the man chosen should be of sterling courage, possessing tact and intelligence, a good knowledge of local affairs, and a non-consumer of alcoholic beverages is desired.  His name, address and duties in the district should be known only to you. At all roll-calls or parades or at any other district meetings he will be referred to and known as an ordinary member of the organisation.  The drafting of district confidential reports are in preparation and will be issued to all concerned at an early date.  A secret district code now in preparation will be used to and from Divisional Headquarters should the necessity arise for telegrams, etc. You will readily realise that intelligence of a militant nature will of necessity play a very important part in our internal organisation, and each member in your district as apart from the D.I.O. should be instructed from time to time as the district intelligence emanated from that source alone.  Both the director and the vice are taking a special interest in this branch.</P>

      <Col N="863" /> This intelligence system which this officer says he has been instructed to establish was of a militant nature.  Of course, they laugh about that &mdash; persons who are so much immersed in a military atmosphere that they cannot get back to the difference between an ordinary political outlook and the outlook of a revolutionary body.  I am sure they might explain that.  They might also explain how it is that the sanction of those people over there is given to attempts that are to be made to tamper with State officials, and use them for the purpose of carrying out this militant intelligence that they have in mind.  Did they approve, when they were in office, of any organisation using postmen, postmasters and other State officials for the purpose of forwarding the militant intelligence of an organisation of this kind?  Do they approve now?  I should like to hear &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to that.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;It is not improbable in the near future that our present lines of communication, the postal service, may be closed to us for the delivery of despatches to and from divisional headquarters.  It is also possible that despatches may be secretly censored.  In order to combat this contingency, it would be well for district officers, on receipt of all correspondence, to closely examine same and the date of postage checked with the actual date of <Col N="864" /> receiving same in order to prevent any leakage.  Steps should be taken forthwith to establish in each district an auxiliary despatch service, enlisting the aid of friendly bus conductors, lorry and bread-van drivers, insurance agents and other such persons, who are engaged daily or biweekly in the carrying of merchandise or other work of a mobile nature to and from Cork city.  Then at any time should the exigency merit it, the auxiliary services should be brought into operation.  When district intelligence officers are appointed as per instruction contained in Divisional Administration letter No. 2, this work could be detailed to them with all due haste. Further, in order that communications will be regular, all inter-divisional correspondence in future, such as reports, parade statements, weekly and monthly returns, should be despatched from each district on a regular date of each week, and this procedure maintained throughout.</P>

      <P>There are other circulars here from 5 Parnell Square, Dublin.  They were found in the house of a man named Quirke, of Drinagh, County Cork.  There is one dated the 14th September which refers to certain matters and winds up by stating &ldquo;As previously explained it must be the aim of the National Guard ...&rdquo; That cannot be accounted for by Dr. O'Higgins' explanation about striking out &ldquo;National Guard&rdquo; and putting in &ldquo;Young Ireland Association.&rdquo;  This is dictated in the letter itself and typed in.  The letter reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As previously explained it must be the aim of the National Guard to get all the representation possible on each executive set up by the <Col N="866" /> United Ireland Party, so as to be in a better position to promote the growth and influence of the National Guard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The letter is signed &ldquo;Mise le meas, E.J. Cronin, Comdt.&mdash;Secretary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another letter of the same date reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&nbsp; A Chara,</P>
    <P>Will you please write to D. Kiely, Ovens, and inform him that the fusion of the C. na G. Party and N.G. should not stop the work of organisation of the National Guard. Steps should be taken to see that when the new parish committees are being set up that our organisation should have sufficient representation to enable them to control the committees.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to increase and build up the strength of the organisation in all districts under his command.  The organisation is maintaining separate headquarters and the work connected with the administration of the organisation will continue as heretofore.</P>
    <P>Copies will be sent to T. Hyde, Ballinacurra, Midleton; J. Curtin, Main St., Midleton.  The officer i/c Mid. Cork District.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Mise le meas,</P>
    <P Just="Right">J. P. Aherne.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another letter, from 3 Merrion Square, dated 4th October, 1933, and signed E.J. Cronin, Commandant, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&nbsp; A Chara,</P>
    <P>A series of Conventions in every county is being summoned for the purpose of consolidating locally the merger that has already taken place between the governing bodies of the three organisations.</P>
    <P>The Convention for your County will be held ....</P>
    <P>As previously explained it must be the aim of the Young Ireland Association to get all the representation possible on each executive set up by the United Ireland Party so as to be in a better position to promote the growth and influence of the Young Ireland Association.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In another letter, dated 13th September <Col N="867" /> and signed by E.J. Cronin, I want to refer to this paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The National Guard may be referred to in future as the &lsquo;Young Ireland Association.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 13th September, 1933, there is a letter issuing orders to new district commanders, marked &ldquo;Confidential.&rdquo; It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...District commanders are instructed to ensure that our members get sufficient representation on all committees being set up under the auspices of the United Ireland Party....  The National Guard must be the predominant factor on all such committees of the new Party.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It must be the predominant factor. That was how the fusion was being respected by E.J. Cronin.  I see that Deputy Cosgrave is very much amused. I will read a document in a moment which will show what they think about him.  There is another letter dated 23rd September, 1933, from 3 Merrion Square, signed by E.J. Cronin, which was also found on Quirke's premises. It refers to a public meeting held at the Mall, Cork, on Sunday, 1st October, 1933, and states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This being the first public meeting held by the new Party in your county, it is of the utmost importance that every available member of the National Guard in your district may be mobilised for the purpose of displaying our strength.  You will further instruct your men to parade in uniform.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is another letter, all of which I do not want to read, but which I wish to have mentioned on the records. It is dated 13th September and refers to the Local Government Elections, to try to get candidates elected and, I suppose, to keep the other people out in the cold.  To show you how the bond was respected there is a letter from Mr. Seán Ruane, Kiltimagh.  It is of no importance except for the postscript:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Are we to refer in public to the National Guard as the Young Ireland Association?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> Commandant Cronin replying on 21st says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The National Guard may be referred to (in public) henceforward as the Young Ireland Association.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In public&rdquo; is in brackets, so that with one side of their mouths they shout for the Young Ireland Association, and with the other side they shout for the National Guard.  There is a document here from Mylie Magee, Bishophiel, Ballymore-Eustace.  I will not read the whole of the letter.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am making very little headway with the Y.I.A.  Some I approached would join if I could give them guns which is impossible at the moment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He ends up by saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are very short of guns.  I am on the track of two Colts .45.  I don't know if I will be successful or not.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is another letter from Commandant MacManus addressed to &ldquo;Dear Des.&rdquo;  It was found this morning.  I do not know who the gentleman is.  A copy is also addressed to &ldquo;Dear Hannon.&rdquo;  A number of things are said in it.  This is one paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We forced de Valera to use the police to keep order at meetings, and we prevented intimidation on polling day.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thought we got into office on intimidation. The National Guard said no, that they got orders to preserve the peace at meetings.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Further than this, it has become more and more clear as we progress that we have a bigger destiny still to fill.  To put it bluntly, Cumann na nGaedheal (Cosgrave's Party) is finished.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I knew I would be able to make the Deputy smile.  He was a very prominent individual in the organisation, yet this is what he thinks of both organisations:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It largely does not exist in the country districts, except in an election, when a patchwork affair gets together and muddles through, very open to intimidation and even to bribery.  The permanent part of it is a hotbed of jobbery, cliques and inefficiency.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Centre Party, that many of us had such hopes in, has gone to pieces too.

      <P>I want to show the relevancy of this when the Opposition are trying to convey to the people that they have control in some way over this organisation known as the National Guard &mdash; otherwise the Young Ireland Association.  No one listening to the letter I read, from one of the most prominent members of the Y.I.A., working at the headquarters of the Opposition and Deputy MacDermot's office, would think that these people had any object in mind, except to push them aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have no respect for them.  They have no respect for what they consider the Party of Deputy Cosgrave which they say is extinct and they have no respect for the Party of Deputy MacDermot which they say has gone to pieces, Deputy MacDermot being a political opportunist.  Does anybody for one moment think that the people over there are able to control this revolutionary organisation?  We have General O'Duffy going through the country and trotting around in his ordinary clothes as a leader of a political Party and we have him the next day appearing somewhere else in uniform as the generalissimo.  I suppose, of a revolutionary body.  Can <Col N="871" /> there be security or can there be any stability in a country where that thing goes on?  I am not going to enter into the question of the raids to-day.  Arms were got and ammunition was got. You say that you obey the law and that you would not associate with any people who did not obey the law and that you would not hold guns unless you had permits from the State in accordance with law.  That is not so, as we have proved and as we were always of opinion it could be proved that there were guns and arms in the possession of you people and that you were waiting for the opportunity to use them.  Those people outside were waiting to use them when a suitable opportunity arose.  We are going to deal with the situation so far as removing the insecurity that exists is concerned.  It is the duty of the Government to do that and people are not going to evade the law simply by changing the name of an organisation and continuing it with all its military trappings, all its objectives and all that and telling us that they are copying from another country, and telling us, a few weeks ago, of the great march there was to be on Dublin.</P>
    <P>There are not going to be permitted any marches on Dublin by any person who thinks or considers himself some sort of heaven-sent leader who is going to lead a revolutionary Party in this country.  That sort of thing is not going to be tolerated&mdash;tactics or tricks of that sort are not going to be tolerated.  Nobody is going to interfere, and nobody has the right to interfere with political parties.  They are entitled to free speech and we are doing our utmost to try to secure free speech for them.  I know perfectly well what the denial of free speech is. I had experience of it and there was very little instruction sent out to ensure that it would be secured in Deputy Cosgrave's time, in one particular area, at any rate, and I can give the name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the first things the Minister does is to break an agreement that the time would be divided half-and-half so that no reply could be given to his perfectly ridiculous speech.  Not one tittle of evidence has he given of any justification for the ban that was put on this Association last August.  Not one bit has he added to the case that was made by President de Valera when he addressed this House and tried to justify that conduct.  Everything he has put forward shows the existence of an organisation, of a body of men, that is trying to obey the law despite everything that the Government is trying to do to prevent them.  I am not interested in the professions of the Ministers; I am asking the country to judge of their acts and I am asking the country to judge of the acts of the National Guard, as they were.  I ask the country to judge of the acts of the young men in the Young Ireland Party and not by their professions, because their professions are borne out by what they have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred &mdash; I am sorry the time is so short&mdash;to the objects of this Association as it was before August.  Was there a single bit of evidence to show that there was anything <Col N="874" /> in their objects that was not perfectly legitimate, legal and patriotic?  Not a single piece of such evidence was adduced here at any time, either now or previously by the President.  Was there anything in their acts all through that period up to the time the Government shut their eyes to outrage after outrage committed in this country, or was there a single thing committed by members of that organisation that did not bear out the purposes they had put down as the purposes of that organisation?  Yet the Government banned them.  On what? What was the principal reason given here by the President himself for banning them&mdash;the libel, the lie against Deputy Mulcahy.  That was the principal reason.  On that he based the banning and now the Minister raids in an effort to get evidence to bolster up an act that they themselves were guilty of several months ago &mdash; the banning of these people.  The Minister's professions of a desire for peace in this country are interesting.  The time at my disposal is short &mdash; a couple of minutes &mdash; but I want to say that I am convinced that if you examine the conduct of the Government in the last three or four months, that conduct is open only to one explanation &mdash; a deliberate attempt on their part to goad a certain number of young men, knowing that they are young men, into illegal acts.</P>
    <P>I echo the view of Deputy Dr. O'Higgins and make a serious appeal to those young men not to be goaded by any of the measures taken by the Minister for Justice, the President or the Executive Council.  I ask them here not to play the game that the President of the Executive Council is anxious they should play.  I appeal to them not to play his game.  The President banned them and the only reason for banning them was that the youth of this country was slipping away from him.</P>
    <P>That was the reason of the banning and that was the reason of the acts of provocation since.  I appeal to every one of these young men not to be goaded by the President, by the Minister for Justice or by acts of the Executive Council, or by acts of their <Col N="875" /> allies through the country.  Arms were found to-day.  I should like to know the character of the men &mdash; I think I heard the name of one of the men engaged in the raids.  I heard his name on many occasions, several years ago, when our Government was in power and he was the man to send &mdash; and we are asked to believe that the alleged ammunition found was there. Personally, I would not hang a cat on the evidence of that man if he was the man in question.</P>

Stunts &mdash; by a man who is one day looking across the Border, across the frontier and having a peep over the wall, and then, to-day, these raids to justify an action taken several months ago &mdash; to find evidence that in the words of the Minister for Justice, they knew existed but without any <Col N="876" /> evidence at all, they banned this Association several months ago.  Was that not provocative?  What evidence had you then?  What evidence is there now?  You say that the aims of that Association have not changed and that the Association has not changed.  What was illegal in that organisation and in the objects of the Association?  What was illegal in any of the various objects set out?  The President said that they were called into existence in the General Election of 1932.  That is not so.  The first time that an organisation of that kind was called into existence was when the head of this Party, in the constituency to which he was elected by one of the biggest votes given in this country, was not allowed&mdash;and there was no ample protection to see that he was allowed &mdash; to address his people.  We asked the President the other day to say whether he was going to carry out his pledge in reference to dealing with the people who said that they would not allow freedom of speech and said it openly.  That was several months ago and no action has since been taken.  Still considering it?  I have no doubt that he is.</P>
      <P>In that farrago of nonsense which the Minister for Justice has brought forward in order to try to prove a case there is not a document later than the fusion and apart even from that, what do they amount to?  Is there any suggestion of illegalities even now, after all the provocative acts on the part of the Government?  As the hour has passed, I finish by again making a solemn appeal to all the young men in this country &mdash; the right-thinking young men &mdash; not to allow themselves to be goaded into illegal actions of any kind by this action of the Government as they did not allow themselves to be so goaded by previous actions of the Government.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.3 p.m. to 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 31st January, 1934.</P>
