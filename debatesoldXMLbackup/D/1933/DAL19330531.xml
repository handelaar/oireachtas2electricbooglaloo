      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is in a position to state (a) the number of applications from County Cavan made to his Department for grants under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1932, and (b) the number of grants actually allocated in that county.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that some of these applications in Cavan have been in for almost a year and that unless the grants are allocated at once, especially in the matter of reconstruction of houses, it will mean a delay of a year in getting through the work?  Will the Minister see that by the middle of next month these grants will be allocated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Section 2, I would like to ask the Minister if, now that he has got a few days between himself and the rather political frame of mind in which he discussed the idea in this Bill on the last occasion, he can give the House some comments arising out of more recent consideration as to what kind of representation he thinks persons should have in respect of the very large amount of rates that they pay in connection with commercial property. The commercial register was established to give a representation to the commercial community that would bear some relation to their position.  They should have, it was felt, some kind of representation on the Dublin Council arising out of the fact that they pay a very considerable amount of rates on commercial property, rates that are in no way otherwise represented on the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that under the law as it will be amended, the commercial community will get all the representation they are entitled to and probably more than they will seek, judging by the experience at municipal elections in recent times.  They can have votes as ordinary citizens.  They can exercise the franchise and can exercise their influence to the fullest extent on the Municipal Council under the system that will prevail when the existing franchise is amended by the passage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that if men in the commercial life of the city do not seek representation for their class on the Council in the way the Minister thinks they should, it is because he and his colleagues drag across the general work of city administration the question of Party polities, and that no person apparently can go before the electors in the City of Dublin, during the coming election particularly, without having to have turned against him <Col N="2013" /> the whole machinery and all the political guns of the Fianna Fáil Party?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that the ordinary business man, who looks on the administration of the City from a business point of view, is well aware that if it is not carried out on a business basis the interests not only of the commercial fraternity in the City, but also of the working people, are going to be damaged?  I submit that the Minister is quite unfair to the commercial community when he charges them with not being interested enough in the management of the city to seek election on the Council.  It is the actions of the Minister and his colleagues, the tactics they adopt with regard to representation on local bodies, that have made responsible and prominent members of the business community rather shy of placing themselves before the electorate for a place on the City Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister, when he is considering the plea made by Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;if there is any danger that he might accept it&mdash; to consider also the protection of this particular class in whom Deputy Mulcahy is suddenly interested, so that in any General Election in connection with this House they will be given a special status and offered the possibility of being able to cut in here without the guns of this Party or the machine guns of the Deputy's Party being turned on them.  Deputy Mulcahy must realise that this system of a special privilege to a certain class in the case of any municipal election, or for that matter in the case of a national Government, was never heard of until he, as Minister for Local Government, introduced it.  He was then trying to bring about the position where certain people would be given extra rights in municipal administration to be followed, possibly, if his idea proved acceptable, in national Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned that the Minister and his colleagues were the main cause of this class legislation.  I would remind the Deputy that it was he who first introduced this idea of special legislation.  Probably he thought he <Col N="2014" /> was going to maintain a majority by the introduction of the new system. The Deputy should realise that what he is now appealing to the Minister for is ridiculous.  His arguments are based on fallacies.  He introduced the original measure and he gave a particular class special facilities before there was any municipal authority at all based on the partly restored rights of Dublin citizens.  I hope the Minister will indicate that not only is this step towards democracy being gone on with, but that in a short space of time we will have civic administration restored in its entirety and that the people will be given their adequate share of responsibility for the administration of the city's affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BartOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite evident that business men will have very little chance of getting elected after the pronouncements we have heard in this House.  It was stated here that the Fianna Fáil Party have a poor representation at present on the City Council, no more than five or six members, but that after the next election they would have far more.  In my opinion there will be little chance for the particular type of citizen in question, the representative of the commercial community, getting elected to the Corporation, because such a person will not stoop to the methods of personation we have heard of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <P>Last night Deputy Briscoe argued that the voluntary hospitals should be controlled to a certain extent by this State because, he argued, that the State contributed large sums of money to these hospitals. To-day he argues in the reverse strain and holds that people with property who contribute large sums of money to the running of the municipal administration are not to have decent and honest representation.

      <P>When this proposal was brought forward originally it was not the suggestion of businessmen that it should appear in this particular form. All businessmen said was that they <Col N="2016" /> paid, through the medium of limited liability companies, more than a moiety of the city rates, and they asked for representation following on the payment of these rates.  That principle is admitted by every country in Europe: that where a large volume of rates is paid representation in the municipal authority should follow.  It is not necessary to argue that principle, which has the support of every Deputy.  Whatever may be said about local government in this country, everybody agrees that local government is carried out by those who pay the rates.  If Deputy Briscoe says that the people whom he speaks for pay all the rates, then I am quite satisfied that they should get all the representation. I question that statement, however, and if the Deputy will look up the figures given by the then Minister for Local Government when the Act was passing through the Dáil some years ago, he will find that limited liability companies paid more than a moiety of the rates to the Dublin Corporation. All business people ask is that if they pay this volume of rates, about which there can be no question because the figures are on the records of the House, they should be entitled to representation in some form.  If the particular form adopted by the former Government is not acceptable, then let the Deputy put forward some other proposal.  So long as they get representation that is all they ask for.  If they pay this large volume of rates, they are entitled to representation.  As I said, that is accepted by every other civilised State.  It is too late in the day to argue the point.  It is only giving to businessmen what is their due when you give representation of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We spoke on the Second Reading about the difficulty of businessmen getting representation on the Corporation. Let me say on behalf of businessmen that they are quite anxious to share the burden of local government. If they are wanted, they are quite willing to come forward.  If they cannot get elected, they are satisfied to remain silent.  That does not affect the issue.  The issue here is a return in the way of votes for taxation.  All <Col N="2017" /> I say is that, if you are to give businessmen their due, you should give them these votes.  The people whom Deputy Briscoe speaks for get their votes through the property qualification.</P>

      <P>In view of what has passed in the discussion, I think it is relevant and proper to read the paragraph in Column 1071 of the Official Reports, Volume 47, in which Deputy Kelly said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They will get elected hands down, if we are to believe all the statements made here regarding the way Fianna Fáil members were elected.  At any rate, personation would be no harm.  It is a good turn. If a man is dead and you knew the opinions he held while alive, what harm would it be to vote for him? If a poor man is sick in hospital and not able to get out, surely it is a good turn to see that his vote is registered.  If he has gone away and his neighbours know his opinions, I do not see any harm in personation. I think I encouraged a lot of that class of thing in my day.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;At one time I saw that the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland voted right&mdash;the first time in his life that he voted right.  He did not get up early enough and he waited for his breakfast before he came to the polling station.  When he went into the booth he found that he had been voted for.  He was very indignant, but he should have got up early and not minded his breakfast.</P>
      <P>At this juncture Deputy Mulcahy intervened to ask: &ldquo;Are we to take these as instructions to Fianna Fáil candidates in the Dublin elections&rdquo;? Deputy Kelly replied:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Yes; vote early and often and maybe the cry will not then come from the benches opposite that we only returned five or six members. We may return a great many more.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment 33:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If, after the making of a grant out of the Hospitals Trust Fund <Col N="2021" /> under this section to any grantee and before payment of such grant or before the making of any particular payment in respect of such grant, the Minister is satisfied that any condition attached under the foregoing sub-section to the receipt of such grant or any such particular payment has not been complied with by such grantee, the Minister may certify to the National Hospital Trustees that such condition has not been complied with and upon the Minister so certifying, the National Hospital Trustees shall not make, and such grantee shall cease to be entitled to, any such payment of or in respect of such grant or to any future payment in respect thereof unless and until the Minister otherwise directs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment to provide for the stoppage of the grant in case the conditions mentioned in connection with grants have not been complied with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is more than a drafting amendment.  This section, as originally drafted, is now altered very considerably by two amendments, whether they are called drafting amendments or not.  The fact is that under the Bill, as introduced, the Minister could make a grant to hospitals in accordance with conditions that were set out in the section. Surely the Minister is not contending that this is a drafting amendment, having regard to the change that has taken place in the section, by reason of the amendment.  The amendment states: &ldquo;If after the making of a grant...and after payment of such grant...the Minister is satisfied that any condition attached under the foregoing sub-section...has not been complied with...the Minister may certify to the National Hospital Trustees that such condition is not being complied with and upon the Minister so certifying the National Hospital Trustees shall not make and such grantee shall cease to be entitled to any such payment...unless and until the Minister otherwise directs.&rdquo;  Now the conditions under which it was open to the Minister to make a grant to the hospitals were set out.  One of them, I <Col N="2022" /> observe, has departed; there was to be no grant in respect to maintenance. That is more than a drafting amendment and the Minister ought to give some reason for it.  Is it proposed that the Minister might alter the conditions, because the latter part of the amendment states that no such further payment shall be made unless, and until, the Minister otherwise directs. Directs what?  Is the minister reserving to himself power to change the conditions?  If, for example, a hospital were to get a grant of, say, £10,000 for an addition and it found that it would cost £15,000, would the Minister consider that a reason for holding up the grant because the hospital finds they could not go on with the work and carry out the Minister's intention?  I think that is more than a drafting amendment and surely we might have some explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 24 the Minister &ldquo;shall specify the purpose for which such grant is to be expended and may attach to the receipt of such grant such conditions (whether to be performed before or after such receipt), as he thinks proper for securing the due expenditure of such grant on the purposes specified by the Minister for securing or attaining any other object.&rdquo;  The Minister may attach such conditions, for example, that a certain proportion of beds in the reconstructed institution shall be free beds for the poor.  The new sub-section proposes and is intended to give the Minister the necessary power to discontinue the payment of the grant or the endowments in the event of the hospital committee or governors of the hospital failing to fulfil or ceasing to continue the conditions on which the grant was made. I might say it is not intended, and not proposed in the sub-section, to alter the conditions attaching to any grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put before us the obligation on the hospital, after reconstruction or the extension of the provision of a certain number of beds, and the percentage of those beds to be devoted to the poor.  Now obviously it will be necessary to have complete furnishing <Col N="2023" /> installed and the necessary equipment provided before that question would arise; so this is not the particular case the Minister must have in mind in regard to this matter.  The question would only affect the moiety completed, I presume, because, according to the estimates we have had for a bed, it would run to something in the neighbourhood of £1,000 per annum; that is including equipment, cost of architect, surveyors' fees, furniture, etc.  Obviously that money must be spent, so that the provision of the number of beds arises only in connection with maintenance and that too, I presume, would be a separate item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that a large percentage of the grant will be expended on capital expenditure&mdash;the provision of new buildings and the equipment of the institution.  The proposed sub-section here is meant to provide for the endowment or the annual grants being discontinued in the event of these conditions ceasing to be fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that, with regard to that, I have just looked up one particular report and in that case the amount sanctioned was £90,000.  I take it that the interest on that was the amount proposed to be allotted to the hospitals in the amendment. Thirty-three and a third per cent. of that would be £30,000 and, at least, one twenty-fifth of it would be somewhere about £23,000, as against £70,000.  Does the Minister intend to hold up the £70,000 if the specification is for building operations alone? Will that be held up, because provisions in respect of that are scarcely open to the Hospitals' Committee to alter?  I think that some pronouncement should be made in connection with a matter of that kind.  The Reference Committee deals a good deal, in the course of its report, with the necessity for care being exercised. They lay the period down as probably two years in order to complete all the plans for rebuilding.  They do not recommend the shortening of that period to any great extent.  Assuming <Col N="2024" /> that the plans and specifications relative to the construction of a building are properly complied with, does the Parliamentary Secretary anticipate any hold-up in all that in respect of what is happening now?</P>

      <P>Is the allocation referred to by Deputy Cosgrave already made out of sweeps that have been reported on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I should say that, if the Hospitals Commission approved of the plans for the new construction proposed to be provided, there would be no hold-up of such allocation as a result of this section. The Minister was satisfied at the time the allocation was being made as to the plans and as to the nature of the extension of the building that, in the ordinary course of things, construction would go on and the conditions attaching to that grant would obviously be fulfilled and no new conditions added.  When new allocations, in the form of an annual grant or in the form of an income from investments, were added certain provisions would be attached in order to ensure that the free beds already provided for would continue to be made available for the poor; but if at any time the hospitals ceased to make that provision available to the poor, the Minister, under this section, would have power to direct the discontinuance of the annual payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this matter between this and the Report Stage.  As it stands, it looks as if there might be a holdup.  It is open to that interpretation. My case is that a hospital makes an application; the money is granted; the hospital has entered into this contract, but it may be that the Minister might propose something that was not contemplated under the contract. For example, there has been a marked development in regard to hospital architecture in recent years. The hospital concerned might, in good <Col N="2025" /> faith, pass certain plans, but in the meantime, the Minister might think, as a result of recent architectural developments, that an improvement might be made in these plans.  Is there anything to guard against a conflict arising between the Minister and the hospitals concerned?  I take it that the relations between the Minister and the hospitals would be cordial.  Similarly, with regard to the matter of equipment of hospitals; I understand that there is a considerable improvement in recent years with regard to furniture, appliances, and up-to-date equipment.  There may be a necessity for other arrangements in connection with matters of that sort. If the question be only one of maintenance, I think that the Minister ought to look into that matter between this and the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, this amendment is one of the amendments sent forward to me by a Committee of the united Hospitals.  I was not briefed as regards this, but when I made inquiries from various people they said to me that no one would understand what was understood by the phrase &ldquo;internal policy&rdquo;.  I did not go farther to seek any further information with regard to it, because I did not think that there would be any chance of the amendment being carried in <Col N="2026" /> view of the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say this&mdash;I have not got it directly from the hospitals, but indirectly&mdash;that there is a certain amount of uneasiness with regard to this Bill as to the attitude that is taken with regard to the distribution of funds?  There is an apprehension with regard to the autonomy of hospitals, and as to what they regard as their independent jurisdiction.  That has nothing to do with the provision of a certain number of free beds for poor people.  But there is an apprehension with regard to the autonomy of hospitals, and if the Parliamentary Secretary would consider that point between this and the Report Stage I would undertake to get an amendment which he might, perhaps, consider reasonable, in the meantime. In the beginning, the Hospitals Bill was treated as a non-Party matter.  It is rather unfortunate that Deputy Sir James Craig said that he thought the Parliamentary Secretary might not consider the matter in that light.  I think the Deputy might have been a little more optimistic in regard to it.  The Minister will, I have no doubt, be prepared to accept suggestions which will relieve apprehensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital position in Dublin has altered within the lifetime of many people.  Within the last 60 or 70 years a new arm, one might say, has been added to those we already had in connection with the hospitals.  They are rather jealous of that autonomy.  It is not an autonomy that has to be considered in relation to isolation.  There is rather a certain amount of pardonable pride in the work done, in the attendance given to the sick, infirm and poor.  The hospitals have done their best with the limited resources at their command.  Even in the last ten or 15 years the hospitals have battled with an adversity which, perhaps, affected those connected with the hospitals more than other people.  They deserve some consideration, not alone in respect of the past, but in respect of the present.  If Deputy Sir James Craig will withdraw this amendment, I <Col N="2027" /> will endeavour to frame one which, I think, the Minister will be inclined to accept on the Report Stage, which will ensure the preservation of the rights of those who have conducted the hospitals in their internal policy and which will have no relation to anything that might be in conflict with the Minister's intentions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I spent four and a half hours this morning examining in the Mater Hospital and I was extremely proud of all I saw there.  I have been examining for about 25 years.  I have seen the changes that have taken place in the various hospitals and nothing has struck me so much as the tremendous improvement that has taken place in every direction as far as a hospital like the Mater Hospital is concerned.  There is a feeling among the higher officials in the hospitals that some interference might take place with regard to their arrangements.  It would be very difficult for me to put my finger upon what the fears are, but undoubtedly there are distinct fears that there may be interference with the management in certain ways that the hospital authorities foresee will not be for their good.  That is what my interpretation amounted to&mdash;that the hospitals did not wish too much interference with the arrangements connected with their internal work.  As far as the attention to the poor is concerned, not only is there the most scientific diagnosis but there is also the most scientific treatment going on.  I say this particularly in regard to a hospital with which I am in no way connected.  As far as cleanliness is concerned, I do not think I have ever seen anything to equal it.  They have hot and cold water in the wards and many other things that did not exist twenty years ago.  They have been improving themselves beyond measure and I pay this compliment to them with the greatest pleasure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think both Deputy Sir James Craig and Deputy Cosgrave realise that the proposed amendment could not possibly be accepted.  The complications resulting from its <Col N="2028" /> acceptance must be self-evident.  I do not see how the Minister could become acquainted with the internal policy of a hospital.  It is conceivable the internal policy of a number of hospitals might be very different.  It would be almost impossible for the Minister, when he would be attaching conditions to a grant, to know whether the conditions were likely to be in conflict with what is called a hospital's internal policy.  It might mean the internal policy in reference to the administration of free patients.  I quite see that Deputy Cosgrave has not that in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It might, however, be interpreted as meaning that.  It might be interpreted to mean the policy in reference to the management of finance, the purchase of equipment, or remaining isolated from the other hospitals in refusing to be incorporated in any co-ordinated scheme that might be evolved on the recommendation of the Hospitals Commission.  The object of the amendment, although Deputy Sir James Craig apparently is not very well briefed in the matter, as he admits, may be to prevent any possible interference under the guise of attaching conditions.  If that is the object, the amendment is altogether too wide in its scope.  There is no desire whatever to interfere unduly with the management of the hospitals or with the ordinary automony of the voluntary hospitals.  We are concerned with voluntary hospitals in so far as the provision for the poor that will result from the sweepstakes is concerned.  The provisions of the Bill are negative rather than positive. Consistent with safeguarding the provision of free beds to the poor in future, as far as it is possible to do that with the moneys at our disposal, I would be quite prepared to accept any amendment on the lines suggested by Deputy Cosgrave that will be in keeping with the principles of the Bill.  The Deputy understands, I think, quite clearly what I have in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the very indirect touch I had in relation to this matter <Col N="2029" /> there were grave apprehensions in connection with every section of the Bill upon which I endeavoured to reassure some of the hospital people. I think the amendment I have in mind, and which I will move later, will tend to allay that feeling.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 35:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (4).</P>
      <P>I think it would be as well to take amendment 37 in conjunction with this and the amendment reads: &ldquo;To delete sub-section (5).&rdquo;  The deletion of those sub-sections was discussed on amendment 28, and the amendments are really consequential on that amendment. On the earlier stages of the Bill there was considerable confusion of thought as to the interpretation of sub-section (4) and (5).  A general desire for clarification was expressed and, on further examination of the Bill, the most sensible way of clarifying the position seemed to be to delete those sub-sections completely.  I do not know whether that will meet the wishes of those Deputies who expressed disapproval of the sub-sections as drafted, but in the light of the amendments already carried I think this is the simplest way of clarifying the position.</P>

      <P>I think it is a very bad principle that the Minister wants to introduce by deleting this sub-section (4).  If sub-section (4) is taken in conjunction with my amendment No. 36, the section will then exactly specify how the money can be expended.  It does not leave it in the air.  It is very full and comprehensive. What is the objection to having it in? It is a direction by this House that when we are interfering with funds which are provided not out of Government sources, but out of the pockets of the public that the House should direct generally how the money is to be expended, allowing, as the section allows, a very considerable amount of discretion to the Minister, but at the same time saying that this money shall be expended in a particular direction, or in one or several particular directions, <Col N="2030" /> but not haphazard in any particular way that the caprice of any Minister who may have the administration of this Act should wish.</P>

      <P>I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to allow sub-section (4) to remain.  There are no less than six different choices that the Minister has for granting the money.  I would prefer the sub-section to remain to having it deleted.</P>

      <P>Amendment 28 makes this amendment now necessary.  Section 24 (1), as amended, now reads &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act the Minister may, at any time, either on his own motion or in consequence of an application to him under this Act, make to any hospital or nursing organisation in Saorstát Eireann a grant out of the Hospital Trust Fund of such amount and for such purposes as the Minister shall think proper.&rdquo; The original Section read: &ldquo;such amount and for such purposes authorised by this section...&rdquo; The words &ldquo;authorised by this section&rdquo; have now been deleted.  I do not think there need be any apprehension about this amendment at all. The money will all be allocated for the benefit of the hospitals, and not for any other purpose.  Setting out in detail in the section the purposes to which the Minister may allocate it seems to me to be altogether unnecessary. In view of the amendment that has already been carried, it would mean a further recasting of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <P>Surely not. Take the Bill as it stands&mdash;&ldquo;For such purposes as the Minister shall think proper.&rdquo;  These words are perfectly distinct.  It is of the greatest importance that this House, dealing with moneys that are not State property, should have a controlling influence. It is important that the House, even within these very wide limits of the section as it stands at present and with the other amendment which I propose to add to this sub-section&mdash;&ldquo;the future maintenance of the grantee&rdquo;&mdash;should have this control. That is very exhaustive.  If there is anything else outside, the Parliamentary <Col N="2031" /> Secretary and his advisers can say what it is.  You can do anything further to this sub-section, but keep sub-section (4) there.</P>

      <P>The section as it stands now provides for endowment income, and it can provide for maintenance and for the payment of debts.  The Minister is empowered to make the funds available to such amounts as he thinks proper subject to the provisions of this Act.  I think everything can be covered by that.  You cannot have anything wider than that.</P>

      <P>I think the sub-section should be left.  Outside of the arguments used by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney the sub-section is useful as a safeguard to the House and it is useful also to possible applicants for grants.  For when they read the Act they will understand for what different purposes they could apply for grants. The mere words&ldquo;the discretion of the Minister&rdquo; would not give people an idea as to what purpose the money would be available.  It is in that respect that the retention of this sub-section would be useful.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary that his claim for his amendment is that it makes the section wide enough.  That is hardly an answer to those who claim that the powers are too wide.  What we were anxious for was not complete powers given to the Minister but a definition of these powers.  I suggest that it is not an answer to that claim that he thinks that there are no limits to his powers.  His powers are all-embracing. May I make this suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;that whatever his own individual intention is at the moment there is undoubtedly enshrined in the Bill as it will stand with this amendment an extraordinary power given into his hands, stretching <Col N="2032" /> far beyond what he indicated in his speech, namely, the desire to provide for the sick poor.  The powers the Minister has got go much beyond that. The Parliamentary Secretary is carrying through this House a principle that is exceedingly dangerous.  How dangerous it is he himself must have recognised last night.</P>

      <P>As it stood originally there was no provision for what is called future maintenance.  That would fall to be met each year.  It has been the system of Local Government finance in connection with certain funds in the Free State and that principle was adopted.  That is a bad principle in connection with hospitals, because the hospitals have to estimate before the spending of the moneys, and the thing would be better done if <Col N="2033" /> they knew that they would have every opportunity to examine into the dispensation of that money so that any provision could be made beforehand. Otherwise the money would have to be expended before a particular item could come for examination.  Personally, I do not think that is a good principle.</P>

It was suggested that it might be possible to put into the introductory part of the Bill all the institutions which were to be included.

      <P>At the end of the section to add the words &ldquo;and shall continue in force until the 31st day of July, 1938, and shall then expire.</P>
      <P>When the original Bill was about to be introduced, the Bill put into my hands provided that the Sweepstakes should end with the Sweepstake on the Derby in 1933.  Certain objections were raised to that, and I extended the period for another year, until the end of June, 1934.  In my opinion, that was a sufficiently long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have put down this amendment because I do think that the hospitals ought to be very well provided for in another five years, and I think it would be very advisable for the Government to cease trying to raise money for this particular purpose after that time.  As soon as the Hospitals Sweep had run its course I was at one time very keen on supporting a Bill that would provide from £5,000,000 to £10,000,000 for housing, but, strange to say, though I suggested that to Senators and to Deputies here nobody seemed to fall in with the idea. My own feeling is that it would be very much better not to continue to appeal to the world for the hospitals beyond a certain period, and that if we wanted to go on with the sweeps for a further period it would be a great deal better to go on with them for housing.  The more we prevent people from getting diseases the less money will be required for the upkeep <Col N="2037" /> of the hospitals, and I have not the slightest doubt whatever that if we were able to do away with our slums and give people proper housing we would do away at all events with a great deal of sickness in the large cities, and particularly in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I should like to press this amendment, because I do not like the hospitals to be for ever held out as poverty-stricken.  This Bill is a permanent measure brought in by the Government.  The last Bill, as has been frequently stated, was a temporary measure brought in by a private individual.  All Parties were consulted with regard to its provisions, and when amendments were suggested those amendments were generally accepted.  What annoyed me in particular, with regard to this Bill, is that the Government took it into their own hands to suggest things, without any reference to the proper Parties in the House, which had not been at all the feeling in connection with the original Bill. However, that is past and gone.  I am quite prepared to forgive and forget anything either that the Parliamentary Secretary said to me or anything that I said to him.  I would ask him to accept this amendment, and, if it is found necessary, to bring in an amending Bill afterwards.  I do not think it is a good thing for us to continue those sweeps as a permanent thing for years and years.  As I say, I am giving this Bill five years from now, and I think by that time surely we ought to have made sufficient provision to support the hospitals permanently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty of fixing a time limit for the operation of this Bill arises largely from the fact that we cannot estimate in advance what degree of success may attend future sweepstakes.  The operation of the measure could be brought to an end in two or three different ways.  If we have secured sufficient money to solve the hospitals problem in the course of three years', four years' or five years' time the Act can be repealed.  On the other hand, when sufficient money has <Col N="2038" /> accrued to satisfy the needs and meet the requirements of the voluntary hospitals, the governing bodies will not appoint a committee to promote sweepstakes.  In that way also, the Bill would become inoperative.  Again, if the Minister for Justice is satisfied that sufficient money has accrued to solve the hospitals problem he could withhold his sanction to the scheme. The Committee of Reference, in the report on the Derby, 1932, estimated that it would take over £7,000,000 to satisfy the requirements of the voluntary hospitals.  More than half of that sum has yet to be raised for those particular hospitals, apart altogether from the very large sum of money that will be necessary to finance the schemes of hospitalisation and development that the local authorities, the boards of health and the mental hospitals have in hand.</P>
      <P>In the light of those circumstances I think it would be very unwise to fix an arbitrary time limit of five years. As I have said, the Act can cease to operate if and when we have got sufficient money to carry out the intentions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>On the Land Commission Estimate I want to draw attention to the case of the treatment accorded to an employee of the Land Commission in County Sligo and County Leitrim, Mr. Michael Gallagher, a county councillor who has been in the employment of the Land Commission as stock manager and paymaster in connection with certain lands for a considerable number of years, in the case of some of them for, I think, 20 years.  His record has no flaws whatever in it as regards integrity or efficiency.  In the middle of April he received a notification from the Land Commission that his services would be dispensed with as from the end of the month.</P>
      <P>No explanation of any kind was given for this action, and he was, therefore, not afforded any opportunity to defend himself against any charges that might be brought against him. Having heard from him on the subject, I called upon the acting Minister for Lands and Fisheries, and I was informed that this gentleman's dismissal was due to the part he had taken in a certain public meeting as far back as last December.  It was alleged that at that meeting he had made statements that were improper as coming from an employee of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting in question was one that was held by a branch of the Farmers and Ratepayers League in Sligo to discuss the situation in regard to the payment of land annuities.  At that time the Press was very full of proceedings that had been started, under the aegis of the <Col N="2040" /> Cumann na nGaedheal Party, to test the legal position with regard to the land annuities.  I might say, quite frankly, I had already, some months previously, taken legal opinion on behalf of the League, and had informed all those I was in contact with that, while the Government were undoubtedly breaking the law, the legal obligation of the farmers towards the Land Commission, nevertheless, still continued.  But while I told people this on the strength of the legal opinion I had obtained, there were others who expressed the view that the matter was in considerable doubt.  This legal action had been started, counsel of great eminence had been engaged to take part in it, and it was understood, by the country people generally, that a considerable amount of doubt existed as to the legal situation, and the obligation of the farmers to pay land annuities, during such time as the annuities were detained here and no legislation passed to regularise all this.  In these circumstances this meeting was held and it was decided to have a test case defended.  A number of civil bills had been issued, and the question was what action should be taken upon the civil bills.  A perfectly reasonable decision was arrived at that one of those civil bills should be defended and that the court should be asked to give a stay of execution until such a time as the big case in Dublin had been decided.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gallagher, whose case is now in question, was chairman of that meeting, and the complaint against him rests principally upon the fact that he mentioned he had not paid his annuities in June.  He said: &ldquo;I saw the tariffs were coming and I was not prepared to pay twice.  I have receipts from the Customs authorities showing that on consignments of cattle I shall have to pay £12 over my year's rent. I am expecting a civil bill and I am going to fight it.&rdquo;  Somebody else at the meeting suggested general advice being given to everybody not to pay. Mr. Gallagher actually frowned on that suggestion and it was he who guided the meeting throughout to the decision that a test case should be defended, to clear up the legal position.  He did <Col N="2041" /> not ask that his should be the test case to be taken because he was of the opinion that he should pay the expenses of his own case himself, and so, some other person's case was to be taken as the test case.  It is alleged that that was an act so flagrant, and so likely to produce a lawless frame of mind amongst the community, that it justified the Land Commission in overlooking the fact that this man had more than twenty years of blameless and faithful service.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that contention cannot be upheld, and that the action Mr. Gallagher took was a perfectly natural and respectable action.  He is not a legal expert.  It was perfectly reasonable that he, and others, should be impressed by the fact that under the ægis of a great Party, legal proceedings were to be taken and eminent Counsel were going to argue the whole legal circumstances surrounding the land annuities dispute.  Under these circumstances I cannot, for the life of me, see that Mr. Gallagher was not perfectly justified, and that others were not justified in withholding payment and defending their cases in the courts until such time as the situation was made clear to the satisfaction of all.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House that the Land Commission has acted in a very unjust and arbitrary fashion.  I draw attention to the fact that action was not taken, at the time of the alleged offence, and was only taken in the middle of April, and the apparent motive of the whole thing was to provide employment for an intimate friend of one of the Fianna Fáil representatives in the County Sligo.  Even if anyone were able to convince himself that the Department acted reasonably in other respects, there can be no possible excuse for sending a man an abrupt notice that his employment is to terminate in a fortnight's time, and giving him no opportunity of any sort or kind to plead any case in his defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak upon this Vote, as in the near future we are promised a Bill that will possibly change the whole policy of <Col N="2042" /> the Land Commission's work, as we understood it, and would not have done so except for the case which Deputy MacDermot has raised.  I think it is monstrous that a Government Department in the position of the Land Commission should take the action indicated by Deputy MacDermot. At the time that the gentleman named took the action he did there was a certain policy being pursued by the great majority of the farmers of this State.  There was agitation being carried on with the Government, and negotiations proposed to remit the payment of the annuities pending the settlement of the economic controversy between this Government and England.  Rightly or wrongly many farmers in this State&mdash; and I maintain rightly&mdash;considered that, taking into account the fact that they were directly paying to England more than the annuities, in fact sometimes three and four times the annuities, they were justified at the moment, and until the question was determined in regard to their annuities, not to pay them.  There was doubt, and in the minds of many people more than doubt, as to the legality of the Land Commission in collecting the annuities at all in these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy MacDermot said, there was a legal action pending in Dublin to determine this matter.  It was reasonable to assume, with this looming largely in the Press, that many people would be imbued with the same doubt that the originators of the same action had.  Some of us were blamed by the Fianna Fáil Party that we did, in effect, urge the non-payment of annuities to the Government.  I do not know that, at the start, any of us took that course; but when some of us found that it was impossible for the farmers to pay their annuities, some of us took the other direction.  Anyhow, events did not take the course that, towards the end of December, farmers could not meet their obligations. But with this in the Press it was natural to assume that any farmer in the country would refrain from making any payments pending the settlement of that action.  I say that <Col N="2043" /> in the light of all these facts it is, to my mind, monstrous that the Land Commission should inflict this dismissal on this civil servant for taking action which thousands of farmers, small and large, themselves took in the course of the last twelve months and which many Deputies of this House also took and were forced to take.  I think it was monstrous to punish an official of the Department for an offence which many of the Deputies of this House&mdash;and I am one of them&mdash;themselves committed, and we are not brought before any bar of justice or penalised; and if a humble servant of the Land Commission is to be penalised for an action which many of the Deputies of this House were forced to take I think it is monstrous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate before the House at present is one which one would prefer to discuss with regard to the details of the working of the Department, from observation, during the last 12 months.  But, in connection with the working of the Land Commission, there has arisen a development which Deputy MacDermot has referred to to-day.  I do not believe that there is a Minister on that bench in charge of any Department, with the exception of the acting Minister for Lands and Fisheries, who would attempt to justify what has been done in this case.  The facts are that a man, who has spent years in the service of the Land Commission, without a single material complaint against him&mdash;his record is that of a man who did all the heavy work connected with his office when there was a lot of undivided land to be looked after&mdash;delivered a speech in the County of Sligo, which Deputy MacDermot has read to the House to-day, and that that man has said in effect: &ldquo;A claim has been made against me on the basis of an alleged contract of payment; I propose to go into court to state my case and to let the Department of State concerned state their case and I am prepared to abide by the verdict of the judge.&rdquo;  That is all that he is charged with&mdash;that he publicly said that he was going to await a judicial verdict as between him and the Land Commission as to the facts of the <Col N="2044" /> case.  The speech was made in the month of December&mdash;early in December. It was published in the public Press on the 10th of December. Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party were just as busy looking into the records of their political antagonists last December as they are now.  I do not know whether they brought this fact before their colleagues or not; but no action was then taken and no reasonable man can imagine that any punitive action should be taken for the language of that man in that speech.  I submit that it was the language of a good citizen.  It was the language of a man who did not suggest that he had any right to resist the law.  It was the language of a man who said that he acknowledged the law and that he proposed to get a judicial decision on what the actual law was and having got it, that he would abide by it. Would that everybody in this country would say as much!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three months later, this man&mdash;this public spirited man&mdash;who is Chairman of the Board of Health in the County Sligo, deemed it his public duty to take a certain course in the discharge of his functions as Chairman of that Board.  The course he deemed it his duty to take did not please the acting Minister for Lands and Fisheries and it did not please the Parliamentary colleagues of the Acting Minister for Lands and Fisheries.  The attitude adopted towards that man was a cowardly attitude.  There was somebody looking for the position and that somebody was a friend of a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Three months after that speech was made the Acting Minister for Lands and Fisheries announces that he is going to discharge an honourable man from his position, not because it was ever suggested that that official betrayed his trust, but because the Minister for Lands and Fisheries does not agree with that official's estimate of what the law is.  I think that, if the Acting Minister for Lands and Fisheries took an example from this official, whom he saw fit to dismiss, it might do him no harm.  That official said that he was willing to abide by the decision of the court and if that was the general <Col N="2045" /> practice this country might not regret it.  But because an official of a Department had the courage to say that, his means of livelihood are taken away from him and justice has been done according to what Fianna Fáil's estimate of justice is.  That would be bad enough, but within 48 hours of that officer's dismissal an intimate personal friend of a Deputy for County Sligo was pitchforked into the position.</P>
    <P>I hope the acting Minister is proud of that.  I hope the Department for which he is responsible is proud of it. Jobbery of that kind, for jobbery it is, may produce a passing advantage for Fianna Fáil in the County Sligo, but in the long run the people of this country will turn with nausea from an action of that kind.  The people of this country still respect an honest and courageous man.  The job hunters and corruptionists may besiege the Minister's office in order to get him to do what the Minister ought to know is wrong.  He may please the job hunters temporarily, but that type of man will turn on him when it suits his own hand.  The decent people of Sligo will at some time get an opportunity of expressing their loathing and contempt for a transaction of that kind.</P>
    <P>I only hope that under the very special circumstances that have arisen this House will mark its disapproval of the treatment that man got by voting in the division which we shall challenge on this Estimate.  I desire to pay no unsought tributes to the members of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I have no hesitation in saying here that since I came into public life no other deed of that kind has been done.  Had I been asked I would have been prepared to asseverate that there was no man sitting on the Front Benches of the Fianna Fáil Party who would have been prepared to defend the treatment this man has had at the hands of the Minister responsible for the Irish Land Commission.  There are some other matters with which I had intended to deal, but under the circumstances having had to deal with this nauseating, this disgusting transaction, I think it <Col N="2046" /> might be better to defer ordinary details of administration to another occasion.  I look with every confidence to members on all sides of the House joining with us in expressing detestation of a transaction of this character.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I have spoken already on the Land Commission Estimates, I assume, as we are in Committee, that I am entitled to speak for a second time if I wish to do so. I want to support the remarks of Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Dillon.  Probably I have been associated much more intimately than either of the Deputies with Mr. Gallagher.  I can speak with four and a half years' experience of his work as an official of the Land Commission.  I can say this, and the Minister can have my statement verified by reference to his officials, that there was no more competent official than Mr. Gallagher in any part of the Twenty-Six Counties. He was an official of the Land Commission for a period of 22 years. He was appointed originally by the C.D. Board, and he continued in the service of the Land Commission after its transfer to the Free State Government.  In the years following the transfer, Mr. Gallagher's duties were particularly heavy, and during those years he discharged his work to the satisfaction of the Land Commission and more particularly to the satisfaction of the inspectors immediately in charge of County Sligo. During his whole period of service, not alone with the C.D. Board but with the Land Commission as well, his record has been a remarkably good one.  He has been recognised as one of the most efficient men in his position in the whole country.  It has been recognised that he has given satisfaction in the discharge of his duties. On no occasion has the Land Commission ever had to reprove him for negligence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was not a civil servant; he was a temporary official of the Land Commission and, consequently, he would not be amenable to the ordinary rules which apply to civil servants.  He was quite entitled to participate in the agitation in connection with the land annuities.  He was entitled also to <Col N="2047" /> participate in the agitation in connection with the payment of rates.  I believe his removal from office was largely due to the fact that he did take a particularly prominent part, as a member of the county council, in connection with the rates question. His removal from office is due to the vindictiveness of a member of the county council, who is also a representative of the constituency of Leitrim-Sligo.  There has been no official charge made against Mr. Gallagher over which the Minister dares stand.  The Minister knows perfectly well that if he examined the records of the Land Commission impartially he would find that no charge can be preferred against Mr. Gallagher.  Mr. Gallagher, as a temporary official, has discharged his duties satisfactorily during his whole period of service.  So far as I know it has never happened previously in the Land Commission that an official has been discharged because of certain action he took outside, which action, as a private citizen, as a farmer, as a ratepayer and as a taxpayer he was perfectly justified in taking.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dillon and MacDermot have dealt with the essential features of his case, and I do not want to prolong the discussion by touching upon them again.  I would like to ascertain from the Minister the real reason for Mr. Gallagher's dismissal. It was admitted in an interview between Deputy MacDermot and the acting Minister that there was no charge against Mr. Gallagher's integrity.  If there was no charge against his integrity then I would be interested to learn from the Acting-Minister if there is any charge at all against Mr. Gallagher.  I submit there is no charge, and his removal from office is due entirely to vindictiveness on the part of one of the Acting-Minister's own followers.  If the Minister is going to deal in this fashion with an official so efficient as Mr. Gallagher, because of representations made to him by his followers out of vindictiveness, then I must say that the position of the officials serving under the Acting-Minister is not a <Col N="2048" /> happy one and will not be a happy one in the future.</P>
    <P>This case has given rise to a good deal of comment, not alone in Sligo but in the adjoining counties of Mayo, Galway, Leitrim and Roscommon. There are officials in these counties occupying identically the same position as Mr. Gallagher did until he was removed by the acting Minister.  Some of these officials, I daresay, have also exercised their rights as citizens and as ratepayers.  Is this action on the part of the acting Minister to be taken as a headline?  It is the first time in the history of the Land Commission, so far as I am aware&mdash;and I do not believe the Minister is in a position to contradict me&mdash;that an official has been dismissed from office because of representations made by a very minor light in the Minister's own Party.  These representations were made by this individual who was animated by a certain amount of vindictiveness towards Mr. Gallagher because of his association with certain movements in Sligo.  I submit that the action of the acting Minister is a disgrace and a scandal and that it is really a reproach to the public service of this country.  If the Minister stands over an action of that kind then I submit that the position of civil servants and the officials not alone of the Land Commission but of every other Department as well is going to be very insecure indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to get this matter straight, it is well first of all to say what Mr. Gallagher's position was and what were his duties.  Mr. Gallagher was an employee of the Land Commission.  His duties were to collect the grazing and other rents from those who held the grazing of the farms in the hands of the Land Commission.  He was being paid for that work.  If he were an angel out of heaven, and I am not denying that he is, he was getting paid for doing the work.  He was not doing it out of any public spirit.</P>

He was paid for collecting these moneys and while he was holding that position he got up at a public meeting and said that he himself had not paid his land annuities and was not going to pay.  He said he was expecting a writ and that he was going to fight it. Is this the position taken up by Deputy Dillon and by Deputy Roddy and the other Deputy who spoke upon the matter: that any civil servant or public official is to be permitted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And Mr. Gallagher, at a public meeting, said he was not going to pay his land annuities and that he was going to fight the case.  He went a bit farther than that.  He is not quite such an inoffensive man as Deputy Dillon, Deputy Roddy and the rest of the Deputies here want to make out.  There was one gentleman, Mr. Williams, who got up and said: &ldquo;I do not see any reason why a man who is able to pay should not be made to pay.&rdquo;  At this point he was interrupted by Mr. Gallagher, and he repeated: &ldquo;I do not see why a man who is able to pay should not be made pay.  Whilst I am different in religion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;  Then Mr. Gallagher said: &ldquo;I will not allow you to introduce a religious element,&rdquo; and Mr. Williams said: &ldquo;The Bishops met at Maynooth and Cardinal MacRory told them the same.&rdquo;  Then Mr. Gallagher said: &ldquo;That does not arise.  I must ask you to sit down.&rdquo;  Well, we have told Mr. Gallagher to sit down at the moment.  The man who would do what he did is not fitted to be an official in the Land Commission, and I took steps as soon as I heard about the <Col N="2051" /> case to get Mr. Gallagher dismissed. Deputy Dillon talked about political victimisation, and Deputy Roddy had the impudence to say&mdash;and it was damned impudence on his part&mdash;that this was the first time that such a thing happened.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>He was dismissed because while being paid by the Land Commission for collecting rents he said that he himself was not going to pay his rent.  Certainly, I would not allow any man, whether a permanent or a temporary official, to hold his position while he was making such statements in public.  That is the long and short of the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the reason he ordered the dismissal of this man was because he had advocated a breach of the law. He never advocated it.  What he said was that he proposed to go to the courts and have the legal position defined, and the only implication which could be drawn from his words was that when the courts had spoken he would conform to the judicial decision.  What happened in respect of this very instalment?  The Minister's own supporters proved recalcitrant and would not pay the instalment, and the Minister had to come to the House and say that not only was he going to give a moratorium for the old instalments of land annuities, but he was going to give a moratorium for this famous June instalment.  The Minister, <Col N="2054" /> to the amazement of the House, said that in addition to the other instalments this also was going to be made subject to the moratorium.  This man never suggested that he would withhold it if the court ordered him to pay. On the contrary, he announced his intention of testing the legal proceedings, and the only implication is that if the legal proceedings went against him he would realise whatever possessions he had and pay, if it were physically possible for him to pay.</P>
      <P>Observe the sub-conscious defence that the Minister makes.  Deputy Roddy stated that this man was a man of high standing and that he had 22 years of honourable service.  What is the Minister's re-action?  &ldquo;Cumann na nGaedheal victimised us in the past&rdquo;&mdash;and then he stopped and became virtuous.  He said: &ldquo;We want to draw a veil over the past; we want to do no harm.&rdquo;  I pay this tribute to President de Valera, that I think he is trying to draw a veil over the past.  I have never hesitated to say that.  Deputies may not agree, but I am not ashamed to proclaim my view.  So far as this is concerned, I regard this as the proper place to say that I think it is a corrupt transaction.  I think it is a scandalous transaction.  I am convinced that this man was kicked out of his job to make room for a friend of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am convinced that he was put out of his job on account of his political convictions.  I am convinced that it was for these reasons, and for these reasons alone, that the Minister acted, and I am perfectly satisfied that this House, in the knowledge of the facts, must see what we see, that wherever an act of the Minister responsible for the Irish Land Commission can injure a political opponent by the misuse of his power he is going to do it; that he has done it, and that he means to do it in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out to the Centre Party and to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party that, in voting for the rejection of the Land Commission Vote on the ground that this official was dismissed, the principle they are standing for is that a public official can refuse to pay money to the Government while he is being paid by the Government. <Col N="2055" /> I also want to point out that 100,000 people, who were drawing no Government money, paid upwards of £1,600,000 in land annuities of the instalment which Mr. Gallagher refused to pay. I asked Mr. Gallagher did he refuse to pay because he had not the money and he said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Deputy MacDermot was present when I asked him.  I asked him could he deny that he used these words, and if he did so, to write in and let me know, and I would put his denial of them along with other evidence that was in my possession.  The words he used were these: &ldquo;I did not pay my annuity in June.  I have receipts from the Customs authorities showing that on two consignments of cattle I shipped I have paid £12 over my year's rent.  I am expecting a civil bill and I am going to fight it.  I do not want the organisation to fight it; I will fight it on my own.&rdquo;  If he fights it, he will fight with his own money, and not with Government money.</P>

      <P>Why did the Minister leave out the most significant passage of all?  &ldquo;I did not pay my annuity in June.  I was not prepared to pay it twice.&rdquo;  He was prepared to go into court and argue that it amounted to paying twice, and if it was decided under the law that he was to pay, he was prepared to abide by the judgment of the court.  What more could any good citizen say?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is no analogy between them.  If the Minister had put it to Mr. Gallagher when he interviewed him: &ldquo;Do you suggest that you are entitled to suspend your duties and to stop collecting rents?&rdquo;, a very different situation would arise.  I ask the Minister did Mr. Gallagher ever default on the collection of the rent? Mind you, he was under this impression for three months before the Minister took any action at all.  During that time did Mr. Gallagher ever default one penny in the collecting of the rent? He said: &ldquo;I take my view as to my rights.  The Land Commission takes a different view.  I am prepared to go into court and have our respective rights defined.  Until they are defined I hold my view, and do not deny their right to hold theirs.&rdquo;  What more could an honourable citizen say?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this matter is disposed of, I should like to remind the House and especially the Minister for Finance, who has just intervened, that a hundred times over throughout this meeting reference was made to the important legal proceedings that were pending in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer as to what happened to them.  That does not concern me.  The governing feature of the whole of this meeting was that those people were all interested and excited at the prospect of those legal proceedings.  Acting in the perfectly legitimate and natural way that any farmer would, whether a Government employee or not, he thought that the sensible course was to take such action in the court as would have the execution of the Civil Bill decree stayed until the case in Dublin was decided.  That was an absolutely natural and reasonable line to take.  In point of fact those who did not take it, and who paid, are in many cases sorry that they did.  I dare say my experience is not exceptional, and I have had letters from <Col N="2057" /> farmers who paid their instalments asking was there any system whereby they could get their money back.  The course the man took was a natural one.  I was constantly pressed to advise people not to pay their annuities last year, and I never agreed to give such advice.  I went further than a great deal of my supporters would like, by recommending that the people who could afford to pay should pay.  So far as Party influence was bearing on Mr. Gallagher it would be bearing in that direction.  He was perfectly entitled to take the view he took of the proceedings pending, and he took the perfectly natural commonsense course for a man to take under those circumstances.  Nothing the Minister has said has shaken me in the opinion that it was an outrage and a scandal to throw that man out after 21 years' service.</P>

      <P>As I suspected, the Minister has not been able to advance one valid reason for Mr. Gallagher's dismissal.  It has been demonstrated quite clearly that Mr. Gallagher acted quite within his rights.  By the course which Mr. Gallagher took he acted within his rights as an ordinary citizen, and the Minister, in replying to the case made by Deputy MacDermot, Deputy Dillon and the other speakers, has not attempted to repudiate their statements.  However, I am not so much interested in that point as I am in the statement he made in the course of his speech.  I said it was the first time an official of the Land Commission had been dismissed for political reasons since the Land Commission was transferred to the Free State Government.  I stated that very definitely.  The Minister said that was dammed insolence on my part.  Those were the words he used. Now I challenge the Minister to mention one case where an official of the Land Commission has been dismissed for his political views during the past ten or 11 years.  This is the first time, so far as I am aware, that a political test has been applied in the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>Those temporary-permanent officials were never fitted for their job, and were kept there for charity. This temporary-permanent official had <Col N="2059" /> 22 years' service.  He was being paid out of money that had been collected from those who did pay their annuities.  That was what he was being paid out of, and he was the man who was to go round and collect them, a man who would not pay his own and who was advising others not to pay.  I know very well if he was collecting my money what I would tell him.  I know very well what I would tell a gentleman who came round to me collecting and would not pay his own.  That was the position in this case.  I would like if these law-and-order gentlemen, who have turned up lately amongst us, would, first of all, try to keep a little law and order themselves.</P>

      <P>A certain policy was promised, or at least a diversion of policy was promised, by the people who, presumably, had the authority of the Fianna Fáil Party behind them.  At that time this Vote was the vote which was annually given in aid of the universities and there was a certain administrative policy carried out under that. I understood that an increased grant was to be included.  I gather now that that is not so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <P>I would not like to ask that a second member of the Fianna Fáil Party be put out of the House.  Since the more cultured man is gone, perhaps it is a pity that the less cultured man should remain.  There has been a particular policy in relation to the universities.  Certain moneys have been made payable.  They have been voted from year to year and there has arisen for criticism in relation to those institutions the existing policy. It used to be the policy of the Executive <Col N="2066" /> Council in relation to these universities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They give these sums because they are bound to do so by statute.  The moneys are paid.  We have no control over the administration and, therefore, I suggest that no questions of administration can be raised on an Estimate.  No debate can take place on the Estimate as to the policy of the Government in regard to the universities or as to any future legislation which may be contemplated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There does arise the point as to the reason for the moneys being voted.  We are told that the Vote is put before us in accordance with the statute.  We know quite well that the statute can be altered, repealed or amended, and we know quite well that is taking place at the moment.  We know further that in relation to every Estimate there has been discussed, not merely the use made of particular moneys, but the policy of the Government with regard to the voting of money in future, whether there is going to be an increase or decrease, and their particular attitude towards the Land Commission Vote, or any vote that comes up from time to time.  That is the point which I am querying here. We do know there has been a certain deprivation in regard to this institution. That arises under another measure, and I will deal with it in good time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy proposes to discuss the general educational policy of the Government with particular reference to university education, he has lost his opportunity.  That discussion should have taken place on the <Col N="2067" /> Vote with which the Minister for Education was connected.  It is quite clearly laid down in the Standing Orders that once a question has been disposed of in a major Vote it cannot be resurrected in a minor Vote.  There is nothing in this Vote for which the Government has any administrative responsibility whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that matters relating to the University always fall for discussion under the Vote of the Minister for Finance, and not under the Vote of the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Never under education certainly, because it does not arise here.  The Minister is now trying to argue that the Government have no responsibility for the administration of the universities.  Then he suddenly tells me that the Minister for Education has.  That I completely and entirely deny.  The only responsibility the Government has is with regard to the sums they vote each year as grants-in-aid or as annual votes to the university. Why they do that is a proper matter for discussion here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have to keep quiet and listen.  I am not to be subjected to any examination by the Minister.  I would like to have some indication from the Minister, if those who support him are not capable of speaking on this matter, of the respects in which changes were thought desirable and as to what was supposed to be wrong with the use made by the universities of the money they got, of the things in which they were deficient, and how it was proposed that changes were to be effected if changes were considered desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that nationalist matter on which I have spoken, there was criticism made many a time here by people now in the Government, when they were in Opposition, that the trend of university education was not as nationalist in its outlook as might have been expected from a university calling itself a national university; that its economics were not properly directed, and there was criticism of the general principles of the teaching and the instruction that was given in economics.  The point was urged on one occasion by a person who now holds a financial position behind the Government that there should be a limitation of the number of students who were allowed to go to a university; that there should be a quota system established with regard to the Faculties.  It was suggested that, of necessity, people opting for a Faculty which found itself congested in a particular year, should have to await their turn until the next year. Whether these were the things in the minds of the people who wrote a <Col N="2069" /> certain pamphlet to the graduates of the university, I do not know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we in order in discussing what certain people wrote to the graduates of the university?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be interesting to get these people to state their views as to what they meant by this, nowithstanding that the Minister wants to put them under the same process of oppression as he himself was put under on finance matters.  It is to be expected that people who address themselves to a constituency and appear to indicate that they have a Government policy in their minds, and indicate a particular change which they think is going to be made in the relation of the State towards the university, should take an opportunity which educated people would welcome of stating their point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that that opportunity will arise but that opportunity does not arise on the Estimates.  It is a principle that has long been upheld in this House that questions of policy and future legislation cannot be discussed here on the Estimates.  On the Estimates we are bound down to the narrow subject of administration.  These grants are being properly administered, I submit, so far as the Government are concerned, once the money has been paid and the money will be paid as soon as this Vote is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very ordinary thing in a Vote to have people criticising certain moneys which are being voted giving as their reason for doing so that these moneys should not be paid because according to their criticism the moneys are not being properly used.  That is the contention I expect will be taken by the people who will speak&mdash;if not by the Minister.  If he does not he can keep quiet then and give them an opportunity of explaining the point that I am raising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not a person who ordinarily wants an excuse for taking up the time of the House.  He has been generally inexcusable.  We had the Minister not merely without excuse but with no possible excuse.  I approve of these moneys being granted.  I think that the institutions receiving these moneys are operating in the best possible way for the good of this country and for its education.  Within the very limited resources that they receive they are giving an education which can bear very favourable comparison with the education given to any students in any country in the world.  The education which they are giving is to be praised, not merely on the grounds of the nationalist outlook that is around that institution and which pervades its teachings and not merely because of the soundness of the particular men in this institution in regard to their work, but also because of the very definite character that lies behind everything that they do.  And if as is the case, any one of these three points is criticised or has been criticised in a loose fashion in an address made at any time or place I say that where that criticism should be advanced and borne out in detail is here on this Vote.  Any attempt to avoid it is deplorable.</P>

      <P>This criticism has been passed upon institutions which are referred to under sub-heads (a) and (b) of this Vote.  The criticism has been on the point to which I have referred.  The institution in question, the National University, belies its name!  It is not national in any way, and it is particularly not national in the use that is made of the facilities afforded to it in relation to the Irish language and it has then been particularly brought under criticism in that it is supposed to have pervading all its economic teachings a certain spirit which is not of the thought or deliberations of those who are trying to operate a policy at the moment! What we have to regard is the deliberation behind such a policy. When I say that, I do not insist that there is thought or economic teaching or a national spirit behind that policy. The criticism has been made that it is the duty of this House to interfere with the people who are appointed under the Charter and statutes of the University.  We were told that it was a proper subject matter for debate in this House.  What would fall for discussion is the number of students <Col N="2072" /> who would come to the University, and whether there should be any regulation of them or of the Faculties which they should attend.  In fact the mentality which pervades this pamphlet to which I refer is that the University ought to become as much a State controlled institution as the industry and commerce of the country has become at the moment.  We were to interfere with regard to what professions are allocated from time to time amongst the various students; what moneys are paid from time to time, what they are to teach the students, what Faculties students are allowed to congregate in and to say what are the Faculties from which they will be ruled out.  That is the clearest sort of autonomy for the University!</P>

      <P>I do not accept Deputy McGilligan's point that we can discuss whether the voting of this money interferes with the <Col N="2074" /> autonomy of the College&mdash;whether there is any attempt to interfere.  I believe that there are certain regulations governing these grants which would make that point clear.  I do think, however, that Deputy McGilligan so far has not gone beyond the scope which he is entitled to go in discussing the Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out, in that connection, that the universities are very jealous of their autonomy; that if we were entitled to discuss any one of the matters raised by Deputy McGilligan in this House the mere discussion would be an interference with the autonomy of the universities?  If the discussion was such that it convinced members of this House that certain restrictions should be imposed on the universities with regard to any one of the matters which he has raised in this debate legislation would inevitably follow and that legislation would be an interference with their autonomy.  Even the discussion of the matter is to impose a potential limitation on the autonomy of the universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I submit with respect, sir, that you have misunderstood the point I was making?  What the Minister says amounts to this: that even to attempt to discuss whether universities ought to be autonomous or not is an infringement of their autonomy and cannot be admitted.  If that is the point, and if that is accepted, and if, therefore, all discussion of universities is to be completely wiped out of the House, I am agreeable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking that as having a meaning adverse to the Minister's contention.  There has been very definite criticism of the National University on three grounds: (1) that it is not properly called, or properly named, as an institution, by reason of its failure to develop fully along Gaelic lines as far as the language is concerned; (2) that it has not its doctrines informed with national spirit in the matter of economics, whether they relate to agriculture or industry; (3) there has often been criticism of it&mdash; how the criticism can be met I do not know&mdash;that it has allowed students to congregate in large numbers in its Faculties without any attempt to regulate these students; not to let them regulate themselves according to their desires as to what profession they think they are fit for, or what they want to do in later life, but that there should be&mdash;and that was urged from this side of the House by at least two speakers&mdash; a definite regulation of the numbers who enter certain Faculties each year, and that, in so regulating, there should be attention paid, not so much to the capacities and dispositions of the potential students, but to the numbers that should graduate year by year in certain Faculties; that there should be some mind who would consider outside the optimum number that should be allowed to graduate in, say, medicine, law, art, etc., and that the College should be so regulated.  I oppose any criticism of the University on these three grounds.  As I said before I think it is fantastic, as well as being nonsensical, to suggest that there should be any regulation of the number of students and, particularly, that there should be any such regulation based merely upon the students who should emerge as qualified men at the end of a particular period, without attention being paid, if attention should be paid by anybody outside, to their capacities, temperament and inclination towards certain pursuits.</P>

Two colleagues of the Minister's, Deputy Little, now Parliamentary Secretary, and the Ceann Comhairle, discussed the very matter that I am discussing at the moment, and on this Estimate.  If there seems absurdity in the particular thing I am discussing it is not I who am responsible for the absurdity, but those two Deputies who put forward this contention about the regulation of the student in relation to certain Faculties.  I well remember raising, as an objection to that particular regulation, the point as to what would happen to a student who had indicated that he thought he had a talent for engineering, and on arriving at the process of being entered up as an engineering student found, under Deputy Little's proposal, that the engineering Faculty was full, but that the Faculty belonging to the clergy was not yet filled up?  Could that gentleman transfer himself to the clerical Faculty for a year, until such time as the engineering Faculty had got rid of some of the pupils?  That was the subject of discussion in this House.</P>

      <P>All I have to say is that the policy of the Department in giving the beet sugar factory beet for nothing out of public money is, to my mind, exceedingly imprudent.  I am aware that a defence has been raised, and will probably be raised by Deputy McGilligan to-day, and by his colleague, Deputy Hogan, if he were here, that the terms offered to the beet sugar factories in this country were no better than the terms offered to similar enterprises in Great Britain.  That is no answer.  The fact is that the subsidy which the beet sugar factories have been getting during the past eight or ten years has resulted in their having their sugar for nothing, and being in a position to sell it and to have the entire sale price as gross profit.  I have no doubt whatever that that has resulted in material advantage to the farmers in the neighbourhood of Carlow, but I very much doubt if it has not had a very grave effect upon the farmers in other parts of the country, who have been obliged to foot the bill in the long run.  Furthermore, I am not at all satisfied that, considering the measure of subsidy which this factory is getting, they are giving farmers anything like a fair price for their beet. The Minister will remember that there was an acrimonious dispute about two years ago on this very question, and the end of it was, I think, that the factory succeeded in bringing down the price of beet from 42/- to 37/-.  I doubt very much if the figure of 37/- as a basic rate is fair, considering the dimensions of the subsidy this factory is getting.  I understand&mdash;and here again I must ask the Chair to rule&mdash; that it has been popularly reported, and I think Ministers have stated in public, that it was their intention to set up other beet sugar factories in different parts of the country.  Is it permissible to discuss that in the light of our knowledge of the subsidy which we are at present discussing?</P>

      <P>If the existing statute only gives power to give a subsidy to one factory, then I am not free to pursue that line of argument.  I think, considering the amount of subsidy annually granted to the beet sugar factory, the attitude of the factory to the farmers who supply the beet is extremely stingy, bearing in mind the subsidy they get which enables them to have the sugar manufactured and refined and actually put into bags for nothing, and being in the position to sell the sugar at the price ruling in the market, and taking the entire proceeds of the sale as gross profits.</P>
      <P>Before another year has passed the Minister should insist upon a close examination of that system being made, with a view to ascertaining whether the farmers are getting a fair share of whatever benefits accrue as a result of the setting up of that factory there.  For his information I can tell the Minister that if he looks at a report of the Public Accounts Committee for last year, he will there find a memorandum prepared in his own Department, setting out how the subsidy has worked, and what it means to the factory every year.  If he studies that report I think he will be inclined to agree with me that the promoters of the beet sugar factory are getting a great deal more than either the consumers or the producers of beet in this country.</P>

      <P>I only want to say a few words in order to endeavour to get from the Minister for Agriculture an idea of what the future <Col N="2082" /> policy of the Government in regard to beet sugar in this country will be.  I do not intend to infringe upon the rulings given by the Chair a few moments ago, that, in as far as it required further legislation for State grants, this matter could not be discussed. But it does not follow that the beet sugar industry cannot be developed in this country without further grants.  I would like a definite statement from the Minister as to whether he considers that in the setting up of any factory for the production of sugar out of beet in any part of the country, it will be necessary to give State assistance.  I would also ask whether the Minister would be in a position to say what State assistance would be considered necessary if any is required.  I shall assume, for the moment, that no State assistance will be required, and I ask the Minister, on that assumption, in what part of the country it is his intention to set up the new beet factories that he has already made reference to.  The Minister is aware of the fact that in my constituency of South Mayo&mdash;and it is not unique in this respect&mdash;there is a very great desire to have a beet factory set up.  If it can be done economically, and without tremendous State expenditure, and especially if it can be done without any State expenditure, then it would undoubtedly be of the very greatest assistance to the farmers, and especially to the small farmers, who make up, I may say, 99.5 per cent. of the agricultural inhabitants of Mayo.  I am sure that the natural sympathies by birth of Deputy Dillon for his native Mayo are quite as strong as his sympathy by adoption is for County Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have learned from the Deputy.  There is this advantage about beet growing.  It is a form of agriculture that gives more employment than any other.  Other crops, such as corn crops, give practically no employment.  One man and a pair of horses can sow a considerable acreage of corn, and corn is reaped by the same process.  There is no <Col N="2083" /> employment given in growing grain except to one man for many acres, and a few casual labourers for stooking and threshing.  Beet is a different crop.  It requires attention continuously.  The land must be prepared for it, cleaned especially, and kept very clean throughout the whole course of the year.  Again the pulling of the beet crop is a very long job, and gives a considerable amount of employment.  It does not mean merely casual employment for a week or two.  It gives steady work for individuals all through the year.  Therefore the beet crop, very much more than any other crop grown in this country, gives employment, and for that reason sugar beet is from the point of view of employment the most important crop that could be grown in the country. Potatoes and turnips give a great deal more employment than the growing of grain, but beet sugar, especially, gives more employment than any other form of agriculture and for that reason I would like very much to know if the Minister can tell us if there is any chance of the beet factory going to be put up in the particular part of Mayo in which I am interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few remarks about this whole matter which may have some repercussion on future policy in relation to the functions of other factories in this country.  Many factories have been promised.  I do not know whether it is wheat, beet or peat that the Government is going to take its stand upon. They are all rather a shaky foundation for anyone to build future industries of his country upon, but they are selected, and selected mainly by the Minister for Agriculture.  I would like the Minister to answer one question, that is, as to whether he has the slightest hope that there is going to be a beet factory established in this country without some form of Government assistance.  The Act referred to in this debate was 37 of 1925, under the first section of which this money was granted.  That Act was passed by this House in the belief that the inauguration of the sugar beet industry in this country was going to lead to two things, one <Col N="2084" /> a permanent matter, namely, that there was going to be an extension of winter tillage in the country and the second was the hope that by degrees as people in the country got used to this crop the necessity for a subsidy would disappear or, at any rate, the necessity for so large a subsidy would disappear.  Part of that was a hope. Part of that was a certainty.  In fact, the subsidy was made so high, because of the disturbed condition of the country at the time when this scheme was inaugurated, that it was impossible to get people to have any confidence in this country at that time or, at any rate, to have as much confidence as would be evidenced by the investment of big amounts of their money except under conditions that would amount to making the return on their money almost a gilt-edged security.  If they did not get that gilt-edged security they had to be granted such subsidies as would enable them, in a very short time indeed, to recover the capital they had sunk in the company.  Those being the conditions in the year 1925, this outside company, being very expert in this particular product and in the manufacture and marketing of sugar manufactured from beet, were asked to come in here, and they agreed to do so under certain conditions.  One of the things attempted at the time was to get some evidence that the people here had confidence in the project themselves by getting the nationals of this country to subscribe to it and, accordingly, an attempt was made to get the people of this country to put their money into it. I think that the total amount secured from the people of this country was less than £10,000.  That was all that was subscribed by the people of this country, although, at that time, this investment could be represented as yielding, at the minimum, 10 per cent. on the amount invested.  It must be borne in mind also that it could be evidenced at that time that this country was suited to the growing of sugar beet, and that, at least on demonstration plots, the sugar content of the beet grown here was equal, on the average, to that of the beet grown in England and even generally, <Col N="2085" /> excepting for bad seasons, of a higher sugar content.  Again, building on the fact that the experiment had been tried in England and had failed there, we were enabled to get certain alleviations of the terms of this foreign company, and to get a scheme which, from the point of view of the subsidy paid, was a better proposition than any of the English schemes; and yet it was a very big proposition for this country and one which has laid a very heavy burden on the people of this country.  It was a scheme which, in retrospect, cannot be said to have been an economic proposition and it arises here in the light of the fact that the Government had made up their minds that the getting of sugar from beet grown in this country is an economic proposition.  By the term &ldquo;economic proposition&rdquo; I mean one which is regarded as being a paying or even a self-supporting proposition. I know that that aspect of any proposition does not often enter into the mind of the present Minister for Agriculture.  All he thinks about is a licence or a subsidy, and almost anything can be made to appear good under these circumstances.  But looking at it from the angle of prices paid here, of productivity, extra wealth, and of the burdens placed on the consumer, I should like to have the view of the Minister for Agriculture as to whether he sees the slightest hope of this proposition ever becoming an economic one in the sense in which I have used the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the back of this experiment was the idea that it would inaugurate an extension of winter tillage in the country.  I do not know whether the Minister has examined the beet areas in this country or whether any more precise information on the subject has been got than was in the possession of this House before.  If the Minister has not got any more information than was available at that time I think he will have to admit that there has been no greater extension of the area in tillage as a result of the production of beet, because what we know happened was that the people went out of one type of tillage and into the production of <Col N="2086" /> beet, but the amount of land, previously not tilled, and now put under beet, was very small indeed.  It is doubtful if, over the whole country, there was any considerable amount of land better used by reason of this very big subsidy for this really uneconomic proposition.</P>
    <P>These points should be taken into consideration by the Minister if he thinks of inaugurating more beet growing in the country&mdash;unless we are to regard this proposition as on a par with the promise of economies amounting to £2,000,000&mdash;just a paper business or a promise never meant to be implemented.  In this connection also, if the Minister is going to say that he is going to have other factories in the country, would he at least tell us, if not the towns in the neighbourhood of which these factories are going to be erected, at least the counties in which it is proposed to erect them?  The reason for this is that I think he will admit that there are certain counties that he must rule out for all time with regard to the growing of beet, and that if he is going to pursue this policy he must realise that there is a very narrow range to his activities.  I think it would help Deputies, and possibly in the end it would help the Government, if there could be a definite statement made that there are certain areas comprised in certain counties which, under no consideration, could be looked upon as suitable areas for the growth of sugar beet.  If a statement of that kind could be made authoritatively I think it would save Deputies a lot of annoyance, because every Deputy has to be up and doing when any project of this kind is mooted, His constituents are after him and he has got to be up and doing to see that his area has got proper consideration or, as in the case of some of these areas, improper consideration, because they could not possibly be used for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It is quite easy now to pass criticism on this subsidy.  I say &ldquo;easy,&rdquo; looking at it from the angle from which people had to look at it in 1924.  There was in the background of the consciousness of the people who <Col N="2087" /> inauguarated this, the idea of getting development going in some way.  There was also the promise held out, but it was not fulfilled, of getting extra tillage.  It can be now said that the scheme was wholly and entirely uneconomic and that the people have been made pay more than was reasonable for sugar.  The results which were expected from this increased burden on the consumers of sugar, the expectations in the way of extra tillage, have hardly been fulfilled.  There is very little in the balance to set against the loss to which the contributing population has been put.</P>
    <P>There is a time coming in relation to this subsidy when a halt has got to be made and some review taken of the circumstances.  That will come when this subsidy expires, and it will shortly expire.  As we are a year or two ahead of that, however, if the Minister is thinking of going forward on some subsidy ground, there is enough information collected on the points criticised here to enable us to get from him a statement as to whether there is the slightest hope of getting sugar beet grown in this country free of a Government subsidy or other artificial aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked by Deputy Dillon to examine closely the prices that growers are paid for their beet in the Carlow factory and make a comparison with the subsidy paid to the factory.  The Deputy gave figures to show that the Carlow factory is making a large gross profit.  I have gone into these figures carefully, but it does not make any great difference whether I examined them or not, because the Government are tied by the agreement our predecessors made in relation to the Carlow factory.  There is not much use in speaking of profits or huge subsidies in relation to the Carlow factory, because there is no remedy for that until the time is up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said his Government made a very good agreement with the Carlow factory.  That may be so, but he did not give all the facts, particularly when he mentioned that the subsidy here is less than is <Col N="2088" /> paid in Great Britain.  I have the figures here relating to the subsidy paid last year.  The subsidy paid in the case of British factories, both directly and indirectly, amounted to 12/- per ton, while in the Irish Free State the figure was 22/6.  There might be some defence for that if we had the satisfaction of knowing that there was something passed on to the growers, but that is not so.  The suppliers of the Carlow factory are not getting as much all round as the suppliers of the British factories.  I agree that the sugar beet scheme was one of the good things done by the last Government.  The growing of beet was encouraged and it was a good thing from the point of view of increasing the area under tillage. Deputy McGilligan now denounces this scheme and thinks that our experience of it ought to be sufficient to induce the Government to drop the growing of beet altogether.  He said there was no increase of tillage.</P>
    <P>We investigated this matter with a view to getting a report before considering the extension of beet growing. The Committee investigating the matter pointed out that the agricultural instructors were asked to call to a number of farms where beet was grown and find out whether tillage had increased.  It is true that tillage has not increased on a number of these farms, but it has increased to a small extent in some.  At any rate, tillage has not decreased.  If tillage has held its own on these particular farms during the last six or seven years, it is something.  During the period when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in power tillage decreased, and if sugar beet was sufficient to prevent a further decrease, something was gained; it is equivalent to an increase of tillage in that way.  Beet growing has induced some people to remain in tillage while their neighbours were going away from tillage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asked if I thought legislation would be necessary for the growing of beet. Legislation for that purpose will be necessary in some form or other. There could, for instance, be an <Col N="2089" /> ordinary customs duty imposed on sugar coming in, and the putting on of that duty would mean legislation. Alternatively, beet-growing could be encouraged under the present system of a direct subsidy as well as an indirect protection by way of customs duty.  In either case legislation would be necessary.  I am convinced that beet cannot be grown economically under ordinary world competitive conditions.  If we were to take the customs duty off sugar and give no direct subsidy I am certain that beet could not be bought by any factory on ordinary competitive lines.  We may take it, therefore, that legislation will be necessary if we are to extend the growing of beet.</P>
    <P>We have not reached the point where I could answer the question as to what parts of the country would be suitable for factories.  The matter is being investigated by a committee, and I expect that committee will be able to submit a report in the near future.  If the Government decides, as I believe they will, on an extension of beet-growing, we hope to have at least some factories established for the 1934 crop.  Where these factories are to be established I am not in a position at present to say.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asked what would be the considerations in the selection of a particular site.  I could not at the moment answer that question, but I imagine the first consideration would be suitable agricultural conditions.  We would want an area in which the beet could be grown profitably and, having got that area, the next question would be a site where all the necessary conditions would be fulfilled with regard to transport, water, the disposal of sewage, and other conditions, such as supplies of lime, easy access of fuel and so on. All these matters will be taken into consideration, and the sites would, I presume, be chosen by whatever experts would be attached to this particular scheme.  The experts will choose these sites in an area where they are of opinion that the best beet could be grown.</P>

      <P>In these circumstances we will discuss the whole matter, but I do venture to think that if the Minister had introduced the Gárda Vote before I spoke, as I have to speak on the matters connected with it, it would save time.  What I purpose doing is discussing very largely the question of the policy of the Minister upon this Vote and then go back upon the policy and upon the general question concerned with the administration of the Gárda Síochána on the next Estimate.  Of course, the most important part of the Department of the Minister for Justice is the part of it which is connected with the administration of the Gárda Síochána.  This year we have had very great changes in the Gárda Síochána and I certainly would have liked to have heard the Minister upon this Vote before I come in any way to discuss it.  We have had most sweeping and most drastic alterations made in that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had two of the most efficient members of the Gárda Síochána, the Commissioner and a Chief Superintendent, dismissed and dismissed for efficiency.  There was no fault to be found with them.  Nobody in this House, no member of the Administration could allege that in any way they had been guilty of dereliction of duty.  Nobody could say that they did not discharge the duties of their office with the highest skill and with the highest efficiency.  It could never be suggested that these two officers of the Guards were not the most distinguished men in the service and yet we discover that as part of the administration of the Department of Justice without any reason and for no good cause, but quite wantonly, we have these high officers removed from their positions.  As far as the successor of the Commissioner is concerned, I do not wish to say anything.  I sincerely hope, as everybody who is interested in this force must hope, that he is a man who will ultimately make good, but I do think from what we see at the present moment that there is being an effort made by the Minister for Justice to change, to swap, and to make every alteration seemingly that he can.  In other words, the Minister <Col N="2093" /> is a very new broom and he has got it into his head&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was mentioning, there has been a policy evidently of making as many alterations as possible and seemingly making them wantonly and without excuse.  It is pretty obvious from the speech which the Commissioner made in the presence of the Minister for Justice at the Depot, which I have quoted, that the Minister for Justice must have been opposed to the policy of his colleague, the Minister for Finance, in introducing a cut in the pay of the Guards.  It seems to me, judging from the Minister's actions recently, that he wishes completely, if I may use the expression, to stymie the Minister for Finance.  If the Minister for Finance has insisted, against what I take to be his wishes, that the pay of the Guards should be cut, he has evidently made up his mind that in another direction he will manage to waste so much money in the administration of the Guards that at the end of the year he will be able to snap his fingers in the face of the Minister for Finance and say: &ldquo;You thought you were going to save £33,000 this year on the Guards' Vote, but I have taken good care that you have not.&rdquo;  As far as I can see, there has been, at what must be enormous expense to the ratepayers, a general shifting during the last few months of chief superintendents, inspectors, sergeants and Guards.  You will hardly find one chief superintendént in the district in which he was a year ago.  They are all being run about.  In the same way, you will see changes in ordinary superintendents almost daily.  All that is done at State expense.  To move a Guard at State expense even is a heavy item.  To move a chief superintendent, or a superintendent, is a very much heavier expense.  These changes are being carried out now, and men are being moved from one station to another at a rate at which there could be no precedent for in the administration of the Guards up to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2094" /> I think every Deputy will agree with me that if there is need for economy in the Guards, and necessity to cut the pay of the Guards by £33,000, it would be far better to see what economies could be effected in the administration of the Guards, and that there should not be what appears to me&mdash;and it is an opinion that I shall hold until the Minister can give an adequate explanation&mdash;a deliberate waste of public money in unnecessary transfers of officers and men from station to station and from county to county.  Then again &mdash;I dare say the Minister was quite right in this&mdash;there has been a tremendous number of promotions from one grade to another.  The result of the cuts has been completely minimised.  I have already expressed my view that the cuts are entirely wrong.  As far as that is concerned, I was very glad to see that the Minister for Finance had got the worst of this internecine strife between himself and the Minister for Justice.  But, in the other respect in which the Minister for Justice has shown himself so determined to reduce the Minister for Finance's scheme to a state of complete impotence, he seems to forget that when he is wasting public money by the unnecessary transfers which are going on, he is not only causing a great deal of trouble and inconvenience to various individuals, but, at the same time, he is lessening very much the value of the force.  If you have an officer who knows a district, he is very much more useful there than an officer who does not know the district.  I have in mind the case of one headquarters where there was a chief superintendent and an ordinary superintendent.  The chief superintendent has been a considerable time in the county, and knew the county.  The superintendent, a very excellent officer, had been in his station for some time, and he knew his station.  Suddenly, in the same week, the chief superintendent is sent to a county right across the whole width of Ireland, and the superintendent is removed to headquarters, some couple of hundred miles away.  Two entirely new men are put in to do the work. That seems to be an entirely unnecessary change.  It must be obvious to <Col N="2095" /> every Deputy that wantonly moving men who know their districts and the work of their districts, and as a general scheme, putting in men who are strangers, militates very much against the efficiency of the force.</P>

    <Title>In Committee on Finance. - Trade Loans (Guarantee) (Amendment) Bill, 1933.&mdash;Fourth and Fifth Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;&mdash;(Minister for Industry and Commerce.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, before Section 3 (c), to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No loan shall be so guaranteed or made of an amount exceeding the actual net value, at the time such loan is guaranteed or made, of the borrower's investment in the business financed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of course is to produce a safeguard to help in securing that in future this scheme shall work less expensively for the State than it has done in the past, and to prevent the money or the credit of the State being used in financing men of straw, who themselves have not got an adequate interest in the business affected.  When we were in Committee on this Bill I put the question to the Minister for Finance (column 1256, volume 47, No. 4 of the Official Debates): &ldquo;When a loan or guarantee is made, is it normally from the point of view that the State expects not to lose money even if the business proves unprofitable?&rdquo; The Minister for Industry and Commerce replied &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  I submit that if the object is to see that even if the business is not a success the State should be reasonably free from loss, it is a very moderate requirement indeed that the amount of the loan shall not exceed the value of the borrower's investment in the business.  If a man <Col N="2096" /> or a concern has only £10,000 in the business, whether in the form of working capital or in the form of fixed assets, plant and so forth, or divided between the two, it is not reasonable that the State should provide more than another £10,000.</P>
    <P>There seems to have been a certain amount of confusion in the mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to this matter when we were discussing a somewhat similar amendment on the Committee Stage. He kept referring to the relation of working capital to fixed capital, and he objected to any provision of the kind I am now seeking to introduce on the ground that cases would occur where working capital might be very small in relation to fixed capital, and that one could safely guarantee a larger amount than might appear on the surface. That observation is really irrelevant, because when we speak of the borrower's investment in the business of course fixed capital is included just as much as working capital.  I maintain that if the State is to put more money into a concern than the borrower is putting into it, it should do so definitely in the form of an investment and not as a loan at all.  You go beyond the bounds of a reasonable loan if you go beyond that limit.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that legislation might be introduced making it possible for the State to make such investments.  In column 1276 of the same volume he says: &ldquo;Not merely may we require this Act enabling us to provide long-term loan facilities, but we may also have to provide machinery by which industrialists of another kind may get capital invested in their undertakings&mdash;I mean put into the business, left in the business and remunerated in proportion to the profits.  We are examining the possibility of meeting that particular deficiency in our financial organisation. It may involve legislation, or it may not.&rdquo;  Whether that legislation is introduced or is not introduced I submit that it is clear that if a larger amount of money is to be provided for any individual or concern than that individual or concern is investing in the business, between fixed capital and <Col N="2097" /> working capital, it is not proper that it should be by means of a loan.  If the State is to do that at all&mdash;and personally I should very much look askance at the idea of the State's doing it at all, though it might help out with legislation in such a way as would encourage private individuals to do it&mdash;it should certainly do it in a way which holds out a hope of some return to the State commensurate with the risk that is being undertaken.  In other words, the State should not merely get the interest on its money that it would expect to get anyhow from a perfectly safe loan, but, if it is going to take a risk like that, it should get a share of profits in the case of the business succeeding, because in the case of the business failing it is perfectly obvious that, under those conditions making a loan of that size, the State will lose a large part of its money in the future as it has done in the past.  I wish to appeal earnestly to the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The main idea behind this amendment was discussed at some length on another amendment moved by the same Deputy on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I indicated then why I thought that no such limitation as the Deputy proposes should be inserted in the measure. It has been the practice heretofore, since the change of Government, to administer the Act as if there were a limitation similar to that which the Deputy suggests.  In other words, we have, as a general rule, refused to guarantee a loan to be raised by any company unless the total assets of the undertaking were twice, or more than twice, the amount of the loan to be guaranteed.  I have said that has been the general rule, but there may have been cases where the amount put in by the other party was somewhat in excess or somewhat less than 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying to the Dáil that if this Bill goes through it will be administered by me in the same manner as previous legislation, that is we will require as a general rule, that the amount of the loan to be guaranteed shall not exceed 50 per <Col N="2098" /> cent. of the total amount to be put into a new business by an applicant, or the total amount of the assets of the existing business owned by an applicant.  At the same time, I think that the Deputy who proposes that the limitation should be made statutory has not attempted to examine the vast administrative problems that would be involved.  I will give merely the example of an application by the owner of an existing business who desires to extend that business, and for the purpose of the extension desires to have a loan guaranteed by the State.  Before we could give a guarantee, if this amendment were accepted, it would be necessary to have a complete valuation of the assets of the existing concern even if we were reasonably satisfied that these assets were in excess of the amount of the loan.  The fact that this amendment was in the Bill would require that we would have to carry out a valuation of the fixed assets, book debts, stock in trade, perhaps, even the goodwill of the undertaking. Only when we have made that valuation and probably secured agreement upon the valuation, which would be most unlikely, would any Minister be in a position to guarantee the loan. At any rate, it is clear whatever assets of the undertaking would be regarded as valid would have to be valued, and we would have to be satisfied on the report of the valuer that these assets did exist against the amount of the loan to be guaranteed.  In the case of a new concern that difficulty does not exist against the amount of the ing the money to put up from his own resources a similar amount, but in the case of an existing concern the difficulty would be almost insuperable. There would be considerable delay and expense so that existing concerns would not avail of this at all. The Deputy said the reason for his amendment was to secure that the expenses of the State would be less in the future than in the past.  The amendment would secure nothing of the kind.  If he examines the cases in which a State guarantee had to be made good he will find that his principle was adhered to, with one or two exceptions, and there were other safeguards <Col N="2099" /> such as that which required that the loan guaranteed should only be applied to the erection of fixed assets.</P>
    <P>I told the Deputy during the Committee Stage that no amendment he could devise would protect the State against bad administration.  The losses incurred in the past were, in my opinion, due to bad administration, and I stated that on the Committee Stage.  I do not want to discuss it again now.  Each of us will hold his own point of view on that matter no matter what is said.  The fact is, even if the Deputy's amendment had been insertion in the previous Act, the whole amount lost would have been lost.  The insertion of a provision of this kind would not prevent it.  The Deputy suggested there was some confusion in my mind because I suggested that in every industry the amount invested in fixed assets to the total capital varies.  I think if he reads again what I said he will see that I was pointing out that the security which exists for the loan varies in each case.  Heretofore, loans were secured upon all the assets of the undertaking, but the substantial thing we had to see before the loan was granted was the fixed assets&mdash;plant, machinery, buildings, land and other property which could be easily realised.  I am not saying that book debts have not proved to be assets in certain cases, but as a rule they are not.  What I mean is, that when we have got to the stage of default upon loan repayment, and that the State has taken over control of the assets to be realised for the purpose of diminishing its losses very little can, as a rule, be realised on book debts.  The thing upon which the State can seize are the fixed assets.</P>
    <P>There is a trade loan under examination, at the moment, in my Department, in which the amount of capital to be invested in fixed assets is six times the amount of working capital.  In that case there would be assets representing six-sevenths of the capital available there.  The security behind a loan of six-sevenths of the total amount to be invested is just as good as it would be in the case where <Col N="2100" /> the fixed assets only represented 50 per cent. of the assets and only 50 per cent. was secured by loan.  That is an important consideration I think.  I say that whether or not the value of the fixed assets exceeded 50 per cent. of the total liability the general rule of only giving 50 per cent. of the amount would remain in operation; except in very exceptional cases where the industry was of a kind that would be regarded as definitely experimental, and those coming in wanted to have the evidence of the State backing, and the security as to the future that the State backing provides; or where exceptional circumstances existed and the whole development of the industry or its establishment in this country at all depended upon the State being able to guarantee an amount more than 50 per cent. of the total to be invested. These are the considerations which, in my opinion, make it most inadvisable to put a limit of this kind into the Bill.  As I said, the Bill will be administered in the majority of cases as though that limitation was there. On the other hand, its inclusion in the Bill might prevent a very useful development which could not, or would not, be undertaken because of the absence of power in the State to guarantee a larger amount than the Deputy is prepared to permit.  Under these circumstances, and because of the inadvisability of imposing a limitation of this kind without quite clearly seeing how this is to operate, this amendment must be resisted.</P>

      <P>In the absence of General Mulcahy, I beg to move the amendment standing in his name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  If and whenever the Minister is of opinion, whether, following the receipt of representations from any local authority or otherwise, that the entry of the public or the use by the public of any particular area of foreshore, whether belonging to Saorstát Eireann or not, for purposes of recreation is desirable in the public interest the Minister may by order declare such part of the foreshore available for such recreation purposes and may by order make regulations regulating or controlling in such manner to such extent and for such period, limited or unlimited, as he shall think proper the entry of the public on or the use by the public of such area of foreshore for purposes of public recreation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Every person who shall do any act (whether of commission or omission) which is a breach of a regulation made under this section shall be guilty of an offence under this <Col N="2104" /> section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever the Minister has made or proposes to make a regulation under this section, the Minister may if he thinks fit hold a public inquiry in regard to the continuation or the making (as the case may be) of such regulation.</P>
    <P>(4)  Regulations made under this section shall not extend to or affect the use of any foreshore for the purpose of navigation or of fishing nor the removal of beach material from any foreshore.</P>
    <P>(5)  Whenever the Minister has made an order under this section, any local authority shall be empowered to acquire such lands as may be reasonably necessary for the purposes of providing public access for persons and vehicles to that area of foreshore and for this purpose Section 36 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, shall apply.</P>
    <P>I think that the object of the amendment appears sufficiently clear from its terms.  It would appear that the amendment aims at giving power to the Minister to acquire a suitable portion of the foreshore for public recreation and to regulate the use by the public of such portion of the foreshore as the Minister requires and to enable public inquiries to be held as to whether certain portions of the foreshore should be acquired or to dedicate such portion of the foreshore as belongs to the State for the use of the public.</P>

In addition to that the local authority as the roads authority has power to acquire land if necessary to enable the public to have access to any portion of the foreshore.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, with regard to the amendment, whether the terms of Section 8 sub-section (1) are not somewhat restrictive.  The Minister takes power there to enable him by order to prohibit, restrict, regulate or control the entry of the public.  It struck me that the terms of that sub-section were such that, where there was a challenge by any person claiming to own the foreshore and to prevent the public use of it, the Minister was restricted by the terms of this section in such a way that the Minister could not in these circumstances attempt to regulate the entry of the public.  I should like to know, if the Minister thinks that the whole of my amendment is unnecessary, whether he might not arrange that this section would read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If and whenever the Minister is of opinion that the entry of the public on or the use by the public of any particular area of foreshore belonging to Saorstát Eireann ought in the public interest to be permitted, prohibited, restrictéd, regulated, or controlled, etc.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The insertion of the word &ldquo;permitted&rdquo; would, I think, meet what I have in mind.  Certain of the sections deal with parts of the foreshore not belonging to Saorstát Eireann.  My amendment would give the Minister power where there was a claim that the foreshore did not belong to Saorstát Eireann to make provision for the entry of the public on a foreshore of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be an interference with the rights of the owners <Col N="2106" /> of the foreshore which, I think, would be somewhat of an innovation. Generally speaking, the greater part of the foreshore is the property of the Saorstát and, so far as that portion is concerned, the public have the right to utilise it.  The only power we want is to regulate their use of it and to prevent abuses which would make it unsuitable for public use, such as the depositing of rubbish or other objectionable matter of that kind.  In the case of a foreshore privately owned or the property of a local authority or from which the public are excluded, there is the power of acquisition under this Bill on behalf of the State, and the local authorities also have power under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898. I do not think there is anything necessary in that connection because if there is a public demand for the use of a particular foreshore for public purposes it can be acquired by the State or the local authorities.</P>

      <P>This Bill has two purposes. One is to permit of the leasing of foreshore which is the property of the State or otherwise regulating its utilisation.  In so far as that is the policy, it is limited to foreshore which is State property; that is, the property of the central State authority, not the local authorities.  The foreshore which is the property of the Waterford Corporation is the same as privately-owned foreshore.  It is not subject to that Part of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill gives the Minister power in certain cases to interfere with foreshore no matter who owns it, where such <Col N="2107" /> interference is necessary to prevent coast erosion, for the purposes of navigation, to prevent impediments being erected which might interfere with navigation or where structures upon the foreshore might destroy the amenities of adjoining foreshore which is the property of the State.  In such cases the Minister has power to interfere with privately-owned foreshore.  In so far as the power of leasing, controlling or regulating is concerned, this Bill relates only to publicly-owned foreshore and not foreshore privately owned or owned by local authorities.</P>

      <P>With regard to Section 14, the proposal there is that no person shall throw, deposit or leave on any tidal lands or throw into the sea adjacent to any such lands any articles which might cause injury to a person bathing or wading on or from such lands or otherwise using material or substance which might be injurious or offensive to any such person.  In view of the purpose of the section I think the restriction to tidal land is too great a restriction.  I suggest that it should read: &ldquo;No person shall throw, deposit or leave on any seashore or throw into the sea adjacent to such seashore.&rdquo;  The point is that the seashore includes the foreshore and every beach, bank and cliff contiguous thereto and includes all sands and rocks contiguous to the foreshore.  If the section is left as it is, it applies only to the restricted area of the beach; that is, the tidal lands.  It is quite well known that the part between the boundary of the tidal lands and the boundary of the seashore is more usually used for the depositing of rubbish and the creation of nuisances of various kinds.  That is also the part of the shore that is as usually used by the people as are the tidal lands themselves. If the Minister will consider this matter I think he will agree that he would want to extend the boundary <Col N="2108" /> as regards the throwing of dangerous articles or rubbish or other offensive matter.</P>

      <P>The section states: &ldquo;No person shall throw, deposit, or leave on any tidal lands or throw into the sea adjacent to any such lands.&rdquo;  That, I assume, would cover any stuff that would be thrown up on the shore by the ordinary action of the tides.  I imagine one of the principal abuses is the discharge of waste oil by vessels in a position contiguous to the shore. If that is so, does the Minister not consider that the maximum penalty is insufficient?  Does he not think that it should be possible to inflict a more exemplary penalty than £5 for an offence of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Deputy Mulcahy's point, the tidal lands are, of course, more extensive than the foreshore in so far as they are the lands below the line of high water of ordinary spring tides, and that covers the whole of the strand on any part of the coast.  It does not cover the fields or cliffs or hills that may be behind the strand. In the majority of cases that area is private property and not subject to our control.  In relation to it we might have considerable difficulty in so far as the land behind the tidal land might be walled off, or might be part of a factory.  We can control the tidal lands which includes the strands used by bathers.  We are anxious to ensure that these are kept in proper order and that there will not be an area, such as from Blackrock to Dun Laoghaire, a complete litter of rubbish.</P>
      <P>We are enabled under this measure to fine anybody depositing rubbish or dirt on any strand used by bathers or children on holidays.  I think it is quite sufficient to have power to do this in relation to the strand as such. We might find ourselves getting into considerable complications if we tried to extend our control to the lands behind the tidal land, which in some cases might be used for all sorts of purposes by the people who own them and who are entitled so to use them subject to the public health laws in the matter of creating nuisances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2109" /> On the point made by Deputy Dillon, it is, of course, true that some part of the nuisances on stretches of the seashore is created by the throwing up of waste oils, discharged from steamers.  But I am afraid we would never identify the steamer that threw up the oil and caused the nuisance and, consequently, we would never be able to impose the fine.  The people I want to get at are the people who are depositing rubbish. The maximum fine of £5 is sufficient, because this maximum fine could be imposed for each offence, and the fine would progressively increase as the number of offences grew.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Minister has had expert advice.  I am not sufficiently certain, but my recollection is that in certain large harbours and in the waters adjacent thereto restrictions are at present in force and are being enforced on the matter of the scattering of oil in the harbours. I think there was some Act passed by the British Parliament dealing with the protection of sea birds.  I do not know whether the Minister has power to exact a penalty under such an Act, but that very Act on the British Statute Book suggests that there is some means of protecting these harbours. However, if the Minister does not think it worth consideration, I do not wish to press it.  I imagine, however, it would be of assistance to him if he increased the penalty to £100. This would be in connection, of course, with shipping companies, and a fine of 10/- or £1 would be no use in their case, while it might be enough in the case of an ordinary citizen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is necessary.  It is intended to emphasise the State's title to the foreshore in cases where that title might be disputed because a practice has grown up for a number of years of people removing beach material from the foreshore. In such cases these people might claim they are the owners of the foreshore, and that the State is not the owner.  This section is designed to emphasise the ownership of the State except in the case of a clear title.</P>

      <P>What makes me uneasy is sub-section (2) of Section 15.  There you have the position that where <Col N="2111" /> people had a right in the past to take seaweed thrown up on the foreshore, that right will not exist under this Bill. I do not know whether any people have <i>profit a prendre</i> on the seashore of this country, but I do know that a very great number of people in Donegal, in Kerry and in Connemara are largely dependent on their supplies of seaweed for manuring their land on the manure they get from the seashore.  The working of their land would not be an economic proposition at all if they had not these supplies available.  I imagine they have acquired a <i>profit a prendre</i> over the seashore, but it appears to me that this section would strip them of their <i>profit a prendre.</i></P>

      <P>I do not want to be in the position of giving what is known as a Capel Street opinion on a section of this kind.  There is a slight distinction between what is worrying Deputy Dillon and what is in the Bill. The Bill, as I read it, deals with the question of title to the foreshore, whereas what Deputy Dillon has been worrying about is the right over the foreshore.  That is a distinct thing from the foreshore itself.  In other words, the State may be entitled to the actual bed of the foreshore, but the ordinary citizen may have a right over that foreshore to take seaweed or any other material.  As I read this section it has no relation whatever to the question or right of <i>profit a prendre.</i>  It deals with the titles to the foreshore.</P>

      <P>This matter has been under examination for a long time.  I do not mind confessing to the Deputy that this section caused me some concern. This Bill was to a large extent produced a considerable time ago.  I found it in a very advanced stage of preparation when I became Minister for Industry and Commerce and I was concerned about the effect of this particular section.  I arranged that the Department of Lands and Fisheries which I thought should be interested in this matter, should be fully consulted. They were satisfied that nothing in this section was going to interfere with the <Col N="2113" /> people who were principally concerned about the foreshore and who might be engaged in the collection of seaweed for the manufacture of kelp.  It is clear that what is intended to be provided here is that the ownership of the foreshore cannot be claimed by any person merely on the ground that he and his forefathers have for a long number of years been gathering seaweed there.  The right to take seaweed is subject to certain limitations under this Bill.  It might in certain cases be that we would enforce regulations in this matter, that people should be licensed and certain measures of control adopted.  Ordinarily there would be no interference with the practice which has been in existence in the past except where there was public need.  It is clear that the intention is merely to ensure that the ownership of the foreshore rests in the State and that the State title to it has not been impaired by the fact that for a number of years people have been collecting this seaweed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will excuse me pressing the matter, because, I need hardly explain to him, it would be a catastrophe to many of my constituents if their easement was interfered with.  I would ask him if he would, in the Seanad or at such other time as is convenient to him, consider the insertion of some words, or of a new sub-section, providing that nothing in the Bill should be interpreted as abolishing an existing easement.</P>

      <P>There is the possibility there, and there may be the possibility under certain sections giving him power to make regulations which would vest in the Minister the right to extinguish an existing easement.  If no such intention is in the mind of the Minister, the situation could be safeguarded by a sub-section saying that nothing in this Bill shall operate to extinguish any easement existing on the date the Bill became law.</P>

      <P>I understand the section applies only to the taking of seaweed. Would it apply to the practice of taking sand?  There is a very big industry in the export of sand and when Fords were working in Cork they used quite a lot of that sand, which they found essential for their purpose.</P>

      <P>Certainly, in West Cork a question arises which it is necessary to clear up as to an ordinary person taking seaweed or sand.  I would be perfectly satisfied with what the Minister said, but it is not the man who makes the law that administers it. That is one great danger.  I would advise the Minister against creating a position unnecessarily of stopping the taking of sand.  A case might be made that the taking of sand would possibly make an island of part of the land.  I would like to be assured that this will not interfere with the ordinary rights of persons for the cultivation of the land with seaweed and sand.  That should be allowed to be continued if it will not interfere with the foreshore or cause coast erosion.  I believe that one act of God in one night would do more than the drawing of sand and gravel for 300 years.  I should like to be assured that the people will be allowed to draw sand and seaweed, if it will not interfere with the foreshore.</P>

      <P>While I yield to Deputy Costello in everything he says about the law, I have some experience of these foreshore cases in County <Col N="2115" /> Cork, and there was a clear distinction drawn between a foreshore vested in the State and a foreshore vested in private individuals.  For instance, the whole foreshore of Bantry Bay was vested in the late Lord Bantry, but you could establish a right against Lord Bantry by having used it for 30 years.  Against any foreshore vested in the State, however, it requires 60 years of clear usage. Several people in County Cork gave conclusive proof of such usage and got decrees in their favour.  The question now is whether this section will interfere in any way with these rights, some of which have been established by decrees given, and some of which may come before the courts later on to be established by clear evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Although what Deputy Hales said does not arise on this section, I should like to say that the Bill gives power to prohibit the removal of sand or gravel from the foreshore, where the prohibition of such removal is necessary in the public interest.  It has been the practice in every case that I have any knowledge of, where such prohibition is enforced, to permit farmers residing in the locality to draw sand for manurial purposes.  When Deputy Hales talked about the practice, he is, in fact, referring to sand drawn by farmers for manurial purposes, and he is forgetting that in recent years, with the advent of cement, and the extended use of cement, sand is being drawn for sale to persons erecting buildings, or constructing roads; and that gravel is also being drawn from the shore for sale&mdash;very frequently for sale to local authorities, who are very often quite reckless in this matter of the removal of sand in large quantities and, particularly, the removal of gravel, which is the natural bulwark created by the sea for the protection of the land.  That has caused very extensive erosion.  Wherever that has occurred, and a local inquiry has demonstrated that it has occurred, a prohibitory order is made.  As a rule, as I have said, we protect the interests <Col N="2116" /> of the local farmers who require sand for manurial purposes.  But where a prohibitory order is made, the drawing of sand or gravel from within the prohibited area is made an offence, and the prohibitory order must be fairly rigorously enforced.  This section does not deal with that.  This section is merely designed to secure that the mere fact that people have been drawing seaweed for a number of years does not, by itself, constitute evidence of title to the foreshore. Some other evidence of title must be produced than the fact that the seaweed has been taken for a number of years previously.</P>

      <P>There is one section of the Bill which authorises the Minister to sanction the erection of sea defence works.  I see nothing in the Bill to enable the Minister, in cases where it may be necessary, to erect such sea defence works.  Has he thought of that matter at all in connection with this? He has had before him in promoting <Col N="2117" /> this Bill for the protection of the coast, coast erosion, but there are many cases where tidal rivers have caused a lot of erosion over valuable fertile land by flooding.  In such cases this flooding could only be stopped by the erection of very important sea defence works on the shore, or across the causeway, where the natural barrier referred to a while ago has been removed by the natural battering of the forces of nature.  I was wondering whether the Minister would not conceive in this Bill some idea of taking to himself the power of spending in this way the money we have authorised him to spend here under Financial Resolution No. 3, because there are around the coast several cases where valuable land running into thousands of acres has been ruined and destroyed through the want of such sea defences.  I would ask the Minister to take this into account, and see that this Bill can be operated in such a way that such sea defences can be erected at the public cost. They would be rather extensive and important works.  The local authorities would not be in a position to finance them, and the local farmers affected would not be able to contribute anything towards the cost of that work. There is, especially in the South, and in the constituency I represent in the County of Cork, much valuable land being destroyed for want of such sea defence works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that this Bill is not designed to facilitate the Government in undertaking the erection of sea defence works where they are required.  In connection with the protection of the coast it provides for the prohibition of anything that is going to produce coast erosion, or cause damage of that kind.  We can prohibit people from removing material or works that might have that result.  As far as taking action for the erection of sea defence works is concerned the obligation is upon the owner of the land affected, and we take power under this Bill to enable that person to erect sea defence works on any part of the foreshore, even if the foreshore is the property of somebody else.  If <Col N="2118" /> he demonstrates to the Minister that the erection of such works upon other persons' stretch of foreshore is necessary for the protection of his property he can get an order entitling him to erect, at his own expense, those sea defence works for the protection of his property, but it would obviously be an undesirable thing that there should be any general provision for the expending of State moneys for the protection and improvement of the property of private individuals.  If the property were public property, or the property of a local authority, it might be possible&mdash;and I think it has been done &mdash;that money provided for, say, the relief of unemployment might be expended on works of that kind. Where, however, the property is private I think the obligation to erect works to protect it or increase its value rests on the owner.  We merely, under this Bill, facilitate him in doing it.</P>

It is &ldquo;Cumann Aontuithe an Arachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte.&rdquo;  That is rather long, and as in future, if this Bill be passed, we will have only one National Health Insurance Society, I was thinking of suggesting that with the leave of the House the word &ldquo;Aontuithe&rdquo; might <Col N="2119" /> be dropped, thus shortening the title to &ldquo;Cumann an Arachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In page 5, Section 10, between paragraphs (c) and (d) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d) to examine and report to the Minister before the appointed day as to the possibility of establishing <Col N="2120" /> a suitable superannuation scheme for officers and employees of the unified society having regard to the moneys available for the purpose under the financial provisions of the Acts.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to insert a new paragraph to meet Deputy Davin's amendment 5 on the Committee Stage.  It will be remembered that there was some discussion as to the possibility of having a report submitted inside twelve months.  I do not know whether that would be possible. It might not be possible, and we are desirous not to be bound to a twelve months' period.  It would probably be impossible to have a report drawn up, because the staff might not be completed by that time.  As any superannuation fund that is likely to be set up must come out of the administration fund of the society it is necessary to put in the words that are at the end of this paragraph &ldquo;having regard to the moneys available for the purpose under the financial provisions of the Acts.&rdquo;  I think this embodies fairly fully the point raised by Deputy Davin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were engaged on the Committee Stage of this Bill the Minister told the House that, while his heart was perfectly willing to meet us, his pocket was unable to satisfy the demand contained in the amendment which I moved.  The Minister then said that he assumed that under the Bill approximately 2,500 part-time agents would be compensated by the amendment that I then moved and that it would cost a sum of £30,000.  I have since made very diligent inquiry from persons well versed in insurance work, in existing insurance societies, and also from persons who occupy a high reputation in their respective societies and in the eyes of the officials of the Department of Local Government. They are all positive in their view and they assure me that nothing like 2,500 people would have to be compensated if the Bill is passed.  They say that it seems to them that a very large number of part-time agents unemployed would bring about a very unsatisfactory position in relation to national health insurance if they are to comply with the requirements of the National Health Insurance Act.  Let us take the case at its worst.  It has been pointed out by the Minister that at its worst the total sum involved in the amendment that I moved in Committee would amount to £30,000.  But that £30,000 is not an annual sum.  It meant one payment in the amendment as originally proposed by me.  I said then, and I repeat now, that since the compensation will be provided in the form of a loan from the National Health Insurance Fund, that a loan of £30,000 could be easily extinguished by an annual payment of £1,500, and would be automatically wiped out in less than 20 years.  Many of these part-time agents are people who have no other occupation whatever.  In <Col N="2123" /> other cases, some of them have tiny farms.  Some others have some kind of employment which is not remunerative in the sense of their being able to maintain themselves from the income they receive from that occupation. The sums they at present receive from the national health insurance societies, though they may not be very substantial, help to relieve the necessity to which they are constantly subject by having to exist upon their present meagre incomes.  Therefore, to try to get some kind of compensation for people like that, I have submitted now an amendment, the purpose of which is to endeavour to provide compensation for part-time agents that have not less than five years' service with their society prior to the 30th June, 1933.  The Minister's statement on the Committee Stage was that it would cost £30,000, if the original amendment that I submitted was accepted.  The cost, if this amendment is accepted, will be nothing like that sum.  If the Minister is prepared to compensate secretaries of national health insurance societies, and officers relatively better off than the part-time people, he ought to be prepared to provide some kind of compensation for that class of people.  The Minister may say that the incomes they were receiving were small, but that only shows that their struggle for existence was all the harder, and the fact that they are likely to lose their livelihood and to have snatched away from them the pittance they are receiving is no reason for not giving them compensation for loss of the positions they had.  I hope the Minister will reconsider this matter and that he will indicate his willingness to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I formally support Deputy Norton's amendment.  Every circumstance in connection with the case he made has been brought to my notice and I sincerely hope that the Minister will consider this amendment. It is a genuine attempt to compensate the part-time agent who will undoubtedly lose the little he has been able to earn to make life worth living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">

      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  I have gone <Col N="2124" /> into the matter again since the Committee Stage, and I can only repeat what I said then&mdash;that the money is not there.  It is all very well, I suppose, to talk sympathetically about these people, and to say it is regrettable that they cannot be compensated. Whether it is believed or not, and whether any sincerity in me will be credited or not, all I can say is that the funds are not there, and I see no way of providing this compensation out of the limited funds at our disposal in the Administration Account.  It would be a very great pleasure to me, indeed, to give compensation to this class as to the other class.  I do not say that there is the same case for giving compensation to those part-time officers as to the people deprived altogether of their employment.  Those deprived altogether of their employment necessarily have first claim upon the funds available for compensation. The officials whose whole time is given to national health insurance and are deprived of their office or employment come first.  They came first with me and we are using the money available, so far as we can, to compensate these people.  It is true that there may be some cases now of part-time people who get a not inconsiderable portion of their present income out of part-time work for national health insurance, but they are not being deprived of their livelihood in the sense that people who were whole-time employees may be deprived of it.  They may have a case, but their case is not on all fours with that of the whole-time employees.</P>

      <P>If you open the door to one case there is no way to shut it.  If you admit the principle, you have to deal with every case, and there is no way of stopping it.  I know that there are certain cases, such as Deputy Norton mentioned on the Second Reading of the Bill where a man gets, say, £1 a week out of some outside employment and 18/- a week out of part-time national health insurance work.  The taking away of that 18/- is a big loss, but I think that probably <Col N="2125" /> there are not very many such cases, and if we open the door for that type of case we cannot close it.  We cannot say that any part-time official is not just as much entitled as any other official, and that that being so, we cannot meet these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Minister is not quite accurate in this matter when he says that the money derived from work of this kind forms only part of the incomes of the people concerned.  I know many men in certain parts of the country who receive about £20 from work of this kind, and that is their sole income. There are small artisans and people unemployed for some considerable time, who receive a small salary in respect of the few members they have on their list.  That is the sole income of these people.  I suggest to the Minister that he should endeavour, before this Bill is finally dealt with in the Seanad, to go some way to meet the conditions of hardship that may occur in cases of the kind I have described.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister is quite sincere in his desire to do something in the cases mentioned if he could do it; but I think that he will find on enquiry that there will be a greater number of cases of undoubted hardship, by reason of the fact that these agents are shut out, than he imagines.  On that account, I would ask the Minister to make further inquiry to see whether or not he could go some little distance to meet cases of that kind, or to meet the bulk of the cases even in a very small way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows, as we all know, that to the agents of the society is due the successful working of the Act, so far as it has been successful.  In the matter of seeing that there is a fair deal for the insured person and in other such matters the agents have done extremely good work.  They have made a success of the Act and they have done their duty very well. To a good number of them that are, to my own knowledge, out of employment for the last few years, and to people who had small businesses, such as harness makers, shoemakers and <Col N="2126" /> people like that, who were doing hardly any business, this is their only income.  Accordingly, I should like the Minister to make further inquiries and endeavour to meet these cases in some small way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that there are some cases of men&mdash;they may have been small tradesmen or goodness knows what else&mdash;who are out of employment and doing national health insurance work.  Where men of that kind can prove that their livelihood&mdash; even though it was only part-time work&mdash;came out of national health insurance work, they will get compensation. Suppose a man got £50, say, as his livelihood&mdash;it may be a poor livelihood if you like&mdash;but he had to rely on that £50 for his own livelihood and that of his family&mdash;and if his trade disappears&mdash;I, certainly, will try to see that he will get compensation; but it will have to be shown and proved to us that he relied on that mainly for the source of his livelihood.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is doing his best, but we must consider that we are passing an Act that is going to disemploy these men.  We are taking that responsibility of putting these men out of employment.  There is another case that has not been referred to by Deputy Murphy.  This matter of part-time work is very misleading.  There is quite a number of these men who, while working part-time, have no other means of livelihood whatever.  This work they do in national health insurance is the only job they have.  I should like the Minister to consider making some provision for these men.</P>

      <P>We certainly recognise the spirit in which the Minister is <Col N="2127" /> meeting this thing to a certain extent. We know that the Minister sympathises with these people, but I do not think he realises the hardship that will be inflicted on some people, especially in rural areas.  There are a good many farm labourers in rural areas who have only casual employment as farm labourers.  They draw certain quarterly wages as agents.  Would such men be regarded as farm labourers merely, or would the quarterly payments be recognised? These farm labourers look forward to this money quarterly to provide boots and shoes for their children, and I would ask the Minister to leave the door open for the consideration of such cases.  I do not think the Minister realises the hardship that will be imposed upon people, especially in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that if the Minister were on the benches opposite I would have a very sincere friend to-night; but I am certain&mdash;and the Minister's timidity convinces me of the correctness of my view-point&mdash;that he does not believe in his heart that this compensation in my amendment will bring about any insolvency so far as the unified society is concerned.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill I reminded the Minister of the fact that in 1912 the administration fund was 3/5 per member per annum.  This is 1933, and almost every commodity has increased considerably over the level of 1912.  The administration fund has been increased from 3/5 per member <Col N="2128" /> per annum to 4/5.  When it is remembered that the complexities of the Act have increased enormously by the issue in the meantime of thousands of new regulations, and by reason of the extra charges for telephones, for rent, for stationery, and for labour; and when it is remembered that the work of the societies has increased enormously, by reason of the greater number of claims, I think the Minister will have to admit that a 30 per cent. increase in the administration fund, over the figure for 1912, is certainly a very low increase.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister, and it requires no legislation, but merely the issue of a regulation to increase the administration fund from 4/5 to some higher figure.  There is no doubt whatever that it can be expanded to a reasonably higher figure, to enable it to bear the extra charges which will devolve upon it by the acceptance of this amendment.</P>
      <P>I will finish with this question: Does the Minister suggest that the administration fund cannot be increased over the present level?  If it were increased over the present level, would it not be possible to provide the compensation suggested in the amendment?  Has the Minister so little faith in the future solvency of the society that he cannot saddle it with the responsibility of £1,000 or £1,500 per annum for 20 years?  If the Minister has not faith in the solvency of the fund, that it will bear an impost of that kind, I am sure the Minister will feel very little comfort in having introduced this Bill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(c) where a person who was the holder of a qualifying post under an approved society was temporarily absent from such post and during the whole of such absence was engaged in service in any of the military forces serving under the authority of the First Dáil Eireann, the Second Dáil Eireann, or the Provisional Government of Ireland, or in the British Army, Navy, or Air Force, or in either of the opposing forces during the civil strife in the years 1922, 1923, 1924 or was interned or imprisoned in consequence of such service, the following provisions shall have effect for the purposes of this sub-section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) such person shall be deemed during such temporary absence to have been the holder of a qualifying post under such approved society and the period of such temporary absence shall be reckoned as qualifying service accordingly, and</P>
      <P>(ii) if such person resumed his position as the holder of a qualifying post under such approved society not later than six months after the expiration of the period of such temporary absence, no interval of time shall be deemed to have elapsed between such expiration and such resumption, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii) if such person resumed his position as the holder of a qualifying post under such approved society within a reasonable time after the expiration of the period of such temporary absence and the delay in such resumption was due to wounds or illness attributable to such service, internment, or imprisonment, or to no vacancy being available in such society, no interval of time shall be deemed <Col N="2132" /> to have elapsed between such expiration and such resumption,</P>
    <P>(d) where a person who was the holder of a qualifying post under an approved society was temporarily absent from such post during labour disputes connected with such society, such person shall for the purposes of this sub-section be deemed during such temporary absence to have been the holder of a qualifying post under such society and the period of such temporary absence shall be reckoned as qualifying service accordingly.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment substantive to the amendment moved by Deputy Costello on the Committee Stage.  The amendment preserves the continuity of employment in respect of any period of absence on service in the various forces. In the case of the period after discharge employment must be resumed within six months.  In the case of persons owing to wounds or because of a vacancy not being available his resumption of employment must take place within a reasonable time.  The period between discharge and resumption will not count as qualifying service. The amendment agrees in principle with the amendment moved by Deputy Costello with the addition of the suggestion made by Deputy Kelly with regard to labour disputes.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question.  Take the case of a person who fought in 1916 and was absent from his business with a national health insurance society because of that fact.  Does the Minister think that he would be covered under this section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose that legally the authority of the first Dáil could extend in that fashion, but I am satisfied that, so far as we are concerned, anybody out of employment in national health insurance by reason of <Col N="2133" /> participation in certain forces will be treated under this section as being out of employment with the forces and will get compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But, ultimately, when the Bill passes through this House and the Seanad it may not be the Minister who will be the determinator.  It may be the courts, and the courts will have to construe this section by inquiring: &ldquo;what is the authority of the First Dáil&rdquo;?  A person who served in 1916 would thereby be excluded because it does not seem that the authority of the First Dáil would cover activity in 1916.  I suggest to the Minister that the case might be covered.</P>

      <P>The Minister may remember that on the Committee Stage an amendment was moved by Deputy Dockrell although it was, in fact, standing in the name of Deputy Good.  It provided that persons who fell ill, or for any other reason had a hiatus in their period of employment with an approved society, should not be penalised: that they would be entitled to get credit for all the years they had, in fact, served.  This is another type of case that could arise. A man might have employment with an approved society from 1912 to 1915, then be dispensed with for redundancy and get a job with another approved society towards the end of 1915.  There would be a hiatus between his first period of employment and his second period of employment.  As the Bill stands it would seem that he would not be eligible for compensation in respect of the entire term.  The reason I mention this is because the Minister indicated his intention of covering this under his own amendment.  I do not think amendment 12 does so cover it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certain that I did not promise to cover the case of any man who had actually broken service.  A person, as the Deputy suggests, had employment for a number of years with one approved society and then because of redundancy was dismissed <Col N="2134" /> or lost his employment.  A year or two later he got employment with another approved society.  I do not think we would feel ourselves bound to compensate that person when there was a definite break in the service&mdash;compensate him for service anterior to the break.</P>

Certainly, anybody out of employment through sickness as long as the contract was maintained&mdash;even though he might be two years ill, if he were kept on the books as an officer of the society and were only drawing a very small proportion of his remuneration&mdash;would be covered, but not a person who had a definite break in employment with one insurance society and then took up employment three years later with another society.  We would not feel ourselves bound to give compensation to that person over the entire field of years of service in any approved society.</P>

      <P>A case may arise where you have men with a protracted period of service.  Take the case of a man who has been in this business from the very beginning.  He had a long period of service with one society which amalgamated with another or, perhaps, it ceased to exist.  For some reason that man's services were dispensed with.  In six months' time he got employment with another society, and perhaps had only three years' service in the second position when these unification proposals came along.  As the Bill stands that man gets compensation on the basis of three years' service although in fact he has had 20 years' service. It was the most fortuitous circumstance that deprived him of his rights.  I think it was the policy of the Government to encourage, where they could, a lame or a crippled society to amalgamate with a more solvent one.  The policy was to encourage the solvent society to take over the lame one.  Because of that the man had a hiatus in his employment.  I would invite the Minister to examine that class of case and deal with it in the Seanad if he thinks it deserving of consideration.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 49, Section 22 (3) (c) (i) to delete the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;three.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that the remuneration of an officer who is to get compensation under the Bill shall be calculated on the average of three years prior to the date mentioned in the Bill.  On Committee Stage, I put down an amendment providing that the remuneration should be the remuneration of the officer for the 12 months ending 30th June, 1932.  The Minister could not see his way to accept <Col N="2136" /> that amendment and gave, I think, as his principal reason for objecting to the amendment, that it was quite possible that certain societies, anticipating that the unification proposals would be brought forward, had increased the salaries of their officers, or, of some of their officers, and he, accordingly, did not see his way to accept the amendment. It is felt that the five years' period over which the compensation is to be assessed or, rather, the remuneration of the officer calculated, is rather a long period, particularly in cases in which there has been a genuine upward tendency in the salary of the official in question and it is felt that it is not right that the officer who received genuine, gradual increases of salary, extending over three to five years, should be penalised for some small number of cases where hurried increases of salaries were given with a view to anticipating the unification proposals.</P>
    <P>I am instructed that, even in such cases, where societies, in an endeavour to anticipate the provisions of this Bill, increased the salaries in an obvious way or on a large scale, the National Health Insurance Commission and the Department in general would have seen that abuse and would have been in a position, on the audit, to remedy it.  I would appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment which I think is a reasonable one&mdash; three years instead of five&mdash;and to consider that the genuine cases are more appropriately dealt with than the exceptional cases of demerit or evasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.  The question of unification has been discussed amongst the societies and the general public interested since 1925, and it has been known to the approved societies that quite a number of societies have amalgamated in a process, one might call it, of unification.  Deputy Dillon referred to some of the lame societies joining up with other societies and that process has been going on for a number of years.  I think that many societies realise that something of the kind that is happening now was bound to happen sooner or later and, as a result, a number of societies that could <Col N="2137" /> not out of their ordinary funds afford to increase the salaries of their officers have used their surplus funds to increase those salaries.  The result is that the administration fund that ought to be at 4/5 per head has gone up to 4/9.</P>

      <P>I cannot tell.  I do not know them, but there are, I am told, a fairly large number of cases where the administration fund has gone up to 4/9½.  I do not know how many cases there are, and we do feel that, that being so, the spreading of the periods over five years is fairer in view of the fact that, as I am informed, it is well known that increases that would not ordinarily have been granted, were it not that this possible unification was in view, were granted to a number of officials.  Their rates of remuneration raised above what they ordinarily would have been because they anticipated that something of this kind was going to come and, of course, the compensation would be based on their salaries over a certain period of years.  The administration fund, to which I have had to refer so often, is already too high, and reducing the period to three years would increase the compensation which we have already, at any rate, I think for the whole-time officials, made more generous than we can afford.</P>

      <P>In page 8, before Section 22 (4), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a person who though employed by some other person or body has in the course of such employment been engaged on health insurance work for an approved society, and</P>
      <P>(b) such person ceases to be employed by such other person or body by reason of the transfer of the engagements of such society under this Act, and</P>
      <P>(c) such person, if engaged part-time only on such work for such society, proves to the satisfaction of the provisional committee that the remuneration paid to him by such other person or body in respect of such work was his principal means of livelihood,</P>
      <P>such person shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed in respect of every period during which he was engaged on such work for such society to have been the holder of a qualifying post under such society, but in calculating under sub-section (3) of this section his average annual remuneration as the holder of a qualifying post under such society no payments, other than payments in respect of such work for such society, shall be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is brought in to cover suggestions contained in Deputy Costello's amendment No. 29 on Committee Stage, so far as it was agreed to.  The Deputy will remember that we divided them into three classes.  We dealt with two of them, but the third we were not able to deal with.  The amendment provides compensation for <Col N="2139" /> certain persons performing the health insurance work of approved societies but not directly employed by such societies.  Certain big English insurance societies will particularly occur to the minds of those interested.  Those societies make an annual payment in return for which the employees on these companies perform the health insurance work of their societies. Such persons who lose their employment as a result of the transfer of the society will be entitled to compensation on the same terms and conditions as if they had been directly employed by the society.  It also covers the cost of clerical assistants not directly employed by the society but employed, perhaps, by the secretary or by the higher officials of these societies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before Section 22 (4), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a person who was the holder of a qualifying post under an approved society would, but for his being offered at the date of transfer in respect of such society permanent employment by the unified society at a rate of remuneration which, having regard to the remuneration previously received by him in respect of national health insurance services is reasonable, be entitled to compensation under this section, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2140" /> (b) such person accepts such offer, and</P>
    <P>(c) such person is dismissed (otherwise than for misconduct or illness) by the unified society within five years after the said date of transfer, such person may apply to the Minister for a declaration that he is entitled to compensation under this section and thereupon the Minister may, if he thinks it reasonable in all the circumstances of the case so to do, declare such person entitled to compensation under this section and upon such declaration being made such person shall, notwithstanding paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of this section, be entitled to be paid by the unified society compensation under this section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon moved an amendment, No. 27, on Committee Stage which would entitle a man employed by the unified society to claim compensation if his services were dispensed with within seven years from the date of the transfer.  I think the amendment was withdrawn after discussion.  I did not, so far as I remember, make any promise to meet the case but I promised to discuss the matter with the officials of the Department.  I have brought forward this amendment which gives a person, who has obtained employment with the unified society and who has, consequently, got no compensation, the right of appeal to the Minister to have his title to compensation restored if his services are dispensed with by the unified society within five years for reasons other than illness or misconduct or, for instance, if he were declared redundant.  I think that meets the point raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge with appreciation the spirit in which the Minister has met the point I raised though I deprecate the inclusion of the word &ldquo;illness.&rdquo;  I think that shows a hardness of heart that I would not have expected from the Custom House. However, if the Minister feels that that is vitally essential in order to preserve the credit of the State and of the unified society, I am not prepared to trouble him, but if his heart grows <Col N="2141" /> softer between now and the time when the Bill will occupy the Seanad, I suggest that he withdraw the word &ldquo;illness.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, before Section 22 (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a person entitled to compensation under this section is offered and accepts employment in the unified society at a salary lower than the salary he was receiving from the approved society on the date of transfer, he shall be entitled to compensation calculated on the value of the loss thus sustained by him.</P>
      <P>I think that this amendment has a great deal to commend it both from the point of view of the unified society and of the employee.  If adopted, it might save the unified society money. It would certainly enable them to keep in their service employees whom they would wish to retain although they were only in a position to offer them considerably less remuneration than they had been receiving heretofore.  I acknowledge at once that the Minister has kept the promise made to me on Committee Stage, when he said he would consider the matter and introduce an amendment.  It is with that object, I presume, that he introduced amendment 5, which goes a certain distance along the line I have been advocating.  I put down this amendment again because I want to draw the Minister's attention to cases which his amendment will not meet at all, but with which it would be very desirable the unified society should have power to deal.  There may be people whom they would wish to employ but whom they can offer only a salary considerably lower than they have been receiving.  Under the Minister's amendment the employee in question would choose his compensation and cease to be employed by the unified society.  That would entail a further demand on the compensation fund and it would deprive the unified society of the services of an experienced man which it might be distinctly to their advantage to retain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2142" /> Take an entirely hypothetical example.  Suppose there were three persons employed by different societies at salaries of £500 a year.  The unified society, let us suppose, has three posts vacant and it would like to employ these three men.  It can offer one of them £500, another £400, and a third only £300.  It would desire to keep these three men in its employment, but the man who stands to lose £200 a year will almost certainly prefer to take this compensation and trust to supplementing his income in some other way.  Therefore, the society will have to pay compensation based on the salary of £500 a year.  If the society had power to compensate him for his loss, they could retain his services, which they desire to do, and they would have to pay less out of the compensation fund.  The amendment, I suggest, is likely to save the compensation fund money rather than increase the charges upon it.  The intermediate case of the three might come under the amendment the Minister has introduced, but the other case most assuredly would not.  It would hardly be said that a salary of £300 was reasonably comparable with the £500 hitherto received.  I am obliged to the Minister for his consideration of the matter, but he has probably not appreciated the likelihood of many cases such as I have suggested arising.  The society would save money rather than lose it by my amendment and they would keep in their employment men whose services would be very valuable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Thrift says is quite true&mdash;that I failed to appreciate the point he made.  I am still in that position.  I thought we had met to some extent the case made by the Deputy when speaking to the amendment on Committee Stage.  I do not think that, mathematically speaking, we would gain anything by giving compensation to those officials for the amount they would lose.  If the matter were examined mathematically, it could be demonstrated that the loss would be a loss to the National Health Insurance Unified Society.  If any of these three desirable officers were offered employment, it would have to be at a reasonable rate of remuneration in <Col N="2143" /> comparison with what they had been receiving from the approved society.  If they did not accept and if they were exceptionally good officials, the loss might be ours.  But, with the variety of officials there will be available, I am sure there will be enough from which to pick and choose.  Financially, I think we should be better off by giving them their full compensation and letting those we are not able to assimilate or provide with posts at a reasonable remuneration in comparison with what they had, go out.  I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 9, at the end of Section 22 (7), line 13, to add the words &ldquo;but nothing in this Act shall operate to restrict the right of appeal against such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While, normally, the Minister would decide as to the right of the person to compensation under this section, or as to the amount of such compensation, I want to preserve in my amendment the right of any aggrieved person to appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction in any matter in dispute between himself and the Minister.  Under this Bill, the legislature is deciding to amalgamate compulsorily all the existing national health insurance societies&mdash;65 in number. They have not been consulted as to whether they are agreeable to <Col N="2144" /> amalgamation or unification.  They have not been asked whether they approve of everything proposed under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The State, for reasons of its own, comes along and insists on introducing legislation designed to provide for the unification of existing insurance societies.  Many of the existing employees will be taken over and others will not be taken over and the terms of compensation provided are by no means generous.  In many cases it is not unfair to say that the compensation will be unreasonable having regard to the past services and the experience of these people.  Here we have the State compelling unification and providing a grossly inadequate rate of compensation.  When you come to ascertain whether a person is entitled to compensation, and when you come to consider the amount of it, you find the Bill drawn in such a way that the Minister, who has resisted efforts made here to provide reasonable compensation, sets himself up as the sole arbiter as to whether a person is entitled to compensation and also the amount to which he is entitled.  That is a very unreasonable rôle for an inevitably interested Minister to assume.  The Minister naturally has an interest in the passage of the Bill and in ensuring that the compensation will be as low as possible.  I think the Minister will scarcely plead those are not his interests, having regard to the speeches made by him on various stages of the Bill.  It is altogether unfair that an aggrieved person who may lose his employment under this Bill and who is offered an ungenerous scale of compensation should, in addition, be compelled to accept as final the view of the Minister as to his eligibility for compensation, or as to the amount of compensation to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to provide that the Act shall be interpreted not by an interested Minister but by the courts set up under the authority of the people.  It seeks to give to an aggrieved person the inalienable right of every aggrieved person; that is, the right to go to the courts and get justice there from disinterested persons.  This seeks <Col N="2145" /> to take away from the Minister the absolute right to rule out of consideration the claims of persons for compensation, if an eventuality of that kind should arise.  In a democratic State with a democratic Government one can hardly imagine an amendment of this kind being resisted.  Therefore, I hope that the Minister, while normally being the person who will decide eligibility for compensation and the amount of compensation, will indicate, by accepting this amendment, that he is not nearly as infallible as the draftsman of this Bill wants to make him.  I hope he will consent to allow any matter in dispute to be determined by disinterested persons in courts of competent jurisdiction set up to decide issues of this kind and to interpret the intention of Acts passed by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>From quite another point of view than that expressed by Deputy Norton, I am supporting this amendment.  I do not agree with the Deputy that the terms of compensation are inadequate.  On the contrary, I regard them as fair.  I consider the attitude of the Minister in his approach to the problem of compensation for these displaced employees is highly reassuring to any person who may in future have to refer a claim to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of opinion, judging from the attitude of the Minister throughout the discussion, that it might be materially to the advantage of men who may have a difference with the managing committee of the unified society as to their right to compensation to have their appeal to the Minister rather than to a court of law. I imagine it might be more advantageous for them to have their appeal to the Minister for a detatched and impartial interpretation of the Act. But here a question of great principle is raised, and that is the general right of men to go to the courts and invoke assistance and protection of the courts from the Executive.  It is along those lines I am drawn to Deputy Norton's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2146" /> I have frequently stated here that we may do things in special cases which are quite harmless in themselves but which, as precedents for future legislation, may be very harmful indeed.  This is not the first Bill that has come before the House in which an attempt was made to usurp the functions of the law officers and hand them over to a Minister of State.  In this particular case I do not think any single man would be a sufferer, but I think the whole course of legislation in this country would suffer because we would subscribe to the principle that a Minister should act as the ultimate and final court of appeal.  I do not think that is a sound principle.</P>
    <P>In this measure we ought to preserve the right of appeal to the courts.  I cannot see how it can materially embarrass the administration in any way.  I should think it highly unlikely that any material number of appeals would go to the courts, but it would be a mistake, even if there were only two or three cases, to withhold from any individual his right to appeal to the courts for protection in any difference that arises between himself and a Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is no new principle so far as my recollection goes.  I think in a number of Bills that were introduced here a similar principle was adopted, and I think it was adopted without much opposition from the House.  I think that the officials concerned, while I hope they will get justice in any court in the land, will get more than justice with the Minister as arbiter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case they would not appeal to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>They might.  I believe they would probably get more than justice with the Minister as arbiter. The question of compensation will be settled in the next two or three years for all these officials.  That is certain. I, as Minister, once this Bill is passed, am outside national health insurance; I will have nothing to do with it.  It will be in the hands of the managing committee.  The Minister's position is entirely an impartial one, and if there is anything to be gained I think it <Col N="2147" /> will be gained for the officials by reason of having the Minister there in contrast with the cold&mdash;evenhanded, if you like&mdash;justice that they would get in a court of law.  They would, I believe, do better by going to the Minister rather than by going to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel that it would tend rather to hamper the unified society if they had to deal with matters of this kind in the courts.  One must remember the long delays that are naturally associated with legal work.  They can more rapidly and more effectively come directly to the Minister in cases where they have any doubt as to what they are entitled to, and they will get their cases more speedily dealt with.  They will get justice, in any case, and probably more than justice.  Of course it is not for me to argue against the right of an individual to go to the courts.  I should not do that, but I do feel that for the good working of the unified society, any disputes that may arise&mdash;I do not think there will be many&mdash;could better be adjusted if the <Col N="2148" /> individuals concerned go to the Minister. If they do so they will probably in all cases do much better than by going elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say what Act of this Legislature providing for compensation gave the Minister the absolute power to determine the amount?  My recollection is that all these cases of compensation provided for the setting up of an independent arbiter.  Will the Minister be prepared to consider even that proposal?  I have in mind the Railways Act, the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tram Act and the E.S.B. Act.</P>

      <P>I think as far as any outside arbitrator is concerned the court would be better than any outside arbitrator.  That is my own personal view.  But in the interests of those concerned, the officials of national health approved societies, I think they would do better by going to the Minister.  That is my belief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House, but if I were to deal with Deputy Norton's attitude on this Bill I should have a good deal to say.  There are two things, however, which I want to make clear.  One is that the Minister has been unable to provide, as he would have wished to provide, for the existing part-time agents who cannot satisfy him that they are making the major part of their income from that employment.  I think it would greatly relieve the situation if the Minister would say that it is the intention of the unified society to give preference to existing part-time agents, in any case where they propose to appoint part-time agents in rural areas.  I believe that that would greatly, if I might use the word, console those people and give them to understand that their position was understood.  Secondly, the difficulty about the treasurers has not been met, except in so far as they are covered under Section 22 (3) (a) (iii).  I ask the Minister to consider an amendment in another place to make lines 30 to 34 on page 8 read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a part-time employee of such society who proves to the satisfaction of the provisional committee that his earnings from such society were his principal means of livelihood on April 5th, 1933.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the date of the introduction of the Bill.  I ask the Minister to consider that for this reason: a man who was a treasurer and had another position may have thrown up his other position since last June.  On 30th June, 1932, his remuneration as treasurer was not the major part of his income, but as a result of his having thrown up his other job between 30th June and the date of the introduction of the Bill, his remuneration as treasurer on the date on which this Bill was introduced was the major part <Col N="2151" /> of his income.  Cases of that kind exist, where a man was earning £200 per year from another job and £100 per year as treasurer on 30th June last, and in July, 1932, threw up the £200 a year job, and the £100 per year as treasurer has been his main source of income ever since.  Under the terms of the Bill as it stands, he is not entitled to compensation, because on 30th June it did not form the bulk of his income, but, at the date of the introduction of the Bill, it did form the bulk of his income.  I am asking the Minister in another place simply to put in the words &ldquo;on April 5th, 1933,&rdquo; and if a man can satisfy the Minister that at that date his remuneration as treasurer formed the bulk of his income that he become entitled to compensation as a part-time employee under Section 22 (3) (a) (iii).  These are the only points I want to mention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House desires to convenience the Minister in taking the Final Stage of this Bill to-night and I did not see any point in making an objection to it.  There is, however, one point that I should like to mention at this particular stage.  I have not the papers with me at the moment and I shall, therefore, refer to it only in brief.  Exception has been taken on the part of the officials of, I think, the Irish Trade Unions' Congress Approved Society to certain remarks made by me on the Second Stage to the effect that the management of the society was bad management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is felt by the officials of that society that the statements that have been made here may prejudice their future in the eyes of the Minister, or the body of trustees that is going to be set up to carry out the reorganisation scheme that will be necessary in setting up the unified society.  I do not think the officials of that society need be in any way concerned with that, and I do not believe they are. I am quite sure that their worth will be judged on their individual merits when it comes to considering whether or not they are suitable persons for employment in the unified society.  I was pointing out at the <Col N="2152" /> time that a Bill was being introduced here, and was being sponsored by the Labour Party, and that perhaps it would not be before us at all but for its sponsoring by the Labour Party. I pointed out that there are a number of small societies run by workers in different branches giving substantial benefits and carrying on without losing any moneys during the last few years, but that you had societies like the society I mentioned which lost substantial sums during the last quinquennial period, and that there were societies organised by labour bodies that were infinitely worse from the point of view of management and from the point of view of losing large sums of money.  If I individualised one labour society it was because of its name, and because of a connection that I supposed it had with the Irish Trade Union Congress. I am told it has not, but whether it has or not I do not think it was at all unreasonable to make the case here that you had a unified society being formed under the national health insurance scheme that was going to prejudice the interests of not only small well-organised and well-managed societies throughout the country, but other smaller labour societies; that in my opinion a lot of the support of the Labour Party to this particular Bill came from a desire to cover up the bad management of some of the national health insurance societies that have been run under labour management; and that this unified society which is now being brought about by their help is going to prejudice and damage the interests of the members of many other labour societies that have been well managed.  The Minister has told us in connection with this Bill that he is hoping there will be no reduction of benefits to anybody.  I trust that the Minister will be able to see his hopes realised in that particular matter, but the information that he has put before the House here has not enabled us to see any solid foundation upon which his hopes are based. On the other hand, we feel that there will be a very considerable amount of disorganisation and confusion, and that members of many well-run societies at <Col N="2153" /> the present moment are going to suffer substantially not not only in benefits but in the matter of the convenience of the service they are going to receive under the unified society.</P>

The Deputy comes along to-night to try and whitewash that slander by saying he mixed up the names.  Of course, the haughty General Mulcahy would not dream of apologising to anybody, although he knows perfectly well that he grossly wronged the officers and management committee of that society. He was absolutely blind, apparently, to the knowledge that that society is one of the best conducted national health insurance societies in this State.  The Deputy ought to have known that.  He is the late Minister for Local Government, and might reasonably have been expected to have some knowledge of that fact, unless one is to say that knowledge of his own Department was not a strong characteristic of the General when he was a Minister.  He comes along to-night on his whitewashing expedition.  I wonder why did the Deputy not tell the House what he has learned in the meantime about the society?  I suggest to him that if he thought fit on the last occasion to utter libel and slander about that society, which he knows here to-night to be perfectly untrue, he should at least come along here to-night and acknowledge frankly that he misled the House on the last occasion, that he uttered libel and slander on the last occasion, and he ought to have courage to withdraw the statements he then made.</P>
