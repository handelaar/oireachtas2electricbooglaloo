      <P>May I venture to express unqualified disapproval of this policy.  Not only does it affect the members of the House but the staffs of the House and not the staffs of the House alone but civil servants from other Departments.  One can get a certain amount of work out of civil servants, but if civil servants are overworked by those utterly and entirely inexperienced in control of affairs it will not make for efficiency in public business.  Those in charge of affairs appear to be unable to realise that it is impossible to get double work from people.</P>

      <P>The Minister will remember several references in dealing with this Bill, to certain major industries that were to be undertaken&mdash; sugar beet, cement, industrial alcohol, paper and so on.  When dealing in the Budget debate with these great developments the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that if certain reports that they were having made at present turned out in the way he expected they would establish an industry for peat that would be the most important industry in the country.  The Minister has now <Col N="2530" /> got permission to introduce a Bill dealing with the sugar beet industry and we will be able to have a discussion upon that.  We already had a very restricted discussion on the question of cement.  If there is to be any development in respect of industrial alcohol, paper and other industries of the size and magnitude that the Minister has spoken about, are we to have measures introduced to deal with the organisation of these industries, or, once a company is set up can a very elaborate industry be embarked upon for the development of certain mines or industrial alcohol or beet or sugar without any discussion taking place in the House here, or would there be a discussion as there is to be on the question of beet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Final Stage of a measure the outstanding characteristic of which is whether in this State we are going to invest £5,000,000 in an industrial credit corporation the main purpose of which will be to lend money to individual industrial undertakings about to be started.  There is no limit upon the proportion of the investments which will take place in these various industrial organisations or companies.  Viewing the matter from the financial point of view the position we find ourselves in is this: We have undertaken to borrow £1,000,000 on the strength of the Road Fund.  The interest on that will fall upon employment in the next five or ten years whatever the term of the loan.  We have, secondly, in these years Budget proposals for borrowing approximately £3,000,000, £2,000,000 of which is in respect of local loans, and £1,000,000 of which is on the strength of the assets of the land annuities&mdash; £1,225,000 if my memory serves me right.  Now we add £5,000,000 so that before the financial year ends we may be in the position of having borrowed £9,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have before us, at the moment, a Land Bill which proposes to issue land bonds in respect of the acquisition of land, and the consequence is that within the next ten years we will find ourselves in possession of debts of £9,000,000 in respect to the Budget of this year and <Col N="2531" /> last year and the proposals in connection with the Land Bill before the House.  That has been the policy of most Continental countries whose currencies were upset and finances were seriously disorganised by reason of their appetite for borrowing money.  Nobody objects to the borrowing of money on a sound basis or purpose. There is an element of speculation in connection with these transactions, and, from all we hear in connection with the Land Bill and matters of that sort there is much to make us apprehensive, because in the next four or five years we might find ourselves fairly heavily in debt and that in respect of our own internal economic organisation.  The country is not sufficiently supplied with investors, and others, as to be indifferent to the unloading on the Exchequer of huge blocks of Government securities.  The quotations in respect to these securities for some years past have been eminently satisfactory.  They have maintained a stable level notwithstanding the extraordinary variations in one way or another.  The facts are that the whole world has been subjected at times to peculiar financial cycles.  At one period there is plenty of money; at another period there is a shortage of money, but it is always at such a time when these peculiar financial disturbances take place that we think we are never going to get out of the particular phase we are in.</P>
    <P>It will be within the recollection of Deputies that during the last ten years there were three periods in which there was a definite tightening of credit, a shortage of money, reductions in the value of gilt-edged securities, and so on.  Then the time came when there was an expansion in the value of these gilt-edged securities.  The most extraordinary situation of all is that which we witnessed in the last 12 months or two years.  Fifteen or 18 months ago gilt-edged securities were at a discount. There was apprehension on the part of holders of industrial securities which apparently gave rise to sales and large investing in gilt-edged securities, and they advanced in price.</P>
    <P>It is, I admit, at once a favourable <Col N="2532" /> time for borrowing, but a favourable time for borrowing would not connote a disposition to spend with strict attention to economic results.  It does not need great experience of either municipal or national finance to know that borrowed money is spent much more freely and easily than money raised in revenue and taxation.  It is right at this moment when this Bill is passing, and when huge sums of money are available, that particular attention should be directed to the fact that this is not a rich country, that there is no margin in respect to which one can speculate without very great advertence to the fact that whatever liabilities are now incurred will have to be met.  Nobody, no matter how erudite he may be in connection with financial or economic matters, can estimate the result of events in the next few years. There has been a catastrophic fall in prices and in the maintenance of prices of commodities lies the only hope of meeting liabilities in respect of such borrowings as we are making to-day. And although there is money available now for investments, and plenty of it &mdash;there was never, during my time watching public events, money to be had so easily or so cheaply as at the present moment&mdash;it is not by any means to be inferred from that, that the situation is to be continued or that the immediate future years may not require all those reserves that we have got to weather the economic storm to which the world is subject and from which no country has been free.  Again, I would sound a note of caution with regard to these matters.  We have had the extraordinary benefit in this country of having had a reserve.  Some people regard it as unfortunate that we have so much money invested abroad.  Sooner of later, it will come home to these people that it was particularly advantageous to this country that, at a time of world crisis, we had those savings to balance the losses which we, in common with the rest of the world, were bound to sustain by reason of the fall in the prices of commodities. The fact that these savings were there in no way entitles us to prejudice the economic and financial stability of this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Cosgrave says as regards the need for exercising the greatest caution and getting the best advice possible in regard to this whole matter.  It must be quite clear to those who have experience, as he has had, of the difficulty of getting persons to come forward and invest in Irish projects that some State or other machinery, such as is now contemplated, should be set up.  We have not a money market in this country and, as he says, our margin for speculation is not very great.  Our investors have not, perhaps, the same aptitude that investors in other countries have.  They have not the feeling that they have detailed, personal knowledge of these enterprises or that they have the technical experts to advise them.  On the other hand, the only machinery the Government has to deal with the matter at present is the Trade Loans Act.  Under that Act, if in connection with any particular proposal such as the peat proposal, which has been mentioned, or the industrial alcohol proposal, the Advisory Committee were to report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in favour of a loan of £100,000 or £150,000, it would be doubtful whether the Minister would not have a certain compunction <Col N="2534" /> in giving his assent to a project of that magnitude without coming before the House and giving the House as much information as possible.  However, the machinery which is contemplated regarding industrial credit may work out, I think, I am safe in assuring the House that, before any substantial sum of Government money is advanced for such a purpose or before the State is definitely committed in a direct manner in any of these enterprises, the fullest possible information will be given to the House.</P>
      <P>The only other matter which I need mention is as regards the need for caution and getting the best advice. The Government have, of course, to depend largely on their official advisers, but, in a matter of this kind, the House will understand that the Minister for Finance will necessarily have to consult other financial people outside.  It is obvious that a project of this kind would not go through without some consultation between the Minister for Finance and people outside interested in these matters.  If the Minister for Finance can get a certain amount of co-operation from those who represent the investing public outside, I think that will be the best security that ordinary commercial standards and ordinary commercial safeguards will not be neglected.  So far as the House is concerned, if the State is to be definitely pledged to an unusual extent in regard to any of these projects, the House will be made fully acquainted with all the details.  I could not say, in reply to Deputy Mulcahy, whether, in regard to any particular proposal, it will be necessary to introduce a Bill.  However, since the practice is that the House should be made fully acquainted with matters concerning expenditure, and since the Minister concerned will be always anxious to see that whatever powers he proposes to exercise will be absolutely legal and above board, I think it will be the general course for legislation to be laid before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the particular projects mentioned, the peat briquette proposal has been under consideration but a final decision has not, I think, been reached in the matter yet.  As <Col N="2535" /> regards the industrial alcohol project, certain proposals have been made by people from different countries.  So far as I can make out, if industrial alcohol were to be developed in this country on anything like the same basis that it has been developed in other countries&mdash;so that we could produce, say, one-tenth of our power-alcohol requirements in the form of industrial alcohol&mdash;I think that an expenditure of more than £500,000 would be necessary.  That is a matter, however, which will have to be gone into in detail.  As regards beet, the position will, no doubt, be discussed next week on the Second Reading of the Bill dealing with that matter.  Therefore, I do not think that I could usefully take up the time of the House in dealing with it now.  I think I can assure Deputies that as soon as Ministers have their proposals in a form in which they can bring them before the House&mdash; when they are in a position to state that they are going to enter into certain commitments with people outside regarding these projects&mdash;they will give all the information at their disposal to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having reviewed certain aspects of the industrial situation, we were discussing the disclosed dissatisfaction with industrial development in this country expressed by the President.  The information that we have before us shows that, so far from marking any definite satisfactory increase in employment, or any definite establishment of sound new industrial development in the country, the statements made from time to time by the Minister for Industry and Commerce have been more or less like the whistling of a person passing a churchyard. In the statement made by him in connection with the discussions on the Budget, he told us there had been more industrial, national and economical development during the previous 12 months than there had been for the 50 years before that.  I have pointed out that, having either suppressed or deliberately decided not to collect information with regard to employment in these industries tariffed during the previous administration, and having published figures then for the 1st March last, these figures disclosed that there has been an addition to employment of 1,600 persons in the aggregate of these industries over a period of 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out that in six months in 1929 there were 2,400 additional persons employed.  But going back for five years to the middle of 1925 and taking from the middle of 1925 on to the last date for which figures were available, 1st September, 1931, we see there has been yearly during that period an increase in employment in these industries that are referred to of 2,000 persons.  We have seen <Col N="2537" /> that while elaborate statements have been made as to the additions made in the confectionery industry, where employment was stated to have been doubled and output more than doubled, we are left with a position in which there has been added to an industry that gave employment to more than 5,000 people, simply 150 persons.  Generally the Minister's statements have been utterly unfounded and we must only take it that he was aware when he was making these statements of the position that the figures now disclose.</P>
    <P>The President stated in Kilkenny that he is not satisfied with the way in which things are going and the alternative now promised to us is that local authorities must take some steps to see that industries are developed in their areas.  I have asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he, following the failure of the Minister for Local Government to do so, will tell us what urban or other local authorities can do to see that industries are established in their areas.  There is one thing more than another that is, to my mind, shaking the confidence of the people who would invest in some of the smaller industries.  I quite agree that another thing that is probably arresting development here is all the big talk about big money that we are hearing at the present moment in connection with the Industrial Credit Bill; all the talk about the development of large industries in this country. That is to some extent arresting investment by Irish people in the smaller industries here.  I do not say that it will induce them, when they come to think over it, to invest in these big industries, because a lot more will have to be considered about these things before the company which is being talked about this morning will get to work.</P>
    <P>Ministers have, through their Press, been pointing out how other countries do things.  We are told in their Press that every new acre of wheat that was grown in Italy was propaganded to the people throughout the whole of Italy.  But as regards every new industry that is set up here, not only <Col N="2538" /> is it not propaganded, but, if we ask for particulars as to how industrial development is going, we are refused any information good, bad or indifferent about it.  I was induced, in the beginning of this year, to ask certain questions with regard to the development of industry.  I thought to find out something about the furniture industry.  I was told seven additional furniture factories have been erected in Dublin City, but I was not given any more information.  The same way with the upholstery industry&mdash;I was told there was one factory in Navan and three additional factories in Dublin.  That was at the end of March last, but then information began to dry up and in April I was not offered any information in regard to several other industries.</P>
    <P>I would not be told, for instance, where the two new coach-building factories mentioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as having been opened were located; I would not be told where the 42 new packing factories stated by him to have been opened since March were erected; I would not be told where the two new factories for galvanised hollow-ware were located; where the new factory for gutters and rain-water pipes was situated; where was the location of the new glass bottle factory; where were the four new confectioneries which he stated on the 13th January had been opened since March, 1932; where were the two new factories for brushes and brooms situated; the location of the two new bakeries; where was the new factory for egg cases and fillers; the two new factories for medical and veterinary preparations; the two new factories for baking powder; the two new maize-meal factories; the new bacon-curing factory; the new factory for metallic badges, medals, etc.; the new sheet metal works; the location of the new factory for concrete sanitary pipes; the location of the new cord and twins factory; the new factory for hay rakes; the location of the new factory for paints; the new factory for plaster slabs; the two new factories for spades and shovels; the location of each of the four new paper bags and <Col N="2539" /> printing works; the location of the new factory for barbed-wire; the three new factories for cycle assembly; the location of each of the two new sawmills; the location of the new factory for mastic ashphalt and the new factory for chassis assembly.</P>
    <P>Not only could I not be told to whom these belong, what money was in them, and what employment was given in them, but I would not be told where they were, for the reason given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it was undesirable to do so in the interests of the people connected with these factories, and having regard to the interests of persons concerned with other factories of the same kind.  There is a discrimination apparently on the part of the Minister, because when a new sausage factory was being set up&mdash;I admit it was a factory for the manufacture of Viennese sausages&mdash;a month previously, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was prepared to tell the whole world about it, by photograph, by speech, by going down to Naas with the nearest thing to a tall hat that he had, and, with great State ceremony, starting the factory and telling the whole world about it. While this House cannot be told even where the new factories for the manufacture of spades and shovels are, where the new factories for the manufacture of hay rakes are, not to speak about who it is that is running them and how many persons are employed, we are told in the <i>Irish Press</i> of February 17th, that there is a great new Viennese sausage factory being established at Naas.  We are told what its production is going to be, ten tons of sausages every week.  We got a detailed description of them. There are to be fifty different varieties of sausages.  We are told with regard to their great export market, an export trade is to be opened up with France, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium.  We are told what the prospects are of establishing additional industries around that sausage factory.  We are told that there is going to be a development of that sausage factory; that there is going to <Col N="2540" /> be a tanning factory developed from it.  A tanning factory is going to be one of the by-products of the new sausage factory that is being set up in Naas.  We are told the amount of employment that is going to be given there.  Thirty local men will be employed.  We are told whom it belongs to.  We are told the reasons why the Minister gives all this great publicity to this new factory, a publicity that is completely denied in every detail&mdash;in so far as information asked for in this House may be regarded as publicity&mdash;when it is a question of spades and shovels, or when it is a question of hay rakes. We are told that the reason why the Minister puts on the next thing he has to a tall hat, and goes down and spends part of the day at Naas, and makes speeches and gets photographs taken, is because of the enterprise of the people who started that factory; secondly, because it will relieve unemployment in Naas by employing, as we are told, thirty local men; and thirdly, because his friend and colleague, Mr. Briscoe, was associated with it.  We have had recently to complain that we are denied information as to who are the people connected, say, with the new furniture industries here.  We are told that all that is to be examined by the Minister under the Control of Manufactures Act.  We are told that informing us as to where the new hay rakes are manufactured would interfere with the interests of the people in this country who are already manufacturing hay rakes. On the other hand, we are told all about this factory.  Deputy Briscoe is associated with it, Mr. A. Caplan, and two Mr. Witstuns.  The Supervisor in the factory is Franz Vogel.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, who is responsible for the establishment of public confidence in the development of industry here, what responsibility he has when a factory such as the Naas factory is set up, for seeing that it is conducted upon sound lines, and not upon lines which shake the confidence of every class of person in this country in the development of industry with which the present Ministry is associated.  Can the Minister for Industry and Commerce leave Naas, and wash his hands completely of the factory and everything that is connected with it down there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given a Viennese sausage factory on the one hand, opened by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and in respect of which we are given all this elaborate information; and given an ordinary hay rake factory on the other hand, not opened by the Minister, and in respect of which even the location is denied as a matter of information to Deputies in this House, I am asking whether it means that the Minister is accepting responsibility with regard to the <Col N="2542" /> management of a factory like the one in Naas, either as an ideal as to how factories should be managed in this country, or in any other way does he associate himself with that particular factory, or suggest to people that it is more worthy of their confidence for investing in or for trading with than those factories in respect of which he is refusing us information?  I would assure the Minister, if he thinks that that is a question lightly asked, that it is nothing of the sort.  I suggest that the person who is responsible for the development of industry in this country, who tells us in his Estimate that the cost of the trade and industries section of his Department is going up from £22,000 to £33,000, should take some responsibility on himself, and ask himself why this differentiation.  He should ask himself whether it implies anything to the ordinary investing people or to the ordinary trading people that he should associate himself so prominently with some factories, and if so, whether if&mdash;by investing in the company or if by trading with such company&mdash;they meet any losses he is completely devoid of responsibility in this matter.  If he does feel that he is completely devoid of responsibility towards those people then he ought to say so.  The matter ought not to be left in the position in which it is at the present moment. This House is entitled to some information as to why some industries are opened in this particular way, with this Ministerial giving of information, while other industries which are just as necessary in this country as additional sausage making factories are to be completely ignored by the Minister, even when information is asked for in a reasonable and systematic way by Deputies in this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken exception to Deputies asking him for information. The Minister, in column 2576 of the Official Debates of the 6th April. said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I suggest to the Deputy that his main anxiety in this matter is that the success which has attended the Government's industrial policy has ruined the political prospects of his Party.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2543" /> Again he stated, in column 908 of the Official Debates of the 11th May:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main design behind those questions is to convey the idea that the industrial development which we assert is taking place is only mythical.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is not in any way the anxiety of Deputies who ask questions about industrial development in this country.  Long before the members of the other side realised the necessity for industrial development here, members on this side were actively engaged in endeavouring to develop Irish industry, and, in regard to the special set of industries which I asked the Minister questions about the other day, had succeeded in carrying out and sustaining development in that set of industries to the extent that during the last five years before we left office there was an increased employment of two thousand persons per annum in those industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister now, deliberately hiding information as to the employment in those industries for the first eighteen months of his period of office, and challenging the <i>bona fide</i> interest of Deputies when asking those questions, gives us, not the information which he promised, in report form, but information dragged from him by questions, which shows that in those particular industries for a period of 18 months there has been an addition of simply 1,689 persons, and that in some of them, particularly the tobacco industry, the soap and candles industry, the brush-making industry, and more particularly, in the men's clothing industry and the furniture-making industry, there has been a very definite set-back to satisfactory development.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Party, before the last election, promised that their policy would mean continuous well-paid employment, the ending of the downward pressure in wages rates, a better standard of living, better houses, better food, and better clothes.  Will the Minister tell us&mdash;particularly in reference to some developments that <Col N="2544" /> have been taking place here in this State, to development that has been taking place, say, in the Wexford County Council, where men who have been in continuous employment have been paid off to make room for casuals &mdash;if the policy being pursued by his Department is keeping up continuous well-paid employment?  Does he not realise that the very steps that were proposed to be taken here, and that, in fact, are being taken in County Wexford, are not only endangering the security of persons in employment, which the Minister's Party said they would maintain, but are preventing employment being continuous and are increasing any downward tendency in wages rates.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, ask the Minister to drop the attitude he has taken up in this House with regard to the non-supplying of information; to drop the attitude he has taken up with regard to Deputies, that because they ask questions about industrial development here they are not concerned with industrial development; to give us the things he promised; to give us a review of unemployment in the country; to let us know when we may expect the directory of Irish manufactures that he has promised us, in connection with which he told us that his main difficulty was that industry was developing so rapidly here that the directory was out of date from day to day.  When can we have these?  We want to hear something from the Minister as to what his main actions have been, and what the actions of this staff, the cost of which is increased by £10,000 annually, have been, to increase industrial development here under the enormous powers that have been given to the Minister under the various pieces of legislation which he has passed through this House, allegedly for the purpose of developing Irish industry during the last 12 months at least.</P>
    <P>The Minister again, I say, promised us that he would let us have an analysis of the unemployment position as disclosed by his weekly returns of employment.  The Minister told us the other day that he does not propose to give it.  We want to know why?  The <Col N="2545" /> last return of unemployment which the Minister has made available for us is a return for the week ended 26th June. He gives us the total number of persons registered on that date in the 98 centres.  In 42 of these centres the total number of persons unemployed has increased as against the previous week.  On a previous occasion here, and in discussions arising out of which the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that he would make this analysis of unemployment available, I pointed out that whereas he claimed that a considerable reduction had taken place in the number of persons registered as unemployed from the beginning of January to the date he was speaking about, that by far the greater part of that fall in unemployment had taken place in the NorthWest of the country, in a sector bounded by lines drawn from Innishowen, in County Donegal, to Ballingar, in Galway, and that there had been comparatively little reduction in the Leinster area, where our town populations are.  We wanted some explanation of it.  The Minister's explanation was that they had been found employment though it had indicated somewhat sectional, seasonal, fluctuations.  This report of the 26th June discloses to us somewhat the same position&mdash;that if we take the areas in the east of the country whose centres are Carlow, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Kilkenny and Wexford, we have a fall in the number of unemployed persons there of 7,900.  But if we take the other sector that I spoke about, the fall from the beginning of January to June is 23,000, with this remarkable difference, too, that the number of persons unemployed in that Eastern area was 4,172 more than they were at the same date last year, whereas the number of persons registered as unemployed in the NorthWestern sector is 6,225 less.  Now the Minister will remember, apart altogether from the position that it was desirable that this House should understand something about what these figures represent, that this House would know what are the factors of definite interest.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="2546" /> says, they are associated with the analysis of these figures.  Apart from that, the Minister is aware that it was stated last year that the sums voted for the relief of unemployment would be expended in the country bearing some relation to the number of persons registered in different parts as unemployed, and that for that purpose he was using the labour exchanges.  He stated on the 3rd of November last, in Column 1097 of Volume 44 of the Official Debates:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We insist in every case in which work has been given, that is, work provided out of the State funds, that the workers would be selected through the employment exchanges, that the manager of the employment exchanges is to select the people who are to do that work and the manager does select these people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was on the 3rd of November last. The Minister insisted on persons employed at work in connection with which Governments funds were provided that they should be employed through the labour exchanges.  I had occasion a few days afterwards, by the end of the month, to draw attention to what was happening in Mayo, and the Minister for Local Government said he was enquiring into the matter.  The circumstances are briefly summarised in column 499 of volume 45 for the 30th of November, 1932.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is the position you have: money is being wasted&rdquo;&mdash;(according to the report of the county surveyor who reported very fully to the county council on the matter)&mdash;&ldquo;to the extent, according to the county surveyor, of 40 per cent.; men who were in ordinary and continuous employment under the county council have been dismissed; men have been taken on purely political grounds; men have forced themselves into the employment of the county council without reference to anyone, and the whole scheme of controlling employment through the labour exchanges and the scheme of giving preference to persons according to their necessity has gone by the board in the interests of the Fianna Fáil clubs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2547" /> Nevertheless the Minister insisted that employment would be controlled through the labour exchanges.  We had a rather remarkable disclosure the other day by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that the Minister's scheme had, in fact, gone by the board in certain counties; that as late as the 7th of July the Minister for Industry and Commerce was not exercising the &ldquo;insistence&rdquo; which it was decided by him would be maintained in the selection of persons going on to relief works.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance on the 7th July, as reported in column 2022 of the Official Debates, a question on the matter.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Parliamentary Secretary has made a statement now which, as far as I know, is entirely contrary to any statement we had before.  The statements we have had up to the present are that persons employed on relief works, or on schemes on which Government money is spent, must be employed through the labour exchanges.  I understand, we are told by the Parliamentary Secretary that that is not necessary in Mayo.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told me that he &ldquo;heard me distinctly and understood me correctly.&rdquo;  So that we have had a position then in which the numbers of persons registered as unemployed in certain areas were last year enormously increased.  The relief grants were apparently distributed on that basis of persons employed on those grants not being selected by the labour exchange, not being selected by the county surveyors but being selected by the local Fianna Fáil clubs, marching to the jobs and starting work there, because the county surveyor of Mayo reported that men came on to jobs and started work that he had given no permission for at all. The sequel to that is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce waives in respect of the County Mayo the regulations that he had introduced for getting men through the local labour exchanges&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, the example is picked up elsewhere, and as Deputy MacEoin points out the victory won in Mayo by the Fianna Fáil clubs is heard all throughout the country, so that you have in Longford a position in which the Secretary of the Fianna Fáil club has, as late as the 7th of May, addressed a communication to the assistant county surveyor stating:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was the unanimous vote of the club that the carters be taken from the following list for quarry work in carting:&mdash;Pat Farrelly, William Farrell, Jim Ward, Pat Ryan, Bernie Reynolds, Pat Farrell, Thomas Bannon, William Kienan, and Peter McLoughlin.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The notice to the assistant county surveyor is sent by S. O'Cellaigh.  I do not think that the signature is that of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, because the word &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; follows and the notice is headed &ldquo;Ardagh Cumann&rdquo; and dated 7th May, 1933.  Again on the same date a further note is sent by the Longford Cumann following the great victory in Mayo.  This note from the same Cumann says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Have full list of men selected from the following names for quarry work and stonebreaking:&mdash;Pat Rogers, Thomas Farrell, P. Curley, Mike Kennedy, Mick Clyne, P.

      <P>It must be.  At any rate if their sisters and daughters and aunts are not included, their uncles and nephews and cousins are. But here we have a situation in which this House is definitely told that the figures that we have been given week by week are definite figures of the unemployed position, the first obtained at any rate in this decade by either the House or country.  We are told that the moneys voted by this House are spent on the basis of the distribution of these figures.  We know that the figures in certain years in towns like Athlone, Mullingar, Tullamore, Roscommon which rose from 1,565 in May, to 13,904 in December have since gone down.  The figures registered for unemployment relief grant are important. The rise at the period is not because selection is made by the labour exchange, after the assault made on the system of the county surveyor of the Mayo County Council, and enquiry was made into it by the Local Government Department as we heard here.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is a Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the Minister of that Department insisted that employment should be through the Labour Exchange.  After the assault on that system by the Fianna Fáil clubs in Mayo, we were told, most casually a week ago by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, that that system is scrapped in Mayo.  Has it been scrapped in Longford, and will the Minister tell us where else it has been scrapped?  Will he tell us exactly what he is doing to keep his word that his machinery will see that the moneys voted for relief works are to be spent in a systematic and non-party <Col N="2550" /> way?  Will he tell us the number of orders in which he has withdrawn his insistence that the scheme be run in a particular way, and the number in which his scheme is still insisted on? The Minister will remember that definite objections of a reasonable kind have been made by persons who know something of the working of county councils, and of the duties and responsibilities of county surveyors. Their work has, in certain years, been interfered with by a system insisted upon.  We want to know why a scheme is insisted upon in certain counties and not in others.</P>
      <P>Every one of these things are matters of importance in this House and in the country.  Again I think it is an extraordinary and discreditable thing as suggested to us that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is as much ashamed of the results obtained from the discharge of his duties during the past 12 months as is the Minister for Agriculture with the results that have accrued in the country because of the way his work has been carried out. If it is unfair to the Minister, and to the results that his Department has been able to show, I think we ought to hear, and at a certain amount of length, from the Minister the cause of the situation at the present time, and why it is that there is no confidence in the people whose efforts could be kept warm and helpful, to assist in the development of Irish industry.</P>

The proposal, presumably, is in accord with what was said by the President at the start of business to-day, when we were told that we were to continue the Estimates until finished, and then that we were to go on to the Appropriation Bill.  There is one Estimate, that for Fisheries and Gaeltacht Services, which has two or three times been taken out of its order in the list and shoved away down as the second last Vote to be discussed. It is hoped presumably that this will come up for discussion in the small hours of to-morrow morning.  I think this whole thing is an attempt to burk discussion, because every Teachta from the Gaeltacht knows perfectly well nothing has been done in the last 12 months by the Department in the Gaeltacht.  The activities of the Gaeltacht housing end of the Department, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries has had to admit in the House, have fallen by about 70 per cent. since Fianna Fáil took office.  In one case he showed that the figures had fallen from 1,166 new houses up to 31st March, 1932, to a little over 300.  The same applies to the amount of money sanctioned.  I think every Deputy from the Gaeltacht should have an opportunity of discussing fully the activities of the Department. I hold that the postponing of this Estimate for the Fishery and Gaeltacht Services until some unearthly hour is part of the deliberate policy of the Government to avoid discussion on the subject.</P>

This motion could have been moved when the House met to-day and I suggest that to move a motion of this kind, which turns the business of the House into a farce, at a quarter to 12 is an obvious effort at closure of this discussion itself.</P>

      <P>I wish that the politeness for which the Minister is well and deservedly known were communicated to some of his followers and, even to some of his colleagues on his own bench and, then, perhaps, some explanation of this motion might be given.  I think it is scandalous, in view of the number of important Estimates, including that referred to by Deputy Lynch, that of Industry and Commerce and the President's office on which the policy of the Government can be discussed, to put forward this motion when we know what the House has gone through for a couple of weeks.  It is an effort to carry through legislation by tiring out the House, and I suggest that no justification except incompetency on the part of the Government can be given for this.  I gathered from what the President said yesterday that a number of new Bills were to be introduced&mdash;another &ldquo;Cuts&rdquo; Bill and various other Bills and that these were to be rushed through.  I doubt if these Bills have been adequately considered even in the Departments and I suggest that we had a glaring example of that yesterday.  A Bill was introduced and a formal statement read out by the Acting-Minister for Lands and <Col N="2554" /> Fisheries.  In the course of that statement he announced that Government amendments would have to be introduced to that Bill&mdash;an obvious confession, even at that stage, that no proper consideration could have or had been given to that Bill by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder how many more official amendments, besides the amendment of the section hinted at or stated to be about to be brought in by the Minister, there will have to be introduced to that Land Bill, which bears on the face of it every evidence of lack of consideration and hasty drafting?  I suggest that what is happening in that particular case&mdash;we had an instance of it yesterday&mdash;has happened in respect of every other Bill and must happen in respect of other Bills introduced in the future, and I suggest that it is simply treating the House and the country, as represented in the House, with complete lack of respect to move a motion of this kind.  Everybody knows from experience that the Government pays very little attention to any criticism.  They have, generally speaking, empty benches while debates are going on, but, scattered through the building, they have their Deputies, and these Deputies, who have not listened to one single argument brought forward, will troop into the lobbies and vote.  They have their majority and they can carry through their particular motion.  A deliberative assembly, however, ought to be allowed to deliberate, especially on important matters of this kind, without the strain that will be imposed by this particular proposal. As has been remarked by Deputy Dillon, it would be much more decent to adopt the straightforward lines of trying to stop discussion, because that is their object.  No justification has been put forward, I suggest, for this motion from the Ministerial Benches.  There are a number of things which we want to discuss, and to discuss adequately, and I suggest that, from the point of view of proper discussion in the House, and from the point of view of the country, whose interests are at stake in these discussions, an adequate and proper opportunity ought to be given to the House <Col N="2555" /> to discuss these matters properly.  The introduction of a motion of this kind, which turns the entire machinery of the House into a farce by keeping up a pretence of discussion when there will and can be nothing like adequate discussion under the circumstances, is affronting the House, and I suggest the House should not tolerate a motion of this kind.</P>

      <P>I note that it is not the Leader of the House who comes in here to make this motion. The Leader of the House was here at 10.30 this morning, and he was asked to make the motion then, but he has run away and left his self-described mild little substitute to move the motion which he is afraid to move himself. This is one of the most important matters that have come before the House, because it is an effort on the part of the Government to prevent discussion of matters of which they are ashamed.  The Gaeltacht Vote is one of the most important Votes in this House, and one of the Votes in which most Deputies in this House are interested&mdash;all over the Western seaboard we are interested in it&mdash;and because its work has been carried on disgracefully, you are ashamed of it.  You have put back the discussion on it again and again, and you have moved the Estimate from the position it had on the list of Estimates, and you now come in here and say: &ldquo;We will try to prevent it being discussed at all.&rdquo;  This is supposed to be a deliberative assembly, and everybody here is supposed to give his best.  How is a person to give his best at this time to-morrow or later on?  How is a member of this House, when it has been in session for 24 hours, to be able to give his best?  It is the Government's endeavour to prevent fair discussion, and it is because they are ashamed of what they have done, and because they are afraid to face a fair and open discussion, that they are bringing forward this disgraceful motion.</P>

      <P>If I may interject now, I will say that efforts have been made, as I think the Deputy knows, by the Whip of the Government Party to make a business arrangement with the two Opposition Parties.  Time and time again, the Parliamentary Secretary has suggested to the gentlemen opposite that they should arrange a time table for these Estimates.  We have no anxiety whatever to burk discussion on any of them, but it is necessary that the financial business should be got through by a certain date, and, in order to do that, as Deputies opposite know well, the Seanad must get a certain time to deal with the financial business.  I do not know who is the Chief Whip for the Opposition side&mdash;Deputy Mulcahy seems to be a kind of Pooh-bah for the Opposition; he is everything&mdash;but the Parliamentary Secretary has asked him what time could be arranged and how a programme could be arranged to suit them and the other Parties in Opposition. So far every effort on our part to meet them and to give time for Estimates, such as the Estimate on which the Opposition claim they want a considerable amount of time, has failed.  There are Estimates on the list here for discussion which I suggest would require very little time, and, <Col N="2557" /> perhaps, they would go through in a formal way, and the time necessary might then be given to the other Estimates.  There are, perhaps, one or two for the discussion of which the Opposition would probably like to have a considerable time but, during the last fortnight, the matter has been discussed over and over again and we have failed to come to any business arrangement.  No time-table could be arranged, so we have to move this motion.</P>

      <P>What does the Vice-President mean by referring to arranging a programme for Estimates, when this House has been sitting on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of this week and last week? Did the Vice-President ever offer to have the Gaeltacht Estimate taken and discussed last week or this week? What does the Vice-President think could have been done with any of these Estimates any day last week or any day this week?  I have complained about the way in which Ministers speak of the difficulty of making arrangements by means of the Whips.  The Whips of Opposition Parties cannot be used to gag this House, simply because the Ministers want that done.  The Government have control of the time of the House, but they deliberately pushed these Estimates down to this particular stage.</P>

      <P>They must not.  The discussion of the Estimates last year lasted into November and December. There is no reason why that should not be done this year.  Deputy Lynch and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney have spoken&mdash;and spoken truly&mdash;of the Estimate for Fisheries and Gaeltacht Services. I honestly believe that there is something in the charge that the Government is reluctant to allow full scope for discussion of that Estimate. <Col N="2558" /> I well remember Senator Connolly, who is now kicking up his heels in London, kicking up his heels in Donegal last January.  I remember torchlight processions through the county. We were told that the deliverer and saviour of the Gaeltacht had come to judgment and that he was going to do the world and all.  You could not go anywhere but you met him with torch-lights and bands, bringing deliverance to the people of Donegal.  Sight or light of him they never had since.  Not a single thing did he do for the Gaeltacht; not a single new service did he establish.  As a matter of fact, most of the existing services were allowed to wilt and decay.  The saviour and deliverer is over in London, and the people in the Gaeltacht are sitting waiting for him to come back.  Doubtless he will&mdash;if there is a general election. That is, if he dares to do so. Meanwhile, that Estimate, the Estimate of the Department of the President of the Executive Council and the Estimate for Old Age Pensions, are relegated to the end of the list, and we are told that it will be necessary to sit here night and day until those Estimates are disposed of. There is absolutely no necessity to dispose of them before the Recess. They were not disposed of last year before the Recess.  The Vice-President must admit that this is the closure.  It is a delicate form of the closure, but it is the closure, nevertheless. The Government is forcing this motion through so that these Estimates may remain undiscussed, because no man can sit here night and day for 48 hours and make intelligent contributions to a discussion on complicated matters of that kind.</P>

Has there been the slightest attempt to prolong discussion?  Is he not aware that a couple of important Estimates were allowed to go through practically without discussion?  Has he considered how the amount of time devoted to Estimates&mdash;this matter is generally considered by Governments&mdash;compares with the amount of time devoted previously to the same business&mdash;say, when the Vice-President was in Opposition and the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in power?</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the fact that the Government has had to move this motion is, in itself, a condemnation of the Government.  It shows that they have been unable so to arrange the business of the House that it could rise at the time it rises normally every year.  It is extraordinary that, notwithstanding that we shall be sitting until 11th August, the business cannot be disposed of without all-night sittings.  I think it is not right that we should be forced to sit all night at any time but, if we are to have all-night sittings, why not have them on Wednesdays or Thursdays?  It is grossly <Col N="2560" /> unfair that we should have an all-night sitting on a Friday night above all other nights.  It is very unfair to those Deputies who represent and live in rural constituencies and who have to go back to their constituencies during the week-end.  It is all right for Ministers living in the city and for members living in the city but it is grossly unfair to Deputies from rural constituencies. The reason the Government have chosen Friday is probably because they think Deputies will allow them to rush business through so as to enable them to catch the 4 o'clock train when the alternative is to sit all night.  So far as many members of the House are concerned, this proposal means that they will have to stay in Dublin over the week-end.  Some members live so far from Dublin that it would not be worth their while to go home on Saturday afternoon and come back on Monday morning to be here for Tuesday. I think that the House has grounds for protesting against the motion.  The Vice-President has talked about the attempts made by the Government to come to a business arrangement with Opposition Whips.  We all know what the Government means by a &ldquo;business arrangement.&rdquo;  A &ldquo;business arrangement,&rdquo; from the Government point of view, means that they are to have all their own way.  We are told that if members on Opposition Benches did not speak so often we would get through the business much more quickly.  We would.  If they did not speak at all, the business would be got through more quickly still.  I remind those sitting on the Government Benches that, when they were in Opposition, they wasted a great deal more time than is being wasted at present. The President, who talked last night about the length of speeches, should be the last man to refer to that in this House.  Last week, on the American Bonds Bill, the President made at least three speeches to one speech made by any other member of the House.  It is an outrage on the House and an outrage on the country that Deputies should be faced with a motion like this.  They are supposed to do the business which the people sent them here to do in a proper manner. <Col N="2561" /> Yet, they are to be forced to sit here, if necessary, until 12 o'clock to-morrow night.</P>

      <P>I was struck on reading this morning's newspapers by two items.  The first was a description of yesterday's procedings given by one of the journalists.  Looking at the House when the President was stating yesterday that Deputies would have to sit until August 11, reminded him, he said, of the schoolmaster keeping his scholars in after hours because they had been bad boys.  This is another effort by the schoolmaster to keep the scholars in because they have been bad boys&mdash;not an effort to get through the business, but an effort to punish Deputies for doing the best for their constituents.  One thing the Government does not appear to understand is that they have been elected to this House on the principle of proportional representation.  There is a very large percentage of the members of this House in opposition to the Government, and they are entitled to have the views of their constituents put forward and listened to.  That is what we are sent here for.  The whole scheme of proportional representation is not to allow the Government to steam-roll particular measures through in accordance with their wishes, but to allow minorities to have proper representation and proper opportunities for putting the views of their constituents before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vice-President has just said that efforts were made with the Whips of this and other Opposition Parties to find out how the programme could be arranged to suit them.  I would make only one amendment to that statement, and that is, that the word &ldquo;them&rdquo; meant the Government, because, from anything I know of the efforts that were made by the Government Whips with the Whips of this Party, those efforts were made entirely with a view to suiting Government convenience and <Col N="2562" /> Government policy.  No effort certainly was made to suit the convenience of this Opposition Party.</P>
    <P>The second point that strikes me is that in the newspapers this morning it is stated Deputy Norton has to leave town through overwork.  There are numbers of Deputies here who have worked as hard as Deputy Norton. Perhaps it is their physique that has enabled them to withstand the strain of the last 12 or 18 months; but what about the Government staff; the staffs of Government offices who are well-known to be overworked and who must be overworked by the spate of legislation sprung upon this House and upon the country?  I suggest overwork for all the staffs or for Deputies will not conduce to proper administration or a proper scheme of legislation.  To add to the other work to which this House has been subjected in the last few months 48 hours of additional and unnecessary work is entirely bad policy from the point of view of the country.  We can readily accept the challenge to stay here until 12 o'clock to-morrow night; our physique is quite well able to stand all that; but I emphasise that the Government's policy in asking us to remain here so long is an unwise and a foolish policy, and it is a policy that is bad for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when we are asked to work here four days a week, I consider it is nothing less than a pernicious thing to introduce a motion asking us to sit extra hours on a Friday evening.  It is particularly pernicious in this case when the House is considering such important matters as the Estimates for Public Services.  It is an unwise thing deliberately to ask a tired House, which has sat four consecutive days, to discuss such important items as the Minister proposes to discuss this evening, to-night and to-morrow. It is asking the representatives of the people to do the impossible. Deputy Dillon pointed out that the Estimates were not passed last year until very late in the year; neither was the Appropriation Bill. These things are no more necessary this year than they were last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2563" /> Deputy Morrissey made an allusion to country Deputies which was very apt.  It is unfair to ask country Deputies to remain late on Friday when they have represented their constituents here practically for the whole week.  In the case of some Deputies, in order to attend here on Tuesday morning they have to leave their homes at an early hour on Monday.  If they are to be compelled to remain here until to-morrow night it will mean that they will be unable to return to their homes during the week-end, because they will have to resume business here again on Tuesday.  The whole proposal of the Minister justly deserves the title pernicious. He calmly asks Deputies to remain here overnight to discuss financial motions, the most important items that can come before us.  His proposal means that sleepy Deputies will be asked to discuss financial matters which could easily have been brought forward at another time.</P>
    <P>If it is essential to get these Estimates through they might easily have been considered during this week.  The Government might easily have deferred other matters that were under consideration until a later stage.  It would appear that they have deliberately selected Friday afternoon and Friday night in order to pass certain Estimates in a tired House because they do not desire to have anything in the nature of a full discussion.</P>

I would like to mention, however, that there are many Deputies who have a good deal of business of their own to attend to and it is not fair to bring them here without letting them know beforehand how long they will be asked to stay.  The Government should give some indication of the length of time they will be required to stay here so that Deputies can make arrangements for the carrying on of their business.  Reference has been made to obstruction from these Benches.  I am not aware that there has been any obstruction.  I think it is a great injustice to submit a motion of this sort so as to place Deputies in a position that they will not be able intelligently to discuss the Estimates for Public Services.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows what I think of galleries; at least he should.  I do not propose, therefore, to go into detail in connection with the disturbance of individual members of the staff.  I must say, however, that it is a monstrous suggestion.  My friend, the Deputy opposite, said that this is playing to the gallery.  I submit that if this suggestion is carried out we will have no gallery to talk to to-morrow.  I think that would be very unfair to the Deputies on the other side, who always arrange their galleries.</P>

      <P>The galleries might be better than the Deputy's Party. The necessity for this motion has not been proved.  There is really no hurry. <Col N="2566" /> The Vice-President did say that at a certain date, I think it was the 5th, the Estimates were to be passed.  I think there is a good deal in the suggestion that the Government desires to rush over those Estimates because of certain promises made by them. The position now is that at the end of 12 months working a number of further millions are asked for instead of a reduction in taxation, and the Opposition parties in this House can say to the Government: &ldquo;Why have you not done as promised?&rdquo;  I do not want to refer again to the savagery of asking the staff to work 36 hours continuously.  As well as that, there is the impossibility of those members on the Government Benches being able to discuss matters with any intelligence at the end of a 36-hours sitting.  I think that the Vice-President would be well advised really to withdraw the motion, and say that the House will sit until, let us say, the normal time on week days, 10.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now about to embark on a 48 hours discussion of these Estimates and it has puzzled the minds of some as to why we are going to do it.  The more I consider these Estimates, the more evident it becomes to me that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party have made up their minds that, for them, there is in this country only one place where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest, and while they can escape from their constituents into this House and there is an ample force to protect them from cross-examination by the people they are supposed to represent, it is very difficult to dig them out of that safe refuge.  I should not be in the least surprised if we had many motions of this kind, particularly in view of the <Col N="2571" /> legislation introduced yesterday.  This will become, by the time the Land Bill of 1933 is explained to the people of this country, the most popular refuge for members of the Fianna Fáil Party in the whole country.  Deputy Mulcahy to-day dealt with the failure of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to meet the problem of unemployment as he promised to meet it, and I think Deputy Mulcahy was too severe on the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  What can the Minister for Industry and Commerce do?  If you wreck the whole economic fabric of a country, if you deliberately put your hand to a national policy the principal consequence of which is the destruction of the purchasing power of the public, how can any Minister, no matter how he administers his Department, prevent the rise, the daily increase of unemployment amongst our people?  It does not matter what the Minister or the Acting Minister does, if the present policy of the Government continues, the tide of unemployment will rise and continue to rise in this country.  The policy of this Government is reducing the consuming public in Ireland, the agricultural community, to destitution and you cannot employ men manufacturing goods if there is nobody left in the country who has any capacity for consuming them.  When the goods accumulate to a sufficient extent, then manufacturers, no matter how good their will may be, must pay off their men when they cannot sell what they have already produced, and the longer the present situation goes on the higher will flow the tide of unemployment in this country, and it does not matter what means the Minister adopts, he will be absolutely powerless to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable fault has been found with him for the way in which unemployment grants have been administered. The unemployment grants have been administered for the purpose of pouring out money at the most propitious moment from the Government's point of view; and when you are trying to make people forget the destitution and the poverty that Government policy is <Col N="2572" /> bringing upon them, the best way in which you can do it is to pour out relief grants on the eve of the occasion when they will be called on to make a decision and to give their verdict on Government policy.  That is what the Government has done and, so far as the Minister for Industry and Commerce is concerned, he deserves high credit from his own Executive. No man skipped into the breach more agilely than did the Minister for Industry and Commerce with a relief grant and, if there is a general election in October, be perfectly certain of this: the relief grants will pour out to the country like a revivifying stream.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So much for unemployment. I want to refer again to what I consider to be a very grave scandal in connection with the administration of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I referred to it on two or three occasions before but, so far, the Minister has never attempted to meet the case.  Under the legislation to regulate the milling of flour in this country, the Minister was given authority to issue permits to certain individuals to import flour free of duty, if he considered that to be in the public interest.  In County Donegal one particular case came under my notice in which a certain individual set up a bakery.  In the course of time, there were some labour troubles on the railways in the Free State, and that individual then represented to the Government that, as a result of these labour troubles, he was unable to secure supplies of bakers' flour for his bakery.  Deputies who are familiar with the flour trade will know that bakers' flour is an entirely different commodity from household flour; that the average housewife could not use bakers' flour in her kitchen, because it would be quite unsuitable for the purposes ordinarily employed in the kitchen. On the other hand, a baker could not ordinarily use household flour in a <Col N="2574" /> bakery, because it is not a suitable grade of flour for the manufacture of bakers' bread.  At this time there was a duty of 5/- a sack on flour, and the Irish millers, of course, raised their prices by about 4/- a sack in order to get the benefit of the tariff.</P>
      <P>All the flour factors in Donegal were obliged to import English flour and to pay the 5/- duty or to buy Irish flour from Irish millers at 4/- a sack above the English price.  This gentleman came to Dublin and got a permit to import bakers' flour, on the ground that he could not get supplies in the Free State.  He got the permit to import, free of duty.  Having got the permit, which was probably simply a permit to import so much flour free of duty, this prudent gentleman went into Derry to Spillers's agent, and got half the quantity of bakers' flour, and half the quantity of household flour.  When he got back to Donegal his flour came after him.  He then sailed round to all the customers of his rivals in the wholesale flour business and asked them what so-and-so was charging for flour.  These customers said, perhaps £1 9/- or £1 10/- a sack, which was the Irish price.  He said to them: &ldquo;Do not bother dealing with them.  I will give it to you at 27/-.&rdquo;  So well he could, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce had given him a permit to import flour, free of duty, and no one else could get a permit.  Let me be clear about this. I am satisfied that the Department of Industry and Commerce believed that the man wanted bakers' flour and gave a permit to bring in bakers' flour. Having got it on these representations this man went on to use that permit, partially to bring in household flour, which he sold for the purpose of injuring his competitors in the trade. I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to inquire into that locally and, if he found the allegation I made in this House true, to bring that man to justice, if he had not given a satisfactory explanation.</P>

      <P>When I had something to say about lobster breeding, the Deputy's only contribution was that my statement was not right.  I repeat the charge.  Every syllable that I utter now I challenge the Minister to inquire into, by sending down a responsible officer from his Department.  Every word I have stated will be demonstrated to be true.  I challenged him to do that three times in this House.  He can do it now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is using his position to make charges in this House that he cannot substantiate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will substantiate the charges, but it is not in accordance with the well-established precedent of this House to mention the names of an individual, because the person is not here to defend himself.  I formally inform the Minister that I am at his disposal now, or hereafter, to place the name and the circumstances in his hands.  I gave them to the Minister for Industry and Commerce before he fell ill.  That specific case falls under the head of this system of issuing permits.  On the general question of permits I say that the whole system is breaking down, and making the conduct of business in this country virtually impossible.  Omnibus tariffs are being imposed, and merchants are told that if they find omnibus tariffs take in something they are not meant to take in they can get permits. When they go to get permits it may take three weeks or a month to do so. I am quite satisfied that the permanent officials are doing their best to <Col N="2576" /> expedite the consideration of applications for permits, but these are so numerous that it is physically impossible to deal with them with any degree of expedition.  The result is that it is daily becoming more and more difficult to carry on ordinary trade in the country&mdash;such trade as is left, and that is not much.</P>

      <P>I do not for a moment desire to avoid your ruling, but it is the declared policy of the Government to sponsor the manufacture of cement in this country.  I think I will be in order if I say that in sponsoring an enterprise of that kind they have got to remember that cement is not a standard article.  There are varying qualities of cement and they have got to remember&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely my position.  I am not trying to wriggle out of your ruling but the Minister and the Acting-Minister have stated repeatedly that it is the policy of their Party to take such steps as may be necessary to promote the manufacture of cement.  I suggest that when they proceed to act in pursuance of that declared policy, they should bear certain considerations in mind.  I want to say a word on the steps they should take before they put their hands to the task.  No other opportunity will arise for dealing with that question.  They have got to remember that cement is an essential element in the housing of the poor and that every shilling per cwt. put on cement is going to be borne by the people who pay the rents.  The most difficult problem that the Department of Local Government and Public Health have is to provide decent houses at a rent within the capacity of the people to pay.  What everybody concerned with housing has been trying to do is to secure that houses will be built at a price which will make it possible to attain that objective.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not supposed to quote a Standing Order.  He can raise a general question.  Obviously, this matter has been discussed here and may be discussed again.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the purpose of the Government to create a monopoly of the manufacture of cement without providing that the consuming public will have cement of a sufficiently high specification at a reasonable price, then, in my opinion, Government policy <Col N="2578" /> on cement is going to cut clean across Government policy on housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy before he continues his speech tell us what the increase is going to be.  It has been definitely stated&mdash;I hate to interrupt the Deputy in an eloquent mood&mdash; that any increase likely to take place in the price of cement will be infinitesimal and will not affect housing costs.</P>

      <P>The Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce says that the increased cost will be infinitesimal. Without the slightest desire to answer the Minister abruptly, I tell him that he is talking through his hat.  If the Minister believes that cement of the commercial quality which is being used here can be manufactured in this country at a price anything like that at which we are importing it at present, he does not know what he is talking about.  Estimates were submitted to this House showing that on the basis of certain suggested increases in the price of cement per cwt., the increased cost per house would be infinitesimal. I think that these estimates were wrong.</P>

      <P>The trouble with this situation is that it is a question of one &ldquo;think&rdquo; against another &ldquo;think.&rdquo; If I had any reason to believe that the Minister's thoughts were founded upon substantial facts, I would be very much swayed, but my experience of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is that they are founded on nothing at all, or on the assumption that what he wishes to think is true.  The fact remains that when I proposed that a specification of the standard cement to be produced by the monopoly which it was Government policy to create should be forthcoming, the suggestion was scorned as absurd and unworthy of consideration.  But when some worthy gentleman with sound Tory background <Col N="2579" /> got up in the Seanad and made the same proposal, the Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce fell upon his face and said he accepted it unreservedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Acting-Minister went on to add that he begged to be excused from the necessity of making a specification for the cement that would be imported between the date of the passing of the Bill and the establishment of the first cement factory.  He is doubtless going to come back to this House at a future date and tell us that this prudent recommendation, having been explained, is one that he recommends to the House.  When this House had the temerity to make that suggestion, it was beneath his dignity to consider it.  It was quite superfluous and unnecessary.  The Minister has learned differently since, and I only hope that he may make a few more excursions to the Seanad between this and the time his cement policy takes final form.  I hope that in those hallowed surroundings he will learn more from his respectable instructor of the dangers and pitfalls of the policy to which he has put his hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, I want to refer to the beneficent influence exercised by the Minister of Industry and Commerce over the milling industry.  As a result of his activities since the Cereals Bill was passed, we discovered on last Monday morning that there was no bakers' flour at all in the City of Sligo.  The bakers announced their intention of closing their doors because there was no flour left.  The operation of quotas and restrictions had been so effective as to dry up the supply of flour.  We had excluded from Donegal bread from the Six Counties.  We had arranged that <Col N="2580" /> bread was to be supplied from Sligo, and, on Monday morning, there was not an ounce of bakers' flour in the whole City of Sligo.  The bakers could not get it.  They went to the usual source of supply and they were told that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would not allow any increase for Sligo, that they had milled their quota and would be allowed to mill no more.  I got into communication with the Minister and, as usual, received a very courteous reply.  I think one or two other Deputies drew his attention to the situation.  But it shows the extravagant absurdity of the administration of this legislation when a situation can arise in one of the principal cities of the country, in which there is not an ounce of bakers' flour or the wherewithal to make a loaf.  That is the favour that has been conferred on the milling and baking industry by the administration of the Cereals Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister for Industry and Commerce was concerned in a certain transaction in wheat recently, but I understand there was a transaction in wheat in Dublin to which the Government was a party. If the Minister for Industry and Commerce had anything to do with that transaction I think it would be of great interest to the House to know the profit the Government derived from the sale they made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That accounts for the Minister's complacency; he looks happy and undismayed.  Perhaps if he knew as much about that transaction as I do, wrinkles would appear on his brow.  I suggest he should have a chat with the Minister for Agriculture and I think he will get information from him that will startle him.</P>

The Deputy's colleague, Deputy Neil Blaney, was recently described by &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo; as being dead.  They heard so little about him since he came here to represent Donegal that they assumed he was dead, and they described him as the late Neil Blaney.  They felt that no man could be so silent, and they assumed that he was in the grave. However, I am happy to see that my friend and colleague, Deputy Blaney, is as brisk and as well as ever.  I met him in the Lobby this morning about his business, and I trust he will be spared for many years to come to represent Donegal as eloquently as he does now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to spare the Deputy from himself; I will ask him merely to take a note of it.  In my opinion the dominant question that arises under this head is that referred to by Deputy Mulcahy, and that is the question of employment.  I think all Parties will agree that it is not a question that should be made one of Party capital.  So far as I am concerned, I am profoundly convinced there is <Col N="2582" /> nothing the Minister can do to remedy that situation so long as the Executive Council continues their present line of policy.  I think it is a mistake to find undue fault with the Minister on account of the unemployment situation. Unemployment must grow where there is universal destitution.  If you wreck the consuming capacity of any community, in that community the tide of unemployment will grow.</P>
      <P>In 1920 the farmers in this country were never so prosperous and they have never been so prosperous since. In those years labour was never better paid and there was never more employment for everybody than there was then.  The farmers in this country are now reduced to a depth of destitution that they never plumbed before in the memory of living man.  Unemployment was never more rife in this country. Those are two coincidences which I would like Fianna Fáil Deputies to consider and, when they have considered them, perhaps they will connect them.  When they have connected them, perhaps the farmer Deputies in Fianna Fáil will try to help their own. Those who represent the constituencies where there is a large labouring population will do their best to help that population.  If they see the problem as I have seen it, I am sure they will co-operate with us in bringing an end to a situation which is leading the farming community to ruin and destruction. If they succeed in doing that they will do more than anything else to put an end to a situation which has perplexed this country and which will continue to perplex it so long as you smash the industry upon which the country depends.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraordinary thing, in connection with a Department that claims to represent the industry of this country and in the case of a Minister who claims to administer what he once described as the revolutionary policy of the Government, that no effort was made in the introduction of this Estimate to give the House any idea of the results of that particular policy.  It is not the first time we have had occasion to call attention to this lack of respect for the House on the part of the Ministry. <Col N="2583" /> Having heard no statement from the Minister, I think the House is fully entitled to make full use of its rights on the Committee Stage, so far as this Estimate is concerned.  Even after the Minister has at least given some statement to the House as to the administration of this Department during the year, the House will still be entitled to discuss that policy as revealed by the Minister.  I think it is well we should issue that warning, so that when the Minister replies it will be distinctly understood he is not going to conclude.</P>
      <P>The House is entitled to a statement from the Minister on the results of what he described as a revolutionary policy.  We are all the more entitled to expect a statement of that kind from the Acting-Minister, because it will be in the recollection of the Deputies that some 12 months ago, in answer to various challenges, the Minister fixed eight months as the time that would see the triumph, the proof of the success, of that policy. I hold there was no excuse for the line adopted by the Minister in the present instance.  He did not attempt to give to the House any idea of the results of this policy.  No justification has been attempted so far as this policy is concerned and right through the year, as Deputies will remember, attempts were made again and again from various quarters, and particularly by Deputy Mulcahy, to extract information from the Minister as to the effect of the policy that has been pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though he promised this House that in eight months after he had spoken, now some 12 months ago, the country would be convinced of the success of his policy, he and his Department have absolutely refused to give any information to this House or any information to the country on which they could form some estimate as to the value of the policy that the Government has embarked on.  Many of us see in this particular policy the ruin of many old-established industries, and interference with a great deal of employment in the country.  Yet no justification, except the glib answers of the <Col N="2584" /> Minister and the somewhat more ponderous answers of the Acting-Minister, has been given on this particular matter.  As a compensation to this country for the loss of our principal foreign market we were promised that we were getting control of the home market.  When attempts were made from various parts of the House to find out what that home market has proved to be worth, even to the manufacturers for whom it was apparently preserved, we could get no information.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that Deputy Keating from Wexford&mdash;and I think that there is no difference of opinion between him and the representative of the Labour Party from Wexford&mdash; has tried again and again to get information as to the amount of increased work there was, for instance, in his own town of Wexford as a result of the tariff policy of the Government, as to the type of employment that was given, and as to whether or not there has been diminution in the higher paid types of employment.  There were no figures and no information available.  I should have thought, seeing that the attention of the Minister had been drawn to that and other facts in the course of the year, that the Acting-Minister would have utilised the opportunity of taking the House and the country into his confidence by giving concrete facts about the increase in employment and the value, so far as wages are concerned, of that increase in employment.  We have no evidence whatever of the value of the employment that has been directly given as a result of those tariffs, but I suggest that we have evidence&mdash;and every Deputy who has been through the country knows there is plenty of evidence&mdash;of the unfortunate results of the Government's policy so far as employment is concerned.  The results that would inevitably follow as a consequence of the Government's policy have been pointed out.  Here, I thoroughly agree with Deputy Dillon.  The burden of our complaint is not so much against an individual Minister, or against an individual Department.  It is against the policy which the Government has <Col N="2585" /> blindly persisted in.  They were warned that it was bound to have certain results detrimental to every type of industry, agricultural and otherwise, in this country.  It was pointed out that as a result of their policy the positions of men who had been in employment for years would become insecure.  Has not that particular warning been more than justified? We have seen the line attempted to be adopted by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance so far as employment is concerned.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the question of employment, and not with the amount given in wages. There has been an increase in unemployment. <Col N="2586" /> There has been what has been justly called casualisation of labour as a result of the policy of the Government, of this particular Department and of this particular Minister.  I suggest that that is one of the most relevant things I can discuss on this particular matter. Naturally I am quite aware that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government as a whole may say they are not directly responsible for what local bodies did, but what local bodies have done in the same direction follows from this whole insane tariff policy and economic policy of the Government.  I suggest, sir, that I am quite entitled in connection with the administration of the Department of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to discuss the economic policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister cannot really follow an argument I candidly confess that I will not try to make him do so.  I made it distinctly clear that the Government are not responsible directly for that, but it is a consequence of the Government's policy.  Unemployment has been increased all over the country as a direct result of the Government's policy.  So far as local bodies or private employers have been compelled to get rid of their employees, I hold that the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is, to a large extent, responsible. It was pointed out again and again to the Ministry that one of the results of their policy would be that people who are now in employment would have to be dismissed.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Party stood up on public platforms and found fault with individual farmers because owing to the action of the Government they had been compelled to get rid of employees.  To suggest that they are doing that for political reasons is a slander on the farming community of this country. The same thing is bound to happen with shopkeepers, and with everybody engaged in business.  It is happening, and it is lamentable that when a situation of that kind is in existence the <Col N="2587" /> Acting-Minister does not attempt to justify this Vote to the House, though it is evident to everybody in the country that those things are occurring. The actual amount of unemployment caused by the Government's policy is one of the serious things that the country has to consider.  The driving out of employment of people who have been in permanent employment for many years is one of the things that has to be considered by the country.  It is no good for a Minister to confess that he knows the farmers find it hard to make ends meet, and for other members of the Party, no matter how obscure, to take the line that farmers are getting rid of their workers, and are doing it for political reasons.  They are doing it because the policy of the Government is driving them to do it, and for no other reason. So far as the administration of the tariff policy of the Government is concerned, no attempt has been made by the Ministry either in this debate or at any time during the year to show that that tariff policy has been successful, but every attempt has been made to avoid any definite statement on it. That is the situation that we have now to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another matter raised again to-day which inevitably flows from the policy that has been adopted by this particular Department.  It has not been answered.  For the third time Deputy Dillon raised that definite question here to find out what steps were being taken.  The Minister has not refuted the charge that the Deputy made.  He refused to face up to that particular charge.  The Deputies who listened to him were surprised to find that no effort has been made by the Department to deal with that particular charge.  I suggest that no amount of mental agility on the part of Ministers can get away from the appalling situation which the policy of the Government has brought on the country, so far as industry and employment are concerned.  I do not intend to deal with the activities of other Departments to beat down wages &mdash;the type of wages that is being given. I have no doubt if I did anything of <Col N="2588" /> the kind we would have the Minister quickly rising on a point of order and saying that I was making an attempt to discuss that particular matter.  I have never seen a Minister quite so anxious as the present Minister has been to prevent discussion on this particular matter.  I think he raised points of order about ten times for the purpose of preventing discussion.  Of course, he is perfectly entitled to do that, but I am not aware that a ruling was given in his favour.  His action shows a distinct eagerness on the part of the Government to prevent discussion. They have done that already with the help of the Party, in the case of the motion they carried through the House to-day.  Now they are trying tactics of raising pretended points of order to prevent discussion.</P>
    <P>The situation, as I have said, is an appalling one so far as the country is concerned.  The Government, by their policy, have deliberately shut us out from the foreign market, and, by doing so, they have made the home market, so far as town industry is concerned, the industry for which this Department is supposed specially to cater, largely unproductive.  How can industry possibly flourish even if the home market is reserved to it, when that home market is made largely unproductive by other portions of the Government's policy?  No Department can save a situation of that kind, no matter how active or how glib the Minister may be.  It cannot be done. The farmers cannot buy because they cannot sell, or if they sell they sell at such an uneconomic price that they have not the money to buy.  That is the situation.  Every shopkeeper in every country town knows that.  It may not be felt to the same extent here in Dublin, but it is felt in the various country towns.  When that position is put before this House it is generally jeered at.  We get the impression, listening to debates in this House, that the farmers were never so well off, whereas everybody who has been through the country and through the country towns knows that the opposite is the case.  Not merely do we find fault with the Government because they have killed the foreign market, we <Col N="2589" /> find fault with them because they have also killed the home market and made it worthless so far as the manufacturers of this country are concerned. We can get no information from Ministers. I suggest, therefore, that an effort should be made by the Minister to introduce the Estimates which he has failed to do up to the present.</P>

      <P>I think the speech to which we have just listened is one of the vaguest that we have heard in this House for a long time, and it is surprisingly vague coming from a Deputy whom we all recognise as a trained thinker.  When Deputy O'Sullivan asserts so emphatically that the position in industry is extremely bad one would think that he would be able to quote some particular manufacturer in support of his view.  Surely our manufacturers are not so deaf and dumb that they are not capable of expressing their grievances.  Can the Deputy quote a flour miller, a clothing manufacturer, a boot manufacturer, or a furniture manufacturer who says that the purchasing power of the people is disappearing rapidly, and that he can find no market for his produce?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely mere assertion on the part of a Deputy who has a considerable reputation in every part of the House as a trained thinker is not sufficient, especially as he professed to find fault with the lack of seriousness on the part of the Government with regard to this Estimate.  I think that Deputy O'Sullivan must know very well that the position is not as he described it.  He must know that, not only would we hear about that position from individual manufacturers, but that we would be bound to hear about it from their different organisations.  The manufacturers of the country are very closely organised.  They have a Federation of Irish industries, and other organisations.  You do not hear from any of these people that the policy of the Government has been fatal to their business or industry.  As a matter of fact you hear quite the opposite. Some of us who were expecting to hear <Col N="2590" /> reports of that kind&mdash;because one would think that the reduced purchasing power of the farmers throughout the country would inevitably have that effect&mdash;were rather surprised that we never got a report of that kind from a manufacturer.  On the other hand, you do meet manufacturers who give the most glowing report of their businesses. I quoted a statement a few weeks ago, and offered to give the name privately to anyone who asked for it, of the manager of a very big clothing concern who said that their whole difficulty was that they had not capital enough to enlarge their business in accordance with the demand for their goods and, so far as the payment of their accounts was concerned, that it was very much more satisfactory than it had been for some years previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the employment question, when the former Government was in power, the only guide we had was that provided by the official statistics.  When we raised any question as to the extent of unemployment, we were referred to these statistics.  The official statistics for several weeks past show, as we know, a constant decline in the numbers of the unemployed and, in view of the circumstances of farming, the Government is to be congratulated on that fact.  The Government is also to be congratulated on another thing, namely, that they have created a tremendous industrial spirit throughout the country.  As a matter of fact, that industrial spirit looks as if it would be an embarrassment to some extent, because you have it so active in the country at present that practically every town and village is crying out for industries.  They are thinking intensely of the development of the local resources and they are demanding Government help to secure that end.  How that is going to be achieved for a small population, and how that desire for industrial development and for the universality of industry is going to be satisfied in view of the small population in this country, is something that I cannot answer.  I think the Government will have to consider that position.  The Government have said again and again that they are in favour of the decentralisation <Col N="2591" /> of industry, and the impression prevailed throughout the country that the Government are able to influence manufacturers who are about to start new industries to go to the provinces with these industries.  The feeling prevails that Dublin is getting rather more than its share of the industrial development that is taking place.  I think the Government ought to take serious notice of that feeling, and if it be the case that they are helpless in the matter they should make it clear to the country that although they favour decentralisation, they cannot influence manufacturers&mdash;that that is a thing on which they will not be able to help those in the provinces who desire to get a share of such industrial development as will take place.  It will be regrettable, in my opinion, if the Government are forced to make a statement of that kind, but I think they will have to do so.  I cannot see how they can tell a manufacturer to set up his factory in a particular town rather than in Dublin, or how they can use pressure on him.  If they cannot do that, I cannot see how they can influence industry towards decentralisation to any appreciable extent.</P>
    <P>As I say, they have created a very active industrial spirit throughout the country; so much so that the main subject of discussion as far as I can see, throughout the country, especially where there is any local organisation, is the development of local resources. To cater for that and so to encourage it that it will not be disappointed with the delay is, in itself, a big problem.  There is also the question of mass production&mdash;whether the Government are satisfied that mass production is a thing that is to be encouraged in this country and whether they can hope to place any substantial number of people in industrial employment so long as mass production prevails.  In my opinion, again relative to the small population of the country, if mass production is to prevail the number of factories which we can hope for will not be very considerable.  It looks to me as if there were to a certain extent an <Col N="2592" /> incompatibility between the two things&mdash;the desire to put everybody into employment and, at the same time, approval for mass production methods.  It seems to me that the two things can hardly go hand in hand. Mass production is, obviously, the enemy of employment.  It is too soon, perhaps, for the Government to consider how far they can counteract mass production and replace it by methods that would be less objectionable and more satisfactory, both from the point of view of actual employment and from the point of view of the nature of the work of those employed in such industries.  It is too soon yet, I think, to expect the Government to be able to deal with that matter, but the time is coming when they must deal with it because, if they are to encourage, as apparently they have already encouraged mass production&mdash;they have encouraged it in the clothing industry&mdash;it is obvious that by that encouragement they are limiting the numbers of people who can be employed in industry and limiting the chance of fulfilling their expressed wish to put everybody into employment.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I want to refer.  It is in the nature of a complaint.  I consider that, with regard to the issue of licences, there is reason for complaint.  It does look absurd that, with regard to a very important article required in the process of manufacture, the firms concerned are refused a licence to import, and referred to one particular person in the country for their supplies, on the ground that that person is a manufacturer, whereas he is only, to a very small extent, an industrialist at all&mdash; only to the extent of merely packing up the material.  They are referred to him regardless of what prices he chooses to charge for his material.  I am referring now to a very important article of manufacture.  I have already raised it in the Dáil.  It is an experience I have had myself during the past few weeks.  I think it is altogether unbusinesslike to expect manufacturers to place their orders with one particular concern and at the same time not to attempt to control the prices being <Col N="2593" /> charged by that concern.  That is one defect with regard to the licensing system. I was glad to hear the Minister say some weeks ago that he hoped to get rid of the licensing system altogether.  I think that would be a good thing, and while, on the whole, the Department have given great satisfaction with regard to the working of the licensing system, there have been some defects in it which have irritated business people very much.  At the same time, I think that the Department are to be congratulated on the amount of work they have done, and on the vigour and enthusiasm they have aroused amongst those engaged in industry in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore said that he was very pleased to see from the unemployment returns during the last few weeks that the numbers of unemployed were decreasing and that he felt that the Government was to be congratulated on that.  I wonder does the Deputy believe that?  I do not believe he does.  I am satisfied that the Deputy is more conversant with the unemployment market in this country than to believe that it follows from the fact that the numbers registered are being reduced week by week, that there is a greater number being absorbed into employment.  I am quite satisfied, and I do not think there is a Deputy in this House with any knowledge of the actual state of affairs who will not agree with me, that the reduction in numbers is due altogether to the fact that thousands of unemployed, who were induced to register last year by the promises held out by the Government, have got tired of registering, because they saw there was no possible chance of getting employment, and said to themselves, as many of them have said to me, and as, I am sure, they have said to other members of the House: &ldquo;What is the use of going through the form of signing for employment month after month (and some of them have been unemployed for a year and a half) when there is no possible chance of getting employment?&rdquo; If we ourselves were in that unfortunate position we would very soon get tired of going to the labour <Col N="2594" /> exchange every morning or, in rural areas, sending in a card every morning to the manager of the labour exchange to inform him that we were still on the unemployed list.  The fact is that there is more actual unemployment to-day than ever there was before.  The fact is that there are fewer men employed on the farms or on the land at this time of the year than in any year in living history, because farmers who formerly employed men at this time of the year are unable to employ them now, as they are unable to pay them.  I go further and say&mdash;and I could give several cases in my own constituency&mdash;that many farmers who, a couple of years ago, were in a position to employ men, are themselves to-day looking for work on the roads or anywhere they can get it.  Deputies on all sides of the House know that is quite true.  There is no use in trying to fool ourselves with the figures published in the newspapers every week and the attempts to convey, both in this House and in certain sections of the Press to the country, that because there is a fall of 10,000 in the figures that means that 10,000 people have been absorbed into employment.  Of course, it means no such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on that I want to say that I was disappointed that the Minister in his opening speech did not give us some information about the new schemes put into operation by his Department during the past 12 months. I refer to schemes for the placing of unemployed workers.  The House will remember that last year the Minister for Industry and Commerce scrapped the system which was in operation when he came into office, and substituted another scheme putting the responsibility for placing men on the managers of the local employment exchanges.  That scheme created such a row in the country and in this House among members of his Party that he had to substitute another scheme.  I think I can venture to say that the scheme that the managers of the exchanges are trying to operate is not any improvement on the scheme which has been replaced.  We know quite well what is happening.  If a county surveyor requires, say, 30 men for a <Col N="2595" /> particular work, he sends to the branch manager of the labour exchange, and the manager selects the 30 men.  They may be the most unsuitable men that can be picked because the manager does not know the particular type of work for which they are required.  In some cases he does not know exactly where the men are to be placed.  The county surveyor has to take these men. I submit that is unfair, and I think that under that scheme, we are not going to get the best possible return for the money expended.  As far as my experience goes, I do not think county surveyors ever did employ men on political grounds.  They were able to use their own discretion, and give employment to men who would be considered most in need of work, having regard to their suitability for the particular class of work that was to be performed.  I, therefore, suggest that the present scheme is unsuitable from every point of view.  I do not think it should be left to the managers of the exchanges to select these men.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I should like to refer to, and that is an order recently issued by the Department to labour exchanges that any man in receipt of a pension of 15/- or upwards is not to get employment so long as there is another man on the unemployment register.  I quite agree that a man with a pension even of 15/- is better off than an unfortunate man who has nothing, but I submit that this order, coming from a Department, the head of which told us that they had a plan to solve unemployment, and that it would be solved within six months, is an admission of their inability to deal with the problem in any effective way.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is very fond of looking for quotations.  He knows well that I can get the quotation quite easily.  If the Minister were here, and I hope he will be here very soon, I do not think he would deny it.  It is not the first time that I have made that statement in this House and in the presence of the Minister, and it has not been questioned before.  This is a serious matter.  We had a lot of talk in this House within the last few weeks about the standard of living that was being set up by the Fianna Fáil Government.  There was a great deal of talk about 21/- and 24/- per week. This is a new standard&mdash;15/- per week &mdash;a standard by which thousands of British ex-service men and thousands of others, who have pensions, say, of 15/- per week, are not to get any employment so long as there are other men unemployed who have not a pension. That means that it is likely they will never get any employment so far as this Government is concerned.  I can give the names and addresses of three such men in the town of Nenagh. One man there is in receipt of a pension of 16/- per week and has a wife and eight children and they are compelled by virtue of the order issued by the Department, to try to exist upon 16/- per week.  I think that is grossly unfair.</P>

      <P>He has.  The county surveyor has a certain discretion in the matter.  If he is satisfied that the persons are not, in fact, in the order of preference; if, in his opinion, the question of means is different from that laid down by the local employment branch office, that is, if he is satisfied that the man is really more in need than appears to be, he can give consideration to that fact.  Of course, he has full discretion with regard to the actual selection of men on main road work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is misinformed.  I realise that it would be unreasonable to expect the Acting-Minister to be conversant with all the details of such a big Department as this.  I think if the Minister will look into it again he will see that, so far as this question of men with pensions is concerned, the county surveyor, or the branch manager, has no discretion whatever.  It is an absolutely hard and fast rule laid down by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have it cleared up because if that is not so, then the order issued by the Department is being interpreted wrongly.  I should like to get it cleared up.  On the interpretation put upon that order, no British ex-serviceman or any other pensioner with a pension of 15/- per week or over&mdash;as far as I remember I think the figure is 15/- can get any employment or can be placed on any job, whilst there are others without a job.  That means that they are compelled or are driven into the position that they will be unemployed for the remainder of their lives, as far as we can see.  On the other point the Minister said that the county surveyor has a discretion regarding the placing of men on grant work on main roads. I must confess that is something new to me.  That must be a variation of the order made very recently because as far as I know he has not any such discretion.  He has got to accept men <Col N="2598" /> sent to him by the manager of the exchange.  That is what is happening down the country.  What the Department may be thinking about, we do not know.  As a matter of fact the first intimation that this House or the country got that there was any variation whatever in the scheme laid down by the Minister was when Deputy Flinn announced the other day that as far as the minor relief schemes were concerned, for which his Department was responsible, that particular rule was not being enforced rigidly.  The reason he gave was that it was more difficult to secure registration in certain counties than others.  He quoted of all counties, County Mayo.  We all know what happened in County Mayo last year when it was announced by the Government that the grants would be allocated on the basis of the number registered as unemployed.  We know the famous case of the town of Ballina, where nearly 7,000 men were given as registered.  I am quite sure that if I were in the position of the Parliamentary Secretary and if I were trying to make the case of the difficulty of registration I would not select County Mayo as an example in view of what happened last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do suggest that the Department cannot be congratulated on its administration for the past year, or on the way in which it had attempted to deal with the unemployment problem.  I think the Department deserves the censure of this House, not only for not getting more workers absorbed in employment, but for making the lot of those unemployed much more difficult than it was.  We had a scheme providing that 25 per cent. of the men employed in any particular work were to be single men&mdash;one in every four.  Is the Minister satisfied that that is working out well?  I doubt it very much.  Is the Minister satisfied that the reduction in the number of unemployed registered represents the true state of affairs?  I do not believe the Minister or his Department is satisfied of any such thing.  I am not blaming the Minister or his Department for that, because, at no time did I, personally, believe that the figures supplied by the Department of <Col N="2599" /> Industry and Commerce, either under the present Government or under the late Government, reflected the actual position as far as unemployment is concerned.  I do not think that we should be told, through the columns of the Press or in the House, that because there has been a drop of 30,000 in the number registered that that means that 30,000 have been absorbed in employment.  It does not mean any such thing.  As I say, I realise that we cannot expect the Acting-Minister to be able to deal with all the details and the points raised from this and other sides of the House, but I think that the Minister ought to get from the responsible officials in the Department what is the actual position regarding the working of the new scheme and regarding the placing of men in employment.  I think the Minister ought to give the House an explanation of the order sent down in regard to the placing of men on work. I think it is a scandalous order that should be either withdrawn or modified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Morrissey has stated, the House is at a certain disadvantage in discussing this Estimate owing to the absence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Personally, I am sorry for the circumstances that have been responsible for his absence.  I think it is the wish of all Deputies that the Minister should soon be back again in his place.  There are several matters in connection with the Vote to which I would like to draw the attention of the Acting-Minister. Deputy Moore stated in the course of his speech that the Government had nothing whatever to do in regard to the placing of new industries in this country.  I wish that were the case, because it, unfortunately, has been our experience in Dundalk that the Minister has, on many occasions, sent people who were prepared to start industries in Dundalk, Drogheda, or other parts of the country, to places in the Midlands and places down South.  I, as representing that constituency, would like to have from the Minister a statement as to whether <Col N="2600" /> that is the considered policy of the Department in future.</P>
      <P>I might remind the Minister and the House, that although there may be very acute differences of opinion existing amongst people in that county, on matters affecting the welfare of the people in the county in general, politics are left out of the question. We all work together for the prosperity of all concerned and, incidentally for the prosperity of the State. With a view to helping the Minister in his policy of the creation of new industries, there was formed in Dundalk a committee composed of business men of all shades of opinion, men who had experience in various branches of business.  By an intensive campaign of advertising, which necessitated very considerable expense, they were able to draw the attention of many people in other countries&mdash; manufacturers engaged in the manufacture of certain classes of goods which owing to the tariff policy of the Government could not be imported into this country&mdash;to the advantages which Dundalk possessed as a manufacturing centre.  These manufacturers were prepared to come here and manufacture.  I can produce, if necessary, a whole sheaf of correspondence dealing with the matter. I content myself by stating that the people down there feel very sore, whether it is due to the action of the Minister or not, that certain of these factories have not been set up there, although the people prepared to set up these factories were very favourably impressed with the conditions prevailing within the county which I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Minister when replying will intimate to the House what policy his Department intends to follow in the future with regard to the setting up of these particular factories.  Members of that committee have been very busy; as I say they have hunted the hare, they have not caught the hare, and they think that it was very unfair to hand her over now to other people.  If people down in other parts of this country want these factories let them take the same steps to secure them as we have taken <Col N="2601" /> in Dundalk, Drogheda and in other parts of Louth.</P>
    <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister if he is not prepared to issue a permit to these people to start any little factories in Dundalk, Drogheda, or any other parts of Louth that he would, perhaps, be prepared to place facilities at their disposal to set up factories.  I refer now to places in mid-Louth, to the village of Castlebellingham which formerly was a very prosperous little village. It was very prosperous a few years ago, but in consequence of the closing down of the little brewery there it is suffering to-day, and as a result of that closing down there are many people there who find themselves without employment at the moment.  The Minister can see that these industries cannot be set up unless the people secure a permit.  This slowness and delay in the issuing of these permits by his Department have more or less given grave dissatisfaction to the members of that industrial committee which was set up some time ago and is functioning at the moment in Dundalk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While on this question of licensing I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that there are very many fittings which are necessary for the carrying out of work of public importance such as sewerage and waterwork schemes, and these fittings cannot be obtained in this country for the reason that they are not manufactured here.  These fittings can be obtained in Great Britain.  I understand that very many applications were made to the Department of Industry and Commerce for permits in order that these fittings might be imported free of duty.  The Minister can see the force of these applications for the reason that these works are mostly works of public utility such as sewerage and water schemes and work for the carrying through of which the Government make grants.  The cost of the schemes would be considerably reduced by the issuing of permits for <Col N="2602" /> the free import of these commodities. I ask the Minister to bear that in mind because the delay in the issue of permits is holding up work.  I am aware that in many cases the Department has absolutely refused to issue permits.  Instead of issuing permits it has replied that suitable substitutes for these fittings can be procured at home, but they have not specified where they can be procured.  I would urge the Minister to give that matter his consideration.</P>
    <P>There is another matter affecting the question of unemployment benefit and I would like to refer to it.  On the 4th of last May I put down a question to the Minister in regard to the payment of unemployment benefit to the workers on the Great Northern Railway. These workers as a result of the strike that took place during the month of April last were debarred from receiving unemployment benefit on the plea that their unemployment was directly caused by a strike.  These cases were referred to the umpire and he gave his decision, I think, on 24th April refusing to grant unemployment benefits to these men.  The acting Minister is aware that that decision affects 500 or 600 men in the various trades in the railway works, engineering, boiler-making and other allied trades.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious to draw attention to the law, as it stands, so that the Minister would put the matter before the Executive Council in order that the necessary legislation might be introduced later.  However, as An Leas-Cheann Comhairle says I can raise the matter on Vote 60, I will bow to his ruling now.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of staff in the various labour exchanges, I find that there has been a very perceptible increase in the number of clerks employed throughout the various exchanges in the Saorstát.  I do not complain of or disagree with that. Perhaps the explanation is that the work has greatly increased there and that this increase in the staff is necessary.  What I would like to be assured of is this: that the procedure with regard to the recruitment of such clerks or the filling of such positions in the labour exchanges should be carried out in a proper manner.  My information with regard to the labour exchange in Dundalk is that very many people have secured jobs there as clerks who never registered at all. Their names were really sent down from the Department in Dublin here. I think that is most extraordinary in view of the fact that at the particular time there were registered at the local labour exchanges from ten to 20 local people who, by virtue of their previous experience in such work, should, in the ordinary circumstances, be entitled to receive some little recognition, and whose applications should receive some little consideration on the part of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel very strongly upon this.  I am one of those who do not like to indulge in pin-pricks, or to criticise the Government for the sake of criticising them. Members of the Executive will see, as <Col N="2604" /> far as I am personally concerned, that I have not gone out of my way to criticise them merely for the sake of criticising them.  I never will be a party to that.  I have not done so in the past, and will not do so in the future.  For my part I would like every man to get a job upon his merits, independent of politics.  But I feel very strongly that people can get jobs of a temporary character, which makes it worse when their names have not been upon the register for unemployment at all.  I hope the Minister will see to it that, so far as filling vacancies in the future is concerned, people who are actually registered will receive some little consideration.  It is well known that people get employment through the labour exchange in Dundalk who are not residents in the Free State at all, but are from Northern Ireland.  I have no objection to people from Northern Ireland getting work in the Free State.  I know what nationalists in the Free State suffered in 1916 and afterwards for their political opinions.  I would be the very last to raise any objection to these men.  But in view of what took place I think I am right in bringing this matter to the notice of the Minister with a view to preventing such recurrences again in the labour exchange in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>I referred to another matter incidentally on the Local Government Board to which I want to call attention now, and that is the policy of the Department of Industry and Commerce imposing indiscriminate tariffs on commodities used in the building of houses. The Minister, no doubt, is anxious to set up as many industries in the Free State as he possibly can with a view to increasing employment.  With that end in view there is at the moment before the House a Cement Bill.  If the Minister is so anxious to manufacture cement in this country, I think he should be equally anxious to manufacture bricks at an economic price, and one that will compare with the price paid for such articles in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain.  It is a well-known fact that bricks can be imported into the Free State, as I said on the Local Government Estimate, at <Col N="2605" /> anything from £1 to 30/- per ton less than they can be delivered in Dundalk, from any brick works manufacturing at the moment in the Free State.  As I said on that occasion it is loading the dice unfairly against the bricklayers and other trades engaged in building. I would point out now, as I did before, that these trades have a record behind them, and that Ministers should be slow in loading the dice against them.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister that in order to give the Dundalk Urban Council an opportunity of building houses with brick at a price that could more or less compete with houses built either of concrete blocks or in situ, he should allow a certain quantity of bricks to be imported from Northern Ireland in order to enable public bodies in places like Dundalk and Monaghan that are in close proximity to the Border to erect houses of brick.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that many people prefer a house built of brick to one of concrete.  There is the danger, also, as I said, of those trades becoming a thing of the past.  In view of the fact that bricks cannot be purchased in the Free State at a price that will compare with bricks made in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, the Minister should make some arrangement whereby these bricks can be imported, and should allow public bodies to import them if they desire to erect houses of brick in the future.</P>
    <P>As regards the policy of the Department on the question of strikes, I do not know whether I would be in order in referring to that matter or not.  But seeing that the Department of Industry and Commerce is looming very largely before the public in regard to strikes I, as one with some little experience of trade union matters, am apprehensive, at least at the moment, as to whether it is quite good policy on the part of the Department to interfere in disputes that occur between employers and employees.  I am referring to this matter by way of helping the Department, not by way of criticism. It is a very important matter and one that affects the future of this country whether from the industrial or economic point of view, and it affects <Col N="2606" /> the Minister's Department from the point of view of the setting up of industries. What I am coming at is this: Rightly or wrongly, I suspect we would not have so many of these strikes at all if those responsible for them did not feel convinced of the easy approach to the Minister, to get him to interfere in these matters and to settle them.  I am one of those who can afford to get up and discuss this question with the leaders of the Labour movement.  I am one myself.  I think it is about time that the Minister should come out boldly and let the people in this State, and all concerned, know that no section of workers in this country can hold up the trade or business of the country at will.  I am one of those who are out for the rights of trade unions and workers as well as any man, but I am against any section of workers flouting the authority of the trade unions and taking part in what I may call unofficial strikes.</P>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, there is a suspicion that these sectional strikes would not take place if these people were not assured of what I might call sympathy, tacit or otherwise, on the part of the Minister.  It is a very important matter for the Minister and for the country and I think it would be up to the Minister, and, in fact, to the President himself, to take such steps as will prevent the trade and commerce of this country being held up by any section of workers who, by reason of having a grievance, real or imaginary at times, embark on an unofficial strike.  I should also like the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not his function, but I might add that there are many matters which, while they might not be quite relevant, are almost relevant. It is, however, a matter of very grave importance to the country and it may be that the Minister may see the wisdom of my remarks, so far as the future is concerned.  With regard to this question of unemployment, I may say that there, again, I do not propose to criticise the Government in regard to whether or not there is an increase in unemployment for the simple reason that I have always taken the view, and take the view still, that it is not the absolute duty of a Government to solve unemployment, and I do not propose to criticise the Government, merely for the sake of criticising, in regard to whether or not there are more unemployed to-day than there were, say, 12 months or two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that all Governments would be anxious to solve this problem but it is a problem which is very difficult of solution and one about the solution of which there are great differences of opinion.  I think that, at the moment, there does exist very serious unemployment but it is no more serious here than in any other country and the only criticism I make of the Government's policy is that I think they are going rather fast in the matter of tariffs. The imposition of many of the tariffs has led to unemployment in many directions and it would be a wise policy on the part of the Government to hasten slowly on this question of tariffs.  There is no doubt that it can be argued, as it has been argued by Deputy Moore, that, as a result of the policy of the Department of Industry and Commerce, certain industries have been set up and certain people engaged in the manufacturing line have experienced a kind of boom in trade during the past 12 months.  It is also a well-known <Col N="2608" /> fact, however, that, side by side with an increase of employment in certain directions, there is an increase in unemployment in other directions and that applies, in particular, to those engaged in the agricultural industry. You cannot legislate exclusively for city and urban areas and leave out of reckoning altogether the position of those who live in the rural parts of this State.  Both interests are interdependent and I would urge the Minister for Industry and Commerce to be exceedingly careful in this matter of tariffs lest by his policy he may be reducing the capacity of that very large section of our people engaged in agriculture to purchase the commodities that will be manufactured in the new factories set up in many counties of the Free State.  I hope that unemployment will decrease but it will only decrease if everyone co-operates and gives a helping hand.  I hope and trust that that co-operation will be forthcoming because&mdash;there can be no two opinions about it&mdash;this is a matter which must arrest the attention and must command the support and co-operation of everyone who is interested in the material welfare of the people of this or any other country.</P>

      <P>I regret very much that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not here and we all regret the cause of his absence.  Deputy Morrissey referred to the inconvenience and, I might say, the difficulties that county surveyors had in providing labour on certain works and I think the Minister assured him that the county surveyors had certain rights in that matter.  I hope that is true because I also was under the impression, as, apparently, Deputy Morrissey was, that county surveyors had to take whatever labour was offered to them by the labour exchange.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the assurance of the Minister, because some of us were under the impression, and were definitely told when we made applications for work for certain unemployed men that the county surveyors had no power whatever in the matter.  I think every Deputy must have had that experience to some extent.  I, personally, had, and I am glad of the assurance of the Minister that they have some option in the employment of labour.  Deputy Moore asked somebody to point out any manufacturer who had had difficulty in finding a market for his produce. When the Minister for Industry and Commerce last year introduced the Cereals Bill, certain of us criticised it very strongly and we pointed out many of its possible effects.  We pointed out the effects it might possibly have on existing industries in relation to the expansion of their business and the finding of markets for that expansion.  The flour industry has been referred to.  The particular constituency I represent is vitally interested in the flour industry and if the Cereals Bill directly affected any industry it affected the flour industry, and one of the direct results of that Bill and the other restrictions the Minister has imposed on this industry has been that the price of flour has advanced considerably.  It has, perhaps, advanced more than it ought to have advanced if one takes into consideration the current market price in England.  The principal cause of that advance, which has affected the poor people especially, is that the flour millers find it extremely difficult to dispose of the offals, and when I say &ldquo;offals&rdquo; I think Deputies will understand what I mean.  I refer to the bran, pollard and other offals of which they have to dispose.  When discussing the Cereals Bill we pointed out that in insisting on the mixture the Ministry was putting a serious hardship on <Col N="2610" /> feeders of live stock.  Unfortunately, circumstances have since arisen which have made it rather difficult for feeders to use any particular food for cattle, or which have made it uneconomic to feed live stock with what they were fed previously.  Representations have been made to Deputies that the mixture supplied is not a suitable feed for certain animals.</P>
      <P>Another difficulty millers have is in disposing of offals.  Farmers are not buying bran, pollard and other offals to the same extent as hitherto.  With the extension of the milling industry there has been a rapid increase in the production of bran and pollard.  In recent months I believe the flour millers have had to export these products to outside markets, which were already saturated, and to dispose of them at scrap prices.  Because of that it was necessary to put the loss sustained on the sale of offals on to the flour that the people are using.  That is one direct result of the policy of the Ministry.</P>
      <P>I referred previously to another matter that vitally concerns the City of Limerick, and that is the discrimination that is made against that city in the charges for electricity, as compared with other parts of the State.  In Limerick the citizens are subjected to a charge which is 25 per cent. greater than that charged for electricity in Dublin and 12½ per cent. greater than the price in Cork.  In fact Limerick is put on a par, for electricity charges, with small villages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I am precluded from referring to it but if the Minister could use his good offices in that respect, on behalf of the citizens of Limerick, we would be glad.  In the course of the debate reference was made to a difficulty about employing people who had small pensions.  I believe I am right in saying that at the labour exchanges the services of certain people have been dispensed with, because they had small Army pensions.  I do not think that is a highly defensive procedure.  It was mentioned in the debate previously. If there is one part of this State that has been adversely affected by the policy of the present Ministry, and by tariffs, and other restrictions, it is the City of Limerick.  When speaking on the various Votes, Estimates and tariffs, I pointed out what would happen to Limerick.  Other Deputies pointed out, when the package tax and other taxes were imposed that they would necessitate centralisation of any new industries which would be established in Dublin, and that in consequence cities like Limerick, Galway, Cork, Sligo and other places would be affected.  They have been affected by these tariffs.  Limerick has been affected more than any other part of the State by the increasing depression. Unfortunately there is a great deal of unemployment there.  It must be within the knowledge of the Minister that during the last few years the railway works have been closed in Limerick. I suppose that was inevitable.  The railways have suffered owing to the depression.  A large number of people were put out of employment when the railway works closed, while dockers have been unemployed as a direct consequence of the policy of this Government. One would have expected that any attempt made to provide employment for these people would have had the sympathy and the encouragement of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Limerick, we have, unfortunately, very few large employers of labour. We have a few noble-minded citizens <Col N="2612" /> who are trying to expand their business, and who at present employ a considerable number of people.  One firm of contractors there is competing very successfully with big outside contractors and has obtained work far away from Limerick.  This firm proposed to expand its business and to embark on new work which would provide employment for a great number of people.  An application was made to the Department of Industry and Commerce for permission to import certain machinery under licence.  This machinery included a concrete machine, a lining machine for the making of roof tiles, and a woodwork machine.  So far permission has not been given to import these articles under licence.  I am informed that the firm asked the Department, in case the necessary licence would not be given, to supply the names of firms who could supply the machinery, but, so far, that information has not been given.</P>
    <P>This particular firm had a big contract in the County Clare, as they have various contracts in other parts of this State.  If it had not been for the good offices of another contractor, who supplied them with the necessary machinery to keep going on that contract, that work would have had to be closed down eight or ten days ago.  Certain works which they have in contemplation cannot go on unless they get the necessary permission from the Minister to import this machinery.  I am reliably informed that if the order allowing them to import this machinery is not issued, 200 or, possibly, 300 men will be disemployed in the course of the next few weeks.  I do not want to give the name of this firm because both the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the President himself are aware of the circumstances.  The matter has been going on for some months, and I would have refrained from mentioning it in the Dáil if there was any other course open to me.  It does seem to us in Limerick unfortunate that, while we are suffering as the result of depression, tariffs and other causes, there should be an addition to our unemployed on the railways, at the <Col N="2613" /> docks, and elsewhere, when we have the opportunity not only of keeping a certain number of men in employment but of increasing that number permanently.  It is unfortunate that that should arise because a certain firm needs machinery to carry on their work and will not get the necessary licence to import it.</P>
    <P>We have now had 12 or 15 months' experience of the tariff policy of the Ministry.  I assume that the Department of Industry and Commerce is, in great measure, responsible for that policy.  Whatever new industries have been established as a result of these tariffs have gone, practically exclusively, to Dublin.  Outside Dublin, practically every city has suffered as a direct consequence of this policy.  We were promised that this policy would lead to a great increase in employment everywhere.  In the part of the country which I represent, we have found that that policy has lamentably failed.  We may be particularly unfortunate in Limerick, but I venture to say that other Deputies will assert that they are suffering equally.  Our agriculture has suffered, and it is difficult to imagine how cases such as I have mentioned should arise at this particular time.  I hope that the Minister will reconsider the matter I have referred to, and that the President, to whose knowledge it was brought, will use his influence so as to enable this firm to carry on and extend its work, thus giving useful and continuous employment to a great number of people in the city I represent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Industry and Commerce speaks with one voice and the Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce speaks with another voice, it is very difficult to understand what is the real policy of the Department.  We were told to-day that there were no definite instructions, and never had been any definite instructions, that workmen employed on Government schemes should be recruited through the labour exchanges&mdash;that there was always a certain choice left.  That is what the Minister for Education, acting for the <Col N="2614" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce, told this House within the last few minutes.  Yet, when I turn to the Debates of November 3rd, 1932, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was himself laying down the policy on which his Department was going to work, I find he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We insist in every case in which work has been given&mdash;that is, work provided out of State funds&mdash;that the employees be selected from the labour exchanges and that the manager of the labour exchange is to select the people who are to do that work.  The manager does select these people.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the voice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 3rd November, 1932.  Now we are informed that there never were any such instructions given by the Minister, that that was never his policy.  When we hear, as I have said, the Minister for Industry and Commerce speaking with one voice and telling us what his intention is as regards the policy of his Department, and when we hear the Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce say that such a policy has never been carried out by the Department, we begin to wonder where we are.  What is the use of telling this House that a certain policy is to be adopted when it is not the intention to adopt that policy and when that policy has not, in fact, been carried out, as we have now been told...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of unemployment, which has been rightly debated at much length, I do not see how Deputy Moore could have drawn the conclusions which he drew from the official figures, that unemployment is decreasing in the State.  These figures, as Deputy Morrissey has pointed out, are, especially under present conditions, very illusory and misleading.  I should like to ask Deputy Moore, if he desires to think about this matter at all, how he would reconcile his conclusions with the appalling increase in home assistance. The last date for which we have any official figures&mdash;about these official figures there can be no mistake&mdash;is the last Saturday in May.  We find that there are well over 30,000 more people on home assistance than there were the year before.  If the numbers of unemployed <Col N="2615" /> are dropping, in fact, as well as on paper, I would like to know why the number of persons living on home assistance is going up by leaps and bounds.  We have only the figures, so far as they relate up to last May, but there is not a Deputy who knows anything about conditions in the country who is not aware that more and more people in the country districts are being driven to home assistance every day.</P>
    <P>Closely allied to this is the question of unemployment.  The question of unemployment should, to a very considerable extent, dictate the policy which the Department of Industry and Commerce takes up.  If you have unemployment upon the one hand and, if you know, also, there are a number of people driven on the rates to obtain subsistence and to keep away from starvation, and if those numbers are steadily increasing, and have gone up by 30,000&mdash;by what would be the whole population of what we would almost call a city in this State&mdash;then everything that can be done by the Department of Industry and Commerce to minimise that condition of affairs should be done.  If there is one way better than any other to drive persons, who are almost on the brink of destitution, right over the brink, and into a condition of destitution, it is to make the necessities of life dearer. People may be just able to pull along if the necessities of life are cheap, but they must get on the rates if the necessities of life are being kept up by a deliberate Government policy.</P>
    <P>That is precisely the course which the Department of Industry and Commerce is adopting at the present moment.  If you want to keep people off home assistance, then what you should do is rather to subsidise the necessities of life so that the people can get them as cheaply as possible rather than tax the necessities of life, making them dear for these unfortunate persons.  If there is one necessity of life greater than another in this State it is flour.  At this period of the year, especially, flour is almost the <Col N="2616" /> main staff of life of the working population.  The policy should be to keep down the price of flour and to make it as cheap as possible to the consumer, so that in this desperate condition of affairs, which the Government have brought about by the mismanagement of the affairs of State, the poorer classes of the community should be made to suffer as little as possible.  What do we find?  Instead of endeavouring to make flour as cheap as possible, they are making flour, relatively to what it ought to be, appallingly dear.</P>
    <P>I have it upon impeccable authority that the same class of flour that costs 18/- in Northern Ireland costs 27/- in this State, and the higher class of flour that costs 22/- in Northern Ireland costs 32/- here.  These figures vary from day to day.  In other words, for your bag of flour&mdash;and I do not care so much about the price of bread, because, so far as my constituency is concerned, and so far as all the western constituencies, and, perhaps, other constituencies, are concerned, it is not the price of bread that matters so much as the price of flour&mdash;you pay practically twice as much as is paid in the North of Ireland. The bulk of the people here bake their own bread, and that is why the price of flour matters so much to them.  If in this State you have people who are selling two head of cattle for the price of one, and those same persons are driven to pay the price of three bags of flour in order to get two, you are subjecting them to gross injustice and you are bringing about a condition of affairs which is going to add enormously to the existing destitution. You are going to make people who are suffering from your economic war not merely suffer, but suffer most unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>As regards unemployment in country districts, we have it that it is not now, in certain counties, the persons who are most in need are receiving benefit.  We are told now that the principle that they are to be recruited through the employment exchanges is, in some counties, anyhow, a dead letter.  We find, in consequence, that dictation comes from Fianna Fáil clubs as to the persons who shall get employment.  We <Col N="2617" /> know that is going on all round the place.  We know there is a regular campaign inaugurated to prevent anybody who is not a Fianna Fáil supporter from getting work.  Unless the Government takes a very clear and strong stand against that, unless the Department for Industry and Commerce takes a strong and determined attitude against that, it may at the moment be doing itself some little good, but it will do itself and the Government precious little good in the long run.  It certainly will do an infinity of harm to the State.  If you are going to demoralise the people by giving work, not to persons who need it, but to persons who have got political credit for something done, you are setting up a desperately bad principle, a principle that will not even pay you.</P>

      <P>Deputy Coburn pointed out that clerks have been sent to labour exchanges, whose names were first sent to Dublin.  I know there have been changes in the personnel of the labour exchanges and I have a shrewd suspicion why these changes were made.  I have a shrewd idea what is the particular political complexion of the gentlemen who were sent down.  No matter who they may be, no matter whom we nominate to be clerks in labour exchanges, I would much rather trust them to see that work was being given out fairly than trust those other gentlemen who dictate the persons who shall receive work.  I know the same efforts are being made in the case of the Land Commission.  I believe all over the country the Irish Land Commission are trying to stand out and see that the work is fairly given.  It will be impossible for the Land Commission, or anybody else who is giving employment on relief work, to stand out if the Government gives way in any one particular direction.  If you want clean administration in this country, if you want to keep the country clean, you must be firm in that matter, and you are not firm.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2618" /> I am glad that here we have an opportunity of getting in this House a little bit of information&mdash;perhaps I should call it a big bit of information &mdash;which this House and the whole country have been thirsting for for a very long time.  There is an opportunity now given to the Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce of satisfying a bit of curiosity, and a very legitimate curiosity, which has been in the minds of the people of this State for a very long time.  He is now in the position to-day of having an opportunity to tell us where the 300 factories have been set up.  He is in a position to-day to tell us there are so many in this county, so many in that county and so many in the other county, and that they are giving so much employment.  He has a grand opportunity&mdash;a gorgeous opportunity. All that information which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has so carefully kept locked up within his own bosom, so terribly afraid that anybody except himself should be aware of the location of these mysterious hidden factories, can now be given to the public, if the Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce has got it.  I am afraid he has not.  I am afraid that all the search that the Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce has been able to make has not been a search which would enable him to find the non-existent. Therefore, though I request him to give us all the information at his disposal upon this important question, I do not flatter myself that the Minister will give this House the slightest information about it.</P>

      <P>Industry and commerce have one particular object, and that is to bring technical effort and capital together, to endeavour to stimulate industry, thereby increasing the wealth of the nation, and to solve the unemployment question if possible.  There is not any doubt whatever that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, no matter what punch of fight he puts into his job, no matter how hard he works, if the Department of Agriculture is not able to walk in step, is only wasting his time.  It is on the basis of a paying agricultural <Col N="2619" /> industry that this country can rise to support its own needs.  It is on the basis of the agricultural community being able to have an open, clear and profitable market that an attempt can be made with any sort of chance of success to establish industries in country towns.  Everybody is aware that in regard to the position of the country towns, as far as industry is concerned, as far as any chance of entering into commerce outside the ordinary local purchasing that goes on is concerned, there is no chance whatever of establishing industry or commerce there under the present conditions that exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President went down to Kilkenny quite recently.  He must have got some information there about the condition of unemployment, because he stated that unless the opportunity was taken now by people with capital, whether it be small or whether it be large, in the near future there would be regrets for not having taken that opportunity.  Protection is offered to the people of this country who start new industries, protection which, I submit, will be to the benefit of the few as against the many.  No matter what protection has been employed, no matter what action has been taken to prevent outside products coming in here which we can make ourselves, apparently the protection has not been high enough, strong enough or great enough up to the present to achieve the results that were in view.  Nobody is anxious to see this country with large chimney stacks emitting smoke all over the place.  That was never the idea in connection with the development of industry in this country.  As I have stated, unless those two Departments walk in step, inch by inch and yard by yard, and have an equal balance of development, there is not the slightest chance of bringing about a development in industry and commerce which will solve or attempt to solve unemployment in this country. Go around to any of the country towns at the present moment, and what do you see?  Nothing but fellows standing at the corners with their <Col N="2620" /> hands in their pockets.  If you interview them you will find that they are living under most appalling conditions. It is quite probable that the vast majority of them have no hope whatever of getting employment, and are completely demoralised.  A C 3 nation will be the result.  County homes were never so full, and home assistance was never so much called for or drawn upon.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made about the present conditions under which employment is given under Government grants for minor relief schemes. Complaints are coming in in ever increasing quantities every day.  Why? When this matter of relief schemes was being discussed, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance was here, I deliberately refrained from making any acrimonious remarks.  It is obvious, however, that there is Fianna Fáil occupation of the country at the present moment; that the clubs which are started are not playing the game between those who are in distress as against their immediate followers.  I have received letters stating beyond yea or nay&mdash;they can be published if necessary&mdash;that there is no hiding the fact that very unfair discrimination is being made as regards the giving of employment under grants for minor relief schemes.  The young fellows are told: &ldquo;If you do not go on in and join the Fianna Fáil club you have no chance whatever of getting work under this scheme.&rdquo;  What is the use of the Minister for Industry and Commerce issuing instructions, or pretending that he can run in a fair way the distribution of relief schemes and give fair and honest employment in the country districts if this kind of thing is allowed to run rampant?  I suggest that impartial inspectors should be sent down to the country districts; that they should be allowed to see the lists showing the same old group taken on again and again.  The same names will appear on the list, and the same fellows will be victimised unless they are &ldquo;tough guys,&rdquo; big enough and strong enough to fight their way in, and hammer out any opposition that <Col N="2621" /> stands in their way.  I have advised them on several occasions &ldquo;to hell with politics.&rdquo;  Excuse me, sir, I am sorry.  I have advised them not to allow politics to stand in their way, and if necessary to return force for force.  That is the position to which the country is rapidly coming. Ex-service men, and those who were in the British Army during the great war, no matter under what circumstances they joined it, are at the present moment being victimised in the County Kildare.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to call attention to the way this unemployment relief is being administered.  There are R.I.C. pensioners who, because they throw their weight into the Fianna Fáil clubs, are now becoming leaders, and it is they decide who should be employed and who should not be employed.  It is only a week or so ago since Deputy Norton referred to that in the debate on minor relief schemes.  It is not in one part of South Kildare that that is going on, but in many parts of the county.  The hardship that is being inflicted on decent people as a result of it is appalling, and is grossly unfair. If that is the way that Fianna Fáil are going to recruit new voters and to increase the membership of their clubs, by victimisation of that sort, then I can tell them it will recoil on their own heads later.  It will be impossible, sooner or later, to hold some of those <Col N="2622" /> fellows to whom they are pandering now.  It is quite wrong to be making this a purely political business.  Some of us want to play the game and to see this employment distributed fairly, without politics being brought into it. The day will come when some of those fellows will get out of hand, and then we shall see what will happen.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of thing that happened in parts of South Kildare last year.  Unless the Minister for Agriculture and his Department carry on their work by ordinary legitimate trading means, instead of by a system of subsidies and bounties, then industry and commerce will not only be not able to mark time, but they will drift backwards.  There will be no chance whatever of solving the unemployment problem, or of reducing the number by a substantial figure.  The present policy of the Government is doing infinite harm to people who have regular and constant employment. Many of them, unfortunately, are losing that employment, and it is feared, because of the Government's policy, they will never be able to get regular employment again.  I do not want to detain the House on this Estimate.  I have no desire to sit here until 12 o'clock to-morrow night or until 6 o'clock to-morrow morning.  I just wish to enter my protest against the unfair methods that are being used in connection with the relief of unemployment.  In my opinion, it will be impossible ever to solve the unemployment problem in view of the manner in which the Government is pursuing its agricultural policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in introducing this Estimate took considerable pride in the fact that the staff in the Department of Industry and Commerce had been considerably increased, and instanced the amount of work that had to be done in connection with licences and permits.  In my opinion, if the Government would really take a long-sighted view they would find that was a distinct disadvantage, not only to the Government but to the country as a whole.  The Government are very anxious to promote industry, and I will give them credit for that.  I <Col N="2623" /> believe they are sincerely and wholeheartedly endeavouring to promote industry here, but I am afraid there are certain fundamental errors in their industrial policy which will, in the long run, defeat the objects they have in view.  I am afraid they are confusing the promotion of industry with the relief of unemployment.  Now the unemployed in this country are the outward and the visible sign of the state of agriculture and industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want on this Vote to refer to the position of agriculture or to the state of affairs which exists in that industry.  I wish to confine my remarks simply and solely to industry and I am convinced that the Government in their desire to promote industry have paid too little attention to certain essential facts.  I have said that they are mixing up the cure for unemployment with the promotion of industry.  When you look narrowly into certain measures that the Government have introduced you find that while undoubtedly certain people have been placed in industry as a result of those and other measures other people have been displaced.  That is what the Government are overlooking.  It reminds one of the story that used to be told during the war about the demolition of a munition factory.  It was this: that a contractor was putting up the factory, and that before he had finished it workmen were engaged at the other end taking it down.  Now something like that is going on in industry at the present time.  I am afraid that the Government pay absolutely no attention to the way that they are raising the cost of living and the cost of production and the difficulty of doing business in the case of other industries throughout the country. Everyone in this House would, I think; concede that when an Irish manufacturer is prepared to make a certain range of goods at something approaching the market price he should be given a measure of protection, but I am afraid that what happens at the present time is that a very much wider range of goods is protected than the local manufacturer is prepared to cater for.  This results in raising the price <Col N="2624" /> of certain goods to the community at large.  In other cases the output of the local manufacturer is so small that goods have to come in from outside to supplement his output.</P>
    <P>I think every Deputy in this House is aware of the extraordinary anxiety the Government have in catering for people who are prepared to manufacture. But there are other features, and I would like to remind the Government that there is a very large distributing trade in this country.  If that were in the hands of somebody else, the Government might find that they had paid too little attention to that portion of the economic wealth of the country.  If you are going to put two people into manufacture and take three people out of the distribution, that may be a satisfactory solution from the Government's point of view of the numbers taken on, but it is producing an amount of uncertainty the effects of which are only very slowly being felt.  The President, a short time ago, told us that people were not investing in Irish enterprises to the extent that they should.  Apparently, they did not appreciate the investment that was offered to them; but I should like the Government to give some concrete example of what the policy was in regard to industry in order that people might prepare for it.  Some manufacturers, who have no distributing facilities, have found that an impost on goods is a protection to them, and they are the only people who can import the goods that they are about to manufacture, presumably with the idea of establishing their place in the market.  I should like to remind the Government, however, that there are distributors, who have a very extensive organisation and give very extensive employment, and who have found that they are cut off from the importation of goods and are left high and dry with a large portion of their supplies cut off from them.  The Government may argue that manufacture is the most important thing in this country, and that distributors really are not wanted.  I suggest to the Government that a survey of the taxes or duties that they have put on would reveal that some of those duties <Col N="2625" /> are very useful.  They are giving a manufacturer the protection he needed and employment has been given, and industry is being carried on.  They would find in other cases, however, that the duties they have put on have really only increased the cost to the consumer, and have not really benefited anybody.  In other instances they would find that not only has that taken place, but that a very considerable distributing unit has been left in a state of uncertainty as to what their future is.  Nobody will deny that there must be a certain amount of dislocation, but I feel sure that if the Government could review a number of the duties, duty by duty, they would find that they have needlessly placed duties on certain things that are not giving any measure of employment in industry, and that in other cases it has merely raised difficulties which have got to be got over by reason of numerous licences and permits.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that, in a time like this, when it is very difficult for people to know what their future is and how far they are to be permitted to carry on their business, the Government ought to show that they are not prepared to displace anybody who is carrying on business or industry in this country unless it is for the interest of the country as a whole that some change should be made.  I feel sure that the Government have entirely under-estimated the effect on the industrial community of the present uncertainty which has been brought about, firstly, by a number of taxes which did not produce any good effect and, secondly, by a want of a policy by the Government which proceeded clearly and logically along certain lines. I do not wish to upset the Government's idea if they think that every single thing that is brought into this country can be manufactured here, but certainly I should like to assure them that the change over can only be accomplished by a slow and gradual growth of experience and confidence and by taking into counsel those who are employed in industry and carrying on the distributing industries as well as the manufacturing industries of this country.  There are certain frightful <Col N="2626" /> anomalies in the Government's policy to which I will refer under another Vote, but it seems to me as if the Government have not paid sufficient attention to the cost to the community in trying to promote industry and commerce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is nobody going to speak on the Government side on the Vote on Industry and Commerce?  Well, I shall go on.  This is the Vote which gives a Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is knowledgeable about his post, or even a substitute who is acting for the Minister, an opportunity to reveal what his policy has done for industry and commerce in the country during the 12 months that have gone.  It would be appropriate for the Minister under these circumstances to give the House some details, if any details are available, of the increased productivity in the country as well as the increase in the wealth that we are told is so marked around the country towns as well as in Dublin; and to give us a better indication than we have got up-to-date as to where the extra establishments are located, what are the wages paid in them, the hours worked, the proprietors who control them, and the capital, whether it is national or otherwise, which has been involved in them. That would be appropriate any time, but it would be particularly appropriate on this occasion when, for the first time, the Minister who announced his policy as a revolutionary one in industry can say that he had a fairly clear year in which to make good, and it would be still more appropriate to have such a clarifying statement from the Minister when that Minister, previously challenged with regard to his policy, said that he was prepared to take a certain challenge that had been flung out, &ldquo;a challenge that had been put that in eight months' time we shall find out whether our policy has been a success or not.  I am prepared to accept that; I am prepared to back that policy.&rdquo;  He talked then about the signs of improvement that he was going to put before the people's eyes in eight months' time, and the eight months date from 12th May, 1932.  Here <Col N="2627" /> is an opportunity in which not merely have the eight months elapsed, but that extra period which would necessarily be agreed upon to enable the Minister to measure up the full fruits of the success of the eight months and to present them here in a lucid and persuasive way, so that doubts that are at the moment in existence as regards the new policy might be all swept away.  The opportunity has not been taken.  There has been nothing indicated by the Minister with regard to progress of the policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time questions have been asked in this House about single industries, taking mainly the form of asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce to state how many new factories have been established in&mdash;&mdash;, and then the name of the industry occurs, to state where these factories are, to state how many new hands are employed, the wages that they get, and the hours they work, so that we could form an impression of the increased wealth produced in the country and how it is being distributed.  There have been a variety of excuses in answer to these questions.  We were told at one time that it was not considered desirable to give figures. We were told a little later that the staff was so busily engaged in promoting new industries that they could not stop to count those already established, although they must have records of them in the Department. We were told later on that it was better to present the matter in a comprehensive way and that a booklet dealing with Irish trade and industry was being prepared.  When that line was followed up later and questions were put as to when the booklet would make its appearance, we were confronted again with the usual evasions, until at last the Minister was asked had he sent out the type of a questionnaire which was necessary to collect the information about trade and industries.  We then found that this sheet of questions had not been yet sent to the industrialists of the country.  I do not know if it has yet been sent.  I certainly take it that no return has been made to it.  I suppose <Col N="2628" /> I should not go so far as that, but I take it that, if a return has been made, then it was so disappointing that it cannot be produced.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, we have to examine the Minister's attitude towards trade and industry in the country and his many flamboyant phrases as to the great progress made, the new ground that has been opened, the new sources of wealth that have been tapped.  From one detailed indication we can see pretty clearly what reliance is to be placed on the Minister's statement.  After persistent inquiry, Deputy Mulcahy recently got a return made to him covering a certain number of industries about which no excuse could be presented to the House for failure to give the return.  That was a group of industries on which tariffs had been imposed in 1924, 1925 and 1926, and in relation to which returns had been collected and presented half-yearly to the House. Recently Deputy Mulcahy did get an indication from these figures of the new employment in the industries mentioned, and from these we can get some criterion by which to judge the Minister for Industry and Commerce and some of his great phrases.  Speaking in the House on 11th May, 1933, as reported in volume 47, No. 3, column 911 of the Official Reports, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said of the apparel industry that it covers a range of different forms of production and has also progressed much more rapidly even than was contemplated. I am going to refer to the advertisements which gave detailed figures which show the Minister's contemplation. On 11th May, 1933, he stated here that the progress in the apparel industry had been greater even than he contemplated.  Then he continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputies who read the newspapers these days will find them full of advertisements for skilled workers in that trade.  Every skilled worker in the country has been employed. Increased production has been held up by the fact that additional skilled workers are not available, and the people concerned in that industry are writing to my Department asking <Col N="2629" /> for sanction to bring in skilled workers from abroad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a most satisfying statement to anyone who believes in it.  The apparel industry has progressed far greater than was ever contemplated. Advertisements were appearing in the newspapers asking for skilled workers in that trade.  That was the Minister's own statement, and he has the records of the skilled workers and knows where they are employed and how many are idle.  He said every skilled worker in the country had been employed&mdash;I am assuming in that trade.  Increased production had been held up, because there were not sufficient skilled workers in the country to deal with the increased production.  Application had been made to him by manufacturers for leave to bring in people from abroad.</P>
    <P>Then lately we got another jolt back to the truth.  The number of people employed in the wholesale side of the clothing end has gone down between September, 1931, and March, 1933, by nearly 500 workers.  That is according to official statistics.  There is something wrong somewhere.  If the Minister's own statistical department says that there were 500 people less employed in March, 1933, than there were in September, 1931, the Minister needs to do something more than merely assert that there are no skilled workers in the country without employment in the apparel trade; that there are advertisements appearing daily, with the implication that the advertisements are not being answered, for skilled workers; that production has been held up because there are not sufficient skilled workers in the country and that employers have asked leave to bring in skilled workers from outside. Either of these two statements is untrue.  Which is it?  Both have been given here officially as from the Department of Industry and Commerce; one by the Minister, speaking in the House, and the other in answer to a question to the Acting-Minister the other day.</P>
    <P>We have heard that type of statement from the Minister for Industry and Commerce before.  In that debate on 11th May, 1933, it was stated that <Col N="2630" /> there was not an industry that had not done better than was contemplated. There was hardly an industry in which production had not at least doubled. There was not one that had gone back. There was not a hint or a breath of suspicion that the detailed figures would reveal that there was less employment round about the period of two months earlier than the month in which he was speaking, than there was two years ago.</P>
    <P>I take one other phrase to get it reduced to its true proportions. Speaking in the same debate on the 11th May&mdash;the quotation is this time from Column 910, Vol. 47, No. 3 of the Official Debates&mdash;the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Take the confectionery industry. Employment in it has been doubled. The output has been more than doubled and it is still increasing. Progress has not yet stopped in that industry.  One new factory of considerable magnitude is being built and there are more to come.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The meanest and the dullest intellect can understand that&mdash;&ldquo;employment in it has been doubled, the output has been more than doubled and it is still increasing.&rdquo;  Then we get the detailed figures.  Employment as between September, 1931, and March, 1933, went up from 5,096 to 5,247.  That is 151 people extra employed in confectionery appears to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he is in one of his high spots of oratory, as double 5,000 people.  These are two statements I have taken from the Reports and I have set them against the increases as they were given in the detailed figures.  I think that, on reading this, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he returns, will have some cause of complaint against his acting colleague for having given away these figures.  His policy of not saying anything was far better.  It sounds far better for an election poster to say: &ldquo;Look at the confectionery industry; employment doubled; output more than doubled and still increasing.&rdquo;  It brings people with a terrific bash back to earth when, after reading that, they suddenly find that employment instead of having <Col N="2631" /> gone from 5,096 to something over 10,000 has merely gone to 5,247.  I presume for the future we can adopt in relation to the Minister's speeches that ratio, that his speeches have the same relation to fact as 5,247 has to 10,000. We should certainly get back to the old humorous calculation of taking a number, doubling it, and then subtracting a whole lot from it, if we are going to arrive at the truth of the statements of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I gather that to-day reference has been made to one really discovered factory.  I pride myself on having discovered this even earlier than the Minister for Industry and Commerce because some time earlier this year I found that a number of people in a certain district in the country were having a competition in which they got points for every new factory they discovered and lost points for every industry that had been destroyed.  The funny thing about it was that all the people engaged in the competition lost because when they had totted up they had all minus points.  They had discovered more destruction than they had new factories, but they did discover one factory which has been referred to here to-day, a factory opened under the auspices of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at Naas and under the special aegis of Deputy Briscoe&mdash;the same Deputy Briscoe who, the President said, had done more than any other person in the community to relieve unemployment.</P>

      <P>Yes, a bet of a few <Col N="2632" /> sausages from the Naas factory if we can get them.  I read more about this factory than I have read in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  A paper called <i>Irish Industry</i> published what, I suppose, American phraseology would best describe as a &ldquo;blurb&rdquo; of this factory, that they were going to produce 300 different types of delicatessen.  It is not called sausage.  The names of the directors were given but they were not given accurately in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  It says or indicates that amongst the directors were a man called Caplan and two men of the name of Witstun.  That name, by the way, according to <i>Irish Industry</i>, is not Witstun but Whizton and Caplan is not Caplan but Caplal. Then there was Deputy Briscoe. According to this paper, there were to be 400 different types of delicatessen produced in this factory.  I have taken 300 as the number in memory of the number of factories supposed to be established in this country and I have asked on a number of occasions in restaurants for the 300th type of the Caplal&mdash;Whizton-Whizton Briscoe delicatessen made in Ireland.  The waitress had nearly always gone before I had completed my order but I did succeed on some occasions in retaining her attention.  However, I have not yet been successful in getting the 300th type of delicatessen from the Naas factory.</P>

      <P>I do not think so. I have searched through Naas and I have not yet succeeded in getting an ordinary native sausage, let alone the delicatessen.  Let me read what the Minister said about the factory on the occasion of its opening.  It was described as &ldquo;the Viennese sausage factory&rdquo;.  There has always to be a touch of musical comedy associated with these new factories.  It was on this occasion &ldquo;the Viennese sausage factory&rdquo;.  The report says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Viennese sausage factory which has been established in a portion of the old Military Barracks, at Naas, County Kildare, was formally opened to-day by Mr. Seán Lemass, Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The most modern Continental machinery has been <Col N="2633" /> installed in the new factory and the sausages and meat products are manufactured under the most hygienic conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was a little bit of a forecast. Very little has been manufactured there since.  Then it talks about the features of the plant, the grand abattoir and the great refrigerating rooms where meat can be kept fresh for long periods.  I am afraid that most of it has not emerged from the refrigerating plant since it was produced.</P>
    <P>The report further states that the factory is capable of producing ten tons of sausages and food products every week, that if necessary an additional machine can be installed, the output increased to 20 tons, and that upwards of 50 different varieties of sausages will be manufactured. <i>Irish Industry</i> is far better than the <i>Irish Press</i> in that respect.  They increased the figure to 400 different types of delicatessen in this &ldquo;bawneen&rdquo; country.  We are going to have something further.  &ldquo;It is hoped to open up an export trade with France, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium.&rdquo;  The Minister for Agriculture could not do much better than that in relation to providing alternative markets.  For this famous sausage, made at Naas, Co. Kildare, we are going to have an export business with France, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium.  That is only part of the blessings of this great factory. The company will also consider, in the near future, the possibility of starting a new subsidiary industry. What is it?  Tanning, if you please.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether they wanted the skins to be recoverable or what the idea was, but a tanning industry was going to be associated with the new Viennese Sausage Factory down at Naas.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce gave it his blessing&mdash;if that is not an inappropriate word to use in relation to delicatessen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; a requiem, I think, would be more appropriate than a blessing.  The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It gave him great pleasure to perform the opening ceremony, firstly, because of the enterprise of those who had started and supported the project; secondly, because it would help to relieve unemployment in the town of Naas, and thirdly, because his friend and colleague, Mr. Briscoe, was associated with it.  The type of industry which has been established was in some respects a new one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know why,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and the proper art of sausage making was being introduced here for the first time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The occasion was when the Minister for Industry and Commerce visited Naas, sometime in February of this year. Then the report goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The industry was necessarily a small one, and should not be compared with the gigantic industries in other countries, but all big things have small beginnings.  Those responsible for the management of the factory had taken advantage of the most highly skilled technical advice that was available to them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then we had Franz Vogel and A. Caplal, and M. Witstun&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is part of the programme of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that in the case of factories that are established except under licence capital should be controlled, in the main, by Irish nationals.

      <P>It has got more or less chronically into that state.  There is the sort of thing this paper was publishing with regard to Irish industry. It is aligned with what the Minister <Col N="2636" /> was saying as to the total number of factories in this country and what he was telling us with regard to the apparel factories in the country, that the industry was being held up because there were not enough skilled workers available, and that people were applying to him for permits to bring in outside workers.  All this at a time when employment in these factories had actually decreased by 500! We have got to find out where the truth lies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good topic, it is a great topic.  If I were going out to make a cross-road speech I could rant as well as the best that Deputy Kelly could do about his lack of interest in the people looking to get employment in the Naas factory and who have not got it.  I could talk about his alleged inhumanity and indifference in regard to other workers in the country.  That was all being done by the Deputy in the same <Col N="2638" /> circumstances.  I am taking a concrete case.  I have said about the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he has the faculty that is supposed only to be possessed by gases that have been able to expand and fill in a given space.  He has expanded over one and a half times to fill the vacuum in the factories.  I have given one or two concrete cases about the confectionery business, the apparel business and this single delicatessen factory.  If there had not been collapse in that factory you would have the Minister standing up and telling us that the factory had an export trade.  It is very easy to get away from the phrase &ldquo;it is hoped to open up an export trade with France, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium.&rdquo;  The Minister very easily crosses the border line between his hopes and his statement of facts.  He would have said &ldquo;things have gone much better than I hoped.&rdquo;  It was hoped to establish a trade with France, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium, and then he would have gone on to say that they were opening up a trade with the Argentine.</P>
      <P>That is a very simple statement for the Minister to make.  It would be all right if somebody had not gone into his Department while he was away and given out the detailed figures and facts which go to expose him.  Then there was the transition and the hope of establishing a subsidiary industry and using tanning, a most improper one, I think everyone will agree, in relation to the Naas factory.  There were markets, at any rate, indicated there.  There were special markets, but I do not know why these countries were chosen.  It is a fact that we have for a long time been talking about the development of foreign trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice there was a meeting of an association last night which got down to bedrock as to where our exports should go.  They decided upon Spain as the spot, and they have been very anxious to get to work in providing new markets.  They appointed a subcommittee to get down to bedrock.  No doubt their efforts will be crowned with the same success that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture have found in <Col N="2639" /> their search for markets.  They may be able to get the delicatessen sausage factory of Messrs. Caplal, Whizton Whizton and Briscoe&mdash;the produce of that completely Irish national industry transported to Spain and later on we may make our name in this new product.</P>

      <P>That may be, and that may be the thing the Minister may find himself up against about a variety of products.  I am not sure whether Deputy Moore is a member of the particular society that met last night and was getting down to bedrock.  He has as much right to be a member as many of those who were present.  The body I am alluding to is known as the United Farmers' Protection Association, not the body under the leadership of Deputy MacDermot. The Chairman of the body that met last night is a member of the Bar, a senior counsel, who deals with land and things relating to land in the garden at the back of his house on Raglan Road.</P>

I do not know what meaning to put on that phrase &ldquo;to be&rdquo; since we had the debate on the Oath Bill.  To the ordinary man it means that there were to be a number of men employed when the Fianna Fáil Government came into power in new industrial concerns. If the Minister is questioned about any of these I am sure he will answer.  The additional workers to be employed in the boot and shoe trade for example were 5,801.  Can the Minister answer as to whether that number have been so employed, or as to whether he is under any obligation to them?  Can we start by being sure that one additional has got employment?  Have the 800 got employment?  Let us leave out the 5,000 as a bit of exaggeration in the heat of a general election.  What about the 801?  Have we had that number additional employed in the boot and shoe industry?  If the Minister for Education representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce will not answer I say we have nothing to go on with regard to the Minister's figures.</P>

      <P>This is in relation to new employment.  There was an additional number of 658 people who were to find employment in bacon curing.  When the Minister was asked to answer about them he was lucky enough to preserve a discreet silence. In woollens and worsteds we find that 6,983 were to find additional employment. Again let us drop the thousands and come to the 893 extra people who were to be employed.  Does the Minister know whether they were or not? Has he any figure?  Then we come to grain milling.  This was a very good business for no fewer than 14,069 additional were to be employed.  Have we got them?  What advance have we made towards getting them?  This is an occasion in which the Minister should be anxious to show his form in carrying out these promises.  Surely we ought to be able to get something more than a smile with regard to over 14,000 people in this country promised employment in the grain milling industry. Then we come to cloth, subdivided into linens, cotton, hemp, jute and canvas.  10,501 were to be engaged. Have we had 501 engaged leaving out the 10,000?  Then there are confectionery, chocolates, jams and marmalades, 1,620 persons additional were to be employed.  That is a small lot.  The Minister told us on the 11th May that the number of people employed in these industries in Dublin had doubled. When we got the actual figures we <Col N="2642" /> found that they had gone up from 5,096 to 5,247.  That is what the Minister calls doubling.  Multiply 5,096 by 2 and you get 5,247! &ldquo;Fertilisers, chemicals, drugs and paints, 2,046&rdquo;&mdash;any offer as to what we have got?  Can the Minister state a figure at all?  I remember when the debate was here in progress on one item of these, fertilisers, as such, we were not promised a single man in employment but we were told that if we did not do certain things 1,000 were going to lose employment.  We had got off the perch of the new employment by that time and there was only a saving of people in employment. &ldquo;Paper and stationery&rdquo; were going to give us 4,653 additional employed people in the country and when we asked about that we got silence.  We did not get any indication of what the new employment is.  There are a whole lot of others.</P>

      <P>I hope there is no implication against the Minister.  I had joined the Minister in with the Department and he is busy starting factories here, there and everywhere. This is one of them.  I have spoken really to three items only to-day and the Minister for Education should not really be so easily aggravated. I have taken only three examples and I have put in contrast performance and promise, and something more than a burst of anger is required as a reply.  There must be some explanation and the Minister must be capable of giving it or else the Executive Council must be capable of getting somebody who is capable of giving it.  Let him take the three things I have spoken of.  I just mention the Naas factory.  What has happened there; how much money is there; what is being done there; what directors are in it; and what money is in it?  It is easy to answer all this with regard to one factory and he can add the details, all the little bits of trimmings, in the way of what export trade we have in these things and what progress we have made towards the subsidiary industry.  If he does not want to deal with that factory at all&mdash;all this talk about it is probably somewhat nauseating to him&mdash;let him turn to the sugar confectionery business.  Can he explain what the Minister meant when he said that employment would be doubled and, then, figures are produced which show that it has increased by 151 hands, on a tot of 5,096, making it 5,247.</P>
      <P>Can he tell us what the Minister meant when he said that skilled workers could not be got in the apparel business; that production was held up for want of skilled workers?  How does he compare that with the note which shows that there are 490 less employed between September, 1931, and March?  If we could get an answer to these three questions we could have an instructive debate on industry and commerce in this country.</P>

It is inconceivable to me that the Department would have allowed the Commercial Attaché in Paris to appoint someone from this country to take charge of this exhibit. I can imagine appointing a person where he was to be engaged on the spot, but if the Minister agrees that someone was sent out from this country, it is incredible to me that the Minister did not say: &ldquo;I want the name of that person and what he was paid.&rdquo;  I presume the Minister in the apportionment of the expenses can give what was paid.

      <P>I put it that it should be disclosed, and that the <Col N="2648" /> Minister should take steps before he replies to get further information, because it is certainly in the possession of his Department.  On sub-head I&mdash; The Chicago World Fair, 1933&mdash;there is provision for the cost of an exhibition of Saorstát industries.  The total cost, including rent of space, is £5,000 of which £300 was provided previously. Therefore, we are now voting £4,700 rent of space and incidental expenses, while the phrase used is &ldquo;total cost.&rdquo; I take it, therefore, that there is something beyond rent of space and what are described as incidental expenses.  I would like to know what these are. Are we giving any help to exhibitors and, if so, to what exhibits?  Are we giving the same help to all who apply or is there any process of selection? If there is a process of selection, how is it carried out?  Have any exhibits been refused, and on what grounds? Can we get, generally, some indication of the exhibits it is proposed to have at the Chicago Fair?</P>
      <P>Under the heading of &ldquo;Appropriations-in-Aid,&rdquo; I would like to know if we could have the contributions and fees payable under the Gas Regulation Act, and under the Weights and Measures Acts, and why there has been a drop in the amount for the coming year.  In 1932-33 they amounted to £1,840, and this year to £1,600.  Does that mean that there has been any relaxation of activities on the part of those in charge of the Weights and Measures Acts or in relation to those responsible for looking after the Gas Regulation Act?  At any rate, there is a drop indicated, and it is good to have an explanation why that drop is estimated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>A great many things have been alluded to on this Vote, with some of which I would like to deal.  First of all, Deputy McGilligan was very vocal&mdash;I am glad he is runing out&mdash;about the number of people who are employed now and the number employed 12 months ago.  In my constituency, on the day that Deputy McGilligan gave over pretending to represent industry and commerce, we had 170 men employed in the flour industry.  Two flour mills were ordered to be closed down and the foreign firm that was brought in to take over the mills under the Cumann na nGaedheal regime had the agents measuring the plant and machinery for removal. These two flour mills have increased the number of their employees by 37 and are now working overtime, whereas the former workers were only employed half-time.  A flour mill closed down during the regime of the Minister, who did not represent industry and commerce, has also been re-opened. The flour mill at Clondullane, which has been re-opened, is giving permanent employment to over 60 hands. The Mitchelstown factory, now in full working order, has 70 hands in employment more than the number employed 12 months ago.  Glanmire waterproofs factory closed down owing to the penal preference given to British manufactures in this country by the <Col N="2650" /> ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce. That factory has now been re-opened and is giving employment to 130 men.  The woollen mills at Glanmire have 30 extra hands employed and are working overtime.  These mills were not working full time at any period during the three years before Cumann na nGaedheal left office.  The new shovel mills at Templemichael are giving employment to over 30 hands. The increased number of persons in permanent employment in my constituency within the last 12 months is 260, besides 140 who were employed in the flour mills and who have been kept in employment owing to the kicking out of office of the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The mineral wealth in my constituency has also been developed.  About 140 men were employed for five months in development work.  As a result, applications have now been handed to the Trade Loans Department for plant and machinery which will give permanent employment to 60 men in one mine alone.  The celluloid factory, in respect of which a trade loan has also been applied for, will give employment to 150 hands.  Those are particulars of one constituency alone, and I think they furnish a complete answer to the activities of our ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was so vocal for the last hour.  Deputy Coburn wants to import bricks across the border from the northern Orangemen, to whom we have to pay 40 per cent. on our cattle going out.  Does Deputy Coburn consider that it is a contribution to the relief of unemployment in this State to bring bricks made by northern Orangemen across the border?</P>

      <P>Deputy Bennett was very vocal on the mixture scheme of the Minister for Agriculture.  He told us about the hardships feeders of stock were enduring on account of not having a suitable mixture.  Apparently, bullocks in Limerick if fed on Irish grain die of starvation.  Deputy Bennett wants to have it both ways.  He <Col N="2651" /> wants to get the benefit of an increase of 100 per cent. on the value his milk would have under the Cumann na nGaedheal regime and he wants to allow no benefit whatever to the other class of farmer who ploughs his land and produces his grain.  He is to have no market but Deputy Bennett is to have the market guaranteed by Fianna Fáil and which he had the pluck to vote for against his own Party.  That secured him an increase of 100 per cent. in the price of the milk he produces. Deputy Bennett wants to keep that benefit, conferred on him by Fianna Fáil, but he does not want a market opened for the grain farmer who ploughs his land and employs the men that Deputy Bennett lets go to the County Home from the 1st November to the 1st March.  These men are to remain idle but Deputy Bennett is to have the benefit of foreign maize to feed Irish stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not intend to interfere in this debate until I heard Deputy McGilligan's speech lasting an hour.  That gentleman spoke about the amount of unemployment under a Fianna Fáil Government but I know the condition of my constituency under the penal regime of the Minister who did not represent industry and commerce, whose whole policy was to get in the foreigner's stuff.  &ldquo;Show the people the flour coming in from Manchester and Liverpool while their own flour mills are closed and they are walking the streets.&rdquo;  That was the policy of Deputy McGilligan.  That was bad enough but one would think that, when turned out of office, Deputy McGilligan would have the decency to shut his mouth here.  He knows very well that the arguments he put up can be refuted.  We are sick hearing these tunes.  We have a little waterproof factory in Glanmire in which the largest number employed during Deputy McGilligan's term of office was 20.  Deputy McGilligan brought in a tariff to aid Irish industry, whereby 20 per cent. was placed on foreign waterproofs and 25 per cent. on the material for making them, with 5 per cent. preference for British products. That was Deputy McGilligan's cure for <Col N="2652" /> unemployment in that case.  The contract for the waterproofs for the Gárda Síochána and the oilskins for the postmen was handed over to the Victoria Rubber Company, of Manchester, for the sake of the difference of 9d. a suit.  That is the difference at which Irishmen could make them with a 5 per cent. allowance against them and what they were being made for across the water.  The money subscribed by the Irish taxpayer was handed over to the Victoria Rubber Company, of Manchester, by Deputy McGilligan.  That is the kind of employment that Deputy McGilligan provides.  The factory in my constituency which I have referred to was closed down for four months before Fianna Fáil came into office in consequence of losing this contract.  That factory is now giving decent employment and a living wage to 130 hands. We did not hear a word of that from Deputy McGilligan.  We did not hear anything about the Clondullane flour mills, which were closed down.  When asked questions about them here by the late Deputy Daly, on his own benches, Deputy McGilligan said that it was a completely uneconomic proposition to have flour mills so far away from a port.  These people do not find it an uneconomic proposition to employ 50 hands.  But it was an uneconomic proposition under Deputy McGilligan's rule. We had many uneconomic propositions under his rule, when a message was sent across: &ldquo;There are special reasons why you should subscribe to Cumann na nGaedheal funds.&rdquo;  I knew very well I would get Deputy McGilligan on the run.  We saw the actions of Deputy McGilligan's Party in our constituency for four or five years.  We can, therefore, speak from experience of what happened under the benevolent rule of of Cumann na nGaedheal in our constituency. You cannot have it both ways.  You cannot have special reasons why flour millers across the water should subscribe to Cumann na nGaedheal funds and at the same time have your mills working here.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy McGilligan and I must confess I could not understand what he was talking about.  I wonder where he got his <Col N="2653" /> information from.  I have not got any from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I have only got information on what I have actually seen.  I know something about the position in County Meath, which is not an industrial county at all, and is not supposed to be.  We have there an extremely prosperous fruit-growing industry.  We are now able to supply 25 per cent. of the raspberries used in the country.  Within the next two years &mdash;we have the assurance that the canes are already planted&mdash;we expect to be able to supply the full requirements of the country.  Three years ago I found that industry in County Meath absolutely decaying.  I visited the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture.  They barely knew what a raspberry was.  That is so far as the agricultural side of the question is concerned.</P>
      <P>As regards the other side of the question, I know Balbriggan fairly well. It is the neighbouring town to mine. I am perfectly satisfied that in the hosiery industry they are working full time.  Sunday is the only day the factory is idle.  Deputy Coburn told us something about Drogheda.  I am informed three or four factories there, including an iron foundry, are working full time.  In Navan there is a well-known woollen mill.  Since the Saorstát was established I do not think that mill ever worked for more than six months in any year.  To-day, I am glad to say, it is on full time.  In Kells we have a boot factory.  It was started five or six weeks ago.</P>

I do not understand what Deputy McGilligan is driving at. I know he is a really good talker, but good talkers do not always have a great deal upstairs.  Really I was afraid the man had become unbalanced.  I am talking from my experience of conditions in the country; I know nothing about the figures.

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £10,494 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1934, for payment under the Railways Act, 1924, the Tramways and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, etc.; and for other purposes connected with Irish Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head A is a statutory payment under the Railways Act of 1924 amounting to £47,288.  Sub-head B is a token vote of £10 in respect of the acquisition of land for colliery railways. No expenditure is likely to arise, but it has been the custom to have this token vote.  Sub-head C is a payment in respect of steamer services, and shows a decrease of £1,160. This decrease is accounted for in connection with the service of the Galway Steamboat Company from Galway to the Aran Islands.  A certain reduction in costs has been effected, and it is expected that in the future it will be possible to run the service on a Government grant of £300.  £300 is the amount, accordingly, allowed this year.  Of course in certain years, such as last year, for example, certain sums have been spent on repairs and so on, but it is anticipated that in the future the service will be covered by the Government grant of £300.  Sub-head D deals with the payments to railway companies in respect of wages, and the amount here is £15,000.  The House will remember that in December last, when there was a threat of a strike on the railways, the Minister for Industry and Commerce introduced a Supplementary Estimate to provide for a sum of, I think, £40,000, of which the £15,000 under this sub-head is in respect of the present financial year. The position was that a strike was threatened, and in order to avoid any strike until such time as those concerned had an opportunity of considering the new position created by the passage of railway legislation, legislation which has since gone through both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Minister gave this subsidy.  The £15,000 fell due during the present financial year.  The portion of the amount payable to the railway companies whose lines cross the Border <Col N="2659" /> was not payable after the 30th January in their case, because a strike occurred. The subsidy was accordingly withdrawn in respect of those lines across the Border as from that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be interrupted.  I want to have some information also in relation to sub-head C&mdash;payments in respect of steamer service.  The Minister says it is expected that £300 will serve the subsidy of the Galway-Aran service. £500 was required before.  Does the Minister mean that any expenditure previously met out of the State subsidy has been put over as a charge upon the people who are, in fact, owning and working the service, or does he mean that the expenses have been reduced to such a point that the expectation is that £300 will only be required where £500 was required before?  Am I to understand from him that the £300 is to be substituted not merely for the £500, but for the £960 in respect of the working deficit on the Sligo-Killybegs-Belmullet steamer services, or is it that that service is being discontinued? The last time the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke to any extent on <Col N="2660" /> this Vote he said that certain investigations had been made which were leading him to the belief that the service was not of very much value and should be discontinued.  He also referred to certain guarantees that were given by certain people in the neighbourhood of Sligo and Killybegs that if they would load so much of their produce on this boat it was bound to pay its way.  What has happened? Is it merely that the steamer has been taken off the service or that the guarantees have been made good and that trade has improved to such an extent that the money will not be required, or else that the £300 is the substitute for all the payments both in regard to the Galway-Aran service and the service to Killybegs and Donegal?  I should like the Minister to tell us which of these is the actual situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an item of £15,000 here for payments to railway companies in respect of wages.  According to the footnote it is the estimated amount required to provide the difference between the higher rate of wages paid to railway employees and the reduced rate which would have been payable had the award made by the Irish Railway Wages Board on 25th November, 1932, been brought into operation from the 26th December, 1932.  Can the Minister tell us if the reduced rate has since come into operation in full accordance with the Irish Railway Wages Board award of the date of the 25th November, 1932?  If so, has the Minister anything to say to the House on the situation which has developed from that?  If it simply is that the railway employees had accepted that cut, will the Minister make some attempt to justify the payment of this sum to prevent an award coming into operation on the date from which the award was to operate, seeing that in these circumstances the award has come into operation since without any trouble?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking on the Supplementary Estimate brought in on an earlier stage to make this payment in respect of the last financial year, said that, as far as he was concerned, he wanted to have it known <Col N="2661" /> that as a matter of policy he would never again interfere in relation to the Wages Board; that if controversy was taken before them in the ordinary and proper way, and if they made an award, the employees got a warning from him that they could not expect any subvention from State funds to bridge whatever the difference might be between the award and the old wage. I should like to know is that still the policy of the Department, and is it going to be persisted in?</P>
    <P>Certain Appropriations-in-Aid are also mentioned.  Paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-head E are tied up with Section 63 of the Railways Act, 1924; and, similarly, on the other side of the account, the payment under sub-head A is also associated with the same section: but there is a divergence between the figures.  Even the multiplication of the Appropriation-in-Aid by two and the addition of the county council payments is not the full equivalent of the outpayment of £47,000. Where does the discrepancy come from?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the discrepancy arises, possibly, from the fact that there will be a change in the amount of the Treasury subvention.  The amount paid to the company is composed at present of a Treasury subvention of £20,586, the contribution of £6,804, and payments from the county councils totalling £21,208 up to the end of 1929, and £19,898 to the end of 1934.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding the steamer service is that no provision is made in this Estimate for any other steamer service but the Galway Bay steamboat service from Galway to Aran Islands.  I take it that the other services to which the Deputy referred have been discontinued.  I have no information as to the circumstances under which they were discontinued, but no provision has been made in the Estimates this year and, accordingly, I take it that the policy which, I understand, the Minister to some extent outlined last year with regard to the Belmullet service at any rate&mdash;I do not know anything about Killybegs&mdash;will <Col N="2662" /> be definitely discontinued so far as the Government grant is concerned.  That has been carried into effect.</P>
      <P>With regard to the subsidies to the railway company and reimbursement of wages, the position is that the award, so far as I know, has been carried into effect.  The Minister declared, at the time and since, that it was not the Government's policy to grant subventions or subsidies in this case where strike disputes occurred.  I think the Deputy can take it that the Government's will not, under any circumstances, make allowances by way of subsidies or otherwise to enable the railway companies or other bodies involved in such disputes to carry on while these strikes or other disputes are in operation.</P>

      <P>I should like to have some information from the Minister, for instance, on the question of railway bridge approaches.  What is the liability of the railway company to the local authority?  Apparently, a case has cropped up.  Formerly, when the roads were not being steam-rolled, I believe the railway company had an agreement with the local authorities to keep their bridge approaches in order. For a number of years now these roads and bridges have been steam-rolled by the local authorities, and the railway companies have given very little attention to the approaches.  In any case, they are not kept in the same state of repair as the local authority would keep them.</P>

      <P>Certain bodies are anxious to find out their position; for instance, the Galway County Council want to find out their position.  The approaches to those bridges are kept in a very bad state at the present time, and if this matter is allowed to go on, it is possible that these approaches will become dangerous to the public.  Certainly, payments are being made to the railway companies and I think that something should be done.  The railway companies certainly should compensate the local authorities in some way for the work they are doing.  In the case of several of those bridge approaches the local authorities have taken on the work themselves.  I do not think it is fair that local authorities should be asked to pay the full amount for this work as the railway company, by agreement, were originally liable to keep the roads in an ordinary state of repair.</P>

      <P>With regard to the item of £15,000 for payments to railway companies in respect of wages, a note in the Estimates states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Estimated amount required to provide the difference between the higher rate of wages paid to railway employees in An Saorstát and the reduced rate which would have been payable had the award made by the Irish Railway Wages Board on 25th November, 1932, been brought into operation from the 26th December, 1932.  Provision is here made for the difference in respect of the months of March and April, 1933.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a previous Vote I referred to the tendency of the Department of Industry and Commerce to enter into industrial disputes.  On this occasion, while it might have been thought good business on the part of the Minister to provide a sum of money from State funds equal to the difference between the award and the demands of the <Col N="2664" /> men in order to keep the railways going in the Free State, on the other hand, it had a very detrimental effect on the Great Northern Railway, which is in a peculiar situation, half of the line being in Northern Ireland and the other half in the Free State.  The action of the Minister on that occasion produced a rather peculiar position, in that the employees on the Free State portion of the railway received higher wages than were paid to the employees in the Northern Ireland portion and that, I think, more or less hastened the strike action by the Northern Ireland section of the employees.  Seeing that their comrades in the Free State were being subsidised by the Free State Government, they thought it only required a little pressure on their part to have a similar subsidy given by the Northern Government, but that Government refused to enter into the dispute.  I need not go into the whole history of the matter.  It is sufficient for me, as a trade unionist, to say that once the men agreed to submit their claim to the Wages Board they should have abided by the result.  However, the wiser counsels did not prevail on that occasion and the fact remains that a strike did take place on the Great Northern Railway which lasted nine or ten weeks and ended rather disastrously for all concerned, as, although the men had to submit, yet the railway company lost a considerable volume of trade and, incidentally, there was a big loss, not alone to the North of Ireland but to the Free State.  In Dundalk, which is one of the chief centres as far as railway works are concerned, and where much employment was given, after the strike had ended there were many dismissals and reductions in staff.  That applies also to other places in Northern Ireland and the Free State.  While I do not want to criticise the action of the Minister on that occasion unduly, still I think it was a dangerous precedent to set up by interfering in a dispute of that kind.  As a trade unionist, I always take the line that employers and employees could settle their own disputes better between themselves than by appealing to outsiders.  If it is necessary to appeal to outsiders, <Col N="2665" /> once both sides have agreed to that, they should abide by the result.  In this case there was an appeal to the Railway Wages Board, which came to a certain definite decision.  In my opinion, it would have been much better for all concerned had that decision been accepted.  Unfortunately, it was not and then we had the Minister's intervention.  From the experience gained on that occasion I think that the Minister, or any future Minister, will hasten slowly in interfering in disputes between employers and employees. As far as Dundalk is concerned, which might be termed a railway town, it has suffered very considerably in the last three or four months as a result of that unfortunate strike.  I do not want to see a repetition of that and, in my opinion, the Minister should steer clear of these disputes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cleary does not know anything about the matter of which I am speaking.  He would rather be making speeches at the cross-roads in Mayo, trying to convince some of the poor people there, who do not understand things, that he is a very clever sort of fellow, and telling the people that he was the official interrupter of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It requires a certain amount of moral courage to deal with the matter to which I have referred.  Deputy Cleary does not understand the words &ldquo;moral courage.&rdquo; It is not to be found in many members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is rather an unpopular thing to speak about strikes at all and the grievances of workingmen.  It is much better to say the popular thing on all ocasions.  Men who know nothing about work cannot be expected to engage in matters of this kind.  There is one other matter I should like to refer to, and that is the very injurious effect that the duty of 5/- per ton on coal has on the working of the railways.  I do not know whether I am in order in referring to it now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering the present position of the railways the Government should be very slow to place any undue burden by way of extra cost on the running of the railways. Certainly this 5/- per ton has added very considerably to the cost of running the railways in the Saorstát. It may be argued that it is possible to obtain supplies from Germany, but there is the drawback that you can only procure German coal at an economic price by taking it in large quantities, and if you purchase a large quantity of coal a large boat has to be employed to convey it here.  There are only one or two ports in the Free State capable of accommodating boats with a deep draught, and if the coal has to be brought to these ports injury will be done to the small ports like Dundalk, Drogheda and others to which cargoes of coal for the railways came in the past.  In the interest of those engaged in the running of the railways, and of the many thousands at present finding employment on the railways, the Government should make some arrangement by which coal for the railways would be imported free of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the point raised by Deputy Brodrick in connection with repairs to railway bridges and roads in the immediate vicinity of these railways, it is a well-known fact that many public bodies have constructed very good roads leading up to those bridges. It is also well known that the bridges and the approaches to them are kept in very bad repair by the railways. They are, of course, bound by statute to keep these bridges in repair.  I think that owing to the bad times through which the railways are passing they are not so quick in repairing these bridges as they have been in the past. It is a matter, of course, between the public bodies and the railways, but I think if some arrangement could be come to whereby the railway authorities would be relieved of the responsibility of repairing these bridges, and the local authorities would take it over in consideration of getting some little remuneration in respect of it from the Government, it might meet the situation.  There is a great deal of dis <Col N="2667" /> satisfaction amongst public bodies in regard to the way in which these bridges are being repaired, and if it were possible for the Minister to make some representation in that regard to the railway companies, it might lead to a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a matter for the Minister directly.  I suggest that the Deputy should take it up with the local authority or get the local authority to take it up with the railways.  The Deputy has twice referred to the question of strikes and he has spoken of the Department interfering in strikes.  On a previous occasion he spoke of the strikers being assured of sympathy from the Department. I do not think it is right for the Deputy to speak of the Department interfering.  The position is that there is a Conciliation Branch in the Department of Industry and Commerce and if the parties, or any one of the parties, approach the officers in that Department or approach the Minister, I think it is the Minister's duty on the ground of public policy to try to bring the parties together and have the dispute settled.  The Minister and his Department would prefer to be left out of the disputes but I think the Deputy will recognise that a certain stage is reached, when the Minister must try and bring the parties together and have the dispute settled in the public interest.  There is no question of the Department giving sympathy or moral support to the strikers.  That question has never arisen and I think the Deputy should not have made the statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a few questions in regard to this Vote and I should like to put them again in so far as they have been left unanswered. I asked for some explanation of the sums set out in the Appropriations-in-Aid in (a) (b) and (c).  The Minister would advance no further than stating that probably they are to be explained by the fact that the sums may change but we are voting distinct specified sums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the exact question that the Deputy wishes to raise? <Col N="2668" /> Is it not quite clear that the matter arose under this particular section of the Railways Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister apparently does not really know anything more about it than what is in front of him.  There should be some approximation between the sum paid to the Great Southern Railway Company and twice the amount got in by way of appropriations in aid plus the payment out of the local taxation account. I say that these things do not balance. I was told the reason was that probably the sums would change but to pass an Estimate of this kind we want something more definite than to say probably they will change.  We want a statement from the Minister that the amounts will in fact change and showing what the amount of the change is likely to be so that people will agree that there may be that deficit and that it has to be met by the State.  That was, I think, the second question I asked.  My first question was in regard to the payments in respect of the acquisition of land for colliery railways. The Minister said that that was a token vote.  A token of what?  Is there going to be land acquired this year for colliery railways or is the vote merely for the purpose of keeping the sub-head open?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other items to which I referred are the payments of subsidies in respect to steamer services.  On the Galway-Aran steamer service there was a subsidy paid some years ago of about £1,000.  It had been brought down year by year until last year it was at the rate of £500.  This year it comes down to £300.  I have asked the reason for this new estimate of £300, £200 less than last year.  Is it because the expenses have been better gripped under supervision, that certain items have been cut out and that, therefore, there has been a reduction from the old estimate of about £1,000 to this £500 or does it mean that the Government considers that £300 is enough to lose on the service?  If so, there is another consideration which must be borne in mind, that the charges for tolls, freight on goods and animals carried, and the fares for the small number of passengers who travel on <Col N="2669" /> this service must be raised.  I also drew attention to the disappearance of the estimate of £960 for Sligo-Killybegs steamer service.  I asked if the steamer services were still being kept on, whether the guarantees were being kept on, or would the steamer service disappear. The Minister said he assumed that it is possible&mdash;that is the sort of doubting preamble we had&mdash;that as the money has not been voted the service is disappearing.  That raises a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>There used to be a steamer service between Sligo and Belmullet and a certain subsidy was paid for the running of that service.  Then at a certain point certain traders in Killybegs, joined by certain traders in Sligo, made what amounted to a guarantee to the Department that if that steamer would run a certain number of times in a northward direction so as to touch at Killkbegs, there would be sufficient traffic offering to pay its way but, as they thought that it might take some little time to get that under way, there should be some subvention for a short period.  The disappearance of the service between Sligo and Killybegs which has not been very long established will not probably do very great harm but there will be some doubts raised when some explanation has not been given in regard to the matter. If it could be shown that there was not sufficient traffic between the two ports so that it was really uneconomic from the start, that would be one thing, and it would be a good answer.  If it could be shown that the traffic is going more cheaply by the present Donegal light railway system that would be another answer and to my mind an equally good answer.  But the disappearance of the Sligo-Belmullet service is a totally different matter. That had been under investigation for two or three years.  It looked on first consideration as if anything that was to be done, as between Belmullet and Sligo, could certainly be met by a road service.  It was easier to approach by road because the steamer service had a difficulty on account of certain tidal variations in the particular place where the wharf outlet ended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2670" /> There was considerable difficulty about getting things landed in a particular time and there was a suggestion that the road service could supply the transport needs.  Then it was found after the first demand was made on the road service that the roads around that area began to crumble and the Government were faced with a decision as between paying fairly large sums of money per annum or re-making the roads which because they were built in a particular place were liable to sink. The question then was to decide whether the subsidy was going to be continued or were they to subsidise the lorry service through an extra grant to the council for road making along that road between Sligo and Belmullet. Those are things that can be answered. The question really has been raised. The Minister will know, if he has studied this matter at all, that past experiments in the use of Arigna coal were made in relation to the Sligo-Belmullet service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a line of it statutory.  It has reference to the payments or subsidy to the Galway-Aran steamer service.  If it is statutory I ask the Minister to name the statute so that that sort of vexatious interruption should not be made. These payments are brought before us in this way in the Estimates in the matter of subsidies which could be refused.  There is no statute at all <Col N="2671" /> which binds us to grant this subsidy and there is no statute which binds us to grant the subsidy to the Sligo-Killybegs-Belmullet steamer service, seeing that it is disappearing.  But on both of these services there was a test made of the use of Arigna coal.  If the Minister has the record of the test that was made I think he will find that the extra cost which the Department had to incur by way of subvention was considerable.  In fact, there was great expense incurred in these tests and an attempt was made to get the accounts under this service cut down.</P>

      <P>I submit I am entitled to raise on the question of the Galway-Aran steamer service the wages paid by that service; the cargo it carries, whether there has been an increase or a decrease of employment; when the vessel was surveyed, and all such matters.  There is a wide field of survey if I like to open it up.  What are we discussing but this £300 subsidy?  I do not want to take on a number of these things, but I do want to ask if there has been any pressure brought, as previously there was, upon those who were getting this subvention, to see that Arigna coal has been used, or if, in fact, the Department has yielded to the arguments brought that to continue the pressure to use Arigna coal would mean that they should <Col N="2672" /> apply for an increased subsidy to meet the increased cost of running the service. Arigna coal is not being used. Is any other type of Irish coal used and, if not, have the Department paid any special advertence to the fact that by putting on a particular type of coal they have increased the cost of this service which they are financing themselves? Do they think that that is a good thing?  This arises in relation to this service, the Galway-Aran steamer service.  The questions asked on this matter have not yet been answered. With regard to sub-head A&mdash;payment to the Great Southern Railways Company&mdash;we had a statement by the Minister, and it was a good thing to have it&mdash;that if there is any strike trouble further on the Great Southern Railway system that the Minister and the Government are going to keep clear of it; that they are not going to come to the aid of either of the parties in order to allow those parties resist the award made by the Wages Board, by granting money out of the taxpayers' pockets.  The Minister talked about the Conciliation Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  This was his answer to Deputy Coburn's cogent remark.</P>

He said that the Conciliation Department was there and that it adhered to and regretted the fact that it had to go there for that purpose but he entirely disregarded the fact that in railway disputes it is not that Conciliation Branch that deals with them.  It is the Railways Branch of the Department. The fact that the Conciliation Branch ordinarily tried to bring the parties together in industrial disputes and generally watches those things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He referred very particularly to the railway dispute.  I want to point to the fact that there is <Col N="2673" /> conciliation machinery in the Department, and that that is not ordinarily used in railway matters shows that the Department is very wise.  There is a Conciliation department which keeps clear of railway disputes.  When there is any trouble there it is the railway section of the Minister's Department which very reluctantly interferes and all that very natural reluctance indicates clearly that the point of view which Deputy Coburn holds is held by the experts of the Ministry which run this Department.  There is machinery for conciliation.  There is the Railway Awards Board and when there is a dispute either party to this type of machinery has a right to bring that dispute before it.  Disputes will be brought before the Board and an award will be made.  When an award is given there is trouble because it is found that the Minister is imposing the work of his Conciliation Board on top of the statutory Conciliation Board.  I think the Minister did recognise that there was a mistake made in that case.  There was a solemn statement by the Minister backed up by a rather weak statement of the Acting-Minister that never again would he interfere if any award given was not abided by all the parties.  He said that with great emphasis though it was backed up by the rather flabby remarks of the Acting-Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not know how it will.  There is a big principle involved in all this, and quite a lot of talk has arisen out of disputes, and as to the necessity for conciliation machinery. The Minister acknowledged the effectiveness of that machinery.  One would not like to say what would be likely to happen without the Wages Board.  It would be found, I think, that after disputes had lasted some time there would be sure to be an appeal for arbitration. But what better type can you have of an arbitration board than one consisting of representatives of the parties, as we have in this case, with a judicial chairman?  Even if you did scrap the Wages Board or if the Minister was foolish enough to think <Col N="2674" /> that a railway sub-department of the Conciliation department ordinarily used for trade disputes, could take the place of the Conciliation Board, it would not be long until he found people were not satisfied with their decision, and there would be still objection taken to the personnel.  The same kind of foolish intervention might be tried by some other departments in order to get trouble relieved.  I think what Deputy Coburn said was quite appropriate, and I regard what was said in reply as very weak.  The Board should either be scrapped, or it should be kept there.  It could, of course, be scrapped, and then the last situation would be worse than all; but if it is not scrapped it should be kept and acknowledged for the purposes for which it was established, and the Minister should keep from blundering in.  So long, of course, as the public purse is there to provide subsidies a weak Ministry could be coerced to avoid immediate trouble irrespective of the extra trouble piling up in the long distance from merely staving it off.  It was with regret that I heard the Minister in charge backing away from the phrase that the Minister for Industry and Commerce used when talking on the Supplementary Estimate when it was first introduced upon this matter.  He spoke with great vehemence, but I do not know that a great deal can be attached to the particular vehemence with which that Minister says things, because he says everything with so much vehemence, but there seemed to be some idea of stability about what he said on that occasion, and of his sticking to it. There is very little of that about the remarks we heard from the Minister who is now in charge.</P>

    <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £128,791 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir <Col N="2678" /> a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1934, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí i dtaobh Arachais Díomhaointis agus Malartán Fostuíochta, maraon le Sintiúisí do Chiste an Díomhaointis.</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £128,791 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1934, for the Salaries and Expenses in connection with Unemployment Insurance and Employment Exchanges, including Contributions to the Unemployment Fund.</P>
    <P>There is an increase under the head of salaries, wages and allowances of £8,085 occasioned by the fact that it has been found necessary to appoint additional staff in unemployment branch offices.  The functions of these officers are twofold; to carry out ordinary work in connection with unemployment insurance, and to carry out work in connection with the assignment of men on the unemployment register to unemployment relief works.  This is a somewhat new feature.  In fact, it is entirely new, and has thrown a great deal of work on the branch offices throughout the country.  Portion of the £8,085 goes to provide additional remuneration for officers, who are already in charge of these offices, and have additional duties to carry out now in connection with registration.  Another portion of the money is to provide additional staff in certain cases.  Travelling expenses show a small decrease, but incidental expenses, owing to the increased work in all these offices, are increased by £450.  Telegrams and Telephones have been reduced by £50. Umpire and Courts of Referees; salaries, etc. show an increase of £125. The number of persons in receipt of unemployment benefit, and the numbers of persons paying contributions, have increased, so I take it, that is partially responsible for the additional expenses.</P>
    <P>With regard to the contributions to the Unemployment Fund there is an <Col N="2679" /> increase of £8,000.  The position is, as the House knows, that three-sevenths of the total contributions paid into the Fund by both employers and employees is paid by the State.  As there are greater numbers of persons paying contributions, so the State has to pay an increased amount.  Payments to associations reveal a small decrease.  Advances to work-people for fares shows an increase of £25.  The appropriations-in-aid amount to £158,570, showing an increase of £5,445. Roughly one-fifth of the gross income of the fund is made available to pay overhead expenses and administration expenses generally.  It amounts to £158,570.  This amount, which is payable from the Unemployment Fund, covers, virtually, the whole of the expenses of Unemployment Insurance.</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce is at present examining the question, as to what further relief in the way of unemployment assistance might be granted, and the details of the scheme are being worked out on that basis.  Deputies will remember that in the Budget statement the Minister for Finance allocated £450,000 for this scheme.  The matter is under consideration, and it is hoped that in the Autumn Session the Department will be in a position to put legislative proposals forward to have this scheme enforced for the coming year.  It is anticipated that there will be a weekly rate of assistance according to means, according to the family circumstances of the individual, and according to age and condition.  It is a weekly rate&mdash;I do not know if I could call it, subsistence or perhaps, maintenance.  I think it will be called unemployment assistance, so that a weekly amount will be payable.  It is estimated that at least 50,000 able-bodied persons will be brought in under the scheme.  It is intended that persons who are in employment, or in receipt of the ordinary unemployment benefit will not come in under it.  It will be devised to cover cases of persons who either have the unemployment benefit exhausted, or are not entitled to benefit. <Col N="2680" /> It is estimated that there are, at least, 50,000 such persons in the country.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the pronouncement made by the Minister, as to the intentions of the Government, so far as they propose to provide additional assistance out of taxation for the relief of the unemployed.  I take it that the measure, which has been referred to so briefly, is one to provide home assistance out of taxation, instead of leaving that responsibility, as it has been left in the past, on the local rate-paying community.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose, and I do not suppose I would be allowed to discuss the proposals referred to by the Acting-Minister now, because it would be anticipating legislation.  It is extremely difficult, with the very limited information given by the Acting-Minister, to go into the question in any great detail.  I will say this to the Acting-Minister, that I do not think there is any section of the House but would be prepared, if necessary, to sit specially before the Autumn Session for the purpose of passing a measure which affects such a large section of the community, apart from the dependents of the 50,000 able-bodied people who will be provided for.  Is there any justification whatever for postponing the necessary legislation to the Autumn Session?  Is it not possible for the Government to set aside some of their many draftsmen to prepare the measure, so that it could be passed before the House adjourns&mdash;if we adjourn at all&mdash;before the summer holidays? I would like to hear, if any <Col N="2681" /> section of the House would raise any objection to prolonging the sittings or, if necessary, coming back specially to enable such a measure to pass in order that those without relief to-day may be provided with relief as soon as possible. The Government have long since accepted the policy of providing work or providing maintenance for those for whom they are unable to provide work. As they have now decided upon a policy of introducing legislation to provide assistance out of the Central Fund, it should not take very long to implement the policy already decided upon in connection with that very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past couple of months, Deputies on these benches have raised the question of the failure of this Department to insist upon the stamping of unemployment insurance cards in the case of those employed on minor relief works and arterial drainage schemes.  I do not see why a Government which compels, by legislation, an employer or an industrial concern to stamp the cards of employees so as to make provision for insurance benefit when out of work should not apply the same policy to those employed as the result of the giving of Government grants to local authorities or those employed on arterial drainage or minor relief works.  No excuse the Minister could give could relieve the Government of responsibility for failing to insist upon the stamping of unemployment insurance cards in the cases I have referred to.  I hope the Acting-Minister will see that arrangements will be made so that the cards of those engaged on arterial drainage works and those who will be employed on minor relief works, now about to start, will be stamped without any more quibbling or excuses.  Hundreds of men are employed in my constituency and on the border of it on the Barrow drainage and arterial drainage schemes and you, A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, have raised in the House on several occasions the question of the failure of the Government to stamp the cards of those employed on the Fergus drainage scheme in County Clare.  I am not making any particular reference to that because those employed <Col N="2682" /> on similar schemes in other parts of the country are in the same position. It is the duty of the Government to see that proper provision is made for these people, when the work ceases, by insisting on the stamping of unemployment insurance cards.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a matter which was under the consideration of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were in office.  I refer to the necessity for the introduction of a system of classification of, and payment of proper rates of salary to, those employed as exchange managers throughout the country.  It is ridiculous that a man engaged as manager of a labour exchange should be regarded as a part-time employee.  On a recent occasion, as the result of representations made to me&mdash;I have been looking into the matter with Deputies representing the Fianna Fáil and Cumann na nGaedheal Parties for a couple of years&mdash;I asked an exchange manager, in whose area I happened to be, to show me the nature of the work he was called upon to perform.  This man had repeatedly insisted that his work was full-time. I can claim to have some knowledge, as a result of 25 years' experience in the clerical world, of what constitutes part-time and whole-time work and some appreciation of the value that should be placed upon different classes of clerical work.  I want to state emphatically, from any limited knowledge I have of this matter, that employment exchange managers are, and should be regarded as, full-time employees. There should be some system of classification introduced which would enable these men to be paid for the work they are called upon to perform. During the past three or four years, the work has considerably increased and that is an additional reason for looking into the matter more sympathetically than it might have been regarded by the Minister's predecessor.  I should like to hear what Deputy McGilligan has to say as a result of his long experience in dealing with men of this kind and whether he agrees that the work which these men are called upon to perform to-day is whole-time work and should be paid <Col N="2683" /> for accordingly.  I do not suggest that an exchange manager in Cork or in a big provincial town with a population of 5,000 or over, should be in the same class or should be paid the same salary as an exchange manager operating in a rural area with half the population. It should be quite possible to introduce a classification system with from one to five or more classes which would enable these people to be treated as whole-time employees and to be paid for the work which they are performing, which calls for their attention for eight hours or more per day.  I presume the Acting-Minister has not had an opportunity of looking into this matter, but I hope he will make representations, when he gets the opportunity, to the Minister responsible for the conditions under which these people are employed.  Within a reasonable time, I hope a system of classification and of payment will be introduced which will be fairer to the people called upon to perform this work than is the system in operation to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was rather unusual procedure.  The Minister gave us what I might call a half-Second-Reading speech on a Bill which we have not yet seen.  Two very interesting facts have emerged even from the short statement the Minister made.  One is that it is now admitted there are at least 50,000 unemployed who are not covered by the labour exchanges or entitled to unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it can be said that none of the 50,000 will be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement was: &ldquo;None of those to be <Col N="2684" /> covered under the new Bill, which will be designed to meet 50,000, will be entitled to unemployment benefit.&rdquo; That was the statement made by the Minister.  I am inclined to agree with the Minister that he is not far out when he puts the figure at 50,000.  It is interesting to have that very clear statement from the Minister.  The other interesting point that emerged was that part of the cost of the scheme &mdash;whether a large or a small part, we do not know&mdash;is to be borne by the local authorities on top of what they have to bear under statute in providing outdoor relief.  The Minister implied that this Bill was being introduced to give effect to a motion which was passed by this House on the 26th June, 1932.  That was a motion placing responsibility for the provision of work or maintenance upon the Government. I suggest to the Minister and to Deputy Davin as a member of the Labour Party that it is about time the Government thought of giving effect, even in part to that motion.  Deputy Davin knows as well as if not better than most members of the Dáil that the £450,000 mentioned by the Minister is not going to give effect to that motion and could not possibly do so. I want to join with Deputy Davin in asking the Minister to tell us when the Bill is going to be introduced and put through the House and whether it is going to be in operation before the winter.  We are entitled to know that. At the moment I do not want to say any more about that particular measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Acting-Minister referred to the increase of £8,085 for salaries, wages and allowances, and he said that this increase was due, very largely, to the new scheme of placing men.  I raised that matter upon Vote 56, the Minister's own Department, but for some reason or other&mdash;I am not going to say it was because he wanted to avoid having to reply to all the points made&mdash;the Acting-Minister moved the closure and we had not an opportunity of learning what he thought of the points raised, or hearing any reply from him on the Vote generally, if he had any reply to make.  Let us hope the closure will <Col N="2685" /> not be moved on this Vote, because we are very anxious to hear the Minister's point of view on this matter.  I want to know from the Minister, or from any other member of the House who has any experience of the new scheme of placing men through the branch managers of the labour exchanges, whether it is worth the £8,000 to £10,000 extra that it is costing this Department.  I say most emphatically that it is not.</P>
    <P>I want to hear from the Minister how much of the extra £8,000 has been incurred by branch managers and other officials of employment exchanges having to carry out a very definite order, laying it down that no man with a pension of 15/- a week, or over that amount, can get employment so long as there is an unemployed man on the list who is not in receipt of a pension.  Of course, that means that such a man will never get employment.  I suggest it is a scandal to have thousands of British ex-servicemen with large families, four, five, six, eight and sometimes ten in number, compelled by the Minister's order to endeavour to exist upon 15/- or 16/- a week.  I hope the Minister will tell us how much of the £8,000 has been incurred by branch managers having to take all these extra precautions so as to see that those particular people do not get employment.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which should have been touched by the Minister in connection with this Vote, in view of the very large amount which the State has to contribute.  I know, of course, the Minister may say to me that the greater the compliance the larger the amount, but I would like to hear from him whether the Department is satisfied with the general compliance throughout the country under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  Is he satisfied that the compliance this year is greater than the compliance last year?  Can he give us an idea whether 70, 75 or 90 per cent. of the employers and employees are meeting their obligations under these Acts?  I have my doubts about it.  Possibly he will tell <Col N="2686" /> us whether any steps over and above those which have been taken for the last couple of years have been taken this year.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important point of all is as to what effect casualisation of labour, as sponsored by the present Government, is going to have on the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  I think the Minister will agree, although it is hardly fair to expect him to be conversant with all the details of this Department, of which he is merely the Acting-Minister, that it will have a very big effect on the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  Has he been informed by the Department as to what effect it will have?  Will he tell us what effect upon this Fund will the action of the Wexford County Council, as announced during the week, have, and if the action taken by the Wexford County Council is going to spread through the country, what will be the effect of it on the Unemployment Insurance Fund and upon the characters of the workers of this country?</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House, if not the Minister, that the basic principle of this Fund, and of all insurance, is that those who are in employment pay for those who are not in employment.  The same thing applies to national health insurance; that is the whole basis of it.  Those who are well, and in good health, pay for those not in good health.  I think we ought to have some statement from the Minister regarding those points. I do not want to develop them, as I do not want to be wasting time.  I shall not give the Minister any excuse for moving the closure on this Vote, because I am anxious to hear his views and the views of the Department.</P>
    <P>I want to support the statement made by Deputy Davin with regard to the insurability of the workers employed upon relief schemes.  To say the least of it, I think it is very unfair that the Department of Industry and Commerce does not do what I conceive to be their duty and insist, as a Department, that workers employed on work which is not, and which nobody can contend is, agricultural work, that is, drainage <Col N="2687" /> schemes, should have their cards stamped.  We find that workers who have been unemployed for six or seven, or in many cases, 12 months, get three or four months work on relief schemes and are paid a very low rate of wages.  Not only is the weekly rate of wages low, but they very rarely succeed in drawing the full week's wages, even at the lower rate, because there is broken time.  At the end of three or six months work they are practically as badly off as before they get employed, except, of course, that during the time when they are employed they just get what enables them to exist.</P>
    <P>I suggest that those men, just as well as the men employed making roads, are entitled to have their cards stamped, so that at the end of their period of employment they will have something coming into their homes to enable them to carry on until they get further employment.  I do not think the cost to the State would be very great.  It certainly would not be very great when you consider what benefit it would be to those unfortunate men. We must remember that the men who usually are employed on relief schemes are those who have been the longest unemployed and are most in need of work.  I join very strongly with Deputy Davin, and other members of the Labour Party, in urging on the Minister that he ought to see, as quickly as possible, that the Department of Industry and Commerce will carry out what I conceive to be their duty in that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether anything has been done with regard to making reciprocal arrangements with the British Government on the question of migratory labourers to Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  This is a matter that has been brought up year after year.  I do not know if any progress has been made yet by the Government. It occurred to me that possibly during the World Economic Conference our delegates might bring the matter to the attention of the delegates of the British Government with a view to <Col N="2688" /> making some arrangement whereby benefits would be paid to Free State workers who may have occasion to work in England and who subsequently come back to the Free State and find that they are not entitled to any unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>I referred briefly on Vote 56 to the question of the stoppage of unemployment benefit to the workers of the Great Northern Railway on the occasion of the last strike.  The Leas-Chean Comhairle informed me that I could debate the point on this Vote. The Acting-Minister may be aware that on that occasion 500 or 600 men were idle as a result of a stoppage of work by the traffic department of the Great Northern Railway.  I think the period lasted nine or ten weeks.  The matter was discussed from every angle, and ultimately it was left to the umpire to decide.  He gave his decision on the 24th April last, stating that those men were not entitled to unemployment benefit.  On the 4th May I put down a question to the Minister, asking him if he was prepared to introduce amending legislation to the Unemployment Insurance Acts with a view to having this grievance removed.  The Minister on that occasion stated that he was not prepared to do so.  I think that in dealing with the decision of the umpire&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting to the Minister to introduce legislation <Col N="2689" /> immediately, but I think that under the sub-head dealing with the salaries of the Umpire and Courts of Referees I was within my rights in referring to a question which is affecting five or six hundred men.  The Umpire on that occasion decided&mdash;legally, I suppose he was right&mdash;that those men were not entitled to unemployment benefit, I hold, from the commonsense point of view, that they were.  It is with a view to removing this grievance that I am bringing the matter before the Acting-Minister. Section 8 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, is as follows:</P>
      <P>(1) An insured contributor who has lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute at the factory, workshop, or other premises at which he was employed, shall be disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit so long as the stoppage of work continues, except in a case where he has, during the stoppage of work, become bona fide employed elsewhere in the occupation which he usually follows or has become regularly engaged in some other occupation.</P>
      <P>Where separate branches of work which are commonly carried on as separate businesses in separate premises are in any case carried on in separate departments on the same premises, each of those departments shall, for the purpose of this provision, be deemed to be a separate factory or workshop or separate premises, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The men contended on that occasion that they carried on their work in separate premises and as separate businesses.  The umpire decided on the interpretation, as far as I can remember, of the word &ldquo;commonly.&rdquo;  He contended that the work of building and repairing the engines was &ldquo;commonly carried on&rdquo; at the Great Northern Railway Works in Dundalk, and that as a result those men were not entitled to unemployment benefit. My suggestion to the Minister is that he should give this matter his attention as was done in Great Britain, when in 1924 there was an amendment to the section which I have just quoted. Section 4 (1) of the 1924 Act is as follows: &ldquo;Subsection (1) of Section 8 <Col N="2690" /> of the Principal Act (which imposes a disqualification for the receipt of benefit during a stoppage of work)&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I will rest content with having referred to the matter. I am sure the Minister understands and appreciates the seriousness of this decision of the umpire.  I did put down a question to the Minister on this matter, but on the afternoon that he answered it he seemed to be in a bad temper and suggested that I should raise the question on the adjournment. Out of charity, seeing that he was very tired, I did not go on with it that evening.  I reserved it for this occasion <Col N="2693" /> to bring it before the House.  As regards the general question of unemployment and of registration, and in regard to the fact that there has been an increase in the Estimate of well over £80,000, I quite appreciate the reasons for this increase.  Staffs have been considerably increased of late as the result of various innovations introduced by the Minister, by way of placing men.  I am not going to offer very much criticism on that, knowing as I do the difficulties which confront the Minister and the Government at the moment.</P>
      <P>There seems to be some confusion as to whether county surveyors have a discretion in the matter of employment at all under the various schemes. My information is that they have very little discretion, although the Minister stated here on a previous vote that they had every discretion.  Some county surveyors are wise enough to carry out, in every detail, the official instructions issued by the Department. There may be others, perhaps, who use their own discretion at times.  I know that in the majority of cases the county surveyors are compelled to take on the men who are sent to them by the labour exchanges, and I do not think there is a great deal wrong with that.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce was very explicit about that at the time: that all men were to be employed through the labour exchanges.  I agree there is a good deal in what he stated on that occasion, that when all men were employed through the labour exchanges it could not be argued that there was local interest used to get particular men jobs.  I think that while the position of the employed is far from satisfactory on the whole, the arrangements made by the Minister are, in my opinion, working very smoothly, especially in regard to the schemes carried out in the rural parts. That is all I have to say.  I am sorry that there is no prospect of getting that Act of 1924, to which I referred, passed.</P>

      <P>We had the peculiar position to-night of the Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="2694" /> blundering in to give away all the things that the Party have so far kept hidden: the sort of character that one meets with in a picture house, a sort of small boy who knocks over the cups, loses the family mortgage and generally gets cuffed around the place for being in the way.  That seems to be the role for which the Acting-Minister has been cast for the last couple of days.  What has come of all the talk about the factories that were going to be established, of all the people that were going to be employed, of the vast provision in the way of relief with security for everybody, continuous and well-paid employment, a better standard of living, better houses, better food and better clothes? Does the Minister remember all these things?  Then the scales dropped from the people's eyes.  They are told now that in the autumn we are going to have a new Bill making provision for £450,000.  Why?  Because there are 50,000 able-bodied men destitute, despite all the factories, all the new tillage and all the provision by way of coal, peat and everything else, all the grand cement factories and so on. In spite of all that, we are to look forward to a Bill in the autumn that will make provision for 50,000 able-bodied men destitute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not what the Deputy, who always interrupts and cannot make a speech, poor dumb chap, envisaged at the time he was going for election.  At the time of election we were to have all these things: continuous well-paid employment, better food, better clothing and security for everybody.  The farmers were to get a rise in cattle prices, and to have less rents, rates and taxes to pay.  Let us see what they are getting under the Minister's promise. The local authorities are going to have to subscribe to this £450,000 and individuals, we do not know who the individuals are, are going to have to subscribe, too.  That is the end to all the rosy promises about factories.  I suppose every county was supposed to have at least one factory corresponding <Col N="2695" /> to the Naas sausage one, and yet, when the autumn comes, the best the Ministry can visualise is 50,000 able-bodied men destitute.  No wonder the talkative fellow is silent. That is a bit of a blow to him.  The election posters did not carry anything of that.  The farmers were promised the same reliefs as before. Then we had £448,000 deducted this year from the grants that go to the relief of farmers.  £450,000 was going to be given to them, but now we find that they are going to be made pay for getting that.  The necessity for that is because there are 50,000 people who will not, according to the Minister's statement, be in receipt of unemployment insurance.  Mind you, not people who will not be in work. Some of those who will not be in work will be protected with unemployment insurance, but apart from them you will have this mass of people cluttering up the towns.  You will have that, despite all the magnificent factories that the Fianna Fáil imagination so readily rose to: despite unemployment insurance, relief provision and the five million corporation that is to be established to put industry on its feet.  Despite all that, this autumn we are going to require £450,000 to deal with a mass of people, estimated to be not less than 50,000 able-bodied men, destitute.  That is the picture that should be in the election posters. I gave earlier to-day the figure of what was promised: 86,000 people in a few industries to produce goods that we are capable of manufacturing ourselves coming in at the date that the advertisement was issued&mdash;86,000 people, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;the real Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;felt that progress had been made far beyond his expectations and that the only reason why certain industries were held up was that they were industries in which skilled workers could not be got.  Everybody in the House knows that is rubbish.  That was the second blundering achievement of the Acting-Minister in which he gave away so much on his colleague.  He has been badly served, and the real Minister <Col N="2696" /> has been somewhat badly served also. In the provision under the statute for the relief of unemployment, when the contributory scheme is built up on the men's own wages, on deductions from the employers who employ them and on the State contribution, the Minister thinks this is the proper moment to throw into the debate the grave news that, after all the terrific achievement and as a result of all the magnificent promises, there are 50,000 people in this country who, but for this provision, would face the autumn without any help either from relief scheme employment or unemployment insurance.</P>
      <P>I wonder how far is even this sum of £450,000 going to carry the people. The Minister for Finance and the President both calculated that a £250,000 relief scheme which was proposed one Christmas would provide about a fortnight's employment around Christmas.  Let us double that amount &mdash;and this is not £500,000&mdash;and it will provide four weeks' employment according to their calculation.  That is what the 50,000 able-bodied destitute are going to have provided for them against the Autumn.  Does the Minister feel that there is going to be a terrific new outburst of factories&mdash; more castles in Spain like the others&mdash; which will carry off these 50,000 able-bodied destitute through the Autumn? We have got at last to the dole.  That is what it comes to&mdash;the dole.  The best efforts of the Ministry to find work for the unemployed, to get new markets for our produce, to develop the home market, to get invested money called home and to get nationals governing the industries in the country, and all the rest of it, end up now towards the end of July in the announcement that the dole is coming in the Autumn of this year, and that it must come, because there are going to be 50,000 able-bodied men destitute at that time. That is a hard fact.  Just look at the figures which the Minister gave, about all the people who had gone out of employment, when his colleague had boasted of the greater employment provided.  That was the preamble to a discussion on the Unemployment Insurance Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2697" /> Another hard fact sticks out from this.  During the course of a debate this year I asked a question&mdash;probably it was the only question I asked that night, because there was a very hectic row going on between the members of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance about the 24/- a week wage.  The question I asked was: How much of the money that was being spent in these minor relief schemes was being spent on occupations which would be regarded as insurable occupations?  I was told, in answer, that it was about 50-50.  Let us consider then, not the minor relief schemes, which are mainly Land Commission schemes and, being chiefly agricultural, might have a bigger percentage of non-insurable work.  Let us think of schemes of another kind, and there is extra employment of an insurable type given in transitory relief schemes.  There is a real solid test with regard to that. Take the State contribution to the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  There is a real solid test of the extra employment given in the country in insurable occupations, and that is by the sale of unemployment insurance stamps.  By that means you can even get down to hours worked if sufficient trouble is taken.  Over and above the contribution of £8,000 that was made last year there is a very simple sum to be done to find out what extra employment that £8,000 extra contribution means. That is the really good test, not of the actual amount of increased employment, but of the Minister's optimistic estimate of increased employment, and it is represented by the £8,000 for last year.  It must be remembered that we were always promised employment in industry.  It was not employment in relief schemes.  It was not casual or passing employment, but employment in industry.  We have got employment in relief schemes to a certain extent. How much of the £8,000, or of the employment represented by that sum, is absorbed by the relief schemes?  The Minister ought to be able to make that calculation.  Certainly, his Department can make it for him, and we can be told what extra number of men that £8,000 contribution represents.  We <Col N="2698" /> can then find out and get a decision as to how many men were employed permanently in new industries in the country.  From my memory of how that equation runs, and remembering the relief schemes that were provided, and taking it that only 50 per cent. were in insurable occupations, it means a decrease in industrial employment in the country foreshadowed for this year over that of last year.  The Minister has it in his hands to make the calculation and he should give it to the House.  That is the real test of the employment that has been given or of the estimated employment that is likely to be given next year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to another point, and it is an important matter in relation to this Vote.  He stated&mdash; and, of course, it is beyond denial&mdash; that in any of these insurance schemes the good lives support the bad lives. Certain people have been paying contributions to an unemployment fund for very many years and have never drawn a sixpence from it nor are they likely to draw sixpence from it.  Of course, they will get a refund of something when they reach a particular age; but the money that has been accumulated from their contributions bears a certain amount of interest or would bear a certain amount of interest in ordinary circumstances; and the contributions from the employer for those people over many years and the contributions from the State, equivalent to those contributions, remain in the fund.  In that way payments can be made to bad lives, to people who are going in and out of employment rather constantly and sometimes are more often out of employment than in it.  These people can get payments made to them on foot of the small contributions made by themselves.  We have now got a hint of a new system from two places. First of all, the Government decided to casualise labour.  Firms in receipt of moneys voted by this House have been asked to discharge men who were in their employment for many years&mdash;&mdash;the good lives&mdash;and take in men who were out of employment.  If that scheme is put into operation it means that some of these people may deplete the resources of the fund.  Those men, <Col N="2699" /> when they go out of the employment in which they have been over a long period, will have to draw from the fund and, when they do so&mdash;those people who ordinarily never drew anything from the fund&mdash;it means that there is a bigger leakage and the fund goes down.</P>
    <P>One local authority&mdash;Wexford&mdash;recently stated that, following the Government's example, they were going to adopt much the same programme, with a bit of a difference.  Their activities, if copied by other people, will aggravate the trouble which I think the Government are going to cause in the actuarial balancing of that fund.  If Wexford is followed by other counties, it means that certain people who were in occupation and contributing to the fund, and had local authorities and the State contributing for them in the ordinary way, instead of representing, as they have done for years, nothing but income to the fund will begin to represent an expenditure.  So that you get a greater leakage, which will be more and more in excess of the normal, if the local authorities decide to follow what Wexford is doing.  In the end, if the number of bad lives, so to speak, is multiplied, and the number of good lives decreases, there is only one result: that the fund will go bankrupt or, alternatively, the contributions to be made by everybody will have to go up and there will be only the same amount of insurance. That is probably a point that was not very fully considered when this decision was taken to put people out of employment and to let in other people who were not getting employment, even under the tremendous development, industrially and agriculturally, that we have been suffering under for the last 18 months.  It must be taken into consideration now, and this Vote might be rehandled.  When I see no movement towards increasing the deductions to be made from the wages and from the employers, with an extra subvention from the State; when I do not hear any announcement, because an announcement would be made if that were in prospect, and as we have no announcement that the <Col N="2700" /> fund is becoming more and more in debt, I take it to mean that this policy of casualising labour has been dropped to a certain extent.  If the example of Wexford is followed by other counties, even though the Government drop the system of casualising labour, and it is taken on by other councils it will certainly result in bringing this unemployment fund to a very parlous state indeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin has spoken of the branch managers and has attracted attention, by his comments on them, to the fact that the numbers have risen. The numbers in the Employment Branch Out Stations Offices have risen by 40 from a total of 256; the temporary clerks, I suppose attached to these out stations, have risen from 91 to 136; and the remuneration paid to branch managers has gone up from £13,600 to £18,000.  The Minister stated that the increase was partly due to an increase in the personnel and also to an increase in the emoluments paid. Will he give a division?  Will he tell us how much of the increase of almost £8,000 was due to new personnel and how much to increase of salaries, and what is the necessity for the increase in the personnel?  It certainly is not in getting men into work.  If it were, we would not have the pessimism about the 50,000 able-bodied destitute.  Is it just some idea of being a bit lax with the people's money again and increasing emoluments or finding jobs, at any rate, in the out-stations in the guise of unemployment officers for people who cannot get employment at all and who certainly are not getting it in industry and agriculture?  Has the Minister considered the point put up by Deputy Davin?  Does he consider these branch managers are doing a full day's work in the main for a half or a quarter day's pay?  If so, will he tell us has he even, in this new personnel, changed the system, because the system undoubtedly used to be to employ men who were in part-time occupation already.  The necessity was to get a man with some clerical experience and you generally got that from a man who occupied some post which required clerical training which, being lowly paid, and not entailing many <Col N="2701" /> hours work, left the man a certain amount of leisure to take up other work. I wonder has that system been changed. If it has not, then I do not think the Minister will find it very easy to answer Deputy Davin when he makes the general complaint that branch managers, on the whole, are being paid a half or a quarter day's pay when they are doing a full day's work.  Undoubtedly they were not doing that before.  There was a calculation made at one time as to the number of hours worked which certain activities of employment officers entailed and the payment was based thereafter on the work done as measured in hours of occupation.  Unless there has been a change made, I cannot consider why, in these days of cuts on everybody else, it is thought necessary to increase the number employed in these exchanges and also to increase their pay.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister would, since he opened the matter at all, just venture a little bit further, at the risk of another eye-opener to the populace, and tell us who are the individuals from whom he is going to demand contributions for this able-bodied destitute fund, and what local authorities he has in mind. Has he any idea of the scale of contribution as between the State, the local authorities, and whatever individuals he has been referring to? It is only then that the country will be able to get some idea of what is ahead of it, and the local authorities some idea of the new bit of ringing the changes that is being done on them. Moneys in relief of agricultural rates used to be granted.  These were increased.  A further big increase was promised by the present Government. This year they reduced the amount. Then, when the clamour got too much for them, they crawled a bit, and told us that there was to be a subvention of £450,000 in relief of the ratepayers to meet these destitute people.  This lasted for a month or two, and now we are told that the £450,000 will come in any case as, of course, it has to be paid, because there are the 50,000 to be attended to.  But there is going to be a contribution asked.  Some has to come from individuals, and some from the local authorities.  It would be <Col N="2702" /> interesting to know how much.  It would be a good thing, if they have to face up to a new demand, that they should know it as soon as possible, so that they may be enabled to reconstruct whatever programme they have, if even that is possible at this time, instead of having the same procedure adopted that was adopted at the time of the cutting down of the grant&mdash;a kind of decoying them into making a programme and then changing and determining that the grant was to be reduced, and so necessitating an increase in the rates.  This is an interesting side development.  The Vote itself and the small contribution also from the Government to the unemployment fund shows how hollow is all the talk about the increased employment to be given, or given.  This Vote is a complete revelation of the absolute breakdown of these last promises made by Fianna Fáil both in relation to industry and agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has been very properly emphasised that the increased Vote in the case of the administration of this Department, and the increased contribution necessary for the unemployment fund, speak very eloquently of the great failure of the Government to meet the unemployment problem. There is a serious increase in the contribution to the unemployment fund of £8,000, while there is an increase in salaries, wages and allowances of £8,085.  That latter sum is accounted for to a great extent by the employment of an increased number of temporary clerks and, possibly because of the increased remuneration, of branch managers.  In connection with this matter of the employment of clerks, I regret that there has been shown a very decided political discrimination in the appointment of such clerks and in the appointment of branch managers, also, whenever vacancies arose.  There has been, furthermore, a graver scandal still, in that the chairmen of courts of referees in particular instances have been dismissed from their positions without any reason in the world being assigned, but simply to make room for men of very strong Fianna Fáil proclivities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2703" /> Deputy Coburn has raised an important point with regard to the insurance of migratory labourers.  A similar condition would apply in the case of seamen, in whom I am very much interested, who have to seek employment on British ships.  I am not going to suggest for a moment that amending legislation is necessary to bring these men into benefit in unemployment insurance, but I think that a little mutual understanding between the authorities here and the authorities in charge of the administration of this Act across the water would make for a very satisfactory settlement in this regard.  I would suggest to the Minister that this might be considered and could be carried into effect without any amending legislation.  I should like, furthermore, to refer to the case where a man has been paying unemployment insurance for a considerable time and reaches the age of 70 years. At that age, perhaps, he loses his employment, but when he registers at the exchange he does not get benefit. He is referred back to a court of referees and invariably the answer this man eventually gets is: &ldquo;You are not going to get any benefit; you are not going to get the out-of-work dole. You will get nothing back out of the contributions you have been paying for years.  That money all goes dead. You can go and apply for the old age pension.&rdquo;  I think that is very wrong. I think that a man who has paid his contributions for years, and who has drawn no benefit, should be certainly entitled to some refund of portion of the money he has paid.</P>

I do not stand over the advertisements that the Deputy read out but I say this for them, that they were based on a rough survey of the amount of foreign material that was being brought into this country and a rough examination of the amount of employment that might be given at whatever period all these imports would have been done away with and we would be producing all our requirements ourselves.</P>

      <P>Therefore, the figures read out to-day must be considered in conjunction with a scheme which presupposes that practically everything that could, with reasonable economy, be produced in this country, would be produced, and that every unnecessary import would be cut out.  Under these circumstances the Deputy has a right to criticise the figures!  These figures which were read out are a rough estimate of the amount of employment that could be given as a final figure, when every single import we can cut out had been cut out and when every single commodity we can produce here ourselves was being produced.  The amount of unemployment that would be ultimately achieved under that condition of affairs should not be taken as a criterion of the amount of employment which this Government should have provided during the last 12 or 18 months.  The Deputy also forgets, as was pointed out to him by my friend Deputy O'Reilly, that a great many of the factories which were either closed down or working half-time, woollen factories and flour mills, are now working full time and that does not appear in the figures published.</P>

      <P>We do not claim that by a system of protection for the industries of the country we are going to solve unemployment in a year or two, or even three years.  I always realised that unless there was development of industry connected with work on the soil and with the agricultural economy of the country that you could not, and would not, solve the unemployment question.  The Government realise that and it is for that reason that they are concentrating on this problem and hope in the near future to put forward other definite proposals such as the wheat scheme, the beet scheme, industrial alcohol and cement. As regards the mineral resources of the country the Deputy was for years in office and would not spend even £100 on a mineral survey where people who owned mineral rights held they were worth something.  Day by day, and year by year, the Deputy was asked in this House to spend a couple of hundred pounds on mineral exploration and would not do so.  Yet he has the temerity to criticise us because after 18 months we are not able to show a revolution in our economic affairs, or able to deal with the whole question of unemployment.  We are taking steps, and we have been pressing upon the local authorities since the day we came into office, to buy and consume Irish fuel solely, and we intend to take further steps to develop our mineral resources in that respect.  But it takes time, and if the Government is to spend five days a week listening to the kind of piffle that we heard from Deputy McGilligan to-day it cannot be done. When one realises that that man has been for years in office and that to-day he spent an hour talking about a wretched sausage factory down in Naas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

And when there <Col N="2707" /> is a constructive proposal put up, they go out of their way to tear such proposal to pieces and to prove to the country that there is nothing in it. That is the intelligent Opposition we have&mdash;the scissors and paste Party. These are the people who taunt us with the promises we made to the country. We told the country that we were going to solve unemployment.  But we are going to fulfil our promise to provide schemes for the maintenance of the unemployed.  Those schemes are not going to be perfect schemes.  They are directly the opposite of the philosophy of the Deputy who told the people when in office that he had no concern with unemployment, that it was none of his business.</P>
      <P>The Deputy was bound to introduce the personal references to people who are not able to answer him in this House.  But these people at any rate can prove that they did something for the country.  Though there is a great cry for industrial revival through the country, yet, during the whole of this debate to-day the Deputies on the opposite benches did not make a single constructive suggestion for dealing with industrial problems and with unemployment, nor did a man of them come forward and say: &ldquo;We realise the task the Government has before them.&rdquo; Their leader has repeated it over and over again in the past few days.  He said the world is in a dreadful way, but outside of him is there a single indication on the part of those on the opposite benches that they have the least wish to co-operate in this problem?  This is the intelligent Opposition that is crying out for its holidays, and when it does not get its holidays, wastes our time telling us about the Naas factory.

      <P>The Deputy referred at length to the failure of the Government to deal with the unemployment question and said that the provisions introduced by the Government showed that we had not dealt with that problem. Again he introduced references to the lack of information as he puts it, or to the lack of result of the Government's policy in that connection.  However, I do not intend to go further into that point.  I want to say with regard to the 50,000 able-bodied men that I have mentioned, that the live register on the 3rd July showed the number estimated at something like 59,000.  In spite of the fact that that in the first place can be explained away as seasonal variations and that the figures improve during the March to September period, and also that it might be partly explained by the fact that numbers of people who registered last year were no longer registered, the fact is that you have there a definite figure which at the present time can be regarded as a fairly reasonable figure as showing the extent of unemployment. And I am informed by the officers in charge of that branch of our work that it has been found on investigation that a considerable number, <Col N="2709" /> perhaps 50 per cent. or even more than 50 per cent. in the turnover of registered unemployed, is experienced. That is to say that at least 50 per cent. of the persons on the register, and sometimes up to 80 per cent. find employment from time to time.  So that when you look at the figure of 59,000, which is the present figure, or the figure of 100,000 which it was last Christmas, that figure does not represent the real core of the unemployment problem.  I say that because the actual number of persons who have not succeeded in finding employment at all would be very much smaller and would not be more than 25 per cent. or 30 per cent. of the total.  That is what is called the hard core of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made a great deal out of the fact that the contributions to the fund so far as the employers and employees are concerned had only increased by £8,000.  On the other hand, the Deputy wants to know why it is that persons employed on minor relief schemes did not get cards and are not brought within the provisions of the scheme.  The Deputy knows very well that that figure of £8,000 represents increased employment and does not, in fact, as he alleges, include people who are employed on minor relief schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that fifty per cent. of the work given out on relief schemes came under the heading of insurable occupations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason that those engaged on these minor relief schemes were not regarded as in insurable occupations was that the rate of wages fixed was at a rather low figure and it was thought that the contribution should not be placed upon them.  The whole matter is under investigation at the present time.  It was the practice in the past that persons employed on minor relief schemes were not insurable but it is hoped that a position will be reached in the near <Col N="2710" /> future where the practice will be changed.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made to the additional staff required, but I understand that the additional £8,000 represented the additional branch managers in charge of branch employment offices. That is how the amount is mainly made up.  A small proportion of it went towards the increase of a staff of 45 clerks and two officers.  The position, as Deputies will understand, was that up to last year only persons entitled to unemployment benefit registered.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce asked unemployed persons generally to register, and registration went on at a great pace, and the numbers increased largely. Those branch managers, who were only part-time officials, were not able to cope with the work, and had, in some cases to employ extra clerical assistance. This work, as anyone will realise, requires a great deal of clerical labour.  Deputy Davin referred to the necessity of putting those employees on a classification basis. I am not fully conversant with the question but I shall call the attention of the Minister to the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey asked me to deal with the question of the present scheme for preference in regard to persons seeking employment at unemployment relief works.  The Deputy, like some other Deputy, suggested that the Government were in some way responsible for something that has been done by Wexford County Council.  The Government has no responsibility in that matter, and as far as the Department of Industry and Commerce are concerned, they disagree very much with the policy carried out.  So far as we are concerned, there is no intention whatever of implementing this principle of the rotation of labour or the casualising of labour, but where the council put that in force it is the business of the council and the council has the responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey asked me to refer to the question of preference.  The position in regard to a circular issued on the 31st March is, that so far as the work of maintaining the main road is concerned, for example, or improvement <Col N="2711" /> works, men in the employment of the local authorities, and executing the work described, who become unemployed, may be included in the same capacity without reference to the officer.  That is to say, that the ordinary labourer can be taken on without any reference to the particular conditions laid down by the Department. As regards work by contractors to the Government, Department contractors are fully entitled and have full permission to choose such labour as they think best.  Deputy Morrissey referred to the fact that there seemed to be something unfair being done as far as a class of persons who were considered pensioners are concerned.  I would remind the Deputy that when Cumann na nGaedheal was in office ex-British soldiers could get no employment, ex-National Army men were the only persons who would be considered and when that condition was asked, the logical conclusion generally meant that there was no work for anybody else in the community and the ex-British soldier was subjected to the same process as anybody else.  It was solely a matter of family interest.</P>
    <P>The consideration as to pensions is that where a man gets 15/- a week or more he is to be put into the category, which will only receive attention after less-fortunately circumstanced people are first attended to.  In that connection, as I pointed out before, there is always the over-riding consideration that the county surveyor when any particular order of preference is put to him can always pick and choose to a certain extent and exercise his own discretion. He is not compelled to take men that he would consider definitely unsuitable to do the work he wants done. Therefore, as far as we are concerned, I think it is quite plain that the only conditions we have to put in are that people who require assistance and are in the worst circumstances must and should receive first claim.  They will be attended to first on the list that comes out from the branch offices. That does not necessarily mean that they will get first preference from the county surveyor or contractor or whoever else may be in charge of the work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2712" /> Deputy Coburn knows, I think now, that this matter of providing unemployment benefit for persons in a strike or trade dispute is rather a complicated matter.  I promised to call the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the question, but the matter is one that evidently bristles with difficulties.  As the Deputy succeeded in raising the question, I think I can give him that assurance.</P>

      <P>There is a considerable reduction in the amount provided for salaries, wages and allowances.  Last year the sum was £20,425.  This year the amount is £16,569, showing a decrease of £3,856.  That is the main change in the Vote.  I am informed that has arisen owing to the fact that certain vacancies were unfilled and the temporary staff that had to be engaged in this office to deal with a big rush of work in connection with patents has no longer been found necessary and has been discharged.</P>

If the Minister cannot answer that, perhaps, he could tell us what was the estimate of the reocipts?  If the temporary staff is dispensed with, <Col N="2713" /> because the rush in connection with patents was over, it seems to follow that the receipts from patents are gone down, or are likely to go down immediately.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister, then, state if there is any truth in the story current throughout the city that there is a great falling off in regard particularly to trade marks and designs because it is believed that trade marks and designs previously taken out will no longer be protected in this country? Patents I can understand falling off because there was a big accumulation of arrears of work owing to the fact that the office was not established for a year or two after the Treaty was passed and there was a gap, so far as work was concerned, but the arrears that accumulated in respect of trade marks and designs were got rid of in the first couple of years and, thereafter, the office was supposed to be running fairly steadily with annual receipts in relation to trade marks.  The question of accumulation of arrears and their working off might still have some application to patents but the office, as I say, was supposed to have been put on an absolutely secure foundation in regard to receipts for trade marks and designs.  It would be <Col N="2714" /> interesting to know if the estimate of £4,475 is lower, and, if so, by how much, than the estimate made at this time last year.</P>

      <P>At any rate, the position to be taken from this is that the estimated amount from all these sources is down by from £6,000 to £7,000, so that the saving of £4,000 in the office, mainly from salaries&mdash; £3,800, almost £4,000&mdash;has to be offset by the decreased receipts, so that, although there is an apparent saving, the office is, in fact, costing this State more in respect of the year we are in than it did last year.

It shows a decrease of £2,682 on the year, but we know from a footnote that the Governor-General's salary has not suffered any reduction, and when we turn to the items of the Vote we see that the Governor-General is still provided with some servants. The diminution in the servants granted to him is probably supposed to be equated to the diminution in the duties previously demanded from the occupant of that office.  It is, however, interesting to note that he has still got a Chaplain and he has still got a Private Secretary, and that is the entire establishment&mdash;the Governor-General, somebody to pray for him, to assist him spiritually, and a Private Secretary.  That is the establishment, but his £10,000 is still being given to him.</P>

We know that the Governor-General is not occupying, at the moment, the house that previously was occupied.  I, as an individual, have received, during the last couple of days, an invitation to a function in the grounds of the Viceregal Lodge one of these days.  Who is paying for it, I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are always entitled to compare expenditure one year with another.  That is the principle on which the discussion of Votes has gone and I am keeping to that principle.  That is an item of expenditure which formerly was met by the previous Governor-General either out of his salary or his allowances.  Who is meeting it this year?  Apparently, it is the taxpayer.  There is no diminution in the salary being paid to the Governor-General, but he is not being asked to meet the certain expenses which his predecessor had to meet out of that sum, so that the extravagant salary, about which so much used to be made, is still being continued but the same obligations do not rest upon the holder of the office.  What happens?  Who is paying? Why is this particular function being held in this establishment?  Is this establishment being kept up at the taxpayer's expense, simply because a particular function is held there once a year?  Apparently it is not a thing that would have been tolerated before.  An establishment of that kind, empty for the rest of the year, will be kept open to have one social function in it at the taxpayer's expense.  There is provision here this year for the maintenance of the official residence and establishment of the Governor-General.  One is entitled to ask, at this point, if it is right that a six months' lease of that particular house was taken, and, if so, why six months, and if any further accommodation, or any alternative accommodation has to be provided for the present Governor-General?  What was the idea in having a short lease entered into in relation to the house <Col N="2718" /> which the Governor-General now occupies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also told, in relation to this Vote, that there are amounts included in other Estimates in connection with this service.  On one Vote the amount is £500 from the Gárda Síochána. Why?  Then there are travelling expenses and subsistence allowances to officers of the household&mdash;although there is only a six months' lease of it. The officers of the household have been provided for.  What officers?  Is it the chaplain?  Is it the private secretary? Is it the police who are, apparently, being provided out of the Gárda Síochána Vote?  When we look we find there is an allowance of a certain sum of money for a motor car, but the footnote tells us that the chauffeur is provided by the Army, and is borne on the Army Vote.  Why all this mixture?  A chaplain and a secretary provided one way, the police provided from the Police Vote, and a chauffeur out of the Army Vote.  Are we trying to make the Governor-General a sort of amphibian, to be carried on as many Votes as possible, or, is it with a view of having the fact tucked away in the Estimates, that the salary was to be criticised as being paid, so far as this Estimate was concerned, and as far as the people are given any information about it, is full?  We knew the duties appertaining to the Governor-General before, and we knew the highly-efficient and creditable way in which they were carried out.  What are the present duties?  When are they carried out?  Can we have an enumeration of what is expected?  We know one thing is expected, that the Governor-General must be an absentee any time the President is about.  The spot-light must never fall on the Governor-General.  It is a big price to pay for over-shadowing the Governor-General when the President is about, to continue to charge the same salary, and very nearly the same charges for an establishment, while getting nothing, or next to nothing in return.  We might be told, at least, just what was the full repercussion of the incident at the French Minister's house on a famous occasion, <Col N="2719" /> and the repercussion that has on the present position of the Governor-General, and in what respect it has restricted his functions.</P>

The Minister for Finance, when moving the Vote, simply said: &ldquo;Here is the Estimate for the Vote; discuss it any way you please.&rdquo;  He is giving us no information.  Surely, as I said on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce, when there has been a fairly radical change made in circumstances&mdash;at least, to me it appears that only trifling changes are made&mdash;when the President has got this person, who gets between him and the limelight, a little bit out of the way, that at any rate we should get the reactions.  Are any functions now laid down for the Governor-General, or is any demand made on the present Governor-General with regard to his conduct or where he would be at certain times, when certain other people are in certain places?</P>

      <P>Is there any repercussion of that on the headgear of members of the Executive Council? That will probably arise on the President's Vote.  Seriously, I think it is necessary that the House should be given the conditions under which the present Governor-General took employment as Governor-General. That is really what this Vote represents.  A great number of people have been able to form in their own minds just what functions were set out as the functions properly to be discharged by the present occupant of the position of Governor-General, but there is a tremendous number of people who feel that very bad use, and undignified use, was made of a rather decent man, in putting him into the position he has been put.  The people who put him into that position, and who got that man to degrade himself in the way they have got him to degrade himself, have <Col N="2721" /> to make some excuse for their conduct, and they might try to justify themselves on this Vote.  It gives them the opportunity.  They should tell us, then, in detail just what promises were exacted, what pressure had to be put on the present occupant of that position before he consented to take the post and whether he himself thought the conditions imposed upon him made him not a very dignified person&mdash;I might even say, in his own estimation, not a very reputable person.

      <P>The Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking on the two Estimates which have been before us, stated as clearly as any man could state that the election propaganda by the President and his Party was in the nature of sharp practice, that it was&mdash;the Minister made no secret of it&mdash;part of the policy of that Party and its Leader to indulge in the habit of pulling the wool over the people's eyes.  Part of the sharp practice and of the pulling of wool over the people's eyes was what I might call the blackguardly propaganda with regard to the Governor-General which was indulged in up and down the country.  We were told that it was perfectly scandalous that anybody should have more than £1,000 a year at a time when the man who was responsible for that propaganda had more than £1,000.  The amount of the Governor-General's salary was placarded on the old walls and formed the subject of an enormous number of speeches.  The picture was drawn, in the first place, of the Governor-General at the end of the telephone getting orders from England.  Later on, he was depicted as a man getting £10,000 to put in his own pocket.  We were told how many unemployed that amount would feed and how many old age pensions it would pay.  The people who put about that story knew perfectly well that the occupant of this office of Governor-General was no more getting possession of this £10,000 to put in his pocket than President de Valera is getting possession, to put in his pocket, the Dáil bonds money which was discussed here for some time.</P>

      <P>I drew an analogy. The occupant of the Governor-General's office until last year received an emolument of £10,000.  Everybody knows that a vast proportion of that was paid out in pursuance of his functions, which included the holding of garden parties, receptions, the entertainment of distinguished visitors and so on.  Last year, there was a complete change.  The propaganda to which the country was treated about the absurdity of putting money into this office of Governor-General had a certain meaning behind it.  It has been perfectly clear to every intelligent man who has observed things here that the real objection to the Governor-General was that one person wanted to have the pre-eminence of political leadership in this country and also wanted to have precedence of all other people in relation to the State.  That was the real objection to the Governor-General.  There was talk about Irish freedom and all that. That was, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce would indicate, clearly pulling the wool over people's eyes and hood-winking them.  It was part of the sharp practice which, as the Minister indicated, was the chief stock-in-trade of the Fianna Fáil Party in getting into office.  During this year, there was a change, not only in the office-holder, but in the whole function of the office of Governor-General. Deputies will remember that certain correspondence was published&mdash;letters from the Governor-General and other letters, with the mark of caddishness in every line, addressed to the Governor-General.  Following upon that, the Governor-General was removed prior to the termination of his term of office.  Why was that? The Governor-General who then was in office refused to take orders as to the social or private functions to <Col N="2723" /> which he would go.  When he was invited by a foreign representative in this country, he dared to go, when the President of the Executive Council and his Ministers were also going. That was regarded as an impossible thing because it was perfectly absurd to think that the President of the Executive Council should not have precedence over the Governor-General. That was the whole reason.  The whole propaganda against the Governor-General&mdash;blackguardly, as it was&mdash; had one object and that was to allow a position to arise which would gratify the maniacal vanity of one man.</P>
      <P>We were told of the important economy there was to be effected. The occupant of the office here receives £10,000 a year.  Why?  I know that the terms of the Treaty and our position as a member of the Commonwealth of Nations indicate that the Governor-General should receive appropriate emoluments.  But what is being done with this £10,000 a year? We all know that, up to the change which was made by the present Government, the vast bulk of the money was spent in the service of this State. A large part of that money was spent in doing things which would otherwise have to be paid for out of some other fund.  Deputy McGilligan has referred to the fact that we are invited to a garden-party in the Viceregal grounds.  Unless we hear to the contrary, we can take it that the cost of that garden-party is going to be borne on the Vote for Public Entertainment.  The ridiculousness of such a thing as a garden party or a reception was part of the propaganda of the Fianna Fáil Party. There was an appeal made to the most ignorant people in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The suggestion is that everybody in this country should be just the type of the Deputy who is interrupting but that is not good enough for every country.  Every country and every society must be <Col N="2724" /> ordered hierarchically.  The Deputy would like to think there was nobody better than he is but, if that were so, this country would be a completely uncivilised country.  Here is a very great scandal&mdash;that whereas heretofore £10,000 was paid and used in a way obvious to everybody, that money is now being paid out and the functions it was used to fulfil are now going to be paid out of the taxpayers' pockets. Heretofore, we paid this £10,000 and certain things were done.  We continue to pay this £10,000 and we have to pay again for the very things paid for previously out of that £10,000.  It is generally understood around the country that the Governor-General is ordered and that he is not allowed to live the life of an ordinary, human being.  If somebody invites me to go to his house, I decide whether I go or not.  It is generally understood that the present occupant of this office occupies it only because he has agreed to terms that are degrading to human nature, that he is not allowed to invite people to his house and that he is not allowed to go to various functions or to other establishments.  What condition does that create?  As I stated here on another occasion, in every civilised country the instruments of Government provide certain protections for the people against a complete despotism. When there was a king as absolute monarch, Parliament grew up to limit the powers of that monarch.  In America, which came into existence as democracy, you have Congress, the Senate and the President fulfilling certain functions, thus depriving any one of them of the opportunity of acting as despot over the people.  In this country the last function of the Governor-General is removed.  So far as one can see, he has no function now but to receive £10,000 a year.  He is not allowed to appear in public.  On one occasion, I think he did appear at a little function down in Blackrock. The President also appeared. Apparently, that created a certain awkward situation and, so far as I know, he has appeared nowhere in public since&mdash;certainly, in no place where there was any possibility of the President appearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2725" /> Now, if there is to be any sort of order in this State, there must be this hierarchy.  The Governor-General is actually the symbol of this State.  He is beyond Party.  The existence of the Governor-General represents in the Government organisation something which is independent of Party.  He might have been a member of the Fianna Fáil Party before, but once he gets into this office he is clear of, and independent of, Party affiliations. What have we got to have in this country?  We are to have every symbol and reality of State closely allied and identified with Party.  The Governor-General, therefore, has to be done away with.  A Party leader, the President of the Executive Council, has to have precedence.</P>

      <P>It does not obtain in the United States.  It is that sort of ignorant remark that plays the devil with this country.  In the United States there is a President.  There is also a Parliament, the House of Representatives, and there is the Senate. Here we have only the Czar, de Valera, &mdash;nothing else.  There is no other power.  When President de Valera, with his pawns behind him, decides that he wants a certain thing done or a certain thing not done&mdash;and usually what he wants done is clearly against the best interests of this country&mdash; there is no power to restrict him.  He is now apparently determined that the Seanad will be able to delay his action only for three months.  The Deputy opposite says that the same thing prevails in the United States.  That is not so.  In the United States the President has enormous powers.  Here the Governor-General has none.  He is not even allowed to go to a social function.  He is only allowed to take possession of £10,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the situation.  And in order to pander to this maniacal vanity we are now having to pay out of taxation for the Garden Party which will be held in the Viceregal Lodge in a few weeks' time.  The cost of that is being put upon the people.

      <P>These coming functions are associated with a medical congress and an educational congress. There was a previous occasion when a great number of doctors came here for some such congress and there was a garden party in the Viceregal grounds. There were receptions in the Viceregal Lodge and they were paid for out of the £10,000 voted.  Now we have to pay the £10,000 and over and above that we have to pay for these things. It is necessary and right and proper that there should be these State entertainments.  The Governor-General, as his functions became more limited, became more and more associated with acting as host on behalf of the nation. Now he is not permitted even to do that.  It was clearly understood for the last ten years that this money was voted in the major part for that purpose. Presumably he is not now even permitted to do anything of that nature and yet we have to vote other moneys for entertainments.</P>
      <P>The whole position seems to me to be perfectly scandalous.  In so far as this State has the constitutional position that it has, it is within the power of the Government, with its majority, to take steps, if it so desires, to change the whole constitutional position of this country.  If it ever does that, I would protest under any circumstances; but I would protest, particularly, if you are going to have a position where you would have a political leader becoming the head of the Government and becoming the supreme head of this State.  I would regard that as a disastrous and an appalling situation, but that is the situation we are getting now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about the economies that are being made.  The President tells us he has reduced his salary by £1,000 a year.  The Governor-General's establishment now costs £2,682 less than it did last year or than it was estimated to cost last year.  The truth is that during the period of office of the predecessor of the Governor-General far more than £2,682 was spent over and above what is included here, in doing useful and necessary national work.  My objection to this Vote, apart from the unmasking of the appalling <Col N="2728" /> hypocrisy of the Party opposite in its political campaign, is that, strictly speaking, we have now, and with a definite object, gone to the point of making the occupant of the position ludicrous while, at the same time, we are giving this £10,000 a year.  Having given that £10,000 for a purpose, we now have to vote other money to the President for official entertainments. The whole situation with regard to the Governor-General has been brought about for no other purpose than to pander to a special vanity.</P>
    <P>Why has the Governor-General a travelling allowance?  Is he allowed to travel on official business?  Is there any point where, as Governor-General, he travels?  Why are the police there? The late Governor-General had such things as Aides-de-Camp, which formed part of the dignity of his office. What are the police there for if the whole purpose of the Government is to deny all dignity to the office?  Are the police there because the President is afraid his late associates might do something drastic merely because the Governor-General is there as the representative of the King?  Why are these other moneys involved?  The Governor-General has a motor car and they give him £300 and chauffeurs.  Under what circumstances would the Governor-General, as at present established, require a motor car, or a chauffeur, for the fulfilment of whatever functions pertain to his office?  I would like to know that.  I would be very glad to believe that the Governor-General was going to fulfil his functions in such a way that he would require a motor car and a private secretary, but so far as we can judge, he is only allowed to use the motor car if he is not using it in the fulfilment of his office.</P>
    <P>He is only allowed to use a motor car if he is using it for a purpose which should not be borne on this Vote.  He is only allowed to telephone and to send telegrams providing that he is telephoning or telegraphing in a way that should not be provided on this Vote.  He is only allowed to travel provided he is travelling in such a way that it should not be borne on this Vote.  I understand we are paying the items that are on this Vote strictly <Col N="2729" /> on the understanding that those moneys will be expended in such a way that they should not be included in this Vote at all.  We were told that the present Government stood for economy. We are spending £10,000 here on the stipulation that this country shall derive no benefit from that £10,000, because if it derived any benefit from it that might in some way put the President down a little in the order of precedence which exists here.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the salary of the Governor-General does not come under this Vote.  It is on the Central Fund, and consequently is not open for discussion here.  Incidental references have been made to it, but a detailed discussion of the salary does not arise on this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might put it this way?  There has been considerable speculation in the public mind as to what is the present cost to the taxpayer of maintaining this office.  That curiosity was excited by the propaganda of the Fianna Fáil Party during <Col N="2730" /> the occupancy of that office by the previous holder.  We were told that a salary of £10,000 a year was being wasted, and that the money spent on the maintenance of the household was being wasted.  The public were not told, of course, that that money was spent on public purposes, and on national purposes, and that probably every penny that was expended in that way went out amongst the people of this country.  I say, therefore, that there has been considerable speculation, because nobody who had heard that propaganda, and nobody who realised the change that was being made in this office by the present Government, expected for one moment that this office was now going to cost any more than a very nominal sum. Having regard to the amount of public money that is being spent on this office now, we are entitled to know what are the functions to be fulfilled in return for that expenditure.  The Governor-General, so far as we know, is confined to his residence.  He seems to be interned in his residence at Monkstown. The public would like to see him occasionally, and they never do. There is no office in the world analagous to that of the Governor-General of this country at the present moment, except perhaps the position of the Dali Llama in Lhasa.  He is confined in the holy city, and nobody is allowed to see him except his monks. The nine monks who preside over the destiny of this country now are the only persons allowed to see the Governor-General.  We should like to know whether he is ordered to remain inside the grounds of his residence, or is he allowed to take physical exercise outside?  Is he allowed to go to the nearest pillar-box when he wants to post a refusal to any invitation to a national or social function?  The people are entitled to know what they are receiving for the money they are spending on this Vote at the present time.</P>

      <P>I will speak, with the Minister's permission and without his interruptions, about the views that are agitating the people in my constituency with regard to this particular Vote.  Seeing that we have a Governor-General who is allowed to fulfil no particular function in the life of this nation; seeing that we have a Governor-General who is not allowed to carry out the ordinary known duties of a Governor-General in this country, we are interested to know why and for what purpose these large sums of money are being voted.  Heretofore people could understand, whether they agreed with the position or not, paying a Governor-General who did the work of a Governor-General, who acted as the nation's host, who filled a particular niche in the affairs of the nation, and so released the President of the Executive Council and the Ministers of the Executive Council from doing the work for which they are paid&mdash;administering, governing and generally looking after the Government services of this country.  We had a Governor-General who acted as the national host; who entertained distinguished visitors from other lands; who spent a considerable portion of his salary on such entertainment, attending functions and managing the really higher social side of affairs in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now a position where the Governor-General is, by order, prohibited from fulfilling any of those functions, from appearing, in fact, as Governor-General in any walk of the national life.  I could understand an Executive Council that would say: &ldquo;In spite of the fact that provision is made for a Governor-General in the Treaty, the whole procedure is too costly in a country that is hard up against it, in a country where the money is rapidly running out, and we will abolish the office entirely.&rdquo;  I <Col N="2732" /> would have a certain amount of understanding for that point of view, and a certain amount of respect for the honesty and courage of the people who took that point of view.  I have nothing but contempt for the men who, being afraid to abolish the office, make every mean attempt to demean it, and, having demeaned the office so that the Governor-General occupies a more lowly and more humiliating position than the humblest person in the land, they then turn around to the taxpayers of the country, and to the Parliament of the country, and say: &ldquo;In spite of the fact that he has no functions to fulfil, in spite of the fact that he dare not appear in public, in spite of the fact as Deputy Rice said, &lsquo;he is really an internee in a private house in Monkstown,&rsquo; you must nevertheless put up £1,200 a year personal expenses, £100 travelling expenses, £110 for telephones, £300 for motor expenses and £240 for renewal of motor cars.&rdquo;  What is all this about?</P>
    <P>Will the President or the Minister for Finance, or anybody on the benches opposite, tell us what return the State is getting for that money.  We have heard from the Government Benches, and in fact from every side of the House, that financially the condition of this country is serious.  We have reached a point where the standard of wages is set by the Government at a lower level than it has ever reached before, and because it has reached that point it has been necessary to dismiss men in permanent employment in order to make room for those out of work.  With that position before us, this House is asked to vote a sum of £110 a year for telephones and telegrams for a man who has no functions to fulfil.  Why, that sum of money alone would keep a family in fairly good circumstances for a year.  Then we have the sum of £1,200 a year for personal expenses. Personal expenses in connection with what work for this State?  Is it the work of signing a Bill once a month; writing his signature once or twice a month and, if it is not for that, what is it for?  In what capacity does the present Governor-General travel?  For what purpose are we asked to vote this money for a motor and for motor <Col N="2733" /> renewals.  In what State capacity is the telephone and telegraph station used in connection with the office now? As far as the world knows, and as far as this Dáil knows, the Governor-General is allowed to play no part in the affairs of this country beyond signing a Bill, and even that has got to be done in secret: it has got to be done behind closed doors.</P>
    <P>Now in times such as these when we hear so much talk about taxation having reached the peak point, when money really matters and must continue to matter to people in a position to vote or to refuse to vote it out of the public purse, I would like to add my voice to the voices of other Deputies, and ask for some justification for these particular sums of money. What is the justification for the £1,200 for personal expenses; for an appointment such as that of controller of the household in the small private residence now occupied by the Governor-General; for the £100 for travelling expenses, in addition to the £110 for telegrams and telephones, and the £300 for personal allowance?  I think the House should be told what those sums are required for, and what return the State is getting.  We are asked to vote this money and we are entitled to know what it is for.  If the Governor-General is fulfilling no functions in this State then we are entitled to know what is the justification in asking us to vote money towards the expenses of certain functions.</P>

      <P>When the appointment of the Governor-General was officially announced, Kildare was, naturally, very proud.  I think it was the first time that it had the honour of having one of its sons selected for such a high position in the State.  After a while, the people began to wonder and ask: where is this Governor-General gone to?  Nobody can find him.  Nobody can ever meet him or see him.  Then the name was changed from Governor-General to that of An Seanaschal, and whether that is the name of a patent medicine or not, I do not know.

Immediately, Kildare lost all interest in An Seanaschal.  He is supposed to represent all sections of the people, and yet when 40,000 people assembled at an international competition we got the same message again: that An Seanaschal regrets that he cannot be present.  When anybody, any big institution or any big organisation, desires to pay honour to him, the same announcement is made: that An Seanaschal regrets that he cannot attend, with the result that the thing is becoming a fraud and a farce, and is recognised as such here and outside. For that reason I am opposed to voting this sum of £10,000 a year for An Seanaschal, because I think the money could be put to a more useful purpose.</P>

      <P>So far as paying for the office is concerned it has not been abolished, but so far as getting any use from the office is concerned it has been abolished.  We were told that it was only a rubber stamp.  Well, £13,000 a year is a rather big sum to pay for a rubber stamp.  A previous speaker referred to garden parties that were given by previous Governors-General, and when that reference was made Deputies on the back benches opposite burst out in laughter.  That only shows the limited intelligence and knowledge of the back benchers opposite.  I have never been at a <Col N="2735" /> garden party of any description in my life.</P>

      <P>Let us be clear about it.  I intervened in this because it concerns an officer of the State, and the dignity of this State.  I did not want it to go abroad that there was any disrespect intended by the President or by Deputy Belton. <Col N="2737" /> Accordingly, when the statement was made that the President ordered Deputy Belton not to attend Mass when the Governor-General was present, I thought it was sufficiently serious.  On the President's correction of that statement, I suggest that the Deputy should withdraw it.  <i>(Interruptions.</i>) I heard the President definitely state that the statement was correct.</P>

      <P>That is the usual footy kind of remark the Minister makes.  It is quite clear&mdash;I put it again&mdash;that Deputy Belton's statement was not clearly heard.  There was a row going on at the time, and his statement was not clearly heard by the two occupants of the Front Bench because it is obvious, unless the Minister wants deliberately to misrepresent Deputy Belton, that he did not hear the last few words of Deputy Belton's statement.  I suggest that it is also possible that the President did not hear the last few words of the statement. That being so, the President has had an opportunity since of denying that statement, and I suggest that we have had no denial.  I am accepting fully that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle heard the President deny it, but what is not clear to the House is, what the President meant to deny.</P>

      <P>Perhaps that brought business to the Deputy.  In every market held in Dublin, in addition to the business houses, trade boomed prior to a garden party.  If you go to any of the markets in Dublin they will tell you the amount of stuff that used to be sent to the Viceregal Lodge during the season, as it was called, in the then society.  That was an important function.  Another function for the Governor-General who was above Parties in this country, and who should be a man of experience, intelligence and education, as the two first occupants of the office undoubtedly were, was travel through Great Britain and attend industrial exhibitions there.  Those of us who have experience of life in Great Britain know how much the patronage of a distinguished personage like the Governor-General of the Free State extended to the exhibitions would further the sale of Irish produce in the British market.  That was also an important function.  It is a great loss that we have a live Governor-General instead of an internee.  An incompent Ministry, dominated and bull dosed by an incompetent President, drove this country up against the economic ramparts of England, leaving it there to starve and wither before these ramparts, with nobody to make a gesture of a settlement, <Col N="2743" /> until this country some day will rise up in rebellion against the bull-dosing that is driving it to the brink of destruction.  If we had a live Governor-General he could have found ways and means of bringing the two parties together and long before now have effected a settlement of that dispute to the mutual advantage of the two countries; that is, unless President de Valera, who started the trouble does not want it settled.  That would be an important function; an obvious function of the Governor-General.  Instead of that he is set up&mdash;I speak with no offence to the present Governor-General, a man, who no doubt, in his walk of life is a good Irishman, who played his part well in the fight for Irish freedom; nobody will deny that, nobody could deny it.  But, it is not because a British soldier wins the Victoria Cross that he will be given the highest position in the administration of the Government of England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The soldier has his place.  The ordinary patriot has his place, but when it comes to filling an important office it must be filled by an individual with qualifications.  It is not because of any disrespect for Donal Buckley by his old colleagues that they say whether it is that he is stopped from filling that post in the best way for this country or whether it is done of his own volition, there must be a certain amount of consent on the part of the individual concerned or otherwise he would not allow himself to be eclipsed and put in the corner out in Blackrock in the way he has been.  If he did not consent to the humiliation of that office, he would have functioned in it as his predecessors had done, and if any attempt were made to humiliate him he would have stood up against it, in the way his predecessor stood up when an attempt was made, a very foul attempt, to humiliate him.  There are rumours about this office that should be denied. There are rumours afloat that in addition to this £10,000 there are certain offices paid out of the public purse in the household whatever it is. Rumour has it&mdash;I would be glad to <Col N="2744" /> have it denied&mdash;that members of the family&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If it is too delicate a point I shall pass away from it.  I hope that in fulfilling these offices, anyway, due regard will be given to the unemployed and that there will not be duplication of offices.  Like the previous speakers, I am at a terrible loss to know, as I am sure the country will be at a lose to know, why, seeing that the office of Governor-General has pretty well passed out of the life of this country except for the payments attached to it, there should be an allowance in respect of salary and wages for a household staff of £608, and why there should be an allowance to the Governor-General of £1,200. We have a provision for the maintenance of the official residence and the establishment of the Governor-General of £1,200.  Why should all these big sums go for some uses that are not quite apparent to the ordinary <Col N="2745" /> man?  It is strange why the residence, the seat of this important personage, should have been removed from the Viceregal Lodge out to Blackrock.  It was mentioned by a previous speaker that there was only a lease of six months taken for that house.  I hope that the ordinary practice of renting a house in the city was complied with and that the Governor-General, or those acting on his behalf, paid half a year's rent as security, because certain whimsical things have been done in the past, and from the way in which this office has been administered recently, one does not know but that the tenant might go away without any notice at all.</P>
      <P>We have an item of £100 for travelling expenses.  I do not know where the travelling takes place.  Then we have got telegrams and telephones £110 and an allowance to the Governor-General for a motor car of £300.  Last year a sum of £240 was allowed for a motor car replacement fund.  The allowance to the Governor-General for expenses and the provision for the maintenance of the official residence and establishment of the Governor-General amounts to £1,200, telegrams £10 and telephones £100. We have all these expenses to the State and no attempt has been made to explain the function for which this £13,000 has been paid.  Previous speakers have referred to the fact that the Governor-General is interned or marooned and cannot go out without leave.  He was not able even to play a representative part at a recent Rugby football match.  Of course, certain people applaud that.  That is the epitome of patriotism.  There was a time before we got our freedom that I approved of that and practised that. For nearly 20 years I played Gaelic football and hurling and nothing else. I agreed with that at that time.</P>

I now find he has <Col N="2747" /> none, and the taxpayers of this country will feel gratified that, despite all that has been said by the Party opposite, the Governor-General exists in the one way that matters to the taxpayers, that is as a loss to the taxpayers.  The Governor-General exists to draw his salary for doing nothing.  When the previous Governor-General was there he drew the same salary, but he did something and it was quite in keeping with the outlook, policy and achievement of the present Government that though they are not doing anything except in a negative way still they are costing the country more than their predecessors.  Though they promised to achieve much they have only achieved the negativing of the effects of some offices.  But they have not reduced the cost of those offices to the country.  They have diminished the efficiency of those offices and our next Vote will give us what the President's Office costs and its efficiency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a very pleasant Estimate to discuss, because we find here in this Estimate a sum of £2,318 to be voted by this House, and that sum, as far as one can see, is a sum of money which is going to be completely and entirely wasted.  Now, there was a post here, the post of Governor-General.  The Governor-General is the head of the whole State and a member of the Oireachtas.  As head of the whole State, as Governor-General, he receives a salary of £10,000.  In addition to that, for the upkeep and maintenance of his establishment he receives these other sums in the Estimate.  Now, if he were Governor-General, if he acted in the spirit, or if you like if he were allowed to act in the spirit in which the Governor-General should act, then no doubt, the sum of money for the upkeep of his house and the other expenses would be perfectly right and perfectly natural.  But we want to know why this amount of the taxpayers' money should be paid to a Governor-General who lives the life of a recluse?  Go anywhere you like and where will you see the Governor-General? <Col N="2748" /> There may be any public business, any State ceremony in public places where men frequent, where you would expect to find the head of the State, representing the State.  But you find him nowhere.  It may be very admirable that a man in the position of the Governor-General or any other position should live the life of a recluse or the life of a hermit.  But surely to goodness, if the Governor-General wishes, or the Attorney-General for that matter, or anybody else wishes, to retire into what is, for all practical purposes, a hermit's cell, then he might be allowed to practice the virtue of poverty in that cell and not be given as well as £10,000 a sum of £2,318, which we know he is not going to spend.  We look through this Estimate and we see the salaries and other things which are being paid to the Governor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One wonders where on earth is this money going.  It is a very unpleasant thing of course that you would see a Dublin comic paper making a joke like it made last month about the Governor-General when it had a notice that the Governor-General had gone on his holidays and then the note of interrogation, &ldquo;from what?&rdquo;  That is all a very unpleasant state of affairs in this country. But, as I say, if the Governor-General lives the life of a hermit, or is compelled by the circumstances, which I need not go into because the whole House knows it, to live the life of a recluse, why should he, at the same time, receive this sum of money in addition to his £10,000 a year?  The Governor-General is the non-political head of this State!  he is supposed to expend the salary he receives and all his other allowances in entertaining and in upholding the dignity of the position.  It is for that this sum of money is being paid.  But now we find that this is being done in duplicate, that the Governor-General is receiving a salary as Governor-General, and is receiving this further sum of £2,318 to be voted to him to-night.  But the work he had to do and the expenses that he had to defray out of these sums of money are being incurred and defrayed elsewhere, and the taxpayers have got to pay them on the double.  We find that the <Col N="2749" /> entertainments that the Governor-General ought to give out of these sums of money are being given by the President of the Executive Council, and of course, out of the Entertainment Fund that comes out of the pocket of the taxpayers.  The Governor-General is receiving this sum of money to entertain, and the entertainment is being done at the cost of the taxpayers, by the President of the Executive Council. This is taking place in a year in which, by common consent, the finances of this State are in a very bad condition.</P>
    <P>Now, as far as I am concerned, I certainly would have no objection to the voting of this sum of money or a larger sum of money, to a Governor-General who was expending that money; to a Governor-General who was upholding the dignity of the office&mdash;not merely in private but in public.  But I do not see why this money should be paid to discharge liabilities which we know are not being incurred.  Because right down through the whole matter runs the idea and has run the idea that the office of the Governor-General is not an office of profit.  It is not supposed to be.  The Governor-General is not supposed to go out of office a richer man than he was when he went into office.  The whole theory of the Governor-General is that it is not a position in which a man is to be put in order that he may get rich out of that office, that he may live on nothing, and, as the expression goes, &ldquo;feather his nest.&rdquo;  That is not the idea.  The idea is that the Governor-General is to come out of that office, if anything, a poorer man, because he is supposed to expend every single penny of his salary and he is supposed to expend every single penny of his allowances in upholding the dignity of his position. I have not said or suggested that in public or private as far as the Governor-General is concerned that he, as an individual, lowered the dignity of his position.  But as far as being in public he is not taking that position in this State that the Governor-General should take, and it is to enable him to take that position and to uphold its dignity that these sums of money are being voted to-night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am intervening in this debate for the purpose of coming to the assistance of the Government; because I think there is something to be said for this Vote.  There is something to be said in favour of the view that we are going to get something for the expenditure of this money, and that however expensive it may be on the country, there is some hope that there may be a return to the country for the expenditure of this sum of money.  The reason I take that view is this&mdash;that it would appear that this country can learn no lesson except at very great expense.  This country can learn at the expense of the amount of money comprised in this Estimate, the value of the instrument that was signed by Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith, and the extent of the liberty that was achieved by them, and by the actions of their successors, Kevin O'Higgins and Deputy McGilligan.  The present Government have demonstrated by their action in reference to the office of the Governor-General all that was achieved by Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith and subsequently by Kevin O'Higgins and his successor Deputy McGilligan at later Imperial Conferences.</P>
      <P>For a number of years the people of this country were told by the propagandists of the Fianna Fáil Party that the Governor-General was an officer who represented the British Government and the British King.  They were told that he represented in this country all that was hateful in British rule, and that he was the embodiment of British interference in Irish affairs in this country.  And we were not believed, and our predecessors were not believed when we told the people of this country that they had in the instrument that was signed on the 6th of December, 1921, an instrument which gave them power to achieve for this country the fullest possible freedom.  We were not believed when we said that there can be no interference in the affairs of this country under that instrument, either through the instrumentality of the Governor-General or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports of the Imperial Conferences of 1926, 1929, and 1930 were proof to this House of the advance <Col N="2751" /> that had been made by Kevin O'Higgins and Deputy McGilligan. These advances were explained to this House and to the country.  One of the most outstanding achievements of these great men was the fact that they made it clear and apparent to all that the Governor-General was not the representative of the British Government in this country, but that he was the mere embodiment of the people's will, that he was merely giving expression through the Executive Council to the people's will in this country, either external or internal, through the office of the Governor-General. These are matters that are now made clear to the people.  It remained for the present President of the Executive Council and his colleagues to show by their actions last year in connection with the office of the Governor-General that we were completely and absolutely free from any domination in our affairs, external or internal, from this office of the Governor-General; that he was the mere nominee of the Executive Council of this State, and the mere instrument for registering the people's will in this State.  I say if this Vote is passed, and if it makes this clear to the people of this country, then it is worth the price. If the actions of the President and of his colleagues who, in their treatment of this office for the last year degraded it, if you like, make it clear that the freedom achieved under this instrument, which has been so much reviled by them, but which has been worked by them during the last 18 months&mdash;in that this office of the Governor-General, upon which they cast so much ridicule is merely the instrument by which the Executive Council's decisions are registered, then I say this Vote will be cheap at the price.  Unfortunately, it is a big price to pay for that in the present economic circumstances, but it is a price which I for one would be prepared to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been some years in this House and never before was I so interested or amused in any debate as I was in this.  I remember, when on the opposite side of the <Col N="2752" /> House, pointing out how ridiculous it was to spend vast sums of money on what I said was practically the position of a rubber stamp.  I remember how these gentlemen sitting opposite, talking about the office to-day, used to stand up here, and if I dared say a word about the person who was then Governor-General, the Chair was appealed to and I was silenced as being one who was out of order in referring to so exalted a personality.  Now, what a change we have got.  We have these gentlemen on the other side, and while they have only to look through the Estimates to see the extent to which that item of expenditure is reduced, they still complain of the cost, talk of the waste of the taxpayers' money on this utterly worthless office.  When we pointed out the cost when it was far greater the gentlemen opposite said that this was an essential office.  Now, we are quite frank, and if it was possible to completely abolish the office, we would do it, and I hope yet one day to be able to do it completely and absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Governor-General to-day is performing all the constitutional functions that any of his predecessors performed, performing all the constitutional offices and functions under the Constitution.  But the gentlemen on the other side did not want merely a Governor-General who performed the functions of his office; they wanted a Viceroy and a Court here.  That is what they wanted; and because we have cut down the office and made it strictly one in accord with the Constitution&mdash;as I say, we propose still to do more&mdash;of course we have offended the gentlemen opposite who wanted to have a nice little king of their own. They wanted a Viceroy operating around here with his own Court.  We do not want that.  We were compelled on account of the pledge we gave the people, to maintain the office.  We have kept our promise and cut down the cost, and confined the functions to the narrowest possible limits.  And before I go into details and show how far we have gone in that respect, I would like to refer to the <Col N="2753" /> speech made by the former Attorney-General. It is true that we pointed out after the Treaty that the Governor-General was the direct agent of the British Cabinet.  The Deputy spoke as a former Attorney-General and I ask him can he deny that the Governor-General was in that position for many a year, and that in all the years that we were out against him as the agent of the British Government he was, in fact, the agent of the British Government and I was one of the first people in the country&mdash;certainly I was, I think, the first person in the Opposition&mdash; to state that a big change had been made.  I think I was one of the first and I gave full credit for that change inasmuch as after the 1926 conference the Governor-General undoubtedly no longer was the agent of a foreign cabinet and a foreign Government but he is none the less and the office is none the less distasteful to the vast majority of the Irish people and if there was to be expression given to the wishes of the vast majority of the Irish people there would be no such thing as a Governor-General here.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows full well, although he was not in the House at the time, the reason why the Treaty was taken.  It might be just as well to remind some of the people why it was.  The late Michael Collins was mentioned by a Deputy on the other side.  Look up his speeches and see why he took it, and look up the speeches of any of the people who took it at the time, and see why they took it.  They took it because it was the alternative to war&mdash;to immediate and terrible war.  That was Lloyd George's phrase, and that is why they accepted the Treaty, and why they accepted the office of Governor-General.  If the office of Governor-General is retained to-day, it is because there is a fear in certain people's minds that, if it were abolished, you would have a renewal of some war.  The people on the opposite side are crying out about the tariff war, and because there are people in this country who feel that if <Col N="2754" /> they completely and thoroughly ended the Treaty, there would be a renewal of a war of one kind or another, by a big State against ours, they are compelled in that particular way to submit to the retention of an office like this. We made a change in the occupancy. Why?  Because we wanted to make it quite clear that the Governor-General functioning in this country, anyhow, so long as we were the Government, would just do what the Executive Council told him to do, and nothing more and nothing less.  We wanted to make that quite clear and we made it quite clear that that is the position. It is the position, and it will remain the position as long as we are the Executive Council.  He is, so far as we are concerned, to remain the instrument&mdash;it does not matter who holds the post&mdash;of the Executive Council of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The personality of the present occupant was mentioned, and I shall just refer to it in passing.  There is not a better Gael in Ireland, or a better man, than the present occupant of that post.  He took the post as a matter of national duty, at a big sacrifice to himself, and he did it because he felt it was necessary to do it in the general interest of the country. He accepted the position on that basis and on no other.  There was only one Deputy who had common sense enough to ask a question before he went a foolish distance with regard to the cost.  I will give some of the particulars of the cost, and I will compare them later with the costs of his predecessor.  As a result of the changes made during the last year, the entire cost of maintaining the office of Governor-General, including his salary, which is charged on the Central Fund, and the charges in this and in other Votes, is expected this year to be £5,083 as compared with £26,452 last year.  It was really amusing to listen to these people talking now about economy on an expenditure which is only one quarter of the expenditure they themselves stood for.  Listening to them talking one would think that all the entertainment of the State was borne by the Governor-General out of his £10,000 a year.  Nothing of the <Col N="2755" /> sort.  In addition to the £10,000, there was a further £16,000 for the upkeep of his establishment in other Votes.  I am giving the total sum this year in our case as £5,000 and it will not amount to that because, as it was the first year, we were not able to estimate accurately what the cost would be, but I am perfectly certain that the cost of these items will be far less than the amount that is down here in the Estimate.  Is it a fact that all the entertainment was paid for by the Governor-General out of his £10,000 a year salary?  Nothing of the sort, because there were other Votes for entertainment.  Going back beyond last year, which was exceptional on account of the Eucharistic Congress, to the previous year, when the Governor-General was costing £27,000, with his £10,000 salary, we find that there was, under Vote 66, for instance, provision for a sum of £1,250.  It is suggested that we have put Votes elsewhere to make up for the loss of entertaining by the Governor-General. Look elsewhere for our Vote, and it will be found that it is only half, in respect of entertainment, what it was when the Governor-General was taking £10,000 a year.  The present Governor-General is not taking £10,000 a year.  We have to put £10,000 a year down in these Estimates, because it is a statutory salary payable out of the Central Fund.  We are bound to offer it to the Governor-General, but the Governor-General is not bound to receive it, and the Governor-General is not, in fact, going to take it, and has not taken it.  The total sum will not be more than £2,000, free of tax, so that, instead of this £10,000, of which we heard the previous speakers talking, it has been cut down to one-fifth of the sum.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it might be worth while going through some of the items. The allowance to the Governor-General for the maintenance of his household has been reduced by £1,800 and travelling expenses by £75 and, as a matter of fact, these travelling expenses will not have to be paid unless they are actually incurred, and we do not believe that they will be incurred.  Telegrams <Col N="2756" /> and telephones have been reduced by £80.  If the Governor-General gets telegrams, I suppose he has to send replies and, while the sum we have estimated on this head is reduced by £80 we expect that, in fact, the actual saving will be far more.  For the first year, however, we were unable to estimate it accurately, and to fine down the Estimate, as closely as if we had previous experience, under which circumstances we would be certain about the amount which would actually have to be borne.  Reductions in the staff have resulted in a saving, on wages and salaries, of £787.  There is an increase of £60 in the allowance for the Governor-General's motor car, which arises from particular circumstances.  The previous Governor-General had three or four cars, a motor van and a whole number of other things, and the expenditure was not at all to be compared with that for this year.  In addition to the saving of £2,682 shown on this Vote there is a net reduction of £10,877 in the charges on other Votes in connection with the Governor-General's establishment.  That is attributable chiefly to the closing of the Viceregal Lodge and to the fact that the Governor-General has taken up residence in a comparatively small house, rented and maintained out of his allowance of £1,200 in the past year.</P>

      <P>Or for any other purpose that is prudent, just as, for instance, other State places would be at our disposal if we wanted to use them for any special State purposes. I have explained with regard to the Governor-General's salary, that it is fixed by statute.  The present occupant of the office has declared his intention of not retaining more than £2,000 of this sum.  That will be free of income tax.  At any rate the net result will be a saving of £7,800 on <Col N="2758" /> one item alone.  To sum up, the total estimated saving is £21,369.  That is not a bad saving, it is over 80 per cent. of the cost compared with that under our predecessors.  I only wish that it were possible to proceed as rapidly with certain other portions of our programme and to have as good a show at the end of one year.</P>

I should like the President to say that the Executive Council places no embargo on the natural or social life of the Governor-General, and never has done so.  Deputies can laugh at that but it is just as well to make it plain.</P>

      <P>We have to take it then that the Executive Council are pursuing a deliberate policy of not explaining to this House or to the country what their policy is on certain matters.  This is one of the most important Estimates we have to consider, because the policy for which the President stands is involved in this particular Estimate.  Yet, though the country has suffered from that policy for 12 months, since we last had an opportunity of discussing the Estimate for this Department, the Government will not vouchsafe any view on some of the most important aspects of their policy&mdash;aspects with which the country is deeply concerned and in which it is vitally interested. What is precisely the policy of the President on the issue which has been most in the minds of the people of this country for the last eight or nine months?  I doubt if anybody knows it. The President himself knows it?  I wonder whether the members of the Executive Council know it.  We had, during the past month, glaring examples of flagrantly contradictory statements made in this regard by the Minister for Agriculture and by the President.  It will be in the recollection of many of the Deputies present how, some few weeks ago, the Minister for Agriculture astonished this House by saying the Government had found markets which would replace the British market we had lost.  Apparently, the head of the Executive Council knew nothing about them.  I am not surprised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Either the Minister for Agriculture did not know what he was talking about or, else, the President is not aware of what his Ministers are doing.  We had a confession on this matter from the President the other day.  When I gave him an opportunity of dealing with the question, he said he had dealt with it and that I was not present.  I was present but it never struck me the the President was referring to the few words he then uttered.  I thought he was referring to his opening statement. In reality, he had not dealt with the question of markets.  So far as he mentioned them, what he said was in complete contradiction, so far as the principal countries of Europe are concerned, with what the Minister said.  There may be countries in Europe in which we have not representatives and in which we are likely to have markets. That may be so of the east of Europe and of the south of Europe, but the President did not even mention that markets were available there.  What <Col N="2761" /> he did say, so far as his remarks can be paraphrased, was that the position was most unsatisfactory, that, in fact, unless these countries mended their ways, so far as we were concerned, and bought more from us, serious steps would have to be taken.</P>
    <P>That does not suggest that markets have been found.  Yet what was the foundation of the play made here by the Minister for Agriculture when he said that such markets had been found?  Where are they?  What is the worth of them?  There are very few matters agitating this country at the present moment&mdash;they are not much agitating another country&mdash;so much as the policy for which the President is responsible, the policy of ill-will prevailing now between the two countries and the two Governments, the policy of the economic war.  It is quite evident that supporters of every Party are seriously concerned with that particular matter.  Why else the rumour we have heard, about once every two months, since this war started, that it was going to be settled?  Rumours have been assiduously circulated.  Almost every two months during the last year rumours have been put about that there was going to be a settlement. There was not a tittle of foundation for these rumours, not one bit of justification for Ministerial statements here and in the Seanad that a settlement might be expected, or for the alternative statements that markets had been found.  Why, then, were the rumours put about?  The rumours were put about because the Deputies of every Party, the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party quite as much as the Deputies on this side of the House, realise that the people want the matter settled. Else there was no point in putting the rumours about.  There were rumours put about some six weeks ago.</P>

We have had many denials from him in the last couple of days and we know the value of them.  I am quite satisfied the people in this country know the rumours have been put about.</P>

      <P>The grunter is at it now.  I understand he is a particular protégé of the President.  These rumours have been circulated in order to keep up the spirits of the supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am bringing that forward as proof of the statement I made that everybody in this country is vitally interested in a settlement of this question and it is nothing less than a scandal&mdash;and we have had many from the President's Party and from himself within the last couple of weeks&mdash;that this Vote should be introduced without any attempt at justification, without any statement of policy from the President.  We cannot regard the few words from the Minister for Finance as an appropriate introduction of this Vote.  Again, if we see fit, we shall have to exercise our privileges of treating this strictly as a Committee Stage, and Deputies on this side of the House will exercise their rights and continue the discussion even when we have heard what the Ministerial policy is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we do want to know because, unfortunately, the country is in complete ignorance on the matter, is whether there is any real wish&mdash;I do not mean a wish that means nothing, but any real practical wish&mdash;any real desire, on the part of the President to settle this dispute.  I suggest that anybody who throws his mind back on the history of this dispute, a dispute that has meant such a lot of misfortune and disaster for this country, will see that there is unfortunately&mdash;at least it is the only evidence we have&mdash;no such desire on the part of the President. Every time, as days and months went by, we found him further away from a settlement.  Every conference and every negotiation he entered into <Col N="2763" /> found him further away from a settlement, putting up new difficulties.  That was so last October and last November when he put up his extraordinary additional payment.  That was so when, during the election, we had a new barrier put up in the way of a settlement, namely, that until the Boundary was brushed aside there could be no settlement.</P>

      <P>I will say this much, that I think it would require a miracle of Divine providence to raise him to the lowest depths of degradation.  The policy, as revealed by actions and not as explained by the Minister, has been one of putting more and more obstacles in the way of a settlement of this matter.  I suggest the whole future of the country is being deliberately destroyed by the man who thinks he has a mission so far as this country is concerned; that he is appointed to carry through a certain policy in this country, no matter what it costs the country in the way of pauperisation and degradation.  I suggest that it is time the people of the country are not asked merely to rely on inferences that they are compelled to draw from the actions of the President and from the rumours that are continually being spread about the country, and that we should have a <Col N="2764" /> plain and definite statement of policy from the Government.</P>
      <P>They have their opportunity on this particular Vote.  I think it is nothing less than a continuation of their usual cruel and callous treatment of this nation&mdash;the way in which rumour has been put about practically every two months and the way in which this country has been treated by that particular Party, just as a very well-known domestic animal is treated by putting a carrot before it.  That has been the policy of these apostles of nationality opposite.  They have been fooling the country in that particular for 12 months.  I believe the great bulk of the people who support every Party in this House want a settlement.</P>

      <P>I suggest that after 12 months of that policy and within a month of the adjournment this is the last Vote on which the Executive Council has an opportunity of explaining its action, its policy, and saying precisely where it stands.  I do not want heroics from the Deputy from the Mountains.  I want a plain commonsense statement whether there will be any effort made to have a settlement or not, whether the mere presence of that great negotiator, Senator Connolly, in London, and the opportunity he has of coming into daily contact with those with whom we are in dispute, has been utilised. Let the country know where we stand. I will confess that it is by no means easy to unravel any statements of the President, or to pin him down to anything. Tht only statement that he was pinned down to to-night was, unfortunately, not heard by the bulk of the <Col N="2765" /> House, namely, a denial.  The opportunity for repeating it was not taken. We know the extreme difficulty, the impossibility, in fact, that he finds in making a definite statement.  That one was definite.  Unfortunately, with unusual modesty on his part, he deprived the House of an opportunity of hearing it fully.  We accept, as we are bound to accept&mdash;and so far as the individual is concerned we willingly accept&mdash;the statement of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in regard to it.  So far as policy is concerned, when the President gets up to make a statement I confess that the House is a little more confused after he has been speaking about it for some time than it was before he got up.  Still, I do suggest that he should explain how it was that his Minister for Agriculture was able to state that we had markets abroad, markets apparently&mdash;because that was the significance and application of the statement&mdash;that would compensate us for the market which we had lost.  Consequently, I think an opportunity should be taken of stating what the policy of the Government is on the economic war, and whether they are anxious to take, or have recently taken, any steps towards a settlement.</P>

      <P>I wish to take this opportunity of making some comments upon the manner in which the President has exercised the duties of his office.  I hope that he will not wait until concluding the discussion on this Estimate to get up and tell us something about it.  I hope that he will give an opportunity to some of us to comment on what he has to say, and possibly to make some suggestions which even he might conceivably find useful.  I confess to having a weakness for the President.  In the first place he was a great friend of one of the men I most liked and admired among those I ever knew.  In the second place I have been influenced, as I think most people who came into contact with him have been influenced, by his courtesy and his charm and his dignity.  Nevertheless, I feel obliged to say about him now what I said about him once in this House already that I disagree with practically everything <Col N="2766" /> he has done in the course of his public life, and that I do not believe any man since Cromwell has inflicted more harm on this country.</P>

I still think so, in spite of what I think about his past actions.  When I was a child learning Church history I used to be taught that the fact that the Church had survived the immoralities of certain mediæval Popes was one of the strongest proofs of its divine origin; and the mere fact that the President's reputation and position have survived the appalling injuries he has inflicted upon this country is very good proof that he could be worth something tremendous to this country.</P>

One is that which has been referred to by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan, that is his attitude towards the question of settling the economic war.  The President put in an interjection just now as to who it was started rumours a short time ago that a settlement was coming.  As far as I am concerned, those rumours reached me from two directions and both directions were Fianna Fáil.  One of them was a Deputy sitting on those benches at the present moment, who gave me to understand in the month of May that <Col N="2767" /> from what he knew a settlement was probable not merely at the Economic Conference, but even before the Economic Conference began.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that point was not stressed to me.  It is perfectly true that those rumours represented the general desire of this country, and still represent the general desire of this country.  What is the President doing, or what has the President done to bring about a settlement?  Why is he sitting here at all?  Why is he not over in London? Is not that where he would be doing some good at the present moment? Why is he not over in London trying to make a settlement?  This matter could have been dealt with, as has been frequently pointed out, in two ways, by negotiation&mdash;by making a business offer, in other words&mdash;or by arbitration.  I maintain that the President has blocked both methods. From all we can hear, he blocked the negotiation method completely during the Ottawa Conference.  The negotiation method was made impossible in connection with the Economic Conference now sitting, and my hopes of anything being accomplished for us at that Conference were almost completely shattered when I read the speech which the President made in Paris on his way back from Rome, a speech so aggressive and so obviously calculated to excite annoyance among the British that it was impossible to think that at the time he was making it he could have had any serious desire that a settlement should be attempted by negotiation in connection with the present Economic Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about arbitration?  I must admit that at first I was impressed when the President announced in this House that he had accepted the principle of arbitration, and that the only thing he insisted on was that it should be a fair tribunal and not a tribunal comparable to the Feetham Tribunal.  I was impressed by that.  I think now I was <Col N="2768" />&ldquo;taken in&rdquo; by it.  I think he never had the slightest desire for arbitration of any kind.  He has never allowed this arbitration question to be brought down to a narrow issue.  He has refused to allow it to be brought down even to the question of who should be chairman, or from what nation the chairman should be drawn.  I made an attempt last year, as he will remember, to get him to go as far as to say that the delegates from the Irish Free State would be Irish Nationals.  Surely that was not an unreasonable proposition to expect him to agree to.  He would not even agree to that, and I think the reason was that if he agreed to that it would bring the matter at issue down to the narrow question of a chairman, and he was afraid that by some means or other a reasonable proposition with regard to the chairman might be put forward, which he would be practically bound to accept.  I can see no evidence that he really wanted arbitration.  I am convinced that if he had really wanted arbitration, means could have been obtained for bringing it about. Now what I am saying about his attitude towards a settlement to-night is no more confined to my personal opinion than it is to the personal opinion of Deputy Professor O'Sullivan. It is becoming the general feeling in the country that the individual who is standing in the way of a settlement is the President.  The bulk of his own followers want a settlement and would like to see some efforts made to bring it about.  It is perfectly certain that at the last general election the majority of the people who supported Fianna Fáil did so because they erroneously believed that the President had not been given a fair chance to get a settlement, and that they by returning him to power again would give him that fair chance, and that then they might expect to see results.  These people were absolute mugs just as I am afraid I was a mug when I thought that he seriously desired arbitration in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>Heaven knows the agricultural industry has suffered enough now and I keep hoping against hope that even at this late hour the President will take some steps towards bringing <Col N="2769" /> about an accommodation; and there is every reason to believe the people on the other side would be willing to contribute to its coming about.  Of course I agree it is not a suitable moment for them to make an accommodation with us, if we make jingo speeches or foolish declarations; I can see that there is a special difficulty for example in connection with India.  We can see that Mr. Baldwin is having trouble with his die-hards about India, and that he probably would not be in a position to take on more trouble with his die-hards about an Irish accommodation. Therefore it is necessary that if an Irish accommodation is to be brought about, we should refrain from making the position impossible by beating the war drums.  I do not think it is a difficulty which a reasonable man should not be able to overcome.</P>
    <P>I pass from the economic war to another matter in which I have a serious complaint to make of the conduct of the President.  This is the matter of individual liberty here in Ireland.  I have referred to the subject already on the Vote for the Minister for Justice.  I then said that I would refer to it again when the Vote for the President's office came to be discussed.  We have in this country at the present time two semi-military bodies.  There is a great difference between these two bodies; one exists for the express and clear purpose of crushing individual liberty and not only for the express purpose of doing that, but having largely achieved that purpose.  I have had my own individual liberty interfered with by the members of the body calling itself the I.R.A. The other body came into existence for the express object of defending liberty for the individual, not suppressing it, and for securing freedom of speech, and on the whole I consider that it has done a useful and perhaps absolutely indispensable service.  I doubt very much whether there would have been anything like freedom of speech at the last general election had it not been for the existence of that body.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, I am frankly going to say that I do not like its existence in principle, because I do <Col N="2770" /> not like the existence of any political army in principle and I am exceedingly nervous that developments may occur here such as occurred in Germany where you had a number of political armies that in course of time, especially after they started wearing uniforms, were breaking each other's heads and committing the most appalling outrages on inoffensive citizens.  The A.C.A. in its present form came into existence as the result of the I.R.A., just as the Southern Volunteers, before the European war, came into existence as the result of the Ulster Volunteers.  One violence produces another.  One licence produces another.</P>
    <P>Now what has the President done to prevent this state of things arising? What has he done to bring about a situation in which each individual citizen can be the captain of his own soul, can be secure of his own spiritual and physical liberty and need have no fear of any bullying by organised bodies of tyrannisers?  What has he done to prevent military recruiting of any kind?  Has he ever said since he came into office, he who carries so much weight with the youth of the country, has he ever said to or advised any young man to stay out of these bodies?  If he has I have never heard him nor have I seen him reported as having said so.  I allege that there are large numbers of the President's followers who are glad to see this organisation in existence and who do not wish it to be discouraged.  They wish it indeed to refrain from interfering with them, to refrain from making trouble during their period of power, but they want it to be there too as&mdash; to use an image that I used before&mdash; a mastiff on a chain that can be let out whenever they think a suitable time comes for it to be let out.  It is a force that they want to be there in case the time arrives for them to make use of it for their own purposes.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the President that that is not worthy of him and that it is not worthy of the reputation that he has gained in foreign countries which he has been visiting: a reputation as being a man in touch with world ideas and with world polities, not <Col N="2771" /> living in isolation, but capable of drawing lessons from elsewhere, a man who wishes this country to be considered on a level with any other country, a man who wishes this country to be a first-class country with first-class ideas of liberty, of honesty, decency, freedom of speech and freedom of thought.  It is not worthy of him to continue to allow this state of things to develop.  I submit to his earnest attention that besides taking the steps that he ought to have taken long ago to bring an end to the economic conflict which is absolutely ruining the main industry of this country, he should also take steps to bring about a healthy state of public opinion and put an end to this marching and counter-marching and let us live like men in other lands under conditions of liberty and decency and with freedom of speech.</P>

      <P>There was a custom here, whether it was good or bad, set by our predecessors.  It is suggested now that we should have at the start the explanation of the Government's policy.  I would like if Deputy O'Sullivan would point out an instance in which on the Vote for the President's office Government policy was set out at the beginning.  It is possible that it was set out as the result of criticism at the end.  As far as our policy is concerned, there is no need to set it out.  It was set out to the electorate on two occasions within a year and a half.  In the election in which we were first returned we told the people in very definite terms what our policy was; and in the first year of office we proceeded to carry it out as rapidly as we could.  At the end of that period we went to the people, <Col N="2772" /> having done and having started that policy in certain respects, and asked the people to return us again in order to complete that policy both in regard to our economic programme and in regard to the question of external relations, which has been the subject of remarks by the two speakers who have just spoken.</P>
      <P>It is very interesting to hear these Deputies talk about making settlements. Of course, we know they are geniuses.  They are wonderful people these, who can tell you at election time that within three days they will make a settlement.  I remember reading a document of Deputy MacDermot's in Athlone which he published at that time telling us that it could be done. I remember asking him how it could be done.  Of course, all we have to do is to go over to England and say: &ldquo;Dear Mr. Thomas, I am really very fond of you; won't you make a settlement so that I can go back to the Irish people and tell them what a great fellow I am?&rdquo;  It is most interesting to hear them talk and say that they are going to make a settlement in three days, but they never told the people on what terms the settlement would be made. I could make a settlement quite easily in the sense of making a settlement satisfactory to the British, but we want a settlement that would be consistent with the rights of the Irish people; and I suggest that the only way in which that settlement can be got is by the Irish people showing that they will not have any other kind of settlement, and that is what they have been doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion was that somehow I stood in the way, and blocked some settlement that was made at Ottawa.  I may be wrong with regard to Deputy MacDermot, but I think he suggested something of that sort also.  Will any Deputy tell us definitely in what manner it is suggested that I stopped a settlement? There was no such offer of a settlement at Ottawa or anywhere else.  The only offer of a settlement we have ever got is that we should go into a Dominion court, and equally we have said definitely &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  This is the only offer we have ever got. Mr. Thomas, of course, talks of the open door.  There is a very open door here, too; but in our regard, we believe that these moneys are rightfully ours, and we are not going to pay until it is proved very definitely that they are due from us.  That is our position, and there will be no settlement until it is clearly understood on the other side that that is our attitude, and that it is the attitude of the vast majority of the Irish people. Deputy MacDermot went around suggesting that if we were prepared to pay £15,000,000 or £20,000,000, a settlement could be made on that basis, and because Deputy MacDermot thinks that by talking softly like that to the British we will be able to make a settlement, is there any reason for us to believe that a settlement can be made on that basis?  Why is it that we have got to be offering all the time?  Is it not time now, one would think, that an offer ought to come from the other side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever a suggestion of negotiation was made we responded, and I, for one, am not going to respond again, simply to sit on the opposite side of the table, until I see that there is something going to come out of it. We went over several times, and we have something better to do than giving each other's points of view ten times across a table.  Everybody know what the question is.  What is involved is that payments of £5,250,000 roughly were being made out of this <Col N="2776" /> country, and have been made for years, and wrongly made, made without the reason why being put either before this House or the Irish people; made on the basis of a settlement, the terms of which were never before this House.  Because they were not before this House, and were not ratified by this House, and because they were unjust payments fundamentally, we do not propose to make these payments, or to continue to make them.  Over £50,000,000 of Irish money has already been paid during the period of the previous Administration.  If justice were done, what we should be looking for is a return of this £50,000,000 or the greater part of it now.  Why should we go and make an offer?  If a man has got property which he believes is his own, what is the proper thing for him to do?  To hold it.  If anybody else has a claim to it, let him make good that claim.  Our policy, as was suggested, is not one of ill-will.  Of course, it was suggested, by those who wanted to misrepresent the Irish people, that the age-old conflict between this country and Great Britain was due to Irish ill-will. Because the Irish people stood up for their own rights, because they said the British had no right, good, bad, or indifferent, to any part of this country, because they said that which was a fact, they were abused by other people, who said: &ldquo;This is simply hatred of England.&rdquo;  I do not believe the Irish people who struggled against England at any time hated her in that sense.  They hated iniquity and domination by a stranger and their efforts were directed to getting rid of that.  The Irish people have never been the aggressors in that fight. Never throughout their history have they been the aggressors.</P>
    <P>What right have the British in this country?  What right have they to demand these moneys from us?  I say they have none.  As long, at any rate, as we are here representing the Irish people, we are not going to recognise that they have any right to these moneys.  They say they have.  Then let them prove they are right in an impartial court, if they have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Money is the only difficulty that we have immediately raised, anyhow, at the moment&mdash;at the moment, because there is a bigger question at issue between the two countries&mdash;I do not deny that for a moment&mdash;than the question of money; an issue which will yet be won out by the Irish people.  That issue is, that no foreign power has any right over any single part of the territory of this country.  We may not be able to win out and make that right effective to-day, but as long as that right remains without having effect, as long as a foreign power claims to dominate a single foot of the territory of this country, Great Britain may know that there will be an effort made by Irishmen to get them out of it.  That is the fundamental position.  As far as we are concerned, there is no indication of ill-will, except that we are not going, in so far as we are able to get rid of it, tamely to submit to having a foreign country exercising any form of domination over any part of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>British publicists suggested that they would like to be on friendly terms with this country and would like to have the issue between these countries solved once and for all. Nobody wishes that more than I do&mdash; nobody in this country, I believe, could possibly wish more than I do to have this fight settled.  But I have sense enough to know that there is only one way in which it can be settled and that is by those who are the invaders and intruders getting out.  That is the way to get it settled. When they are out, then there will be a possibility of co-operation and of working together with the real goodwill of neighbours.  I do hold that, and I always believed it.  Any settlement which falls short of that will never be completely satisfactory. From day to day we have to put up with things, submit to things, but we do it with no more good will than others who have to submit to interference from an outside Government. There is no ill-will in the sense that <Col N="2778" /> we are animated by hatred against the British as such.  Wherever there is dislike or hatred, if you like, it is against the imposition of foreign rule in any regard on our people.</P>
    <P>I made a public statement to the British to the effect that if there is to be a complete and final settlement, and if there is to be real good will and co-operation between the people of this country and Great Britain, then certain fundamental things will have to be satisfied.  The unity of this country is essential before we will ever get a complete and final settlement with England.  Those who are looking for a complete and final settlement on any other terms, and who want to bury the hatchet, as they say, completely, will have to realise that that can never be. Two, three or four of us on these benches might be foolish enough to think that, because we wished it, it can be done.  Nothing of the kind.</P>
    <P>The Irish people, in that regard, are animated by the same spirit that the British would be if the Germans had won the last war and had brought part of Great Britain into the German Empire against the will of the British people.  Do you think that there would not be people in England always who would say: &ldquo;We are going to struggle until we get back our freedom&rdquo;?  Of course they would.  The people of France paid a big price for their freedom in the security that they tried to effect in various ways.  The people of other countries who have been free are willing to pay a big price for their freedom.  The price that subject peoples have to pay is the cost of the constant endeavour to get back their freedom.  The Irish people recognise, and have recognised it through the centuries, that the struggle they have had to make to get that freedom was worth while.  I am perfectly certain that no matter what may be done by us, or what might be done by the Opposition, if they were in our place, as long as&mdash; to use the phrase of a famous Irishman&mdash;grass grows or water runs, so long will there be people in this country who will strive for Irish freedom, if it is denied.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise these facts. <Col N="2779" /> There is no use in burying our heads in the sand and thinking that some sort of gesture towards Mr. Thomas, or something of that sort, is going to finish this.  It is not going to finish it.  This contest between Great Britain and Ireland will be finished when those who are the aggressors and the invaders make up their minds that it is not in their interests, and that it is not right to continue that aggression and invasion.  We do not want anything from England.  We are not taking anything belonging to England. We are simply holding our own.  I said, in answer to British publicists who spoke about a final settlement&mdash; something that would really enable this country and the people in this country to settle down in peace and co-operation with their neighbours across the water&mdash;that one of the essentials for the unity of this country was the ending of partition.  That may not be secured in our day, but until it is secured then that co-operation between the two countries that the English publicists spoke about and say they desire, cannot be got.</P>
    <P>There is then, if you wish to go into it, a wider sphere as to the relations between those two countries; there is a wider question than the money question, but the immediate difficulty is that money question, and there are no dicussions which we have had yet which went beyond that sphere.  We went to London to a Conference and the terms of reference were on the note.  We went in connection with this financial matter.  We put our point of view, and they put theirs.  There was no chance, apparently, of getting agreement and we came home.  I see no use whatever in going into any of these conferences if the mere purpose of them is for each of us to state our case again.  We know that that is no use.  They know our side and we know theirs.  That is with regard to external affairs.</P>
    <P>Another matter referred to by Deputy MacDermot was the question, I think, of individual liberty.  I claim that there is probably no other country in the world at the present time <Col N="2780" /> in which there is a greater amount of individual liberty.</P>

      <P>There may be licence in liberty and it is possible that some gentlemen think that they can take licence with liberty and try to do something such as they have seen done on the Continent.  We tell these gentlemen that they will not be allowed to do it.  We are anxious to see individual liberty and free expression of opinion, but we are not unmindful at all of developments and we are not unmindful at all of the aims, so far as we can judge them, of certain people, and the moment we are satisfied that any actions on the part of these gentlemen become really dangerous, then, you may be perfectly certain that the liberty of the people as a whole will be defended, and defended with all the forces at our command.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made, on more than one occasion, my position and the position of the Government, clear.  When our predecessors were in office I always thought of them as people who had tremendous resources at their command, and having these resources, they behaved as if they did not have them. They behaved as if a big man were dealing with a child, and they used their brute strength where there was no need whatever to use it.  We have had peace, at any rate, in this country. We have had more liberty, more security in this country than they had for ten years before.  And why should Deputies be so anxious that that position should change?  Is it not obvious that no Government, with any sense of responsibility and any desire to see liberty being preserved, would take action only until they are compelled to take it, until in their judgment there is development taking place which would mean conflict finally?  I do not believe at the present time there is likely to be a conflict, but I said on previous occasions that we are not going to permit people to parade in uniform, and we <Col N="2781" /> are not.  That is definite.  We are not going to allow people to parade in uniform.  When it comes to that stage, we believe that it has come to a dangerous stage, and it is the duty of the Government to step in.</P>

      <P>We will get back to the rumours again&mdash;the rumours about the settlement.  I was surprised to hear that the rumours came from anybody on our side.  I take the Deputy's word for it, but no member of the Executive Council was responsible for any such rumours.  We have said from the beginning to the Irish people that if they want to get their rights they will have to be prepared to stand for them.  Anybody can surrender; it is very easy to do that.  It is not easy, when there are aggressors about, to hold your own, but we believe we can, and I believe that settlement will come quickly only when it is clear that those who are the aggressors will not succeed in their aggression.  That is the only way to make a settlement.  Anybody at any time can surrender.  There is no doubt that the former Executive Council, if they came over here, could surrender their rights as they did before.  Deputy Hogan, the former Minister for Agriculture, used to come along and tell us of the good bargain we could make.  He is a good judge. They told us before that they made a great bargain, &ldquo;a big nought,&rdquo; but it turned out that there were five other noughts and a five in front of them.</P>

I went to them at that time and also when the Boundary settlement was made.  There were two things outstanding in the Treaty; the Boundary was one of them.

We have the power, we know, to meet any people who try to interfere with our authority, and because we are conscious of the forces at our command we do not mean to use those forces until it is absolutely necessary, and there is no one in the country need have the slightest fear that because our attitude is one of giving as much liberty as possible that either irresponsibility or shakiness is preventing us from action.

      <P>As I said, only two points have been raised.  The general policy of the Government I have indicated.  We genuinely desire to be on friendly terms with Great Britain, but we want the conditions satisfied, the only conditions on which the two peoples can be on good terms.  I do not see that we are the aggressors in this matter.  We simply say to the British: &ldquo;Will you for goodness' sake cease your aggression?&rdquo; They have been asked by generations of Irish people to stop that aggression, and have been told that there will then be genuine peace between the two countries.  I say that we, who take up that attitude, are fundamentally more friendly to the British than those who pretend that they can be friendly with Britain by getting some sort of settlement.  Our attitude towards Britain is one of peace and goodwill.  I think it would be to the advantage of our people, and to the British people, if we as neighbours co-operated in the things that are of common interest to us, but we must be the judges as to the extent to which that co-operation should go, just as they are at liberty on their side, to agree to the extent that they should co-operate.  If there is to be co-operation, it must be between two equal, independent people who co-operate on a basis of mutual advantage. That is what we are striving to get.  We believe there is only one way, in view of the whole history of the relations between Britain and ourselves, to get that co-operation, and that is an acknowledgment by Britain, that the people of this country are completely free.</P>

      <P>The two matters which have been discussed by the President in his speech have been so inextricably mixed that I find a difficulty in approaching the subject with the solemnity that is due to it. However I shall take the last matter to which he referred as it is present to my mind.  He says there has been no intimidation, there has been no disorder, that there is peace, order and so on throughout the country. I have never made public any complaint against the Ministry in respect to the maintenance of order in the country, but I shall give my own experience.  I went to my constituency after the General Election in 1932.  I believe I secured more first preference votes than were cast for any other person in that election.  There may be a dispute between myself and the Lord Mayor of Dublin in that connection, and I bow to him if there be anything in his favour.</P>

      <P>I addressed a meeting in my constituency, but I could not be heard.  They were not Cork citizens who interrupted me.  They came in from outside.  I do not know why order was not kept at the meeting, or why it should not have been kept, but I do say that until that moment the organisation which has been mentioned here to-night did not come into existence to help to preserve for the people of this country the liberty of speech which has been guaranteed by the Constitution.  I got no representation, apology or excuse from the Executive Council in connection with that.  It was due to me having regard to the fact that I delivered them after the Civil War, alive and well, every one of them. What was my experience during the late electoral contest?  I was informed when I was having a meeting in Cork, going into the city, not to enter by a certain road, that there was danger of an ambush and the information came from the Fianna Fáil headquarters. I was to approach Cork by a circuitous route, and at a later time.  My meeting was held up in Cork for an hour and a half.  On <Col N="2789" /> the following morning I was informed that I was to be escorted to Dublin by a procession, a whole pilgrimage of military and police&mdash;an armoured car, two military units, and a C.I.D. car, so that anybody travelling the country could see that there was no chance of that person being elected anyhow.  That was on the advice of the man who tells us he knows of conditions in the country.</P>
      <P>Look at the mockery of it.  A fortnight afterwards I was approached at my own house by a military officer, who asked me: &ldquo;Are you going out to-day, sir?&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;  He then told me the name of a high officer who expressed a wish that I should not go out on that day.  I said &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and he replied: &ldquo;I cannot tell you, sir, but he wishes that you would not go out.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;The day I cannot go out of my own house is not worth living in this country.  I am going out.&rdquo;  I went out and walked for an hour and a half.  On looking round, what should I see?  A lorry load of troops with tin hats.  Was not that a nice spectacle?  And the President of the Executive Council says there is liberty in this country!</P>

None at all. There was a military guard on my house, and they removed in a month. The necessity for the demonstration had passed, and the mockery had then got to cease.  So much for law and order.  It is due to the Executive Council, the inefficiency, the incapacity of it, the fact that the people of this country have got no confidence in the members of it, that there has been created an organisation which will ensure liberty for the people.  Had the Executive Council not any information that the military cars that accompanied me to Kerry when I was visiting that county, were bashed from one end to the other, and the glass broken in them, on an occasion when I addressed a meeting either in Listowel <Col N="2790" /> or Tralee?

I quoted here in this House statements that were made by the President when he was in Opposition, in connection with that time and they were much more damaging than the £19,000,000.  But the £19,000,000 was mentioned.  And £19,000,000 was not the sum that the British asked for in 1925, but a very much higher sum.  Those people who pride themselves upon their knowledge <Col N="2791" /> of figures should not commit such an egregious blunder as to confuse £150,000,000 with £19,000,000.</P>

      <P>I went to London, the statement having been made by the President of the Executive Council here who was then outside the Dáil.  The Dáil was untouchable at that time.  We were liable for £19,000,000 he said and he warned the Irish people about the Bill that was going to be put upon us.  What are the facts of the case?  The facts are that our liability in respect of Article V of the Treaty was eliminated from the Constitution, we undertaking to pay the damage to which the British were put, amounting to £5,000,000.  Otherwise we paid the whole cost of the Anglo-Irish War here, in so far as the damage was concerned, excepting personal injuries.  What was the Dáil told on the occasion on which the amendment of the Treaty was proposed here in 1925 by me?  They were told the case that had been put up to the British.  What was it?  The case was very simple.  We had to pay £3,000,000 a year for Land Commission Annuities and, approximately, £2,000,000 in pensions.  That was £5,000,000 that was going out of this country, and I stated that we could afford no more.  That was stated here on the night the Second Reading was passed.

What is the basis of this dispute?  There is the President protesting to the dispute, that particular Agreement of 1925 which relieves this country of its responsibility for the public debt.  Is the President protesting to the British that he is to reopen that and take back the Nationalists of the North and take back the Border, or push it back five, ten, or 25 yards? Not likely.

You can go over now and say: &ldquo;Gentlemen, we are reopening the whole business: we are starting from scratch again.&rdquo;  There has been no suggestion that you are going to do that.  I would like to see you do it.  I would like to see you facing the £19,000,000 per annum that the people were warned about.  Now they are more silent about Article XII.

We know the discreditable methods adopted here by these know-alls.  The President cannot but know the condition of affairs in this country.  They will exercise impartial treatment towards all citizens.  We know now that there is to be no settlement.  We know now that all their speeches were bunk.  There is one thing that Fianna Fáil have not learned yet, and that is whether it is paying this country to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows all about that&mdash;the man who would die in the last ditch before he would come in here!  He sailed in like the celebrated bachelor who on one occasion when he heard there was to be a tax on bachelors said: &ldquo;If there is, there is no man in this State who will not go in and ring down his five dollars on the counter and say &lsquo;hang the expense, it is worth it all.&rsquo;&rdquo;  In fact most of the trouble over there on the Government Benches is that they did not come in long before, that it was a waste of time.  Where do we stand?  Where are we going with this dispute?  We are standing on our rights!  Well, there are a great many people in lunatic asylums who are doing the same thing. But let us sit down calmly, make up accounts, and say whether or not it is costing us more to continue the dispute than even to pay the £5,000,000.  Is not that a fair suggestion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question; that can be decided also.  It is not the most important matter at all. I should say from my knowledge of affairs, and as a man reading what has transpired at the Economic Conference, and examining the speeches made over in Great Britain, that the subject can be approached and the case properly presented and a case made for the exceptional circumstances of the country, or of the two countries without <Col N="2795" /> any provocative treatment of the matter, with a simple-mindedness and without introducing personalities, I observe a disposition rather to indulge in these personalities than deal with the subject in dispute.  It would be up to the British just as well as it would be up to us to settle.  They might come down very much from their present status and they might not be unreasonable if it was pointed out to them that the future relations, and the present relations, which exist in the present Commonwealth of Nations, is their concern as well as ours.  There are legal questions here, and the majority of the people in this country will not be satisfied unless there is a pronouncement upon those legal questions by some other persons.  They have that duty in respect of the great difficulties on both sides; they are bigger than we are and they have more resources than we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer to fight the British upon any other question than on their cash box.  Members of the Party opposite too will ultimately come to the conclusion that it is not wise to fight what is perhaps the most financially sound country in the whole world at this moment.  That is what the issue is.  There are our natural markets.  We must sell what we have got to sell.  We cannot expend money and resources in trying to get other markets and if we did and if we had them, would it profit us as it would to keep the one that we do want?  Now after all the heat and turmoil of the last 12 months let us, as businessmen, examine exactly, and as nearly as we can what are the disadvantages of this contest during that 12 months.  Let us balance these disadvantages with the advantages we have derived.  Let us consider whether or not it might be to our interest or not to present to the British our case, not as a request if you like, not as a kind of contest to be entered into by two people one of whom must yield but to approach the subject in a natural businesslike way and with the idea that this thing should be settled in a proper statesmanlike manner.  Let all the <Col N="2796" /> past be done with.  Let us reopen this matter and settle it without noise and without flag waving, having an eye entirely to the best interests of the country.  That is the spirit that should be in evidence and the most enthusiastic of all people in the country who wish to see reunion always postulate that pretty well in advance.  I would like to see that spirit very much nearer.  It might be that by approaching this subject in that statesmanlike way we would bring that very much nearer.</P>
    <P>The longer this particular quarrel lasts, the less desire there will be on the part of certain people in the other part of Ireland to join with us.  And the less that desire exists the more remote is the possibility of union.  It is no use to them to come in and be united with us if the reunion be one in which suspicion remains on both sides, because the greatest obstacle to putting an end to our long quarrel would be suspicion on both sides.  The allaying of suspicion in the negotiators, and those besides the negotiators, and the allaying of that suspicion between Great Britain and ourselves would do much to allay suspicion and objection on the part of some of our fellow countrymen in the North.  It is not to be allayed by the experience we have gained in the last 12 months by saying that the people on the other side have not made money out of it either.  If our purchasing capacity is lessened, they also have lost and surely it is to their interest to see that state of things pass.  If that were done it would bring much nearer the project for peace and reconciliation in this country than a dozen general elections.</P>

Yes. &ldquo;Cannot you come back and say you have scored over this man?&rdquo;  That is the real reason why the Boundary was accepted, and the Six Counties given away.  That is the reason why, six months after the secret agreement of March, 1926, they attempted to confirm the previous agreement of 1923 so that Deputy Cosgrave might come back and say &ldquo;we have made a damn good bargain,&rdquo; so that he might be able to deceive and delude the people even as he did here to-night towards the conclusion of his speech.</P>

He gave away, in the agreement of 1923, £11,000,000 more than the British themselves demanded. His Minister for Finance subsequently in 1926 confirmed that agreement by his signature also.  They endeavoured so far as they could by their loyal and secret acts to endeavour to bind the Irish people in these agreements.  And the reason once again was that they might obey the injunctions of their <Col N="2798" /> British friends, come back and tell the Irish people that they had scored over this man.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave opened his speech in a rather melodramatic frame of mind.  He told us about the terrible happening in Cork on the night of the election.  I happened to be in Cork on that occasion.  Deputy Cosgrave has told us about rumours that came to him from Fianna Fáil headquarters that he was going to be attacked on the road.  I was in the Fianna Fáil headquarters and I can tell what was the opinion about that episode there. It was the common knowledge of every one of them that members of the organisation with which Deputies opposite are associated, following up the old dodge that had been tried in every general election and by-election that was held in this country during the time that Deputy Cosgrave was head of the Government, had planned to have a sham ambush&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary that members opposite should be so anxious, at this stage, to disavow the tactics they adopted through the preceding elections.  After all, the people of this State have memories. They can put two and two together and when they see occurrences continuously associated with each other in a way that cannot be ascribed to mere coincidence, but that, logically, could only be put down to definite planning; when they see that, at the general election of 1923, we had the same sort of story; when they see that, at the two elections of 1927, we had at these armed outrages and unknown individuals attacking prominent members of the then Government; when they see, at every by-election, people shot in Dublin and incidents occurring here and there, and every one of these occurrences made the excuse for filling the streets with troops, for parading armoured cars and for sending men out with all the panoply of war, in order to intimidate and cow the electors and to induce the people to believe that this State was living on the brink of revolution; when we know they did that at the first election at which they were beaten in 1932, is it surprising that reasonable men should credit the statement that they were planning to do that again in 1933, that the old tactics were going to be pursued once more and that, when they had been talking about Communism and disorder and revolution and revolt and public turmoil and civil strife they were going, so far as they could ensure it, to give to the election all the appearances of that state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say, and I repeat, that, so far from any information of the sort having been conveyed to Deputy Cosgrave from the Fianna Fáil headquarters in Cork, on the contrary, the general belief and opinion in Fianna Fáil quarters in Cork, on the eve of the election, was that there was to be, as I have said, a sham attack made upon Deputy Cosgrave <Col N="2801" /> by members of the organisation whose conduct, by whatever else it may have been characterised during that election, was not characterised by any desire to preserve public peace or order.</P>

Admittedly, Deputy Cosgrave may have been escorted by a strong force through Cork; admittedly, he may have been escorted, after the election, through the streets of the city by a strong guard, but it was not the first time that Deputy Cosgrave enjoyed such an escort.  When he was President of the Executive Council, and when the members of his Front Bench were members of that Executive Council, in what way did they go around the streets of the city and in what way did they go around this country? <Col N="2802" /> Was it as humble individuals anxious to walk the public streets?  Oh, no. They went around in armed cars with machine guns, as Deputy Mulcahy told us the other day.  It was not an unusual sight during the election, when they were on the hustings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made a statement which I regard as of some importance.  He stated that until we came back into practical politics they went round this country unescorted and unarmed, and when we came back to practical politics, and when we were challenging the Cumann na nGaedheal Party for the control of the resources of this State, then the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, as I have stated, adopted this as an electioneering plank, and as an electioneering dodge; when they could go around posing as strong men, men who were in danger from these turbulent forces they were endeavouring to subdue, attended by armed cars and providing themselves with armed guards, military escorts, and soldiers with tin hats, to which Deputy Cosgrave in 1933, takes such strong exception.  He took no exception to these precautions from 1927 to 1933. He could not have walked the streets <Col N="2803" /> of Dublin in 1931.  I say he could have walked them, but he did not choose to walk the streets of Dublin in 1931 as an ordinary private citizen.  That would not be effective at all; it would not help him to sustain the rôle which he was playing, as one of the preservers of the public peace in this country.  If these escorts were a mere demonstration in 1933, they were much more a demonstration in 1927 and 1931, after Fianna Fáil, in the words of Deputy Mulcahy &ldquo;was coming back into practical politics.&rdquo;</P>

He asked: &ldquo;What is the cause of the dispute?&rdquo;  Let us examine it precisely. At the very utmost it can only be costing this country what the bounties amount to, £2,450,000.  Why do I say that?  Because responsible members of the British Government, people who are in a much better position than Deputy Brennan, Deputy Minch, or any Deputy opposite&mdash; except possibly Deputy Belton, who has a mission on all matters&mdash;to know and to weigh up the cost, and the relative advantage to this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They have raised it as high as it could be raised by any artificial restriction. Yet, what is the position in Great Britain to-day when the British farmer is having even that limited chance in the British market?  I told the House what the <i>Irish Times</i> had said of the situation.  Here is what the <i>Daily Mail</i>, of 11th July, says about it:</P>

What is the moral that the Opposition must draw from that?  Are you going to ask us to believe that the British Government is going to have no care for the British farmer or the British people, that they are going to allow the British farmer to be driven out of the industry altogether, with the result that the land of the British farmer will become unlettable and that British men will starve if something is not done quickly.

If that was the case, why should they be annoyed? Should they not be pleased because these export bounties and subsidies were, at all events, making their task easier to that extent?

But does not the Senator's description <Col N="2809" /> of the feeling in Great Britain with regard to these tariffs, do not the pronouncements of Major Elliott and Mr. Baldwin with regard to the effect of the subsidies, does not the fact that they are considering the questions of quotas&mdash;do not these things at once explode the whole of the hypothesis upon which Opposition propaganda throughout the country during the past 12 months has been based: that these tariffs were due to the fact that we were withholding the land annuities and that the present attempt to keep the Irish farmer out of the British market was motivated merely by the desire to collect what was due? Is it not plain that it was nothing of the sort&mdash;that while the land annuities might be made the excuse for putting on the tariffs, they were not the real reason the tariffs were put on?</P>

      <P>To come back to what Deputy Cosgrave said, let us examine the balance of the account. Whether we held the land annuities or not, the restrictions would have been put on.  We would have had to do what every Dominion inside the Commonwealth has had to do&mdash;to submit voluntarily, or involuntarily, to some restriction being imposed upon us.  We would have to take the same position as Canada and Australia and other countries have done&mdash;as the Argentine and Denmark have done. We would have to agree in order to give the British farmer a chance, and our export trade to Great Britain would be reduced in volume and in value, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether we keep the land annuities or pay them, the condition of the British farmer and British agriculture is such that any agricultural country wishing to sell its produce in Great Britain will inevitably have to accept some restriction upon its exports to that country.  Then where would we be after those restrictions have been imposed, if we were still paying the land annuities and £5,250,000 which we have withheld?  We would still be paying that money and we would have nothing for it.  Examine, as Deputy <Col N="2810" /> Cosgrave says, this account and see how we stand.  At most, the dispute about the land annuities is costing us £2,450,000 a year, if it costs us even as much as that.  Before this Government came into office we had extensive commitments in the dairying industry, commitments of huge capital sums, and we would have had to provide a subsidy.  As Deputy Hogan, when he was Minister for Agriculture, realised, he would have ultimately to provide a subsidy for Irish butter if we were going to keep the British market for that commodity.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I say that the dispute is not even costing us as much as £2,450,000 a year.  That is the very limit at which it can be placed. Against that we withhold in this country at least £5,250,000, and when you subtract £2,450,000 from that sum you see there is a balance, and, thank God, as far as the Irish people are concerned, that balance is on the right side of the account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister for Finance, and, while listening to him I was struck by the fact that if he went in less for noise, we might get a little more sense.  If he would take advice from an humble member of the Opposition, he would certainly keep off agriculture.  We know he has not been a success at finance.  Let him find some other subject with which he can deal.  The last man in either Party entitled to talk of agriculture, the man who, by his talk, displays least knowledge of the real conditions in the country at the moment, is the Minister for Finance. Even with regard to Fianna Fáil Deputies, I am pushing the open door when I state that, owing to the tariffs imposed by the British Government, the farmers in this country are being faced with bankruptcy.  The President has repeatedly shown far more appreciation of the suffering of the farmers, and the real conditions that exist in the farming community, than has the Minister for Finance.  Time and again he has repeated the fact that they are undergoing hardship, that they are up against a very tough struggle, that their profits are falling as a result of <Col N="2811" /> those tariffs, but that they must be endured in order to bring the economic war to a successful termination.</P>
      <P>His glib-tongued, noisy Minister gets up here at the end of July, 1933, when his own Party are in the same position to contradict him as I am, and he tries to make a case that the farmers are, in fact, losing nothing, and that the bounties are equalising the tariffs. Is one to be surprised at the bad conditions in the country when you have the important Department of Finance in charge of a man who argues that 35/- is equal to £6?  That kind of twaddle, accompanied by noise and gesture, may sound well, but not to the people who are paying £6.  Let the Minister advance that argument to any farmer, and he will get an answer that I would be slow to give him here. And all this on the one Vote of the year that gives Ministers the greatest scope for explaining to the Dáil and to the country what is their policy.</P>
      <P>We had this kind of twaddle from the Minister for Finance, and we had from the President, I regret to say, as contemptible an exhibition of double-shuffling as ever took place on a front bench in any country.  We had an absolute failure to face up to the facts, and we had an absolute funk to state the policy of the Executive Council.  We had one step in advance, and one step back, and as a result we had a kind of stagnant twist with which we are getting rather familiar in Presidential statements latterly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had one statement from the President's lips this evening that stands out clearly, and I think it is a statement on which this House should ask for more information.  We had a statement from the President, the man who bragged to us of all the forces at his command, that arms would not be allowed to be carried in public in this country.  Three times in the course of his statement he repeated that his Government would not allow people to carry arms in public.  The President is a great master of phrase; he is a great master of quibble; he is a man who, in every expression he uses, can <Col N="2812" /> escape either through the front door or through the back door.  I think this House is entitled to a clear explanation as to why those words &ldquo;in public&rdquo; were added to that statement every time it was made, and it was made on three occasions. Is the President such a simple soul that he believes, looking back on the recent history of this country, that the man carrying arms to do any foul or cowardly deed carries those arms in public display?  The President has more sense than that, and the President knows that there would be less harm, less evil, and less danger associated with arms, if they were carried on all cocasions publicly.</P>
    <P>I would far rather have a pronouncement from the Government Front Bench, and I believe it would make for the safety of the country, and for the safety of the individuals who have to live in the country, if we got a clear pronouncement of public policy, compelling every able-bodied man to carry arms and to carry them openly. Such a statement would mean more safety for the ordinary citizens of this country than a sneakish Presidential pronouncement to his own allies, to his own tools, that as long as they do not carry the guns openly they are free to carry them.  That statement to-night does not stand just alone.  We had a previous pronouncement by the same individual that all the forces at his command would be used to prevent the importation of arms&mdash;not to prevent the use of arms, not to prevent the use of arms as a threat or argument, not to prevent the quiet secret carrying of arms, but to prevent the importation of arms.  That was a safe and a smug statement, after, by his inactivity and by his spineless rule in this country, he had secured a condition where every follower of his own had already procured arms in order to intimidate or to threaten the life of others.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who hold that neither wealth nor prosperity nor trade nor progress in any direction matters one whit if the life and property of the individual in this country are not safe.  I believe all sides of this House will agree with me, that our <Col N="2813" /> very traditions, the very successful revolution that brought this State into being, the aftermath of that revolution, and the years that went by since are years that should warn every one of us of the dangers and evils associated with arms.  They should warn every one of us what a curse it is to a country such as this to have that kind of spinelessness on top, that failure to grasp the realities of the situation, and that failure to face the dangers of the situation.</P>
    <P>I say, as I said before, that this country can only be saved one way or the other.  It can only be saved through a courageous Government&mdash; backed up by all those great services which the President spoke about, and for which I have, I think, more respect than the President&mdash;insuring that no man is allowed to possess or carry a gun, whether he carries it in public or not; or alternatively, if the Government is not prepared to protect individuals from the secret menace of the secret gun, then it should insure that at least there is equality, that every man is bound to carry his gun and to carry it openly.  There would be no such thing as street murder; there would be no such thing as murder on the public highway, if every man going on the highway was, by law, the possessor and carrier of a gun.  I do not particularly desire that state of affairs, but I do urge that it has got to be one way or the other. That kind of weak-kneed pronouncement, whistling one tune to the Dáil and whistling another in the ears of the armed men outside, is one of the greatest curses that could be inflicted on a country.  That kind of left-handed incitement to individuals to carry guns, provided they do not carry them in public, is one of the most damaging statements that could be made in a country such as this, in times such as these.</P>
    <P>If any mistake was made by the President, if the repetition of that particular phrase was made in error, or the clear meaning it had to this House &mdash;and the clearer meaning it will have to the organisations outside this House&mdash;was a mistaken one, I hope, before this debate ends that either <Col N="2814" /> himself or some responsible Minister on his behalf will get up and clear the air; that we will get a clear declaration, which would be the first since Fianna Fáil came into office, that the law as it is made by this Dáil and as it exists in the country is going to be carried out by the Government; that the criminal who commits a crime in secret is going to be dealt with as rigidly and as strongly as the man who does it in the open, and that it will be made clear that membership of any organisation, whether it has politically aided the Government in the past or not, is no excuse for defying the laws that are made by this Dáil, and no excuse for defying the laws that are supposed to be administered by that Government over there.</P>
    <P>We got from the President a long lecture on how to negotiate.  I submit, and I think everyone in this House will agree with me, that he is the one man in this country who is entitled to deliver a lecture on how not to negotiate.  He may have his good qualities.  He may have many great characteristics, but the outstanding success of that man in life was never associated with negotiation.  At home or abroad&mdash;and Members of his side as well as Deputies on this side know that&mdash;on no single occasion in the public life of the President has he ever brought a negotiation to a successful termination.  Even negotiation, not between two countries in the depths of an economic war, when passions are roused and people are hurt and injured, but with regard to divisions and dissensions inside the camp of his own followers every time he put his hand to negotiation he made the situation worse, and the tragedy of the last 18 months is that a man who might be successful in other directions but who has been repeatedly proved an abject failure as a negotiator, jostled away from the negotiating tables better men in that line than himself who took control when he himself had failed as he always did before.  That is the man that stands up here to-night to deliver a lecture on how to negotiate. Following on that, it was not right or in keeping with that atmosphere when the Minister for Finance gave us a <Col N="2815" /> lecture on agriculture and agricultural prices.  &ldquo;Like master, like man.&rdquo;  But I think that we ought really to discuss the situation as it exists and to settle down to try and realise that the present situation between this country and England is harmful and injurious to both countries, and that the longer it lasts the more both countries will lose, and, like any drainage test, where the bigger fund is, that country can afford it best and that country can hold out longest, and that the dominating point of this squalid, unnecessary squabble can only be the financial annihilation of the greatest industry of the country.</P>
    <P>We heard the Minister for Finance last night telling us that industry in this country was rather lop-sided, that when Fianna Fáil came into office they found a lop-sided condition of industry &mdash;some 85 per cent. being agricultural and the balance industrial, and their first big attempt to alter that position was to wipe out, in fact, the 85 per cent. industry that was paying.  You probably equalised the proportion of profit-making industry in agriculture as against the rest by bringing down the profitable percentage of agriculture to some 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. to balance the other, but I suggest that is not good business, I suggest that is not sound national economy, and I suggest that the Fianna Fáil Government, now close on two years in office, should have long ago&mdash;in the first year &mdash;seen where these reckless, insane kind of actions were leading the country. Perhaps it could be excused on the ground of political history and insanity.  But in the second year of their office the responsibility should have begun to steady them a bit, and they should see that they have got to wake up to the fact that if all countries adopted the attitude of the President towards negotiation this world would be in one chronic state of wilderness; that if Government Ministers and representatives of different Governments with a controversy between one country and another adopted the same policy as he adopted in this country no controversy could ever be settled by peaceable means, or, <Col N="2816" /> in fact, there would never be a settlement.</P>

      <P>I suggest that negotiation and the effecting of a settlement of international disputes is the hardest work that Government Ministers may be called upon to do, because it tests men.  Any lop-sided lout can make a quarrel and any ignoramus can keep a quarrel on, but it takes men of ability and courage to end a fight, and I would like, although I am opposed to that Front Bench, to see evidence of that type of ability and courage.  Remember it is all very well to indulge in cheap heroics at a crossroads, or, for that matter, at election times&mdash;we can make allowances for that&mdash;but this kind of cheap clap-trap of &ldquo;Up the Republic!&rdquo; our &ldquo;national enemy&rdquo; and our &ldquo;historical enemy is not doing this country any good.  It has done it harm, and is going to continue to do harm, except Government Ministers do what Ministers do all over the world&mdash;meet and bargain on behalf of the people, obtain the best bargain they can, according to the strength of their case, and the courage and principles they are gifted with, and bring it back to the people here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a statement here from the President with regard to the situation in the North&mdash;partition.  Partition is deplorable and is deplored by people on this side of the House as well as on the other side, but the hotch-potch type of statement made here by the President to-night&mdash; mixing up the partition of this country as if that were a part of the old age-long struggle between this country and Great Britain&mdash;can do nothing but real harm.  Everybody on both sides of this House who deplores partition, or the continuance of partition, and realises that mixing up the present partition, which everyone of us must hope is a terminable partition and a temporary one, with the old controversial feuds and the bad blood of centuries gone by, can do nothing but harm <Col N="2817" /> and can have no effect but to make partition more permanent and more lasting than it is at the moment.  That type of irresponsible speech about Orangemen in the North&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Who referred to Orangemen? I think if the Deputy is quoting the President he should quote him accurately.  He has already devoted a large amount of his speech to partition but he did not go to the trouble of getting notes of what the President said.  The President made no reference to Orangemen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mention the President's name in association with or in regard to Orangemen.  The lateness of the hour probably explains the Minister's lack of grasp.  I said the mention of Orangemen can do nothing but harm and can have no effect but to make the rift wider and deeper than it is at present.  I believe the Deputies opposite really hope for the termination of partition, and there are many who would hope for it in spite of the fact that a certain catch-cry would be removed from the political arena, but, if we are ever really to work towards the ending of partition we have got to begin by altering our statements in regard to the North. We have got to begin by recognising and preaching to those who support us and those who follow us that the people in the North though they may differ in religion are just as Irish as the people in the South, and the division between people of the same nation is unnatural and unnational, and by introducing a bit more toleration, a little bit more understanding, and a bit more charity into our remarks on these things, concerning the North of Ireland, then we would be doing something real to terminate partition in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the speech of the last Deputy is the grandest apology that could be made for every connivance on the part of England towards the subjection of this country and for those who have largely contributed to every difficulty that exists on both national and religious matters <Col N="2818" /> dividing the world to-day.  The whole contribution is one argument in favour of his own attitude and the attitude of his Party on this question.  He advocates an adjustment of our affairs with England from the English point of view.  He advocates that every difference with this country is based upon the attitude that we occupy and for which we stand in advocating our rights to the national independence of the country.  He further advocates that all the ills that have flown to this country are due to the same principles &mdash;the principles of this country&mdash;and he subjugates all those rights to the domination of outside authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. O'Higgins might well be excused for that line of argument. He has made very well out of that line of reasoning.  He is to-day in possession of a valuable position of medical officer of health, because he was one of those people who thought that the rights of this country should always be subject to the dictation of an outside authority, and that position brings him in a emolument in the neighbourhood of a £1,000 a year.  If we are to advocate along the same line of argument we could see the value of advocacy of everything material, but if there is nothing greater in life than that, then all our ideals are a failure. I suggest for his consideration that he might well consider that if these are the only arguments of importance, he himself to-day would not be a Deputy of this House nor any House, nor would he be in possession of the emoluments coming to him as medical officer of health under the authority of the Dáil.  He refers to the settlement of the economic differences that exist between this country and England and he blames the responsibility for non-settlement on our policy.  I have waited for the reasons that he might give in justification of that.  They were not forthcoming.  It was merely a general statement that the policy of Fianna Fáil was responsible for the continuance and existence of those economic problems.  I suggest to him as a medium of consideration that if he would only look back on the records <Col N="2819" /> that exist for the past five or ten years, he would find the responsibility was not due to the Government in existence to-day, or the Government in existence for the past two years, but would be due entirely and with full responsibility upon the Government that existed before us, and the Government he supported and the Party he supports now in Opposition plus the support that is always forthcoming to any renegade Irishman who advocates the interests of England against our own country. The economic problems are directly due to the policy carried on and advocated by Cumann na nGaedheal while they were in this country as a Government supported by the English interests whose purposes they serve, and who in return were bound to support that English interest. There is no economic policy to be served now, other than a national economic policy, and the Government in existence recognises that it can only be served by utilising the general resources of this country in the general way that Christianity and a Christian social policy would see them utilised.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to the double shuffles of the President.  There is no double shuffling of the President of this State, or any double shuffling connected with the Party controlling affairs now.  Double shuffling was conceived and carried out by the people endeavouring to serve two countries&mdash; this country and England&mdash;and I assert England first.  The double shufflers are Dr. O'Higgins and the Party he belongs to.  The President has outlined national policy and Fianna Fáil are endeavouring in spite of terrific odds to carry through that national policy and the greatest enemy we have is Dr. O'Higgins with his double shuffling of accepting a salary of £1,000 a year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Let him not endeavour to seek by any form of what he calls double shuffle to transfer the responsibility for partition of the country from the Party to which he belongs to the Party who always stood and will always stand against it.  He further sought to saddle us with the responsibilities of making slanders against the Orangemen of the Six Counties.  Some member of our Party interrupted him on that question.  He was quite unjustified in making that statement, but if I am called to order for making certain statements&mdash;I accept that Leas-Cheann Comhairle is within his rights in calling me to order &mdash;there is certain justification for extending my limitation by reason of these unlimited charges that were made by the last speaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he refers to the President of this country as making a charge against the Orangemen of this country or any other section of the people he knows, and he must know, he is the slanderer and maligner, because everyone both inside and outside knows that the President is the one man that stands for unity, not class or creed, but equality of all interests and all sections.  The men, and the only men, responsible for the division of our country are Dr. O'Higgins and the Party he belongs to.  They are the Party who signed their signatures to the division of our country, and that is the most outrageous charge that can be levelled against any individual or against any Party in this country, and when Dr. O'Higgins wants to refer to <Col N="2821" /> the division of the country, and to make that charge against us as a Party, he must know that he is speaking and making a statement that is unfounded, and when he charges the President of the State with making allegations or charges against a section of our people he does know and must know that these charges are unfounded.  All these evils belong to Dr. O'Higgins and his Party.  If we are partitioned in this country it is due to him and his Party.  If we have sectarian differences they are due to Sir James Craig, Dr. O'Higgins and Cumann na nGaedheal.  If we have an economic war raging in this country, that economic war is due to Cumann na nGaedheal and their allies, the British Government in this country. Let the people not misunderstand that, and if statements are made from the Opposition that these matters are due to any action of this House I will repudiate them, and will always repudiate them.</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Higgins said: &ldquo;Let every man carry arms.&rdquo;  Of course, let every man carry arms!  Why does not he carry arms himself&mdash;this Medical Officer of Health for County Meath, a Deputy of this House and the leader of the A.C.A.?  Why not all carry arms? Of course, it is a splendid appeal!  I assert to Deputy O'Higgins and to the Party for whom he speaks that his plea in this House for permission for every citizen to carry arms is based upon cowardice.  He has endeavoured to organise a force in this country that would upset every ordered condition of society in this country, if he dared, but he, and the Party to which he belongs, and the people he has endeavoured to organise have not enough courage to put into practice the policy for which he pleads.</P>
    <P>He found his material, but he found that he was lacking in courage to put the policy into operation, and he comes forward now with the appeal for us all to be allowed to carry arms.  Is that the appeal we should expect from a man who puts himself forward as a Constitutionalist?  Is that the end of his A.C.A. ism?  Is that all he can accomplish by his efforts to bring into existence a force that would overthrow <Col N="2822" /> and displace every force for the maintenance of order that this State has set up&mdash;the Civic Guards, the Army, and the other necessary forces for maintaining order?  He sought to acquire and put into existence a force that would conquer them all, and it seems that he failed, because the material he had, I assert, was not capable of that courage that would enable them, without the authority which Dr. O'Higgins&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, by his appeal to this Dáil, advocated the authority that they would by all means apply if they dared, but which they find they can only apply if they are allowed to carry arms.  That plea is based, not upon equality, but upon the hope that, if arms were allowed to be carried, the section he hopes to lead in this country would be enabled, by reason of the right to carry arms, and by reason of their organisation, to terrorise the community into subjection to the will which he would enforce upon them, and the will which Cumann na nGaedheal would wish to enforce upon this country.  That is the will of a dictator, as against the expressed wish of the democracy of this country.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the Republic, Deputy O'Higgins uses the phrase &ldquo;cheap clap-trap.&rdquo;&ldquo;Cheap clap-trap&rdquo; from a man who sits in this Dáil to-night by reason of the declaration of the Republic many years ago!  He is one of the men who advocated the Republic, but he now vilifies the name of the Republic mentioned in this House as &ldquo;cheap clap-trap.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In presenting the Estimates for Fisheries and Gaeltacht Services, I regret to have to say that the fishing industry has passed through a very discouraging year.  Supplies have been scarce and markets bad. Herrings and mackerel, upon which our inshore fishermen principally rely, were not encountered in paying quantities, and the export markets for cured fish have been bad.  The increased duties levied last year on cured herrings entering Germany have had a further depressing effect on the industry.  In the trawling and lining sections of the industry an improvement has taken place. During 1932 we increased our landings of demersal fish, and the imports of this class were diminished. Improved arrangements for distributing the catch to our inland towns have resulted in a considerable increase in consumption of fresh fish, which is, however, still very much below what it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The output of the rural industries established in the Gaeltacht is steadily increasing.  The home demand continues to expand and in spite of difficulties export trade is being built up.  The number of trained weavers in Donegal, Mayo and Galway has been increased to 99 and the yardage of tweeds produced ran into 72,500 yds. during the year ended last March.  In the outlying islands where the need for home industries of a suitable kind is very pressing owing to the low economic <Col N="2830" /> position due to isolation, special effort has been made to establish machine knitting of socks and similar articles of standard demand.  New centres have also been opened up on the mainland in the Dingle peninsula and in the Donegal and Galway Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The lace-making industry shows no signs of revival for the moment, and activity is mainly based on producing knitwear, crochet-wool work, hosiery, hand-knitted goods, tie making as well as tweed weaving.  A start has been made with the manufacture of poplin in Donegal, but the creation of technical skill in this trade is a matter of slow growth. Other industries such as garter-making, glove-making, etc., which can be carried on as home industries are at present under examination by the Department.</P>
    <P>The kelp and carrageen industries showed a considerable increase in output in 1932, but the heavy drop in iodine values which occurred last year will have unfavourable reactions this year on the kelp industry.  The world price of iodine has fallen in the past 12 months by 50 per cent. and it is obvious that last year's prices cannot be maintained in consequence. Reports so far received show that the quantity of seaweed gathered this season is considerably in excess of last year.</P>
    <P>In the provision of houses in the Gaeltacht, considerable progress has been made during the year.  Since the passing of the Acts grants and loans to the total of £300,000 have been approved, and over half that amount has been issued to the recipients who have qualified for payment of instalments. It has to be borne in mind that the rate of progress in building houses in the remote parts of the Gaeltacht is slow.  This is principally due to the fact that the work is engaged in at times of freedom from other occupations and is subject to weather conditions and to a considerable extent also to the lack of an adequate supply of skilled craftsmen in several districts.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the Estimates, it will be observed that I am seeking this year £14,495 less than was voted last <Col N="2831" /> year for the services administered by my Department.  This is due to circumstances which I will explain in dealing with the details.  Under the head of Salaries, Wages and Allowances, there is a net increase of £1,969 compared with the previous year.  The increase in the estimate is made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Small savings amounting to £795 are estimated to be effected in travelling and incidental expenses and in telegrams and telephone service.  The saving in this sub-head of £1,000 is due to the fact that proposals are in progress for the transfer of the boatyard and motor shop of Meevagh, County Donegal, to the control and management of the Sea Fisheries Association.  The yard has been fully occupied for the past two years in building boats to the order of the association, and it will be more satisfactory to let that body have the use of the yard to build and repair its own boats.  Provision will be made in any terms of transfer to ensure that the primary object of the boatyard, <Col N="2832" /> namely, to afford training in boat-building and marine motor-driving to sons of fishermen, will be observed.</P>
    <P>The Estimate has, therefore, been taken for a portion of the year only. On turning to item (3) in sub-head O, which sets out the receipts from the Department's schemes, it will be observed that £450 is estimated to be recovered on sale of boats built in the yard, so that the net charge on the Vote for this service is £50 only.</P>
    <P>There is an estimated saving under this sub-head in the taking of statistics, part of this work being done by the Gárda Síochána instead of by paid collectors.  Regarding the sea fisheries protection service, the provision for which in these Estimates is the same as in the year just passed, I had hoped to be able to introduce legislation early this year in order to secure fuller powers of protecting our inshore sea fisheries.  I hope to be in a position to introduce the Bill dealing with this matter before the close of the present session.  The provision for the services of inland fisheries shows very little variation upon last year's Estimate. I should have liked to be able to include provision in this Estimate for the erection and maintenance of a brown trout hatchery.  I have, however, encountered great difficulty in finding a suitable site, but I am not relaxing in any way my efforts, as I am fully aware of the need for such a hatchery.</P>
    <P>The provision of funds for the Sea Fisheries Association shows a total reduction of £23,000 as compared with the prior year.  The grant for administration expenses has been increased by £1,000 owing to the more widely extended activities of the association. The grant for general development stands at £20,000 as against £53,000 last year.</P>
    <P>The greater part of this expenditure is necessitated by measures to promote the development of the deep sea fisheries of the Saorstát and to replace the annual import of fresh fish amounting to a figure in the neighbourhood of £180,000 and of cured fish amounting to some £150,000 by fish landed in the Saorstát.  The Association has been organising the landing of fish by <Col N="2833" /> trawlers from the fishing fields off our cast and west coasts, has set up an organisation for the marketing and distribution of fish supplies throughout the country and has been taking steps to increase the consumption of fish, which is at present much below the potential consumption.</P>
    <P>In the development of this branch of the fisheries the greatest handicap of this country has been the absence of home coal supplies and the consequent heavy cost of fuel for coal-driven boats. Fortunately, oil is now beginning to replace coal as fuel on this class of boat and the Association, which last year had to rely entirely on coal-driven boats, is at present arranging for trials with oil-driven trawlers, which, if they are successful, will, I anticipate, indicate the path of future development of our deep sea fisheries.</P>
    <P>These measures are at the same time rendering possible the development of the inshore fisheries by making it possible to absorb the inshore catch more readily into the general fish supply of the country, and at prices which will make it more easy for the inshore fisherman to meet his obligations.  The catch, for instance, of the west and south-west coast, which had to look largely to Dublin for its market in the past, can now be disposed of much nearer home and in much larger quantities on better terms.  The way is thus opened to expansion of the inshore fisheries.  The association has also been engaged in organising the marketing of shell-fish, that is, mussels, winkles and lobsters.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head G 3, for the supply of boats and gear, there is an increase of £9,000.  The Association has been able to keep all the available boat-building yards of the Saorstát busy turning out its requirements and has succeeded in bringing about the reopening of the yard at Killybegs, County Donegal.  The yards are not yet able to keep pace with the requirements of the Association, but the output is increasing.  The provision of £5,000 under G 4 will be required in connection with the provision of a mussel purification plant in Dublin Bay, the arrangements for which are <Col N="2834" /> well advanced.  The completion of this plant will, it is hoped, reopen markets which have for some time been closed to certain beds in this country, the mussels from which have not been free from the suspicion of impurities. Mussels which have passed through the proposed plant will be absolutely free from any shadow of suspicion.</P>
    <P>Rural industrial development in the Gaeltacht will be extended in this year.  A number of new knitting centres will be opened and 25 Irish-speaking girls are being trained at headquarters to take charge of these centres.  The increased provision for staffing new centres provided for in the Estimate is £2,500 (sub-head H 1). Weaving on hand-looms is being taught and tweed being turned out at eight centres, while the weaving of poplin and tie-making is progressing at Annagry, County Donegal.  To meet the needs of the new centres and of the increased activities in existing centres, provision is sought under sub-head H 3 for £4,000 new plant and machines.  This represents an increase of £1,000 on last year's requirements.  The additional provision under the next sub-head, H 4, for the raw materials required in connection with the various industries carried on will be needed to meet the greater output from the new centres.  The total sum required is £22,000, and under sub-head O, item 6, there is a credit for a similar sum to be recovered in the year. The next section in the Estimates deals with the development of industries connected with marine products. It will be observed that under sub-head I 1, provision is made for employing for a period of eight weeks during the kelp buying season seven analysts who will test the kelp offered to the Department for sale. It is upon the result of these tests that the rate per ton paid to each kelp burner is fixed.  The work of the six instructors in kelp-making employed last year has been completed and this item has accordingly disappeared.  The Department employs an experienced instructress in cookery to give cookery demonstrations in the principal towns of the <Col N="2835" /> Saorstát as a means of extending the consumption of carrageen.  It has been found necessary to increase last year's provision for the travelling expenses of the organisers of the gathering and treatment of marine products.  These officers, who are on loan from the Department of Agriculture, have to cover the entire western seaboard from Inishowen to Daingean Ui Chuise, and necessarily incur heavy travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>It is not anticipated that the iodine market will warrant the payment this year of the same rate per ton for kelp as last year.  The world price of iodine, which determines the price of kelp, has been reduced from 16/- per lb. to 8/- per lb., the price being based on the gold dollar.  My estimate has, therefore, unfortunately to be based on a lower price than in previous years.  Special efforts are, however, being made to develop alternative uses for kelp, which, I have some hope, will help to remedy this position.  This year the handling of the kelp crop will be dealt with by officers of the Department direct instead of by local agents as hitherto.  The estimated receipts from the sale of kelp are shown in sub-head O, item 7.  It will be seen that it is expected to realise £28,000 on kelp sales as against £30,300 estimated outgoings in the sub-head.</P>
    <P>The quantity of carrageen gathered last year and sold to the Department fell much short of the Estimate for that year and consequently it is believed that the provision of £4,500 in sub-head I 4, for the gatherers will be sufficient this year.  The sales of the packaged carrageen in the home market have been very satisfactory and efforts are being made to extend the demand for carrageen in this form.  It is expected that the sales of carrageen of all sorts through the Central Marketing Depot will amount to £8,000, as is shown in sub-head O, item 8.</P>
    <P>The marketing depôt requires additional staff to keep pace with its increasing turnover.  For these reasons the estimated cost of the marketing organisation shown under the &ldquo;J&rdquo; sub-heads 1, 2 and 3, show an increase <Col N="2836" /> of £1,579 over last year.  The provision previously made for loans for industrial purposes has not in recent years been fully availed of largely owing to the greater extent to which the Department is dealing itself with the provision of plant and appliances. The provision has accordingly this year been reduced to £500, which, I anticipate, will be sufficient for all demands. The provision for the supply of facilities in connection with the marine industries has been increased from £800 to £1,000.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head L, provision is made for giving instruction in the Gaeltacht in general housewifery, hygiene, etc. There were formerly three ladies employed for this purpose of whom one died and the other married.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased provision under sub-head M 1, has been made for grants under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts of £80,000, as against £69,000 last year. £300,000 has now been assigned to applicants for grants and loans.  15,000 applications for assistance under the Acts have been received up to the end of last month from persons resident in the Gaeltacht scheduled areas.  9,490 of these applications have been investigated by the surveyors in the country. 7,159 of these investigated cases have been ruled on by the Department, and the remainder are undergoing examination.  Of the 7,159 cases ruled on 3,288 have obtained sanction for grants and loans amounting to £300,000, 1,274 have been refused on grounds laid down in the Acts, 1,169 have been withdrawn by the applicants for various reasons, and 1,428 have been deferred because Irish was <Col N="2837" /> not used as the home language or because the Land Commission intend to rearrange the applicant's holding or for other sufficient reasons.

    <P>The scheme for providing teachers' residences has not been availed of as freely as had been hoped and only a small part of the provision was expended last year.  This year I am asking for £2,000 only, which I consider will be sufficient to meet the requirements for this service in the present year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I cannot enthuse about the position of Gaeltacht housing as the Parliamentary Secretary enthuses about it, but I shall wait until later on before I actually deal with that.  The thing that would strike one most about the Estimate this year is the huge reduction of almost £16,000 in the total net Estimate, or of £30,000 in the gross Estimate.  That decrease will surely excite a good deal of comment from all those Deputies from Gaeltacht constituencies or from constituencies which have sea-fishing ports along their coasts.  I shall watch out, with great interest, for criticism, especially from the Fianna Fáil Deputies from Gaeltacht constituencies, and more particularly, if they have listened carefully to the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, or if they have made any kind of a careful study of the subheads under which these decreases occur.  For instance, a decrease does not occur in sub-head A, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out.  As we see in the Estimate, there is an increase of £1,969.  At the start let me say that I am not going to indulge in the rather ignorant criticism that I was compelled to listen to for a number of years as to the relation of salaries to any given estimate.  That <Col N="2838" /> is not my intention.  I know that you must have a body of civil servants who will administer the affairs of the Department.  I know that they must be paid, and from my pretty long experience of the Department, I know that the staff earn their money, at least as well as in any other Department of the State.  There is a provision of £840 in the Estimate for two temporary inspectors to which I must refer.  That is the only question I will raise on that subject.  I do so because we have not been told since their appointment, and we were not told by the Parliamentary Secretary this morning what these officers are doing. We must conclude that they are really doing nothing.  Obviously they have not left their mark in the way of any increased activity as far as the Department is concerned.  We must not be blamed, therefore, for believing that here we have two political jobs for which there was really no necessity, and that these officers have no particular function and do not earn the salaries for which provision is being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to have the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation of the first reduction of note, that in sub-head E1 &mdash;Vocational Instruction Including Boatbuilding.  We find a decrease there this year of £1,000 compared with the sum provided last year.  A footnote states that that is a provision for part of the year only.  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that the intention is to hand Meevagh boatyard to the Sea Fisheries Association. I should like to see where the provision is, in the sums voted for the Sea Fisheries Association later on, to enable them to staff Meevagh boatyard, and to carry on the work there in the extended fashion that we would expect, if the statement made by the chairman of the Association at the last annual general meeting was correct. If I remember aright the report stated that the Department had increased very considerably the staff of the Meevagh boatyard, with a view to being able to turn out in sufficient numbers the standard boats which the association required.  The Estimate actually shows a very considerable <Col N="2839" /> decrease in the amount provided for the staffing of Meevagh boatyard.  The provision for the staff there is £240 against £950 last year.  The total provision is £1,000 short of the sum provided last year.  Of course, we must be satisfied with the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that everything will be all right in this respect, that the boatyard will be handed over to the Sea Fisheries Association, and that some provision will be made to enable them to carry on the work which they set themselves out to do. It would be a disastrous thing if we started economising in a service of that kind, because it would completely hamper the work of the Sea Fisheries Association.</P>
    <P>Although I listened carefully, I did not hear any explanation of the astounding decrease in sub-head G 2 &mdash;General Development (Grant-in-Aid) to the Sea Fisheries Association. There is a reduction from £53,000 in last year's Estimate to £20,000 this year, a decrease of £33,000 in that sub-head alone.  Even if we take the next Estimate, where there is a provision of £9,000 extra for advances for boats and gear to the Association, yet, it leaves a net decrease of £24,000 in the Grants-in-Aid to the Sea Fisheries Association for development purposes. A sum of £1,000 additional is given for cost of administration.  What is the explanation?  Is this part of the Fianna Fáil fishery policy that we heard so much about?  During all the years that I was sitting on the opposite benches we had loud denunciations of Cumann na nGaedheal by the Fianna Fáil Party when they came into the House, of the neglect to provide sufficient money for the Gaeltacht and for fisheries.  We made provision last year for £53,000 for Grants-in-Aid to the Sea Fisheries Association, but the first year that this Government are framing the Estimates they cut them by £33,000.  Unless we get a very good explanation the reduction in that sub-head is utterly unjustifiable, and I am certain it will create heart-rendings around the coast amongst persons who believed Fianna Fáil speakers who visited the sea fishing <Col N="2840" /> ports.  It will certainly give them room for thought.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Now we come to kelp, where under sub-head I 1 there is the reduction of £9,500.  Under the sub-head for the payment of kelp-makers in respect of kelp marketed by the Department, the amount provided has fallen from £34,500 last year to £25,000 this year. Let me say immediately that I quite appreciate the situation.  I knew, of course, that there has been a fall of 50 per cent. in the world price of crude iodine.  But, have we not been making experiments in other directions.  Did I not read in some newspaper last week that these experiments were tending towards the hope that a nutritious cattle food was to be expected from kelp?  Experiments are going on with regard to finding by-products of various kinds in addition to iodine.  What has been the result of the experiments? Is there any hope eventually that we will become independent of the fluctuations in the world's price of iodine? As I say, I quite understand that there must be a reduction in prices of the kelp gatherers but, about two months ago, when I put down a question to the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the price of kelp&mdash;if I remember rightly that was about the third week of May&mdash;he told me the price had not yet been fixed.  He tells us to-night there has been a great increase in the amount of seaweed gathered.  I feel that it was very unfair to the kelp gatherers that they were not told at that date what the price of kelp would be for the year&mdash;the price per decimal point of iodine content.  I presume that is the way it is bought now.  The price used to be £1 per decimal point iodine content.  For .7 iodine content you got £7 per ton for the kelp.  For 1.1 iodine content you got £11 per ton for the kelp.  I am afraid that these days are gone for a while.  In the case of Tory Island, we were able to pay as much as £14 per ton for certain kelp. The kelp gatherers should have been told before the May weed came in what the Department hoped to be able to pay this year.  It would be only fair to them to let them know whether it would be worth their while to gather it and burn it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2841" /> The Parliamentary Secretary surprised me when he mentioned that the agents are done away with this year and that officers of the Department are dealing directly with the kelp.  I had not known that and I wonder how it has come about.  I hold no brief for these agents.  I do not think that I know any of them personally.  But a great many of these agents gave up fairly lucrative agencies, which they held from foreign buyers around the coast, to come over to the Department when we started this co-operative kelp scheme.  The firms who employed other agents were driven out of business through Government policy.  It is very unfair, especially as regards those who came over to us voluntarily at the time, that they should now be scrapped in this rather arbitrary fashion.  To many of them, this was a very considerable portion of their livelihood.  In many cases, they had been at the work from their childhood, buying for various firms along the western seaboard. As I said, I hold no brief for these men, but I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, what is behind this doing away with agents and how he hopes to deal as efficiently with the kelp gatherers through the officers of the Department as we were able to do through those agents who were accustomed all their lives to dealing with these men.</P>
    <P>There is the excuse of the fall in the price of crude iodine for the fall in the price of the kelp gatherers but there is no such excuse for the fall in the estimate for payments to the carrageen moss gatherers.  This year, there is a sum of £4,500 provided under this head as against £10,000 provided last year.  It is practically the same body of persons who are engaged at the kelp and the carrageen.  They are placed in the same locality&mdash;the very poorest part of our western seaboard, mostly in the Fior-Ghaeltacht.  Here you have, between a drop of £9,500 payments to kelp gatherers and £5,500 payments to the gatherers of carrageen, a total drop of £15,000 in the income <Col N="2842" /> of these poor people in the Fior-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>About the same time that the answer, to which I have referred in regard to kelp was given, I was told by the Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to a question, that they had not fixed the price of carrageen per stone this year.  I have been told since&mdash;I have not got with me a copy of the Debates containing that reply to the question&mdash;that the price instead of being from 2/- to 2/6 per stone, as in former years, will now be from 1/6 for good carrageen to 2/6 for excellent carrageen.  Something else must have happened, in addition to that fall, because the fall from £10,000 to £4,500 would not be justified if the price only fell the 6d.&mdash;bad and all as that would be.  I say it is tragic that there should be a fall of 6d. per stone in the payments for carrageen.  That fall of 6d. does not account for the fall of £5,500. I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary must not expect that anything near the same amount of carrageen is going to be saved this year.  Presumably, it is because they expected this fall the carrageen gatherers did not go to the trouble of gathering.  The Parliamentary Secretary must know that it was distinctly understood by the carrageen gatherers two years ago that 2/- would be the lowest they would be paid for carrageen.  I feel this, in a sense, as a breach of faith. They were told that 2/- per stone would be the lowest price and that we hoped to make it considerably more. We were able to pay 2/6 per stone for carrageen and we had hoped to be able to give a bonus on top of that.  I do not think that the bonus materialised but we never fell below 2/6 per stone since the Department started to deal with carrageen.  For this, the Government must take the blame for, unfortunately, the fall in the price paid to the gatherers of carrageen is, I am afraid, directly due to the tariff on carrageen entering the British market.  I can see no other explanation. That is, of course, portion of the economic war.  It is not only the question of the tariff but the prejudice that was created against anything imported from the Saorstát amongst <Col N="2843" /> those persons who would be most likely to buy carrageen across the Channel.  A great deal of money was expended in advertising carrageen for its food value and so on, and there was no doubt that it was bound eventually to have a very large market in England were it not for the economic war.  A prejudice against everything emanating from An Saorstát, a prejudice in the ordinary English housewife's mind, absolutely prevented that market from expanding.  As we said when this business was being entered upon, it is the poor who always suffer in this kind of war, and this certainly is an outstanding example.</P>
    <P>The next fall that I will refer to is one to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, and it is in the loans for industrial purposes.  There is a fall from the £2,000 provided last year to £500 in this year's Estimate, and the Parliamentary Secretary explained this was not being utilised in recent years.  I am rather sorry to hear that, because I know it was very distinctly in our minds, at the time the Gaeltacht Housing Acts were being put through, that, in addition to providing decent dwelling accommodation in the Gaeltacht, we were also providing houses in which possibly one room could be turned into a little workroom, where the loom or knitting machine could be used to the economic advantage of the person who owns the house.  Deputies will remember the provisions of the Gaeltacht Housing Act.  Not only were dwelling houses provided for, but poultry houses and piggeries were also provided for as being two of the things, as the Department of Agriculture advised at the time, which were suitable for the economy of the persons looking for Gaeltacht houses.  In fact, it was made a condition of one getting a new house&mdash;unless the Department of Agriculture said it was not necessary&mdash;that that person should also apply for a grant for a poultry house and a piggery.</P>
    <P>We had in mind as well this thing of having machines supplied to these houses where they could be worked in an atmosphere in which they could not <Col N="2844" /> have been worked in the old tumbled-down shacks which the Gaeltacht houses were intended to replace.  I regret to see that reduction, but I suppose one cannot blame the Parliamentary Secretary if the money was not being utilised.  I think, however, it is something which the Department should have pushed.  It could easily have pushed the utilisation of this sum of money through its ordinary industrial centres in the Gaeltacht, and I have no doubt that with a certain amount of pushing it would have been taken advantage of.  At any rate, it is a fault which amounts to, if I total all the things I have mentioned on the development side, a drop of £43,700.</P>
    <P>We will now leave the reductions and come to one of the things to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, just as if he were quite satisfied with it. The Department of Lands and Fisheries has very many varied activities.  I have referred so far to those which show a reduction in the Estimate.  I now come to sub-head M 1 &mdash;Grants Under The Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, 1929-31.  Here we have a provision of £80,000 this year, as against £69,000 last year.  I wish that those figures could make one feel that here at least we had some increased activity; but, in fact, as every Deputy from the Gaeltacht knows, the contrary is the case.  The £80,000 provided in this year's Estimate is in respect of commitments of the past, commitments entered into in the past. Deputies may not quite understand how these payments are made.  The first Gaeltacht Housing Act was passed late in 1929, just before Christmas, in fact.  It got into working order well into 1930, probably about the following autumn.  It was only then that the sanctions began in any numbers, and, as the sanctions were issued, houses began to be built.  There was a provision for a very small sum before the actual house was started, but as the house progressed, a man could draw a little bit more from the full amount sanctioned.  Now, houses are being built.  They are advancing towards building or are actually built, and of course, the money is falling due.</P>
    <P>I invite the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2845" /> to say whether at least 75 per cent. of the £80,000 provided in this year's Estimate is not for commitments entered into before he actually came into the Department.  It is obvious it must be so.  Now, the true position of the operations under the Gaeltacht Housing Act was indicated some weeks ago in reply to a question of mine. The reply is reported in the Official Debates, vol. 47, cols. 1859-60.  That reply shows that as against 1,166 new buildings sanctioned in 1931-32&mdash;that was our last year of office&mdash;there were only 345 new buildings sanctioned in Fianna Fáil's first year of office, a fall of 70 per cent.  The amount of money involved shows a proportionate decrease.  The amount sanctioned for new buildings in the year 1931-32 was £120,826, as against £38,928 in the year 1932-33.  On the improvements side the very same state of affairs prevails; that is on the side which deals with repairs to existing buildings.  There were 778 improvements sanctioned in the year 1931-32 as against 286 in the year 1932-33, and the amount for improvements sanctioned in 1931-32 was £48,291 as against £17,181 in 1932-33. Now, the state of affairs shown by those figures&mdash;and those are the figures supplied by the Parliamentary Secretary in reply to a question&mdash;calls for the condemnation of every Deputy who has anything more than lip sympathy for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment say that it is the Parliamentary Secretary who is actually to blame, and I am perfectly satisfied that it is not the Department is to blame.  I can well imagine that this condition of affairs must be heartbreaking to the officials of the Department, who threw themselves heart and soul into the work of making the Gaeltacht a better place to live in.  I do not blame the Department.  I blame the Government as a whole.  I blame the Executive Council, and I blame, of course, the Minister for Finance, for the callous manner in which they are dealing with this most important social service of providing decent houses in the Gaeltacht.  The Parliamentary Secretary is to this extent to blame, that he is lying down on it.  Of course, there is the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but he is too busy, between Washington and London, to take any interest in the matter.  At any rate, I hope that Deputies on all sides of the House will utter their condemnation of the Government for their neglect of Gaeltacht housing.  If the progress that had been reached before we left office had been maintained&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary will admit this&mdash;it would have been necessary, several months ago, to have had a new Gaeltacht Housing Act to provide money for this purpose, unless they went on under the Miscellaneous Housing Act passed last year under local government auspices. That might be all right but the people in the Gaeltacht would be getting a rather bad bargain.  One of the results of this state of affairs is this: the Parliamentary Secretary does not seem to be quite convinced about it, and I should like to put it again. When we found, coming towards the end of 1931, that the first £250,000 provided by the Act of 1929 was almost allocated&mdash;it was, in fact, entirely allocated I think about the end of December, 1931&mdash;we brought in another Bill providing another £100,000.  The intention was that according as that sum was allocated a further Bill would be brought in to provide a further £100,000&mdash;a one clause Bill.  As far as I remember, the second Gaeltacht Housing Bill was merely one clause, providing a further sum of money for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further Bill should have been brought in several months ago if the rate of progress that we had reached had been maintained.  The result of not having brought it in is that there is no money now available for new schemes. All the money provided under the former Acts has already been allocated, and it is only in an odd case, where a person had got sanction and for one reason or another decided not to avail of it, that there can be a sanction given now.  That is very unfair to a big number of persons in the Gaeltacht who had incurred expenditure on the strength of the Act and on the strength of the fact that the inspector had gone down, had examined the condition of <Col N="2847" /> their old houses, and had told them, as he had a perfect right to do, that he was going to recommend their application for sanction.  He had a perfect right to do that, because our instructions, from the very word &ldquo;go,&rdquo; if I may use the expression, to the officers dealing with the Housing Act was to deal with applicants in the most friendly and unofficial manner possible. Any of us who know the Gaeltacht know that they are extremely suspicious of officials owing to their experience of them in the past, and we wanted the officials dealing with this matter to act in a friendly way with the applicants. I think they did so in a most extraordinarily successful manner.  In the last year in which I was in charge of the Estimates here I remember even Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches, who were very sparing indeed in compliments, had to admit that the officers dealing with the Gaeltacht Housing Act left nothing to be desired. They, as they had a perfect right to do, told the applicants that they were going to recommend the sanction of grants in their particular case.  As a result, those poor people went to considerable expense and to considerable labour, either in digging out a site, or in carrying stones to the site.  A great number of them had employed a handy man or a mason to do some building. That is very unfair.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should not convince himself that as far as the Gaeltacht Housing Act is concerned everything is happy.  He should insist on getting authority immediately to introduce the further necessary legislation to deal with the matter.  It is the duty of all Deputies, particularly those sitting on the benches over there, to insist that the Government which they support will give a fair crack of the whip to the Gaeltacht in that matter.</P>
    <P>Taking the Estimate as a whole, there is one thing about it that I suppose I should feel extremely flattered about, and that is the fact that there is not one single departure from the lines laid down when I was in office.  There is not one single departure except where there is the lagging behind to which I have just <Col N="2848" /> pointed.  I should like to know where now is all the fine talk we used to hear.  Where is all the fine talk we used to hear in this House during all the years since Fianna Fáil came into the Dail?  Where are all the fine things that were promised by the various Deputies when they went around the Gaeltacht&mdash;promised both in Irish and in English to the people of the Gaeltacht if Fianna Fáil came into office.  Where is the new development scheme for our fisheries?  Where is the reorganisation of our fisheries that we were promised in that much read Fianna Fáil poster which Deputy McGilligan quoted to-day? What a different tune Fianna Fáil in office is playing to the tune that they played when they were looking for votes!  We used to hear a lot here, for instance, about the inadequacy of our fishery patrol service.  Here we are again.  The same old £8,500 for the good ship Muirchú&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and nothing more. The good ship Muirchú is still being provided for, and as I say we have nothing more in the Estimate.  The Parliamentary Secretary elaborated a little bit in his speech.  I think he said that he was going to introduce legislation to improve the law relating to the matter.  I wonder is Deputy Blaney here.  He used to be very vocal in the old days about the depredation of the trawlers off the Donegal coast. I wonder did that suddenly stop when Fianna Fáil came into office?  I do not think so, from what one reads in the newspapers at any rate.  I wonder has the French lobster boat ceased to haunt our inshore waters, seeing that we hear no more about it from Wexford, Cork and Donegal Deputies?  It is funny how silent some people can be when the Minister whom they have to question happens to sit on their own benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, as I say, promised that he was going to bring in legislation.  Now if the Parliamentary Secretary were to take a tip from me he would refuse to bring in legislation with regard to our territorial <Col N="2849" /> water unless he is first given some guarantee that the coastal patrol will be extended in addition.  In reply to a question of mine a few weeks ago the Parliamentary Secretary said that this matter was under consideration. When I asked him what he meant he said they were considering utilising motor boats for this work.  That is a delightfully vague answer&mdash;there are motor boats and motor boats.  If the Parliamentary Secretary meant they were going to utilise small motor boats at various points around the coast, even at ten miles, I think he will get officials in the office who understand this work who will advise him that he would be wasting money if he did that. To protect our fisheries you must have patrol boats that will be able to go to sea in any weather in which a steam trawler can go to sea, and as anybody who knows anything about it knows, it would be very bad weather indeed that would make a steam boat lie up.  I might as well give the Parliamentary Secretary my opinion, it would be necessary to have three boats of the steam trawler type having three or four more knots than the steam trawlers; they should be equipped with wireless and whatever armament would be necessary to enforce their orders.  That, to my mind, would be the only coastal patrol that would be very much used. I always agree that one boat is, of course, not effective, but three boats, equipped with wireless to keep in touch with one another and whatever stations there might be on land, would be sufficient to patrol the coast and unless the Parliamentary Secretary gets a guarantee that those will be provided I would advise him not to bring in this legislation.  He can learn from the Department what was in our minds in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Mr. O'Briain Mr. O'Briain">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of things might be happening for 20 years and they would be no use to some people.  But at any rate the Parliamentary Secretary can find out that the argument which was advanced effectively against me when I was connected with it and was advocating protection for the fisheries <Col N="2850" /> was that they did not think that the fisheries as they stood warranted extra coastal extension.  It is an expensive business&mdash;coastal patrol, and that was the argument that was always put up to me and it was almost impossible to answer in the circumstances, but I was assured that when the Sea Fisheries Association got under way the argument could no longer hold.  The association is now under way, the time has come when that argument can no longer be of much use, when it cannot have the force it had when it was used against me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate the fisheries are going to be developed and it will be worth while spending the necessary money on coastal patrol.  Whilst we are on that I would like to say that the small motor boats might be of use in preventing the French lobster boats taking away our lobsters but they would be utterly worthless so far as steam trawlers are concerned and it is trawlers that do the real harm because they destroy the beds apart from the other harm they do.  On the general question of the fisheries I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what are his hopes from the activities of the Sea Fisheries Association.  Not all Deputies have read the annual reports of the association, and I think it would have been wise if he had said something about the association's activities.  I should like to hear for instance in considerable detail what are the results of the experiment in trawling; as to whether the results would justify private enterprise in going into the business.  That was the hope we had when this was being embarked upon; our hope was that as a result of this trawler experiment we would induce private enterprise into the trawling business along the south and west coasts.  It would have been extremely difficult to come to any very satisfactory conclusion based upon an experiment lasting only a season or two, but at least those experiments were something we could go on.  We hear about some of the trawlers being returned.  I hope that is not an indication of abandoment of the scheme, an abandoment only in a half-hearted way.  It would be just as <Col N="2851" /> well to abandon it altogether as to abandon it half-heartedly.  I think it is worth going on with for another year or two.  It has educational value.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the experimental end, it is a necessary adjunct to developing the market for our inshore fisheries.  I believe that the Association has had considerable success in developing the market in our inland towns, and it would do nothing but harm to future efforts if, having created the taste for fish, a supply would not be provided for those people.  The supply can be provided only by the trawler; both as to quantity and variety you can only supply the quantity and the variety of fish for that market by utilisation of the steam trawler.  The Parliamentary Secretary said very little about the shell fish development, but I was glad at least, because I had intended to raise it here, that the purification tank is under way and that the £5,000 have been allocated for it.  That is very wise.  I cannot understand why there was delay about it; there was some difficulty about the site or something of that kind; it was almost completely settled one and a half years ago.  At any rate that is one of the things necessary&mdash;that purification tank, because the fact is that our mussels have been time and again rejected by medical officers of health in the markets in England.  The mussels from certain beds show the presence of a little fellow which rang in my ears for ten years called, I think, bacillus coli, which is an indication of the presence in the beds of some putrefaction.</P>
    <P>As I say, a year and a half ago we had almost completed the arrangements for the establishment of a purification tank here on similar lines to the purification tank at Conway in Wales.  We hope there will be no further unnecessary delay in getting on with the work of establishing that tank, but the thing that has absolutely killed the mussel industry and, in fact, all the shell-fish industry, is the tariff imposed upon that industry across the Channel.  There is another market for <Col N="2852" /> lobsters besides the English market, especially in recent years.  You have the French market, especially since those boats come across from France and collect lobsters along the coast. Still, the London market was the main market, and the English market in Birmingham and some of the main towns in the North of England was the only market for our mussels, and mussels cannot afford the tariff that was placed on them.</P>
    <P>I was given to understand that when this tariff was first imposed about a year ago, or very nearly so, the Sea Fisheries Association were going to meet the case by paying the tariff on behalf of the fishermen, being recouped by bounty or something of that nature afterwards, but I learn now&mdash;in fact I have been aware of it for some time past&mdash;that that is not being done.  The effect has been that the mussel industry, as well as the industry in other smaller shell-fish, like periwinkles and so on, has been absolutely killed.  It is only a small industry but it was of considerable importance to those engaged in it.  In Cromane, in Kerry, for instance, very many families earned a livelihood out of it for a portion of the year.  The same applies to Mornington in the County Louth and to other places along the coast which I forget for the moment.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to say a word on inland fisheries.  I see that the sum provided for inland fisheries remains about the same as it was last year.  There is just a small reduction which is accounted for by Section 13 of the Act of 1925. This is a branch of our industry which requires no subsidies.  It merely requires to be conserved.  It is generally agreed that the Acts of 1924 and 1925 provided effective machinery, generally speaking, for proper conservation of the fisheries. The 1924 Act, and the 1925 Act also, increased very largely the penalties for the various offences under the Acts, especially offences like the poisoning of rivers, stroke-hauling, and all that type of particularly obnoxious offences, as well as the <Col N="2853" /> offence of taking fish from the rivers during the spawning season.  These Acts also stop the outlet for the profitable disposal by the poacher of his catch.  That is that.  There only remains that the law should be administered; that the administration at headquarters should see that the law is carried out.  I do not know whether these complaints are groundless or not, but there have been complaints, and the Parliamentary Secretary can say in his reply whether or not there is any foundation for them. There have been complaints by boards of conservators that it is a waste of money for them to be employing bailiffs, because, automatically, when fines are imposed, as they can be imposed, by a district justice, they are either reduced or remitted altogether.  I wonder if the same system prevails now as I insisted should prevail during my time there.</P>
    <P>At a very early stage&mdash;in fact, almost immediately after the creation of the Department of Fisheries as a separate department&mdash;it was agreed that the Minister for Justice would not reduce or alter any penalty imposed by a district justice under the fishery laws except on the advice of the Minister for Fisheries.  I should like to know if that still prevails.  The Fishery Acts, right through, provide minimum penalties.  They give the district justice, once the person is found guilty, no discretion as to the amount of the penalty he imposes.  It is right that there should be the exercise of the prerogative in certain special cases; but the normal thing should be that the law should take its course. The exceptional thing should be that the fines should be remitted or reduced.  I have no hesitation in saying that, at any rate, for the first two years after the passing of those Acts, you might say that, in 99 per cent. of the cases, I wrote on the file that the law should take its course, until the lesson had sunk in.  I agree that there is room for being a little bit softer now, but I should not like the position to arise that poachers would get it into their heads again that every time they were fined they had only to send in a memorial and the fine would be automatically <Col N="2854" /> reduced to the very minimum or remitted altogether.</P>
    <P>Our angling attractions are easily the most important side of our tourist traffic and they bring into the country the best type of tourist, and the type that spends most money in the country. Deputy Corry guffaws, but it is true. Killarney knows it, and Waterville knows it, as Deputy Daly is very well aware.  The type of tourist that is looked for in the tourist centres in Donegal, the type of tourist that is looked for in Donegal and in Galway, is the angler tourist, and the sportsman generally&mdash;the man who takes a shoot or a piece of a river to fish.  He is the man who spends money in the country.  There will be a deadly blow struck at our tourist traffic if the fishery laws are not strictly enforced.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy The O'Mahony, who cannot be here, to make one other point.  I shall make it very briefly.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in a sense, has no responsibility in this matter.  In certain cases, where the boards of conservators take proceedings and an order is given in their favour, this order may be appealed against.  There is one case in point where the decision of the district justice, on appeal, was upheld by the Circuit Court.  It was further appealed to the High Court and the High Court reversed the decision.  The case occurred in the Cork area.  It involved the board of conservators in a sum of £300 in costs.  I think that some way ought to be found out of that rather bad predicament of a board of conservators in cases of that kind.  Either there should be some system by which the Attorney-General would undertake these prosecutions in the ordinary way out of the law charges or else there should be some method of recoupment of the boards of conservators when they have to meet a big bill of costs of that kind.</P>
    <P>One last word.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware, I suppose, that Section 13 of the 1925 Act will expire next year.  This section provides that the rates on valued fisheries go to the boards of conservators for the purpose of fishery protection instead of going to the local authority.  I should like <Col N="2855" /> to hear from him that he intends to make sure that legislation will be introduced before that provision expires, making provision for a further ten years, or making it a permanent part of our legislation, as was our intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just listened to a very able, if somewhat unscrupulous speech, with a very questionable object in view, and that is to cover up the Deputy's record while he was Minister.  We heard a great deal about the failure of the Department of Lands and Fisheries to deal with the housing problem in the Gaeltacht.  We heard nothing from Deputy Lynch about the reason for that failure, about the history of this question, about the promises and undertakings which he gave when there was entrusted to him a sum of £250,000 to spend in an experimental way in the Gaeltacht, so that a true basis and a sound basis for the solution of the housing problem in the Gaeltacht should be found.  Deputy Lynch, I said, was entrusted with a sum of £250,000 by the Oireachtas and he was entrusted with it on very specific and definite conditions; entrusted with it on the basis of undertakings which he gave when he was responsible for putting the measure to the Oireachtas.  I have looked up some of the statements made by Deputy Lynch on that question when he was Minister for Lands and Fisheries, and I find that, speaking on the 17th December, 1929, in the Seanad, as reported in the Official Report, volume 13, columns 417-18, Deputy Lynch, the then Minister, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 3 states: &lsquo;Where, in the opinion of the Minister, a dwelling house in the Gaeltacht is wholly unsuitable for the proper and healthy accommodation of the occupier thereof and his family,&rsquo; the Minister may make a grant.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he went on to lay down the conditions under which this grant might be made.  First of all,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;that first preference must be given to a household in which Irish <Col N="2856" /> is the ordinary language.  After that there comes the condition that amongst the Irish speaking households the one which from the point of view of sanitation and so on is the worst must get the preference.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He repeated that again.  In the course of his statement as reported in column 491 on the 18th December in the same volume we find him saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am perfectly certain that any Minister who comes after me will be as anxious as I am or as any Senators are, that the Bill is applied to the persons for whom it was conceived&mdash;the worst houses and the very poorest persons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, in volume 32 of the Dáil Debates, columns 1481-82, we find Deputy Lynch giving this undertaking to the Dáil:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Of those households those in which the sanitary conditions are worst and where the valuations are lowest will have prior claim on the total of the funds available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dozens of times there were undertakings of this sort given freely and emphatically by the Deputy who was then Minister.  Were those undertakings observed?  Were those principles applied?  They were in some cases. When a Fianna Fáil Deputy was interested in a district, as Deputy Blaney was in the districts of Greenfort and Knockalla electoral divisions, County Donegal, then these conditions were observed by the Minister. When, I repeat, a Fianna Fáil Deputy was interested in any particular district and raised the matter in the Dáil then Deputy Lynch, the Minister for Lands and Fisheries at that time, became a very strict trustee for the funds that had been entrusted to him. Recollecting the promise he had given during the passage of the 1929 Act and responding to Deputy Blaney's request that some attention might be given to these districts, of which he said that from personal knowledge he was perfectly sure that some of the houses are worse than any houses in the county, Deputy Lynch got up and piously assured him that priority under the Act had to be given to the poorest of the Irish-speaking homes.  &ldquo;The <Col N="2857" /> applications,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;from the district electoral divisions mentioned do not disclose any large number of urgent cases, but in the order of urgency these districts will be reached at an early date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Blaney asked:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is the Minister aware that in two or three townlands in Greenfort and Knockalla the residents are purely Irish-speaking and that many of them have asked for a grant under the Housing Act?  Will the Minister state why the applications of residents of these townlands have not been considered?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch replied as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy must not have quite understood my answer.  Even though the districts were entirely Irish-speaking, the Act provides that three-fifths of the total money is to be allocated to certain areas which are extremely poor.  The districts to which the Deputy refers do not come within the three-fifths, but as I stated in my reply, the order of urgency will probably bring them within a category which will be reached at an early date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney then asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is it not a fact that of the £250,000 originally granted two-fifths were to be expended in the Breac-Ghaeltacht and that no consideration has been given to claims from the areas I have mentioned?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy is misinterpreting the Act.  While three-fifths must be allocated to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht with a certain low valuation, the Act does not say that the five-fifths shall not be allocated to it.  The provision in the Act does not mean that two-fifths are to be allocated to the Breac-Ghaeltacht.  We are dealing with the most necessitous cases as they arise in the different areas and it is quite possible that the whole £250,000&mdash;if there were sufficient urgency, I should like it to be so myself&mdash;may be allocated to the areas to which we must allocate three-fifths.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>So far as we are concerned, we are saying that the Act is administered strictly in accordance with the principles enunciated when the legislation was being enacted.  I am doing that because the 1931 Act imposes special responsibility on the Minister for Finance.  While it has provided £100,000 and authorises the expenditure of £100,000, it only authorises that expenditure when the Minister for Finance is satisfied that the expenditure is going to be made in accordance with the Act, and the Act, as the Deputy knows, provides for a selective attack upon this problem, and as he himself said, when responsible for the measure, that grants should be given to the Fior-Ghaeltacht, and in the Fior-Ghaeltacht the most necessitous cases should be dealt with.  That is not the principle upon which the Act has been worked up to this year.</P>

      <P>The particular person at any rate was a person in the Fior-Ghaeltacht, living in a house no better than his neighbours, anxious to extend his house in order to accommodate people going there to learn the language.  He was therefore, a most deserving case.  Nevertheless, in the year 1932, I discovered his application <Col N="2865" /> had not been dealt with although it had been in for a long time because the moneys which should have been there to deal with the particular case were not there.  Applications had been granted without any regard to the selective principle under which the Act was supposed to be worked.  We found the Department denuded of every penny-piece that could possibly be allocated, and for which sanction could be got.  The money had been definitely promised to some applicant, as I say, without any proper inquiry as to whether the facts of the case merited the granting of the application.</P>

      <P>We found ourselves in this extraordinary position.  We have not been able to sanction a considerable number of applications that have been before us, because the £350,000 that had been granted by the Dáil has now to be paid out to applications which were granted in that indiscriminate manner.  The Deputy took a great deal of credit to himself for the fact that this year we had to provide £80,000.  I wish that the amount were £800,000.  We should possibly be bringing in a Bill this year to deal with this huge and pressing problem, the solution of which it is estimated by the Department will cost at least £3,000,000, if instead that £350,000 had been properly spent in making investigations that would enable <Col N="2866" /> us to produce in this year a sound solution for that problem.  If we were not able to do that, the responsibility does not lie with these benches here, but lies with those who betrayed their trust before we came into office.  Every time that we come to this House with a Finance Bill or with a Budget, a Budget full of proposals for constructive expenditure, full of proposals to provide employment, what reception do we get over there?  Do we get Deputy Lynch rising up then asking us what about the £3,000,000 to be spent on the Gaeltacht?</P>
      <P>Did we get Deputy Lynch getting up when the Budget was produced in May last; did we have Deputy McMenamin and Deputy O'Neill getting up from their benches in May last and saying: &ldquo;Why are you not making better provision for the Gaeltacht?&rdquo; Oh no, we had Deputy McGilligan getting up charged with his petty obscession of the two-year-old advertisement and telling us that we must economise and keep expenditure down.  We had Deputy Cosgrave getting up and saying that the country is groaning under the load of taxation that it can no longer endure. And we have Deputies McMenamin, O'Neill and all the others with their hands up to heaven saying that the country is bankrupt; that industry is declining and that taxation must be lightened.  Not a word about the Gaeltacht.  Then when we bring in a Bill to reduce public expenditure in order that we might make proper provision for services like this, what assistance do we get from the benches opposite?  We had six, seven, eight or ten days of Parliamentary time wasted and we had to listen to foolish piffly speeches from Deputy McGilligan, from Deputy Fitzgerald and from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  We had all these getting up and saying that this is a Bill which is a breach of the Ten Commandments.  The Deputy was not then thinking of the miserable hovels in the Gaeltacht.  He did not then sit beside Deputy Lynch and make an appeal that more money should be appropriated.  Oh, no!  He appealed to all the laws of God and man and to the Ten Commandments against the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the criticisms on the Estimate.  On the question of the Sea Fisheries Association I should like to say a word.  The main purpose of the Sea Fisheries Association was to assist in-shore fishermen. That was the main purpose and the records show that.  I think if I may say so, that too little attention is being paid to the in-shore fisheries and that is due to the fact that the main activities of the Sea Fisheries Association have been linked up with the trawling scheme which has been a very expensive venture.  Deputy Lynch again has asked us to continue the Sea Fisheries Association not merely for this year but for two or three years.  Very well. I am not prepared to say that possibly more money should not be spent on this trawling experiment.  But if we are going to have more money spent, then we will have more of these speeches from Deputy McGilligan about the £2,000,000.  I am putting that to Deputy Lynch.  The Deputy is clamouring now for increased expenditure. Will Deputy Lynch put the muzzle on him the next time that Deputy McGilligan gets up in this House and mentions a word about the £2,000,000?</P>

      <P>The last remark we had from the Minister for Finance summed up his speech&mdash;a waste of time on the part of the Government.  I certainly do not think that the time of this House could be more completely wasted by any speaker than it was wasted on behalf of the Government by the Minister for Finance.  Of course, he got up to waste the time of the House.  The whole of his speech was a deliberate attempt and endeavour to waste the time of the House.  He was never relevant.  He did not come to deal with this Estimate at all, but wandered all round it.  He tried to go back to tear his passions upon the Cumann na nGaedheal Party but he never came to the Estimate.  That was because he knows that the conduct of his Department since the Fianna Fáil Party came into office has been thoroughly incompetent and disgraceful. He knows that.  We all know why this Estimate was put back.  We <Col N="2870" /> all know why it figured early in the Order Paper on different days, and why it was put back and back until it comes on at a comparatively late hour to-night.  We know, of course, that the closure is coming.  We know, of course, there will be more muzzling and more Ministers running away as they ran away when the Vote for the President's Department was before the House.  We are perfectly certain that this unfortunate Parliamentary Secretary will be saved by the Minister for Finance from making any speech.  The Minister for Finance will get up and move the closure.  We know all that, but the Minister himself gets up and deliberately wastes the time of the House without having attempted any defence of his Department.</P>
      <P>Now, surely, if there is any part of this country to which this particular Administration have done injury it is to the Gaeltacht.  Everybody knows that.  Everybody who lives in the Gaeltacht, and I live in the Gaeltacht, and I know conditions there, knows that there is no part of this country which has suffered so badly under this economic war as the Gaeltacht has suffered.  That is perfectly plain and obvious, because the people who live in the Gaeltacht rear sheep and cattle, and have to sell them as store cattle.</P>

He is very loyal to his Party, and he wants to get them out of their difficulties.  I have spoken to the Deputy more in sorrow than in anger, and now I come back to where I was. I say nobody in this country has suffered more than the people of the Gaeltacht.  The people there have <Col N="2871" /> suffered most, because they are deprived of the opportunity of rearing their young cattle.  Everyone who lives in the Gaeltacht rears cattle, to a certain extent, but they cannot finish them.  Everybody knows that, but possibly the Minister for Finance may not know it.</P>

      <P>I do not mind Deputy Kelly or his remark.  As I was saying, no part of the country has suffered more than the Gaeltacht, owing to the depression of the prices of cattle.  Other parts of the country can buy store cattle.  If people lose their fat cattle, they can replace them at a cheaper price than others would be able to replace them.  It is the margin between what they sell as their finished cattle and the price at which they can replace them that means their profit in the long run.  But people in the Gaeltacht, who rear cattle, and buy none, must bear the entire loss themselves.  As far as cattle is concerned, owing to the attitude of the Government, terribly bad conditions prevail at the Gaeltacht at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I only said I could prove it.  You ruled I am not in order in proving it, and I shall not proceed.  Now here is another matter. There is no part of the country to which the Government and their supporters made more definite and clear promises than to the people who live in the Gaeltacht.  Every part and portion of the community, I might say was lied to by Fianna Fáil propaganda, during the last election, but to no section of the community were more lying and false promises made, than to the people who live in the Gaeltacht. In view of the promises made everyone who represents the Gaeltacht was entitled to expect that very much better treatment would be meted out to persons who live in the Gaeltacht this year than any other year.  The very opposite has happened.  A terrible lot of promises were made to the people of the Gaeltacht: everything was to be done for them.  Three gentlemen were appointed at very large salaries&mdash;I do not know what their salaries were&mdash;to report on what was happening in the Gaeltacht, and then <Col N="2873" /> the Government was to carry out all sorts of improvements.  Heaven only knows what mountains were to be planted, what lands were to be reclaimed and divided up.  We come here this evening to see how the promises that were made are being carried out by the Fianna Fáil Government, and how they are being kept to the people.  But we find simply that they have been successfully deceived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find every single thing that the Government has done shows a falling back from what was done before.  The Minister for Finance talked at very great length about the Gaeltacht Housing Act.  He attacked Deputy Lynch because Deputy Lynch, as Minister for Lands and Fisheries, having had a certain amount of money at his disposal, expended it in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht, and because he expended it quickly.  Having got a Vote of £250,000 Deputy Lynch, when he was Minister, allocated it there and then, and did everything to have a Gaeltacht housing scheme carried out quickly.  The Minister for Finance gets up here and says what a terrible thing this was.  The Fianna Fáil Government has done nothing for the Gaeltacht, and the whole scheme for the Gaeltacht is a dead letter in their hands.  The excuse of the Minister for Finance is, that Deputy Lynch, when he was Minister, was too active, and got through his work too quickly, and spent £250,000 in improvements in the Gaeltacht. That is the head of Deputy Lynch's offending.  He did his work too quickly and too expeditiously, and, therefore, we have to let the Gaeltacht housing come to an end.  What a very melancholy picture we got from the Parliamentary Secretary in his opening statement this evening.  There was not a single thing he touched upon that was not bad.  This is bad; that is bad; and the other is bad; and one thing was worse than another.  We started off with industries bad; then we have fishing&mdash;very bad; we come on a little bit further and we come to kelp&mdash;very bad, a very sad story we have to tell about kelp.  Then we come on to carrageen&mdash;worse than anything else.  There was not one single thing in the whole <Col N="2874" /> of that statement which he made to the House which showed that one thing was thriving under his administration. His cry was &ldquo;Nothing new&rdquo;; he attempted nothing, but he had the opportunity of building upon foundations that had been well and truly laid and in respect of which all the spade work had been done for him.  His sea fisheries organisation was in existence. There was the Gaeltacht housing scheme; kelp had been put on a firm basis, and carrageen the same.  The whole of the foundation was laid, and he had nothing to do except to build upon it, but he attempted nothing new himself, and yet, we find that instead of improving matters or keeping them up to the level on which they had been, he has allowed every single thing to slip back.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder at all that the Government are very displeased at having this Estimate debated at all. It is no wonder that they postponed it and tried to have it taken later. They hated the idea of having it discussed. They have shown incompetence all round, and they have shown inability to govern the affairs of this State all round, but nowhere have they shown greater inability to make good the promises which they made to the people than with regard to the people in the Gaeltacht.  It is no wonder they wanted to keep it back&mdash;no wonder at all.  These promises will work for a little time and will deceive the people for a little time, but they will not deceive them any longer, and I think that, by this time, no matter how much you may strive to stifle discussion in this House, you will not prevent the people of the Gaeltacht from recognising what they themselves are suffering and from recognising that every single source to which they looked to for their livelihood has been rendered less profitable to them, and that you have made the cost of living to them as high as you could make it.</P>

      <P>Needless, to say, I was particularly glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that £5,000 were being made available for the erection of a mussel purification tank in Dublin Bay.  We are interested in the mussel-fishing industry in County</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2875" /> Meath.  We have, for a long time, been looking forward to the erection of this tank so that mussels can go through a process of purification and be placed on the market in a fit state for sale.  The population of Mornington and the surrounding districts along the Boyne have been engaged in mussel fishing for generations, and, during the winter months, when the close season for salmon fishing comes along, these men engage in fishing the mussels and, for some years back, they have been unable to sell them in the English market, because medical gentlemen on the other side claimed that there were some germs in the mussels that rendered them unfit for consumption.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to speed up the erection of this purification tank.  I should like to point out to him that the mussel fishing should commence in the beginning of October, and if the tank is not erected by the beginning of October, the fishermen in Mornington, and, I take it, in other parts of Ireland, will be idle.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that the plans are well advanced. No doubt, the plans are well advanced on paper, but I should like to see the foundations laid and the work well advanced.  I presume that this money will be given to the Sea Fisheries Association to expend, and I am not too certain that that body can be accused of being a very speedy body.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will have the matter speeded up when it is put into the hands of the Sea Fisheries Association.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned by Deputy Lynch that the mussel-fishing industry has been killed on account of the tariff imposed against it in England.  I suppose that is just as true as the other statements in connection with the economic war and its effects on the products of this country.  The mussel-fishing industry has not been killed, and, if it was not a paying concern, if it was not an industry that could pay its way, I should not be standing up here this morning asking the Parliamentary Secretary to speed up the matter for us.  With regard to relief grants&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies on the Opposition side may laugh.  They gave relief grants to the idle fishermen because they could not fish these mussels and did not provide a purification tank for them.  We appealed last year for a relief grant for unemployment in that district, and, this year, we shall have to do the same, unless the purification tank is erected.  Furthermore, a relief grant will be necessary, because of the accumulation of mussels.  The fish will accumulate to such an extent that they cannot afterwards be fished unless they are removed from the spot in which they accumulate.  It is not relief grants that should be given down in that part of the country, because they have there a potential source of wealth.  They have an industry which needs no loans and no overdrafts, and is an independent profitable industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I would like to refer to is the salmon fishing on the Boyne. Has the Parliamentary Secretary power to have the system of trapping salmon on the Boyne discontinued. As far as I can find out, these traps on the Boyne are held by vested interests under some sort of charter given them hundreds of years ago. Salmon running up the tidal water a few miles from Drogheda enter the first trap, and when the water is low if they are lucky enough to escape it, they fall into the second trap and very few will get five miles further up. People living along the river have licences to fish with nets from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m., except on Saturdays and Sundays.  Traps can be laid from six o'clock on Monday morning until six o'clock on Saturday evening.  The time for fishing with nets is shortened, but those who catch the majority of the fish have a longer period.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see if he has any power to have the system of trapping fish discontinued, and to look into the question of shortening the period during which traps can be set.  Fishermen on the upper reaches of the Boyne at Trim, Navan and Kells, complain that, although they pay for licences to fish for salmon <Col N="2877" /> they are unable to have satisfactory results in these areas, owing to the operation of the traps.  I suggest that if the vested interests interfere with the wishes of the people, the Parliamentary Secretary should keep the matter in mind, with a view to having legislation introduced to deal with it in the near future.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Kelly has anticipated a great deal of what I intended to say in connection with the Mornington fishermen.  I notice, however, that he disagrees with the statement of Deputy Lynch that the 40 per cent. tariff has interfered with trade out of which fishermen lived for years.  The Deputy is quite right in urging the Government, and the Department concerned to hurry on with the construction of the purification tank at Howth.  He is not right, I think, in blaming the Cumann na nGaedheal Government for the delay about that, because, I think I am right in saying that a great deal of the delay was caused by differences of opinion existing between the Mornington, the Clogher Head and the Howth fishermen as to the best place to put the tank.  In any case, the tank is not yet constructed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Kelly that he has a grievance there, but it is against his own Government.  What is the use of constructing a tank for the purification of shell-fish when the market for that shell-fish has been destroyed?  These Mornington fishermen earned £3, £4 and £5 a week raising mussels.  They sold these mussels across the Channel, the market being mainly in England.  Assuming, owing to the exhortation of Deputy Kelly, that this tank is constructed at Howth, and that the mussels will be brought there, what is going to happen to them afterwards?  There is no market for them in England.  Other industries, such as the cattle-trade, butter, and so on, have been helped by bounties.  I am entitled to ask that the Government should provide a bounty for the shell-fishing industry. All the people in Meath are not ranchers.  As Deputy Kelly pointed out, there are some fishermen there, and they existed on this mussel <Col N="2878" /> industry.  Instead of getting £3, £4 or £5 a week they were getting about 24/- to 30/- a week last winter working on the roads.  I admit that that was better than nothing.  Even if the purification tank is given to Howth, their industry will not be given back to the mussel men.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch tried to make the case that under his administration the Gaeltacht and the Government services, generally, were better attended to than under the present Government.  I entirely disagree with the Deputy there.  What was the position when this Party came into office? Fianna Fáil Deputies from the Gaeltacht have experience of it.  We received representations regarding applications for housing in the Gaeltacht, and when we visited the Government offices here we found that the money had been allocated.  To whom was it allocated?  In 90 per cent. of the cases it was allocated to supporters of the late Government.</P>

      <P>I stand over that statement, and I can prove it.  That is my reply when people ask if there is no money available to the present Government for dealing with the housing question in the Gaeltacht.  It could not be a coincidence that all the money was ear-marked for a certain type of people.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that there should be a complete overhaul of the Sea Fisheries Association and other Departments under his control, as that would serve a very useful purpose. The planting of mussels in the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2879" /> Cromane district of Kerry, which is one of the main centres in this country for that industry, has been neglected.  During last season the Sea Fisheries Association provided in or about £30 for planting operations. That amount was entirely insufficient.</P>
    <P>It should have been, at least, £100. There, again, politics played a very large part.  This is the first time in any statement I have made in the House that I have referred to politics or to the practices that have been carried on under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, but here, again, in this district, politics played a leading part.  It is all very well for the ex-Minister to say he did not directly take part in practices of that kind but he had agents in areas &mdash;and particularly in that area&mdash;who saw to it that in this particular peninsula the supporters of Fianna Fáil were isolated.  The mussel-beds adjacent to where they were residing were neglected.  They were not planted for the three, four or five years previously.  I have submitted a map, which is marked, to the Secretary of the Sea Fisheries Association, pointing out the areas that have been neglected. Under the British régime&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I referred to last year, particularly, and, by way of elaboration, I pointed out that, during former years, through this process of victimisation, the beds adjacent to where our <Col N="2880" /> supporters resided were neglected.  I intervened to make sure that fair play would be given to all persons in those areas.  I have submitted a map to the Secretary of the Sea Fisheries Association in order to have the matter rectified.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, at least, £100 should be provided for planting operations in that locality during this season.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of lobsters, the main point is to concentrate on the development of the Continental market.  It is a strange proceeding when we find that in the western district, in the Dingle area, and, on the south coast, around Cahirdaniel&mdash;the Frenchman has agents.  He has an agent in the Blaskets purchasing lobsters.  We have the Sea Fisheries Association which should have seen to that and developed the lobster fishing for the benefit of the poor fishermen of that district.  It is very strange to find that the Frenchman can come in and keep a man working for him at a profit and that we, with an expensive administration and an expensive Sea Fisheries Board, do not realise the importance of the lobster industry in that area.  By way of suggestion, I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary, that there is at Castlecove, near Cahirdaniel, a natural inlet that could be utilised as a storage tank for lobsters.  One of the inspectors concerned visited the area some time ago and reported favourably in regard to it.  At the nominal expenditure of a few hundred pounds, an absolute barrier could be erected whereby lobsters could be stored in this little inlet.  That would be of great importance in regulating supply and demand because you would be able to cope with the market.  You would have a supply available on all occasions.</P>
      <P>There is one other important point I would like to mention, and it has relation to the oyster beds in Tralee Bay.  In order to prove that I am not trying to score from the political point of view, I will mention this much, that an inspector in my own area, a nominee of Deputy Lynch's, took it on himself to develop the oyster beds in</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2881" /> Tralee Bay.  There was no official planting carried out in that instance. There was a voluntary system in which the fishermen co-operated with the inspector.  What happened?  In 1923, when he took over these oyster beds, there were four boats operating, and in 1931, when he finished, there were 24 boats operating.  What has happened since?  Through the lack of a little assistance from the Sea Fisheries Association and the Department in the matter of planting, the oyster beds are going back and, in another year or two, they will probably go back to the state in which the inspector, Mr. O'Dwyer took them over.</P>
    <P>I have shown what can be done in a small way with very little expenditure. All these theories, such as sterilizing plants, etc., are all right, but the people interested in the oyster business know their own requirements.  We are in close touch with the fishermen who are intimately concerned with the business.  They have had years of practical experience and, in their own way, they could enlighten some of the experts in the different Departments. It would be well for the inspectors concerned if they gave serious consideration to some of the suggestions put forward by fishermen along the coast, particularly in the south and the west.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Gaeltacht housing question, I would like to suggest that, if at all possible, the applications that have been investigated and approved should be transferred to the Local Government Department, and, in order to save time and expense, the report of the engineers who have approved of particular plans for the Gaeltacht houses should be adopted by the Local Government Department. There is very little difference except in this sense, that the loan could be obtained on more favourable terms under the Gaeltacht scheme.  I understand it could be obtained at 5½ per cent., while the other works out at 6 per cent.  I am sure that matter could be very easily adjusted.  I merely make that suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>The Cumann na nGaedheal Government provided money for the training of nurses from the Gaeltacht districts, <Col N="2882" /> but they never at any period put their scheme into operation.  When I went into the offices, the inspectors informed me that the scheme fell through because the matrons of the hospitals in Dublin would not cooperate. I persisted last year and, with the co-operation of Mr. Bradley, the Richmond Hospital did take in a few girls from the Kerry Gaeltacht. We are not satisfied that the scheme has received the consideration which it should receive.  An effort should be made to provide an adequate sum for the training of girls from the Gaeltacht. It would be a great opening for brilliant girls who might otherwise have no facilities for training.  I suggest the scheme could be operated quite economically and it would be of great benefit to many young girls in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch said that the Gaeltacht housing scheme operated mainly as it was designed to operate, that is, in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, and that nobody except those who spoke Irish would benefit by it, and in the Breac-Ghaeltacht, equally those who knew Irish and who spoke Irish as a rule, where it was known, would get first preference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge that statement absolutely, and Deputy Flynn has challenged it so far as it applied to Kerry. I will give one concrete example to any Deputy who disbelieves the protests that we make.  There was a case, which I can prove, of a large family, whose house was bad, and who spoke Irish habitually; in the same district there was a family of equal size, living in a house of equal condition&mdash;a house in which no Irish was spoken or known.  The Irish family was turned down and the &ldquo;English&rdquo; family was given the grant. How would you characterise the application of the Act in that case?  Those <Col N="2885" /> cases, in Connemara at all events, are so numerous that it would be useless to particularise.  If anybody does not believe what I say about it, and if anybody wants to try to make people believe that this Act was carried out impartially, I advise him to go down and make that statement in Connemara. Decisions under the scheme were made entirely on political grounds.  I challenge contradiction on that.  The thing was notorious in Connemara. I think it just as well that that scheme should be wound up and housing generally operated from one Department.  The operating machine, as far as the Gaeltacht Housing Department is concerned at any rate, should be entirely scrapped.  I believe it is incapable of operation.  The people who are operating it seem to be actuated by political bias, and no other motive.  I made a statement to that effect during the 1932 election, when an official of the Housing Department was listening to me.  I made it because I saw him there listening to me, either during the meeting or afterwards. He did not challenge the truth of what I said.</P>
    <P>Another matter which was mentioned by Deputy Lynch was the appointment of four officers to buy kelp and carrigeen this year, and the removal of the agents.  He said that was a very bad proceeding; that the agents had given satisfaction, and were really the best people to buy kelp and carrigeen, as they knew all about it. In Connemara, the people do not agree with that point of view.  There is an Act known as the Truck Act, and that Act was frequently broken by the kelp agents in Connemara.  No money was handed out to the people who sold kelp.  They had to take shop goods.  I know a case in which an unfortunate man, after buying the things he required, had a balance of 4d. coming to him; he would not get the 4d.; it was kept to his credit.  Those cases were, as I say, too numerous to particularise, but what I say on this question can be backed up in every parish in Connemara.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Sea Fisheries Association and Fisheries Development, Deputy Lynch drew attention to the decrease in the amount voted <Col N="2886" /> for development purposes.  I understand that that is due to the fact that the Sea Fisheries Association is now easing off in the trawler experiment. I think that that is a wise change.  I do not agree, of course, with the reduction in the amount for fisheries development.  I should like to see more spent on it.  Deputy Lynch said that it would be wise to keep on losing money for a couple of years on the trawler experiment. That may be so, but I think if there were any losses to be incurred in fishery development it would be much wiser to incur those losses in trying to develop the in-shore fisheries.  I know the Department holds that you cannot stabilise the supplies in this country, except on the basis of trawler fishing.  I think that has to be proved yet.  I a not in a position to challenge it, but I do not think anybody is in a position to confirm it with any degree of accuracy, because trawling has not been developed to any extent.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am not at all enamoured of the Fishery Department.  It is a Department that has been largely criticised by Deputy Lynch.  I hope to see it greatly altered, or at least, to see it made more adaptable to the needs of the particular district in which it is operating.  I do not believe, and nobody in the Gaeltacht believes, that the present operations of the Fisheries Department can solve what has come to be known as the Gaeltacht problem.  Kelp, carrageen and such like industries, can never solve it.  I admit that when fully developed they would do a good deal to mitigate the position there, but they cannot have any lasting effect until most of the people, particularly in the very congested parts of the Fíor-Gaeltacht, are given holdings elsewhere.  However, that is a matter for another Bill.</P>
    <P>I have no more to say on this matter, a Chinn Comhairle.  I do not usually speak in this House, but I thought it would be too bad to allow to go unchallenged an ex-Minister who for five years, whether it was done with his knowledge or not, allowed corruption of the very worst kind to be <Col N="2887" /> carried on in his Department.  For that reason I challenged him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks on this Estimate.  In this Estimate the Government trading is exemplified, and while Government trading may be very successful and very necessary in certain instances, when it conflicts with private enterprise, the Government would have to make up their minds as to which they desired to promote.  Looking first at the heading for carrageen development, apparently the carrageen gatherers are going to get a very much lower price this year.  Certainly, the Government did not develop the sale of carrageen moss to the extent that it might have been developed.  Last year, a matter came under my notice, where a considerable amount of carrageen moss could have been exported if the Government were prepared to let the finished product back again into this country without charging the duties.  That may or may not have been a reasonable proposition; but the Government did not see their way to go in for that scheme, and in consequence, certainly in that one instance&mdash;and there may have been others&mdash;the sale of carrageen moss suffered.</P>
      <P>The next matter to which I should like to refer is the activities of the Sea Fisheries Association, and there it seems to me that the Government will have to make up their minds that either they are going to compete with privately-owned trawlers and exterminate them or they are going to make it a Government enterprise altogether. There are, I think, at the present time only about seven steam trawlers left operated by private enterprise, and they catch fish and bring it into the market and distribute it and, presumably, it is disposed of.  The Sea Fisheries Association, with the object, presumably, of increasing the supply of fish that is taken by the Sea</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2888" /> Fisheries Association and their distributing machinery from the in-shore fishermen, hired seven trawlers.  Four of those trawlers were English and three were Scottish.  The development of trawlers seems to be very much in doubt.  Some people say that there is going to be a smaller type of trawler operated on the Spanish system, in which two trawlers operate the net between them.  Other people contend that the steam trawler will be replaced by some type of motor-driven trawler. If the Sea Fisheries Association had conducted a series of experiments and operated a few boats on the Spanish system and a few others on the motor-driven system, there might have been some excuse, but, apparently, as I say, they hired four English and three Scottish trawlers to reinforce the supply of the in-shore fishermen; and the catch of those seven trawlers and the organisation of the Sea Fisheries Association's distributing machinery is operating in direct competition with all that is left of the Irish trawlers operating a parallel system.  It seems to me that the Government ought to make up their minds and come out boldly and have a talk with the remnant of the privately-owned trawlers and tell them that they think they are not operating on correct lines, if they do think so; but this war of extermination ought not to be undertaken. The seven trawlers go back to England to be refitted and, unless the Irish trawlers should get any unfair advantage while they are being refitted in Milford or some other port, the Irish trawlers are handicapped by having to wait for permits for twine and other details like that.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have referred to the fact that the trawling activities were reduced.  I understand that some member&mdash;probably a member of the Government&mdash;thought it was not seemly that this considerable expense should go on; or perhaps he discovered the nationality of the trawlers, and the four English trawlers were dispensed with, and the three Scottish trawlers are left.  I must say that the Parliamentary Secretary, in introducing these Estimates, certainly gave us very full details compared with other Estimates; but I <Col N="2889" /> should like him, in his reply, if possible, to deal with the general principle of how far the Government are going to go in the sea-fishing industry. Are they going to take over the whole of the sea fishing?  Other people think that the money that was spent in hiring these trawlers might have been more advantageously expended on the provision of the long-promised patrol boat that was to help to keep the coast clear of foreign trawlers that were poaching.  After all, the object of either the Government Sea Fisheries Association, or the privately owned trawlers, is to catch fish, and one hears inshore fishermen talking about foreign trawlers that are, practically, almost trawling over their ground lines.  If that is the case&mdash;I expect it is a bit of an exaggeration&mdash;but if it is the case, it does appear to me that the first object of the Government ought to be to protect efficiently the stock of fish that is around these shores.  For that reason, I think that the Parliamentary Secretary ought to give us the details as to what is intended, or if any further provision is intended for patrol boats.</P>
    <P>Passing from the sea to the Gaeltacht industries, a somewhat similar position has arisen there.  The Government are very anxious, naturally, to promote the cottage industries, but there are also firms that give very considerable employment in the Gaeltacht to people, and it is practically impossible for private enterprise to develop if the present Government policy is carried out.</P>
    <P>I suppose most of us are sufficiently conversant with manufacturing conditions to realise that, broadly speaking, the manufacturer has to meet the cost of raw material, wages, and overhead expenses.  Presumably the firms engaged in private enterprise in the Gaeltacht have to meet those three items.  When we turn to the Estimates, we see a provision of £22,000, or something like that, for raw material. When we turn to the appropriations-in-aid, the sum is exactly the same. In other words, they are going to sell the stuff for the material cost.  That may be all right for the Government <Col N="2890" /> for promoting cottage industries, but some line of cleavage must come, and I suggest that, when you are also providing £4,000 for power looms, you are getting to a point where the Government must go very much further and private enterprise disappear, or the Government must make some effort to reconcile the two conflicting interests. Private firms that are operating, or someone that is operating in the Gaeltacht, have built up a well-deserved reputation for Donegal homespun tweeds.  But with Government assistance there is Donegal tweed supplied the wool of which never saw Ireland until it was imported, and it is carded and spun outside Ireland.  If that were done by a private individual, I think there would be a prosecution and that he would not be allowed to describe that material as homespun Donegal tweed.  That is another most undesirable form of what I call conflicting interests.  The Government, in their anxiety to promote sales, have, I suggest, rushed to a point at which something ought to be done.  Naturally, when they begin to supply homespun tweed at a price that only covers the cost of the material, that renders it even more difficult for the other manufacturers to carry on their business at a profit.  It is rumoured that the Government are contemplating a very much wider extension of their activities, and that they are going to make cardigans, pullovers, socks, and various other things for the army. They have power machines and various other machines that really belong to factories.</P>
    <P>But the real point that I wish to make as to these two items, namely, the Gaeltacht industries and the fisheries, is that the Government ought to reconcile their own manufacturing activities with those of private enterprise. I am not attempting to draw any line of demarcation.  I frankly admit that the interests of the Gaeltacht ought to be considered as paramount. At the same time, the Government must realise that they are going to get to a point in which private enterprise will have disappeared.  I do not know whether they will then heap reproaches upon manufacturers <Col N="2891" /> for not embarking on private enterprise. We heard last night that Irishmen were not sufficiently adventurous in embarking on manufacturing undertakings in their own country.  It would appear to me, however, that if manufacturing undertakings in their country are going to be met with Government competition along practically similar and parallel lines, there is going to be even a less field for private enterprise in manufacturing industries.  I would ask the Government to take this very seriously into consideration and that the Parliamentary Secretary should, if it is at all possible, outline what the Government's sphere is, and what it is they have reserved for private enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the fisheries, I have one word to say.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to say in his reply whether any inquiry has been made as to the depredations of these foreign trawlers, as to the full effect of their activities on the Irish fisheries.  Are they playing havoc with the fishing beds in Irish waters? We know that it is a commonplace with fishermen all along the coast.  Every time I go to Arklow I am told that the foreign trawlers are the biggest enemy they have to face, that they are destroying the fishing.  I do not doubt that for a moment.  What I should like to know is whether the Department has made an estimate of that destruction.  Is the Department satisfied that the destruction is continuous and cumulative?  Because what makes me more or less independent minded on it is an article that I read written, I think, by a Tory Irish peer in the British Parliament about 1857, in which he mentioned that at that time foreign trawlers were destroying the Irish fishing. That was written, I think, as far back as about 1857, and if that has been going on all that time&mdash;because actually it must have been increasing, as I do not believe that steam trawlers were at that time anything like what they are now, it would seem to me that fishing must have been reduced to a very, very low quantity by this time. That is a matter I would like to know, whether the Fishery Department have <Col N="2892" /> actually inquired into the extent of that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is scarcely a month passes without a question appearing on the Order Paper about foreign trawling, and every time I go to Arklow, the fishermen tell me that the foreign trawlers are making profitable fishing impossible, and it should be one of the duties of the Department to say to what extent are the possibilities of profitable fishing in Irish waters being interfered with by foreign trawlers.  A great deal of the discussion on the Vote has been devoted to the question of whether there should not be better protection against foreign trawlers, and naturally when we are to decide on that question, we want to know to what etxent is the quantity of fish available for Irish fishermen being interfered with by the activity of foreign trawlers.  I think it is the duty of the Fishery Department to give us some idea of the extent to which it is being interfered with, because it will prove a very expensive business adequately to protect the Irish fishing fleets, and in deciding whether that expense is justified or not, or whether the Government's proposals are adequate, we want to know to what extent the fishermen within the Saorstát are being hampered in their activities by the activities of foreign trawlers.  I think that is the only question of any importance I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with in connection with this problem, and I say I have to admit that so far as I can learn, the Sea Fisheries Association is not giving satisfaction.  It is not doing what it set out to do; it is not gaining the confidence of the fishermen to the extent we hoped it would when we passed the Act which created the Sea Fisheries Association. No doubt it had a very hard task in front of it when it started, and it has a very hard task before it still.  It is apparent from the report of the Fisheries in England and other countries that the fishing industry in every country is meeting with hard times at present, and, naturally, in a country like this where the fishing industry has never reached a position <Col N="2893" /> of real strength, it should be meeting with difficult times.  But at the same time, I think there is room for a great deal more energy on the part of the Sea Fisheries Association.  I think now that with the experience they have had, they should be able to do more for the fishermen and the marketing of the fish.  They should be able to consider the requirements of fishermen with regard to the position of boats and nets and gear and so on, a great deal more satisfactorily than they have been doing up to the present.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to speak for long on this debate, but only a few sub-heads I would like to have answered.  Take sub-head H (5) Exhibits of Gaeltacht products at shows and fairs&mdash;I see that that Estimate is reduced from £1,600 to £1,100. I would imagine that that is a mistake, because if you advertise Gaeltacht products you will get the people to take an interest in them.  I would like that Estimate, if it is possible, to be an increase on last year's Estimate. Take the ordinary country horse and cattle shows.  I was last year at some of those shows.  I was connected with some of them and interested in them. We asked for Gaeltacht exhibits.  The show committees were very anxious to have those exhibits at their competitions, and every committee was willing to make provision for them, but when we asked for the exhibits the answer given was, that they could not send the exhibits because they could not afford it.  I would say that was very foolish of the Department, because by advertising your products at those provincial shows it creates demand.  I see another sub-head here, No. H (6), which is reduced from £2,500 to £2,000.  I think that is a mistake, because we will never get anywhere with our Gaeltacht products until we advertise.  There is no use in the Department cutting down on the expenditure of advertising by a few hundred pounds, because that expenditure would result in the buying of thousands of pounds worth of the products of the Gaeltacht.  There are a few small matters I would like to refer to also.  Take sub-head H (4)&mdash;<Col N="2894" /> Materials of wool, yarn and other raw materials for industrial centres.  I would like to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary that Irish wool should be used as much as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I could tell you something if I wanted to go back to the promises you made before the election, and what is your performance since. Since you came into power, the Gaeltacht services have been reduced by&mdash; I cannot get the figures now, but certainly the full figures for Gaeltacht services show reduction, a considerable reduction since you came into this House, so if I were you, I would not boast about what you have done for the Gaeltacht.  Irish wool should be used where possible.  Now, while we are on this, I want to mention about the Galway Woollen Factory which happens to come into the Gaeltacht. We hear such a lot about the number of new factories and the revival of industries in this country which is supposed to have taken place in the last one-and-a-half years.  Some time ago, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was giving figures as to the increased employment in the woollen industry, he mentioned the Athlone Woollen Factory as working overtime.  I mentioned the Galway Woollen Factory, an industry which was established a number of years ago, and gave considerable employment in Galway, about 400 or 500 hands.  It has been closed for some years now, but the machinery at least is there.  It is really the one industry you have in Galway&mdash;the woollen industry&mdash;and it is strange to say the Minister months ago told me in reply that he hoped to see Galway factory opened within a few months.  Up to the present there is no sign.  It is in the Gaeltacht, and I would like now that some move should be made.  The population in Galway City is increasing very much, and it was the one industry for years that had been a paying proposition. It gave employment to 400 or 500 people.  If that factory was taken in hands again, it might possibly in the course of time employ up to 100 people <Col N="2895" /> in the City of Galway.  I think Deputy Flynn mentioned about housing, and I think he mentioned he would like to see it going under Local Government, but what I see about Gaeltacht housing problems is that housing is under the Department of Local Government, the Land Commission and the Board of Works.  At present you have in the West of Ireland and North-West, four sets of inspectors going around on housing alone.  You have Gaeltacht housing inspectors and you have Board of Works inspectors.  I believe myself some scheme could be adopted by which all those housing operations could be carried out under one head with one set of inspectors instead of duplicating. You have different inspectors travelling over the same ground day by day, and you might even say you have local authority inspectors, county surveyors and assistant surveyors travelling over this particular ground, and if you could have some scheme by which you could get all those housing inspectors under the one head, and have one standard plan, it would make matters much easier.  I would like to see some amalgamation in that respect of Local Government, Gaeltacht, Land Commission and Board of Works schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the housing itself, certainly, I have been down through Connemara not nearer than last Sunday.  I have been in four different places and as far as I could see the people have a terrible grievance as to promises not kept.  All the people who have applied and who cannot get certificates in order that they could start their houses, complain bitterly.  There is no employment in the Gaeltacht at present.  As Deputy Lynch mentioned, all the little industries, carrageen and kelp are at the present time at a standstill and there is no employment whatsoever.  I have heard that in three or four different places not later than last Sunday, that even for all the relief work there is no employment given there at present. So far as I could see in the different places things are much worse in Connemara than ever I expected&mdash;much worse.  To deal with the Gaeltacht <Col N="2896" /> housing problems in the Gaeltacht itself, I don't blame the Parliamentary Secretary.  I blame the Executive Council and the Minister for Finance. The Minister knows nothing whatsoever about the Gaeltacht.  He has proved that and certainly the Parliamentary Secretary is in the position that he knows sufficient about the Gaeltacht.  The money should be made available for it because of the promises that were made by every member of the Executive Council including the Minister for Finance and the different Deputies that when they would be the Government, what would they not do? I believe the Government are doing nothing to carry out these promises and I say that the Parliamentary Secretary is a bit too soft for the Minister for Finance.  I believe myself that to deal with the housing problem in the Gaeltacht and to deal with the problem boldly would take £2,000,000.  At least that sum would be necessary.</P>

They were the people who suffered and kept the language and the nation together and certainly they deserve something from us.  The expenditure of money on reclamation works I mentioned a few days ago.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance spoke of a sum of money, between £50,000 and £60,000, which may go a long way but it will take a great deal more.  The same applies to every other part of the West of Ireland. There is plenty of work in the Gaeltacht in the lands of the West, for lime kilns, such as stone and waste and old rubbish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We might have a trial at it.  I have seen the erection and burning of lime kilns; I have seen the turf built round the rocks and burned without lime at all; I have seen them going to that trouble; I have just passed through it.  There is another matter I mentioned some few weeks ago.  Regarding the domestic economy school in Clifden in the heart of the Gaeltacht, I mentioned that at an examination of the pupils in Galway by the Agricultural Committee, out of 15 girls, 13 were more efficient in Irish than English.  I learned from the remarks of the Rev.  Chairman at the time that there was not a word of Irish being spoken in the Domestic Economy School.  That is the statement of the Rev.  Chairman at the meeting.  He said that it was a disgrace to have young girls leaving the national school with a fluent knowledge of Irish and going into a school to which the Department is giving a grant of over £600, and that from once they go into that school they do not hear a word of Irish.  A word of Irish is not spoken to them.  I have been informed since that the Department are responsible for that condition of affairs.</P>

      <P>You have two years of office now and you were to do an enormous work in 12 months.  In eight months you were to have unemployment relieved.  You have had two runs of Estimates coming along here, and it was up to the people who claim to be so much in favour of the Irish language to see whether £600 was to be spent on a school in the heart of the Gaeltacht where there was not a word of Irish being spoken.  We are accused of being Imperialists and traitors, and, therefore, you could not expect us to have the same interest in the language as some of the patriots over there.  I am informed that the people in charge of the school are not responsible. They want a certain number of teachers, and the teachers have to be sanctioned by the Department. Although the Minister for Agriculture sanctions teachers who have not a word of Irish for this school in the heart of the Gaeltacht, those girls who go in there, and who hear nothing but English, are expected when they come to Kilmacud after a few years to speak Irish fluently.  Is it any credit to the Government that such a state of things should exist in the Gaeltacht?  Deputy Flynn told us that in the case of house building, 90 per cent. of the applicants who received grants belonged to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  If that is the case in the Gaeltacht, how is it that a Fianna Fáil Government is in office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>So much has already been said on this Vote that very little new ground now remains to be covered. It was amusing to hear Deputy Lynch telling the House about legislation that he had in mind for the improvement of fisheries when he was in charge of this Department.  Deputy Lynch, who was then Minister for Fisheries, on January 18th, 1923, promised extra protection for our fisheries.  He remained in office as Minister for Fisheries for <Col N="2899" /> eight years afterwards, but for the first time on this Estimate we heard of the legislation which he had in mind for the protection of the fisheries.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to a few grievances in connection with fisheries which we have in Donegal. It seems to me that the trawling operations of the Sea Fisheries Association have not been the success that was anticipated.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Sea Fisheries Association that some effort should be made to devote some of the money for the development of fisheries to the hiring of drifters, steam-drifters, instead of to steam-trawlers. At the present time in Donegal, and in other parts of the country where herring-fishing is pursued, when shoals of herring appear in May and in autumn, there are no local boats available and the success or failure of the herring-fishing on the Irish coast depends on the goodwill of English or Scotch firms who send over their drifters and their curers to look for the herrings.  I think some effort should be made by the Fisheries Association to repair, if they can be repaired, the drifters taken to Downings Bay during the regime of Deputy Lynch and left there to rot.  Some effort should be made on the part of the Sea Fisheries Association to see if these drifters can be repaired and to obtain the services of competent crews who would be in a position to go and locate the shoals instead of waiting for the English or Scotch drifters to come along to our coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishermen of Teelin&mdash;I put this before the Parliamentary Secretary already&mdash;have a grievance in respect of the boundary as fixed by the previous regime.  I think that an inquiry should be held into the existing boundary on the Teelin-Carrigan river.  This boundary, which is part of several fisheries was fixed 78 or 79 years ago through pressure by the then landlords on the tenants.  These people consider they have a grievance, and they are anxious that the Department should take up the matter and have an inquiry into the existing boundary to see if in the <Col N="2900" /> circumstances it is fair and equitable to them.</P>
    <P>We have at present a dispute in Kildoney area, where the fishermen are being prevented from fishing in the river Erne.  That matter has been in dispute for some time, and the fishermen feel that the time has come when some decision should be given in regard to it.  The fishermen decided that they would enter the Erne estuary and to fish there, and notified the authorities to this effect.  The result was that the men who claimed that they have a right to fish there, although the matter has not been legally decided, have been kept out of the fishing area.  I hope that the little publicity that the matter has received by the fact that the Guards are being forced to keep the Kildoney fishermen out will hasten a decision on the question of the Erne fisheries. Another estuary in Donegal known as the Loughras Bay estuary was sold separate from the land to the Congested Districts Board.  As the Department is the successor of the Congested Districts Board, I would like to point out that the Congested Districts Board offered to sell to the tenants 16 years ago for £1,000 the fishery rights of the Loughras Bay estuary.  No agreement was reached and the Congested Districts Board decided to carry on until the capital expended was realised.  Now that the tenants are of opinion that the Department had ample time and failed to realise the capital expended, the tenants should now be entitled to the fishery rights.</P>
    <P>Application was made some time ago for a proposed change in the close season by the Moville Fishery Board.  Despite the fact that the chairman of the board and several other members as well as members of the general public made what they considered a very good case for the proposed alteration, it appears that the Department did not agree to it.  If there is any possibility of having the matter re-investigated I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should have the question of the proposed change of the Moville Fishery Board re-opened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2901" /> In the Estimates I notice that provision is made for the establishment of new centres.  I trust that in the choosing of the centres this year the needs of the district rather than the political affiliations of the people in the district will be the concern of the Department.  It is pretty well known in many districts in the Donegal Gaeltacht, where the people were not thinking politically in the direction that the previous Administration were thinking, that centres were not very lavishly established.  I think that Deputy McMenamin will agree with me when I point out that nothing had been done in the Gaeltacht area from Glenfin to Dungloe up to a couple of months ago, when a centre was established in the Fintown district.  Despite the fact that my colleague, Deputy MacFadden, wept tears about the Fianna Fáil promises to the Gaeltacht, I should say that I think the Deputy should be the last who should complain about the people in the Gaeltacht, because the part of the Gaeltacht that he thinks about has been well catered for, and in the Deputy's own town or parish every industry under the control of the Gaeltacht Department has been established.  There are embroidery, weaving, crochet, and I do not know what else there, and for years equally-deserving places had no branch of the Gaeltacht industry at all.  My complaint is that the Department catered for a particular area and did not spread out the industries in the manner in which they should have done.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that my colleague, Deputy Dillon, is not here to-night. Deputy Dillon was terribly anxious about the Gaeltacht yesterday morning. But he disappeared after his protest about having to sit here at a late sitting and we have not seen him since. If Deputy Dillon had the interest of the Gaeltacht at heart, as he professed to have, he should not begrudge sacrificing one night's sleep, probably the first night's sleep he ever sacrificed, in the interest of the people of the Gaeltacht.  He had the opportunity yesterday morning, on another Vote, of casting aspersions on one of his Fianna Fáil colleagues.  I would like <Col N="2902" /> to tell him now&mdash;and he will probably see it in the Official Debates&mdash;that the Deputy on whom he is seeking to cast aspersions was working for the Donegal Gaeltacht when Deputy Dillon was unknown in Donegal.</P>
    <P>The Donegal Deputies know the Donegal Gaeltacht at least as well as if not better than any Deputy from Mayo.  We are quite capable of looking after the interests of the Donegal Gaeltacht.  The Deputy made one aspersion here a couple of months ago about lobster fishing in Donegal. Deputy Seamus Moore mentioned yesterday morning that he had drawn this red herring, as he described the lobsters, across the trail.  He accused me of giving information to the Parliamentary Secretary and that that information was not correct.  The Parliamentary Secretary for Lands and Fisheries has better advisers than I and I agreed with their advice in this case.  Knowing the fishermen of Donegal and knowing the time of the year when they go out lobster-fishing and when they engage in line and salmon fishing I was able to agree that the Minister's information was correct. At that particular time they were not engaged in lobster fishing.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for another reason that Deputy Dillon is not here.  We heard a great deal in the last few days about alternative markets; Deputy Lynch told us about alternative markets for shellfish.  He told us there were markets for shellfish in France.  It is too bad that Deputy Dillon is not here now, he would be interested in this fact.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider seriously the point of view I have put before him in regard to herring fisheries.  I hope his Department will lose no time in devising ways and means for securing three or four extra drifters for the herring fishery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that, on this huge Vote for a sum of almost three and a half million pounds, we are to have no explanation whatever from the Minister?  Do I take it that the Minister has nothing whatever to say on this Vote?  The Minister is unusually silent, and, perhaps, if he were as sparing in his words on other motions and Bills as he is on this motion, there would be no necessity for us to be sitting here at ten minutes past six this morning.  If there is one member of this House responsible for <Col N="2907" /> keeping us here until this hour of the morning, and, we are told, until the 11th of August, it is the Minister.  But on this Vote, calling for three and a half million pounds, and one of the most important votes we have to discuss in this House, the Minister has nothing to say.  One would be inclined to gather from that, if we were not conversant with the position regarding Old Age Pensions and the administration of Old Age Pensions, that everything was all right.  I should like to have heard from the Minister his views on the working of the Amending Act, which was passed, I think, last year. I should have liked also to have heard from him, as Minister for Finance, whether the Government's original estimate of the cost of that Act had been realised or whether it had been exceeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister would have to admit that the Government's estimate has been very much exceeded.  I would like to know whether the Minister has any report from the responsible officers regarding the working of the old age pensions scheme since the passage of that Act, and whether he is satisfied that Act has not been abused.  Is he satisfied that persons have not been enabled to secure pensions under the provisions of the Act whom, in the opinion of many Deputies, and of a great many people, it was never intended to benefit?  Is the Minister aware of the fact that the rush of claims was so great, following the promises made by members of the Fianna Fáil Party, and the cost mounted so quickly, that instructions were recently issued, and the machinery was so tightened up that people who in the ordinary course would be entitled to get the old age pension are being excluded because hundreds&mdash;I do not think I would be exaggerating if I said thousands&mdash;secured pensions who, in the opinion of anyone who gives the matter consideration, were never intended to benefit.  In my opinion one of the great flaws in this old age pension scheme is that we have two Departments more or less responsible, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance, and that <Col N="2908" /> very often their views come into conflict. I have reported cases of people who secured the full pension who are in possession of means that would put them outside the provisions of the Act. Many Deputies on all sides, even on the Fianna Fáil Benches, know that what I am saying is true.  From personal knowledge I know that comfortable farmers, men with money in the banks, have got pensions.</P>

      <P>I should like to listen to Deputy Smith at any time, even at 6.15 a.m. but not by way of interruption. I want to tell the Deputy this, that there are farmers getting some portion of the £3,500,000 at the expense of unfortunate poor people who are being excluded, and I am going to prove it.  In my opinion this old age pension scheme was never intended to benefit people in comfortable circumstances, and who had enough to maintain themselves, particularly at the present time, when we are supposed to be as badly off as we are told by members of the Government.  There are people, even farmers who, in spite of Fianna Fáil, are fairly comfortable, and I thank God for it.</P>

      <P>It is strictly the Vote.  I want to know from the Minister what additional cost has been imposed upon the country as a result of the passage of last year's Old Age Pensions Act.  Can he tell how many appeals are lying in the Department <Col N="2910" /> of Local Government?  I wonder does he know?  Are there 10,000 appeals lying with the appeals officers in the Department of Local Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I was going to refer to these because they are, perhaps, the worst cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to refer to them.  There are appeals by blind pensioners waiting from eight to 12 months.  It is unfair that the appeals of these unfortunate people should be kept waiting so long.  Many Deputies are aware of that.  The Minister may sneer at this matter.  Of course he is not interested.  I doubt if the President is very much interested.  I claim to know something about this question, because I sat for six months on an Old Age Pensions Commission, which was set up by this House as far back as 1926.  We made what I considered to be a fairly valuable report, having regard to the rather restricted terms of reference.  I am putting this point to the Minister, that he is in a position to state to the House the number of appeals waiting to be decided.  I am including old age pensions and blind pensions, and I am suggesting to the Minister that there are, at least, 10,000 at the moment. Many of these have been held up for, at least, 12 months, particularly in the case of blind pensions.  I say that that is a shame for any Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to put the position in as fair a way as I can to the Minister.  The Minister is there to reply to anything I say.  He has the facts before him and I am sure he does not want any assistance from Deputy Crowley or Deputy Smith, or Deputy Martin Ryan.  The Minister is quite competent to deal with the matter and I am quite entitled to put my case before the House.  If my information is correct, and if there are 10,000 cases held up in the Appeals Office, it is a scandal.  I do not think that any Deputy will deny that.  I can give the Minister the names and addresses of persons whose cases have been held up for from six to 12 months.  I can supply those at any time.  I have made representations about them but one thing I have never done during my time in this House, is to put a question to the Minister regarding either an old age pension or a blind pension.  I never did that and I never shall.  It is not a practice to be commended.  It is unfair to those old people and all I have to say is that the Deputies who started that practice in this House were very badly off for propaganda for the local papers.  The representations I make are made by way of letter to the Department concerned and not for the sake of getting publicity.  I can assure the Minister that I am really concerned on this point of the large number of appeals which are held up.  I quite appreciate, from the little experience I had as a member of the Old Age Pensions Committee, that the new Act threw a great deal of additional work on the staff.  I suggest to the Minister that if the staff is not adequate to deal with the number of claims coming in, the staff ought to be increased&mdash;in the interest of those genuinely entitled to old age and blind pensions.  If there are 10,000 cases held up, it will be admitted it is a shame.</P>

      <P>I did not say there were too many people in receipt of old age pensions.  I said that there were people in receipt of them who, in my opinion, ought not to be in receipt of them.  There are few Deputies who do not know that I am speaking the truth.  Many Deputies know as well as I do, and perhaps better, that there are many persons entitled to old age pensions who, by a mere technicality, are deprived of them.  Pensions officers are supposed to give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  That is the theory.  It very rarely works out in practice.  We know that, so far as a person applying for a blind pension is concerned, he requires to be almost stone-blind, under the provisions of the Act, before he can get it.  I am not blaming the Minister for that but the applicant must be almost stone-blind.</P>

      <Col N="2913" /> 1932 Old Age Pensions (Amending) Act.  Surely, Deputy Morrissey, when he refers to the latter type of applicant, must realise that, as a result of that Act, the conditions attaching to the receiving of a blind pension have been radically changed. Surely he must realise that the opinion of a pensions officer with regard to a blind pension is not of as much assistance to the Department in giving a decision on that type of claim as it is in the case of the ordinary old age pension.  Surely, the Deputy must realise that in 90 out of 100 of these cases, it is necessary to have a report from the medical inspectors attached to the Local Government Department.</P>

      <P>The very same applies to the ordinary old age pension applicant.  Deputy Morrissey, I am sure, can take his mind back to a former Old Age Pension Act passed in this House, and I am sure he can recall a misunderstanding that arose as a result of the interpretation of the Act of 1924.  With all his experience of Old Age Pension Acts. and their administration, he surely knows that when new legislation of this kind is passed, the ordinary official in the country asked to administer it is going to protect himself and proceed with caution, with the result that pension officers, until they get to know definitely the interpretation of an Act from their superiors, say to themselves &ldquo;We will keep ourselves safe, and we will appeal every case.&rdquo;  That is a reasonable attitude, I suppose, although it is not one that might commend itself to us. We can, however, understand the point of view of a pension officer who endeavours to get out of his difficulties in that way.</P>
      <P>It was delightful to hear Deputy Morrissey talking about farmers who have money in the banks.  I was very glad to hear that there was even one farmer in the country, after all we have heard to the contrary, who has money in the bank.  I was delighted to hear from this one-time Labour Deputy an expression of sympathy towards that class of the community about whom we hear so much from the benches opposite.  It would seem from the remarks of some Cumann na Gaedheal Deputies, and particularly from the speech made by Deputy Morrissey, that there is not so much respect for the farmer after all.  It seems that every official who serves this State or a local authority, has to have provision made for him out of national revenue and out of local rates, and there is to be no question as to whether he has money in the bank when he comes to the pensionable age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey, the one-time Labour Leader, tells us that if one of the farmers, about whose condition we were told so eloquently during the last twenty-four hours, happens to <Col N="2915" /> have a few pounds in the bank, we should send the revenue officials after him to see that he does not get a few bob a week when he reaches seventy. That is the mentality of the one-time Labour Leader who has thrown in his lot with Cumann na nGaedheal.  He now complains when the Fianna Fáil Party have improved the lot of the old-age pensioner and the blind pensioner, and who have made it possible for small farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think that, during this debate, and for the remainder of the sitting, we should hear no more from Deputy Morrissey, because it seems to me that he has come down so often and has made so many twists and turns, that he will not know where to find himself after six o'clock this evening.</P>

Deputy Morrissey was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth; he had to work hard to attain his present position.  We here are proud to see an Irish nationalist get to the stage Deputy Morrissey has reached through his own efforts.

I wish to support the complaint made by Deputy Morrissey.  I have had experience of honest applicants waiting to be dealt with for a considerable period. One would be led to believe that their <Col N="2916" /> cases were being held up deliberately while, as Deputy Morrissey said, there were others receiving pensions who held property and who, one would imagine, would not be entitled to a pension.  Very often the genuine people are refused pensions while there are people receiving pensions who are not entitled to them.  It is time there was a complete and thorough investigation into the whole pension question.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I am glad to have this opportunity of congratulating the Government on the splendid effort they have made in regard to old age pensions and blind pensions.  I cannot understand any criticism coming from Deputies on the opposite benches, because, if they were still in power, there would be no surplus of applicants at the Department.  During the Cumann na nGaedheal administration what the British Government granted the pensioners was reduced by a shilling.  That is all that can be said for Cumann na nGaedheal.  This Government has carried out splendid social work.  As regards the remarks about farmers and people with property, I want to say that I never regarded the old age pension as an act of charity.  It is an honour conferred by the State on people who live to that grand old age and who have given that length of service to their country. I hold that anybody who reaches that age should be entitled to the pension without being asked to have any other qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I agree that the time has come to make a thorough investigation into the subject of old age pensions.  I think the Government should consider whether it is really worth while to exempt anybody who has reached the statutory age. Deputy Morrissey, surprisingly for a man of his history, has complained of people getting pensions who had means which placed them outside the scope of the Pensions Act.  Is it such a very regrettable matter?  Is it a matter that is greatly to be deplored <Col N="2917" /> that any man or woman of 70 years of age should get an old age pension?  It may be said that such cases of people who have means which should exclude them from receiving the old age pension are so numerous that the accumulated cost would be an injury to the community.  That is really my point.  I should like the Minister to state whether there are so many as that.  Deputy Morrissey's speech on the subject did not convince me.  He seemed to think that for any person of even mediocre means to get the old age pension was something like a crime against society.</P>

      <P>I am merely commenting on the curious anomaly of Deputy Morrissey finding fault with the man of mediocre means, who by some technical examination may be found to be outside the Act, drawing an old age pension. That was a great grievance with Deputy Morrissey.  In connection with that I referred to the fact that people with the outlook of Deputy Morrissey at the time when the first Old Age Pensions Act was passed favoured the idea of universal old age pensions, regardless of means.  I was going to suggest to the Minister for Finance that he should give some statement&mdash; he may not be in a position to do so now, but might do so at some early date&mdash;as to what the cost would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I do not want to waste any time at all.  I want to join in appealing to the Minister for Finance to try to expedite the position with regard to applications for pensions to blind persons.  It is really deplorable in some cases that the delay is so long.  I really think that the Department is somewhat at fault, because they have adopted a certain routine with regard to the examination of applications, and have refused to depart from it in any circumstances.  I have known of suggestions made to them as to how decisions could be expedited.  They seemed to me to be reasonable suggestions.  It seemed to me that they were suggestions which might very well be adopted in the Department, but the Department turned them down, and the people are still waiting for decisions on their cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the ordinary applications for old age pensions, so far from agreeing with Deputy Morrissey that people who are not really entitled to old age pensions are getting them, I venture to suggest that the practice of objecting to every application should not be encouraged.  It seems to be a practice on the part of some old age pensions officers to object to every decision of a sub-committee.  Cases have come before me where there could be no doubt whatever as to the merits of the claim that was put before the sub-committee; as to the rights of the applicants to old age pensions, with regard to age, means, and every other test; yet they were kept waiting for many months for a decision.  Not merely were they kept waiting for <Col N="2920" /> many months with regard to a decision, but I have a case before me at the moment where they were waiting for many months for the payment of the pension even after the Minister had decided that the application was to be granted.  There is obviously very considerable suffering in many of those cases.  Though it is undoubtedly a great benefit to the person affected that he or she is able to get an old age pension from a certain period, and able to get a considerable sum in back money, still there are cases where the real charity would be in the immediate payment of the small sum which the State allows to a person over a certain age who has no means.  I do suggest to the Minister that every care-should be taken to avoid any unnecessary delay.  I know that since the recent Act was passed there has been a great deal of extra work placed on the Department, and I could not speak too highly of the attitude of officials of the Department with regard to every case put before them, but undoubtedly there are cases of very great hardship arising from delay, particularly with regard to application for blind pensions.  I am confident that the Minister will use all his influence to see that all those delays are rectified as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Morrissey has left, because I was rather interested in one or two statements he made that he himself had personally reported cases of persons who have means that would put them away beyond the Act.  I should like, if he had been here, to question him a little closely on that as to whom he reported those cases.  I do not know whether he reported them to my Department or to the Department for Local Government and Public Health, which is responsible for the appeal administration of the Act, but he certainly has not reported them to me, and my Department would be more immediately concerned with checking any abuse of the Act.  The Deputy also spoke of farmers with money in the bank who were in receipt of pensions, <Col N="2921" /> and Deputy Smith took him up on that in view of the wild statements as to the poverty of the farmers issued from the opposite benches during the last 12 months.  He said that farmers with money in the bank were in receipt of pensions, and then he said that he was going to prove it, but he conveniently sat down without producing the proofs.  The Deputy also said that he regarded the report of the Committee on Old Age Pensions, in which he took part in 1926, as being a fairly valuable production.  We will take the report at the Deputy's own valuation of it, and I should be glad to know how it is that he did not press, night and day, for the amendment of the Act on the lines of that report, and how it is that, when the time came for him to reconsider his political affiliations he should have thrown in his lot with the Party that consistently opposed any alteration in the Old Age Pensions Act that would be for the benefit of the poor and the aged in this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan said nothing on the debate, but he threw in a significant interruption.  He said that there were applicants for blind pensions whose applications have not yet been dealt with and who are now dead.  Precisely. If these applicants were alive to-day they would not have their pensions, and, as a matter of fact, there would probably be danger of losing the pensions if they had them, because that is the direction in which the legislation of the Party opposite moves&mdash;towards the reduction of pensions.</P>

      <P>I am quite certain there may have been abuses.  Cases will slip through in spite of precautions, and I am certain that, arising out of the more wide and more generous provisions of this Act, many borderline cases will come forward for determination, and that the determination of those borderline cases will be very much more difficult than they were under the preceding code.  Every alteration in the old age pensions law in this country has found the Appeal Department choked up with cases, and there has been a glut of such cases within the last six or 12 months.  All these cases of first appeals have been sifted and principles laid down which will enable the local pensions officers to determine for themselves whether or not an appeal properly lies from the decision of the Old Age Pensions Committee.  It is not a question of staff at all, because you could not possibly increase overnight a staff in the Pensions Appeal Section of the Local Government Department.  If Deputy Morrissey was the authority on old age pensions matters that he claims to be, that is one thing it would have taught him&mdash;that you cannot get the experienced officers to deal with the cases of appeal that may come before them overnight.  It requires a considerable amount of experience and a considerable amount of training, before they can exercise the judicial functions between the Minister on the one hand and the old age pensions applicants on the other.  Therefore, as I said, it is not a case of staff, it is simply a case that the experienced people, and the people with training, must have time to consider all the aspects of the cases that come before them, and to lay down general principles which will make the subsequent administration of the Act easier and more expeditious.</P>
      <P>With the change in the law, it is inevitable that there must be a considerable increase in the number of applicants and a consequent delay in dealing with them.  What has been the position?  In 1927 the number of pensions payable on the 31st March of that year was 114,185.  On the 31st December, 1928, the number had increased to</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2923" /> 116,282.  On 31st December, 1930, it decreased to 115,436, and on the 31st December, 1931, under the administration of the Party opposite, which Deputy Morrissey now supports, the number had declined to 114,756.  By the end of that year, and it will be remembered that we just came in at the tail-end of the year&mdash;the number had declined to 113,619.  Thanks to the operation of this Act, the number had increased on 31st December, 1932, to 120,246, and it is anticipated, because of the more generous provisions of the old age pensions law now, that the number of persons in receipt of old age pensions will have considerably increased on the 31st December, 1933.  Is it any wonder that we have had delay when the number of beneficiaries has been increased in that manner, and particularly when the number of persons eligible for blind pensions has substantially increased?  The determination of an application for a blind pension must be, in any circumstances a difficult matter, unless the House is prepared to say that a man should get a pension merely because he says he is blind, when, in fact, he may not be blind at all.  He may be merely weak-sighted, but not blind.  If one were to grant that, I suppose we would have, certainly, one-fifth of the whole population of the country between the ages of 30 and 70 eligible for blind pensions in addition to those who are over 70 years of age.</P>
    <P>These are Acts that you cannot administer laxly.  Either a person is entitled to a pension or he is not.  Either he must fulfil all the conditions laid down for the securing of a pension or he should not get the pension at all. The cost of the service is so enormous that you have got to safeguard the Exchequer against abuse.  In the year 1931-32 the expenditure on the cost of the Old Age Pensions Act was £2,702,000.  In the few months of last year that the new Act was in operation the cost had risen to £3,027,000.  For the present year it is likely to exceed £3,250,000.  So that the recent alteration of the law has cost the State almost £500,000 and has given to the <Col N="2924" /> elderly poor in the community a corresponding advantage, an advantage in which the farmers particularly have shared.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore raised an interesting point and asked what would it cost if we were to give the old age pension to all people over 70 without any qualification as to means.  It would cost almost £4,500,000, certainly over £4,430,000.  I am afraid that until we settle the economic war and give men back their markets that is a burden we cannot shoulder.  With regard to the question of the determination of blind pension cases, I shall have the matter looked into in my Department to see if something cannot be done to expedite it.  I am afraid it is going to be a difficult matter from the point of view of getting the medical skill necessary to determine those cases with any sort of accuracy and reliability.</P>

      <P>A question of real importance is the position of factory butter, under these particular bounties.  A large portion of the county I represent is not in a position to avail itself of creameries.  A lot of the butter is ordinary home-made farmers' butter.  Under the scale of bounties in force, I have heard, in fact, that the various butter buyers have told the farmers or the sellers in the local districts that they are not in a position to give more than 6½d. for first-grade butter, 6¼d. for second-grade, and 6d. for third-grade.  Those are the prices actually given in the month of May of this year, and it is quite obvious that, though something may have been done in keeping up the price of creamery butter, nothing effective has been done so far as a very large portion of the county I represent is concerned, and therefore so far as a very large portion of the country is concerned, that is where there are no creameries. There are two industries hit in that way, that of the ordinary farmer who makes farm butter, and has not the advantage of creameries, and that of manufacturers who make factory butter.  I understand that recommendations have been made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to those markets, so far as I am aware, <Col N="2927" /> no satisfactory solution has been offered by the Minister.  I should like him to turn his attention to it.  I am sure he is filled with all the benefits of the case.  There is a large portion of my own constituency gravely affected by this whole particular policy of the Government.  As the Minister is here, might I suggest if, according as I have been informed, these bounties are to be extended to enable us to keep our place, or portion of our place, on the British market, that, if he will not reveal to this House the markets he spoke of a fortnight or three weeks ago, he ought to reveal them to the President of the Executive Council.  Let him tell the President where the markets are.  I hope that if he is guilty of revealing secret information of that kind to the President of the Executive Council, the Attorney-General will not prosecute him for giving away some information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will remember distinctly that he said there were markets, that he had the markets, and we had the statement from the President the other day, which conveyed as clearly to us, or as far as it is possible for any of his statements to convey anything clearly, that the markets outside Great Britain are in a most unsatisfactory condition and that serious steps would have to be taken against those countries.  The Minister ought to clear the matter up or at least not conceal the matter from the head of his own Government.  He said the markets are there, the President said they are not there.  It is possible that he might have a reason to conceal those markets from the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or the Centre Party but surely he would be justified in giving the President the information. I suggest that the Minister take this opportunity of telling the House or the President about those markets.  It is an extraordinary way to run a Government; the Minister responsible for the principal industry of the country making such a statement about markets, and the absolute head of the Executive Council responsible for the policy that has ruined our principal industry says he knows <Col N="2928" /> nothing about those markets.  The Minister should acquaint the head of his Government with what he has been doing.  How the Minister could negotiate those markets without acquainting the head of the Government or the Minister for External Affiairs passes the understanding of the ordinary Deputy in the House. Or, perhaps, the Executive Council is following two different policies in this matter, the Minister finding the foreign markets and the President finding that they do not exist?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a just a few words about those bounties. I would like to say, first of all, that I would like if the Minister had segregated the different amounts as to how they were apportioned.  I assume that the bulk of the bounty will be in respect of cattle.  The Minister might have given us particulars about the distribution of the cattle bounties; what sums of money were being given to foreign buyers of cattle as well as to home buyers of cattle.  What amount, for instance, was being given to English buyers in the Irish markets beside the ordinary exporters of stock, or what amount was being given to Germans and other exporters of cattle, and altogether more information in the line of the distribution of this money.  It was said to-day that because of those bounties we were flooding the British market with cattle.  I think that was the inference from the line of argument of the Minister for Finance.  I wonder if the Minister for Agriculture will agree with that statement.  Would he even agree with the statement that bounty or no bounty we were flooding the British market with cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister further stated that if it were not for our bounty, and because of some of the actions of the Ministry, we would not at all be able to hold our place in the British market and that we would cease to accept the price which the British would give us. There is no evidence whatever of it. Whether there was a bounty or not we would continue to export to England <Col N="2929" /> because we have as yet no other place to export them except the one hundred or two hundred cattle the Germans buy every week or so in Dublin, and for which we are paying £1 15s. per head, for what one might describe as practically the most inferior portion of our fat stock exports.  The chief difficulty we have with this bounty is that we don't believe the full amount of bounty is reaching the farmers.  That may appear false on the face of it.  We have no method of proving it, except when a private individual selling cattle in Britain makes more than through the shippers. The farmer does not believe he is getting full value.  While the bounty is desirable some such steps should be taken to ensure that the farmer gets the benefit of the bounty while the present unfortunate economic war lasts.  Some more advisable method of distribution should be found.  It should not be beyond the intelligence of the Minister and his advisers to devise some way by which this bounty would go direct to the farmers, that it would not be passed on to the exporters who buy from the farmers and from whom the farmer finds it difficult to obtain any proof whether he has paid the bounty or not.  There will, under this scheme, always remain a suspicion in the farmer's mind that he is not getting the full value of the bounty that the Minister is supplying to him.  He is, to my mind, justified in that suspicion.  It would be, I admit, a boon to the farmer if he did get the £1 15s. for two year old cattle or 15/- for young cattle.  I do believe that some method could be devised, with all the officials and with the assistance of the Gárda, to see that would not be abused, that some method would be arrived at to ensure that it would go direct to the farmer, while it would only prove a small offset against the bill he has to pay to meet the tariff on the other side.  The £1 15s. goes a very short way to meet £6, and vice versa, the other bounties go a very small way to meet the tariffs on that particular animal or stock.  However, it is something.</P>
    <P>I don't believe that on this Vote I ought to go into the merits of the tariff <Col N="2930" /> as an offset to the bounty, but the Minister for Finance rather invited us to discuss that matter when speaking to-day or this morning.  The Minister suggested to us that we were possibly getting with bounties, and in spite of the tariff, as good a price as we could have got even if the economic war was not there.  The Minister even attempted to prove to his own satisfaction and probably he did prove it to his own satisfaction.  It reminded me of the story of two students, one of whom attempted to prove to the other that the moon was made of green cheese.  And he proved it.  &ldquo;It either is or is not, but it is not, therefore it is.&rdquo; And in the same way the Minister for Finance attempted to prove that because of the bounties and despite the tariff, that we were getting as good a price as if the economic war was not on.  It is bosh&mdash;pure, simple, unadulterated bosh&mdash;trying to be inflicted on the intelligence of any Deputy.  The Minister quoted an extract from some paper that the price of cattle was 17/- in Leicester.  I don't know how the paper made that mistake but the Minister should have intelligence to know that there was no foundation for that figure except, perhaps, that the beast referred to was in some way a dilapidated beast.  Even a fat cow or an old bull&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It should be very clear even to the intelligence of Deputy Kelly.  In Dublin market last week there was 25/- per cwt. paid for best beef and take a 10 cwt. beast at 25/- per cwt., that is £12 10s., even to Deputy Kelly's intelligence, and the man who paid the £12 10s. and shipped the beast had to pay a £6 tariff.  That makes £18 10s. and it cost him £2 10s. to deliver the beast in an English market, and that was £21 and he got 35/- from the Minister for Agriculture. He had then something short of £20, so that if he was to get full profit&mdash;if he was not a philanthropist striving to prove that the Minister's impossible figures were correct&mdash;he would have to get £20 to leave him his share of profit. £20 for a 10 cwt. beast is £2 per cwt.&mdash; unless they are spending the money to <Col N="2931" /> the advantage of the farmers and to bolster up the Minister's case, they are getting £2 per cwt.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Reilly or Deputy Kelly does not suggest that all the exporters of this country are like the Minister for Agriculture was,. some time at the end of last year, a philanthropist, giving more than the cattle were worth to help out the Irish farmer. The exporter of Irish cattle could not dip his hand into the same purse as the Minister did when he attempted to ship cattle to Belgium and paid more than they were worth.  If he had to buy them, ship them and pay the tariff in the ordinary way, he would have gone out of business and every intelligent man knows that.  Still we have Ministers for Finance, Ministers for Defence and Ministers for everything else coming here and telling us that, war or no war, tariff or no tariff, we would not get a better price for our cattle under any circumstances than we are getting and that the British would not have taken our cattle.  There is no proof as yet that there is any cessation of our trade with Britain.  The shipping statistics show that during the early months of this year we shipped as many cattle as last year to the market that they are denouncing.  The market was there for more if we cared to ship them and take the price offered.  We shall continue to ship them even if the Minister dropped the bounty.  I hope he will not.  I hope that instead of dropping it he will increase it and make it in some way payable direct to the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in the event of the bounty being dropped and even if prices became worse than they are, the unfortunate farmer would still ship his cattle to Britain.  He would continue to ship them until the price became so <Col N="2933" /> low that it would not pay the shipping costs.  There is nothing else for him to do with them.  He has to ship them as long as he gets a price that will pay even the shipping costs.  The indications are that the production of cattle will be continued in this State.  As far as I can see they will be produced <i>ad infinitum.</i>  The Ministry know that even under their policy of dividing the land the production of cattle is going to be our staple trade.  They can take to wheat growing, beet growing and every other system of tillage.  Yet what do you find down the country?  The same old system as when Hogan and Roddy were in charge and when they were dividing the land.  The inspector comes down and interviews some landless men who are going to get land.  He does not ask them can they plough or can they dig or are they going to till. He says to them in a whisper: &ldquo;If I give you this land can you stock it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is still the policy in the division of land in this State as far as I know, and I believe that most Deputies listening to me will bear me out, that the first question put to any applicant for land is can he stock the land.  I see my colleague from County Limerick, Deputy Ryan, smiles, but he knows I am telling the truth.  Deputy Ryan knows as well as I do that this is the first question put to any applicant for land, even in Limerick.  That is the question that is put to incoming tenants.  They do not ask them can they plough or grow wheat, but can they stock the land, and these are the gentlemen who tell us that cattle-raising is a wrong policy in this country.  They are carrying out Hogan's policy and Roddy's policy.  I may be moving away from the amendment, a Chinn Comhairle, but I was much nearer to the amendment than many other Deputies.  This Vote is a drop in the ocean for the unfortunate exporter and the producer of stock in this country&mdash;35/- to meet £6 or £7, and even that amount is something that does not reach the producer.  I think even the Minister is quite satisfied that it does not reach him. It is up to the Minister to make some change in the disposal of the money, so that it will be quite sure to reach <Col N="2934" /> the farmer.  I think some new machinery might be devised in that respect.  I conclude as I began, by saying that I do not believe that any man of intelligence would say that this 35/- or the 15/- or all the bobs down to the two bob are being paid to the people they were intended for &mdash;the producer.</P>

In all the arguments put forward here there has not been a single question raised as to the necessity for providing for human beings on the land.  Let us get to the origin of things.

      <P>It originated because your Party got ten years in office. You undoubtedly took over this country at a time when it was <Col N="2935" /> weakened and broken, with a small population and with nothing in it.  I admit that.  But you got a golden opportunity to do one thing.  Deputies opposite had spoken to me and all had the one old gospel.  What was that?  That the whole fight was for an increase of population just as you would increase steam power in an engine when all the other things would automatically follow.  Certainly I agree that the classes can be happy in this little country.  You can reduce our population to two millions or to one and a half millions or to one million and the classes can be happy at the expense of the masses.  But remember that was not what was fought for or struggled for in this country.  That is what you have to bear in mind to-day. The Government has asked us to pass this Estimate and Opposition Deputies are going to oppose it.  Let us come to the real difficulty now and use our common sense.  In a few years we will possibly be all gone.  There will be new Deputies and a new Ceann Comhairle here.  A new population will have grown up and will have the running of the country.  When the mournful procession with the funeral tune of the industries of this country winds its way along the gentlemen who vote against these measures will be held in remembrance for what they have done.  With that before your eyes there is only one thing to do now and that is to do justice to your own country for you will not be doing it long.</P>

      <P>This is not the way to get down and cope with this business. I was pleased to hear Deputy Hales though I disagree with him.  I know he was a man who fought when there was fighting to be done, and to what a man like him says I am ready to listen.  We all respect a man like Deputy Hales, no matter how we may disagree with him.  I expect, a Chinn Comhairle, you are suffering from the complaint from which we are all suffering and, before any accident happens, I will have to say something about the matter before the House though, perhaps if I did not give this hint I would be able to get away with a lot of things that I cannot get away with now.  I am not so enthusiastic about these bounties as my colleague Deputy Bennett is.  I am sorry I cannot go in step with Deputy Hales and vote for these bounties.  I would submit to the Deputy that his criticism is rather too severe when he brands us as being in step with any kind of ascendancy when we do not see eye to eye with him and his Party in this matter.  The figure which the Minister for Finance gave us to-day about this bounty was, I believe, £2,450,000.  By some extraordinary process of calculation he informs us that this is all we have to pay out to rectify the balance against us.  We have to find this sum of £2,500,000 for bounties.  We are keeping, he says, £5,000,000 from the British Government, so that we are making a clear profit of £2,500,000 on the transaction! The Deputies opposite are challenging <Col N="2938" /> about the prices.  Now if the prices for cattle are as good here as in England why do we send cattle to England?  I have asked that question repeatedly here, and not a single Deputy or Minister has addressed himself to it when winding up whatever debate was in hand.  None of them attempted to make a case for the Government.  Again I invite any Minister or Deputy opposite to give a reason why any goods are supplied by this country to Great Britain if there is as good a market in this country as there is in Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot create a market if there is not a demand for the produce.  There can be no movement of goods unless there is a surplus of goods in one place and a scarcity in another, or unless the price of goods in one place is greater than in another-Goods will flow from the cheap to the dearer region.  They have been flowing from Ireland to Great Britain because there are higher prices in Great Britain than in Ireland.  There is, in fact, no need to go into the question of prices.  The fact that goods naturally flow from Ireland to find a market in Great Britain is proof, on the face of it, and you want no other proof that the price is higher in Great Britain than in Ireland.  If the market is not saturated here, if there is a market to use up our production here, why does that happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad to hear Deputy Hales again on this matter, when he finds himself in sufficient form to deal with it.  I think it is only fair in this quiet discussion we have here this morning by ourselves, practically nobody looking on and talking, as we are, in a kind of family circle, that we should listen to one another.  I put that point to Deputy Hales or to any Deputy opposite, because I am interested to know how Deputies or Ministers can honestly arrive at the <Col N="2939" /> conclusion that there is anything at all like equal prices here and in England. Then there is the question of the bounty.  If the prices were equal here and in England, why a bounty?  Why hand out £2,500,000 to the cattle dealers or the farmers?  I am not supporting a bounty.  From the little consideration I have given it, if I had anything to say in a matter like that, I would say that I would prefer that this money should be given to agriculture itself, at its source, rather than at its end; because when you go to the source you relieve the overhead charges of production and the benefit comes down the whole line of production and will make itself felt.  But if you got to the dealer, at the other end, I am not satisfied at all.  I spoke to people in the street about the matter, and they are not satisfied that the benefit comes down all along the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the Minister upon this subject one day, and I knew from the line Ministers were taking what they would achieve by this policy.  For instance, we are told the bounty is going to the shipper.  They argued from that that by giving the bounties to the shippers that would induce them to go down the country and buy cattle.  One dealer or shipper would compete with another and would give a certain price. He would give £10 before the bounty. Now he would go down and buy some class of beast and give another 35/- because of the bounty; and if he did not do that his competitor would do it, and so, by the ordinary law of supply and demand he would be forced to part with 35/- more for his beast, and that was supposed to go down all along the line.  That is all right in theory; it is all right on paper.  But anybody who ever studied the elements of economy knows that in the operation of economic laws there is also the time line. It is extraordinary that the intelligentsia of the Fianna Fáil Party, when bearing these glad tidings to the farmers, always said &ldquo;S-sh!  there will be a settlement.  I saw So-and-So at a meeting of the National Executive, and I have it straight from the stable.&rdquo; These were the glad tidings that were given round the country.  There were <Col N="2940" /> hopes of an immediate settlement.  If this bounty was given 12 months ago, when the economic war started on 1st July last it would hardly yet have worked its way down through the whole gamut of the cattle trade.</P>
    <P>If I were a supporter of the economic war I should have been a supporter, not of this bounty, but of giving something in the way of help to agriculture. I would plump for giving help at the source of production, and lightening the overhead charges on the land.  I would benefit production from the source instead of this kind of trick-of-the-loop with the cattle trade.  These cattle traders can look after themselves; it is their trade to do so.  No one can blame them if they get the best value they can.  It is up to the other fellow to see that they do not pull the wool over his eyes.  I would favour giving assistance at the other end.  I would help the overhead charges and not the dealers.  In going with your help to the source of production you would be going to the producer, and it is the producers that make a nation.</P>
    <P>I shall quote some figures, but before I do so I would like to say that I set far more value on the movement of goods and upon economic laws than I do upon statistics.  There is a cattle fair in the chief town of every county at least once a month.  There is a market in Dublin for cattle every week, and there is an opportunity to sell cattle here at the ruling price, and if there was not the difference in the price ruling here and in England, and if there were not a higher price in England than there is here, one beast would not go to England, so that if you brought a man here from the North Pole and told him that cattle are exported to England and sold in the English market, he will know, if he knows anything about economies, that the price must be higher in the English market, and as much higher as will pay for the cost of transit and give a fair margin of profit, with risk and insurance, for shipping the cattle over.</P>
    <P>There has been so much objection to going back beyond the current financial year that I hesitate to do so, but I <Col N="2941" /> would ask the indulgence of the Ceann Comhairle to let me quote half a dozen prices for 1931.  I do not do it for any political reason, but to show the small disparity between the prices obtaining in Dublin and England for live stock in 1931 as compared with the disparity now and the increased disparity started about the time of the economic war.  On the 4th June, 1931, the average price per cwt. live weight in Dublin was 45/-, and on 5th June, 1931, in London, the average price was 48/8.  On 11th June, a week after, in Dublin, the price was 46/3, and in London, 48/8.  On 8th June it was 44/6 in Dublin and 50/- in London.  Those figures are in respect of June, 1931. With respect to January, 1932, it was 38/3 in Dublin and 42/8 in London, on January 1st.  On 14th January it was 38/6 in Dublin and 42/8 in London; on 2nd June, 1932, it was 42/6 in Dublin and 50/8 in London.  On 5th May, previously, it was 42/- in Dublin and 46/- in London.  The prices normally in London were from 3/- to 5/- per cwt. more, but, when we come on to July, we find that, on 7th July, it is 38/6 in Dublin, and, on 8th July, 46/8 in London, a difference of 8/-. On 6th October, 1932, it was 27/6 in Dublin and 38/- in London, while on 5th January, 1933, it was 29/9 in Dublin and 38/8 in London.</P>
    <P>Coming to the last dates I have, we find that on 4th May, 1933, the average price is 25/9 in Dublin and 40/- in London.  There has been a difference of 3/- or 4/- per cwt., normally, which accounted for the attraction that has always brought Irish live stock and beef to England, and that has given rise to the export trade.  You can see the disparity that has started in July of last year.</P>

On the 4th May, 1933, in Dublin, it was 25/9, and on 5th May, 1933, in London, it was 40/-, practically 15/- per cwt. of a difference. There is the cost of the economic war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the cost of the economic war which the Minister for Finance told us to-day did not matter. I do not want to go outside the question of the bounties, but from other legislation before this House, we know that the position of affairs has become perilous.  We are asked now to bolster up a permanent trade arrangement like that, which is purely artificial, by finding £2,450,000&mdash;say £2,500,000&mdash;for bounties to be given to the trick of the loops who buy the producers' stock throughout the country and export it to England.  I do not want to go over the ground again, but if the people opposite want to do the right thing, even if they have made the fatal, or mortal mistake of starting the economic war, to repair the damage as much as they can, or from that starting-point, to do what is the best thing, they should give this money to the producers and let the trick of the loop fellows come along and buy as cheaply as they can after, but make sure that the producers have got the money, and then nobody can deny&mdash; you cannot even deny it yourselves if you want to&mdash;that you did not get the money.  I do not mean to say that the money goes into your pocket, but let <Col N="2943" /> the overhead charges that you will be called on to pay be met to the extent of this £2,500,000 or to the extent which the Minister for Finance, and the Executive Council, can afford to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To boil down the situation, the position I take up is that I am against the economic war, and I would not vote supplies for it but, as it is here, and as you have a certain amount of money to give to help agriculture, then, by all means, give it to the producers at the producing end.  Deputies will remember, if they followed it, that when he introduced his Budget as Chancellor of the Exchequer in England, in 1928, Mr. Winston Churchill advocated complete derating for agriculture and three-quarters derating for industrial premises.  He said that the place to relieve any industry was at its source, and that is why he stood for derating of industry and agriculture. If you want to help agriculture, therefore, help it at its source and not at the top, which only puts the money into the pockets of the fellow at the top who will never let it go down the line.  After all, the exporters of cattle are comparatively few compared to the producers.  Knowing on what side their bread is buttered, and being more manageable, they could more quickly meet and combine and say: &ldquo;The prices we will give for certain stores are so-and-so.&rdquo;  I do not suggest that they would form a ring.  The Minister for Finance excelled himself to-day when he started to lecture us on agriculture. My remarks will invite certain criticism from Deputies opposite. I will be glad of that criticism.  We were asked, in all seriousness, by the Minister for Finance, if we thought more cattle would be shipped to England if there were no tariffs.  Of course, there would be more shipped. Why not?  I am surprised at such a question being asked.  The Minister tried to argue that the small quantity of meat and foodstuffs we export&mdash;out of foodstuffs value for £360,000,000 or £400,000,000 that Great Britain imports every year&mdash;would have any appreciable effect on the general level <Col N="2944" /> of food prices there.  It was absurd for the Minister for Finance to wax eloquent and to form the deduction, from the position that now obtains, when we are sending over less than the normal quantity, that it would have an effect on the general level of prices.  Our contribution to the British food market is comparatively small, not more than 5 or 6 per cent.  How a percentage of that size could appreciably lower the general level of wholesale prices in Great Britain is something that I did not expect to come from the Minister for Finance in his wildest and most hysterical moment.  He tried &ldquo;to put it over&rdquo; to-day, but it will not wash. Whether the economic war is or is not to continue is a question on which I would have a good deal to say.  It does not arise now.  I might summarise the position by saying that I am against tariffs and against sucking-bottle treatment for farmers.  Give them a free market.  If you deprive them of a free market, and if you want to give subsidies, by all means give them, but see that the producer gets them.  If you give it to the fellow at the top you cannot prove that the producers get it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general question of bounties I think the Minister, in view of a recent statement about tariffs, bounties or subsidies for agriculture should give us some explanation of where this huge sum of money is going to come from this year, mainly for the assistance of the agricultural industry, and where it is going to continue to come from in future.  We had a free export market for two-thirds of our agricultural produce.  That is being wiped away.  Deputy Belton has quoted certain prices.  If we look at the price Irish farmers have been getting for some of their principal products in the English markets&mdash;the market that up to the present took two-thirds of our produce&mdash;we get some idea of the enormous sums of money that are being lost to the agricultural industry and that it is expected cannot be got out of that industry in future.  In spite of the additional staff the Minister for Industry and Commerce has <Col N="2945" /> got we will not have the figures of our imports and exports for about a fortnight.  From the British figures we find that the average price for each head of cattle sent to Great Britain within the first six months of this year was: £9 10s. against £15 4s. last year; sheep, £1 3s. against £1 18s.; pigs, £2 each against £3 18s.; butter, £2 13s. 6d. against £4 18s. 6d; eggs, 5/- per great hundred against 8/5; potatoes, £2 13s. against £7 3s.; bacon, £2 16s. against £3 12s.; pork, £2 12s. against £3; live poultry, 2/4 against 3/1.  These figures give some idea of the loss agriculture has sustained.  This country's manufacturing industry bears no relation to its agricultural industry, but it is being asked to bear subsidies for the export of agricultural produce, reaching the enormous sum provided in the Estimate and the Minister tells us it is going to continue.  Surely we should get some reasoned explanation from the Minister as to where the money is to come from to support agriculture in future, if it is being reduced to the condition farmers have been reduced to, and if any industrial development is going on, or something that the Minister for Industry and Commerce need not be silent about.</P>

      <P>In answer to the question put by Deputy O'Sullivan, that matter has been considered but I regret that, so far, I have found no means of dealing with it.  Deputy Bennett and some other speakers raised the question whether these bounties go to the farmer-producer or not.  I have always held they should.  Deputy Belton argued, as I argued before him, that the ordinary law of competition ought to compel those people to give the price.  If that does not operate, I do not see why they could not two or three <Col N="2946" /> years ago have, in collusion, put £2 per head into their pockets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was nothing to prevent their doing it or, if the bounties and tariffs are taken off, there will be nothing to prevent their putting £2 per head in their pockets in the time to come.  Apart from that, we did try to verify the thing by having a number of examples in the Department of Agriculture and getting fair proof of the price paid for the cattle and the price realised outside.  Taking into account expenses, bounties, tariffs and everything else, we found that the profit which the exporter had was not any more than he usually had, 3/- or 4/- per head.  The exporters themselves gave us the impression that times are not as good with them now as they were before the economic war started. I think that, no matter how you take this, it is quite clear that the bounty does go to the producer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Several things were suggested to me, and it is only by taking an example I could deal with the matter.  Derating was suggested to me.  A farmer with one hundred acres and paying rates of £30 might not be a large producer at all.  He might have his land let in con-acre.  A smaller farmer beside him might have quite a lot of pigs, sheep and other stock, and it would be unfair to give advantage to both equally.  We tried to give advantage to the producer in this way because, so far as the economic war was concerned, the person who was hit was the producer and not the ratepayer.  Deputy Bennett mentioned, in support of his argument, the case of a farmer who finds it better to export his stock than sell through an ordinary <Col N="2947" /> exporter.  I must say that, having met some farmers myself, my experience is all the other way.  Some were rather large farmers who, thinking they were not getting as much as they should get by sending their cattle through ordinary exporters, tried to export them themselves and did not do so well.  I do not think that there is really anything in that.  I do not think that any method can be devised to meet the case referred to.  I myself was very anxious when these bounties were brought in that they should go direct to the farmer-producer. We found, on examination, that the only way of preventing a bounty being paid twice was to get the goods out of the country when paid, so that they could not possibly pass on to a second man who would get the bounty a second time.</P>
      <P>I think that the figures quoted by Deputy Belton are correct, but I do not see how any intelligent man could quote figures as Deputy Belton did and say that if it were not for the economic war a beast fetching £12 10s. in Dublin would fetch £20.  The very most you can blame the economic war for is the £6 tariff, less 35/- bounty.  If there is that difference of £20 and £12 there must be another explanation than the economic war.  There must be the explanation of a general drop in prices. Deputy Bennett also spoke of our policy being the same in the Land Commission as it was under Deputy Hogan when he was Minister and under Deputy Roddy when he was in charge of the Land Commission.  When we send down an inspector, the Deputy says, the inspector goes to a man to whom he proposes to give land, and asks him if he has stock for it.  Perhaps Deputy Bennett would get some pigs down in Limerick and give them to poor farmers so that they may stock their lands.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton generally starts off his speech like a philosopher by stating economic principles.  They are sound, I believe, in most respects, but still they do not always apply.  For instance, I do not know why cement should be dearer in England than it is here.  Still, it comes across here for sale.  If you try to fit in questions like that with Deputy Belton's principles, you find that these principles do not stand.  If first principles are to have any value, they must stand the test of cases such as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it.  I think that happened only quite recently.  After the economic war started, British cement was practically wiped out of this market.  Belgian and French cement was capturing the market and then British cement came down suddenly from 50/- a ton to 38/ or 39/- with practically no margin of difference, considering quality, between it and Belgian cement. Obviously, they sold at a loss or at very little profit in order to hold the market for another day.  I do not think the Minister is correct in stating that in normal trading, before tariffs on either side were imposed, British cement was dearer in England than here.  If Deputy Dockrell were here, he would be a better authority than either of us.</P>

      <P>The only other question I was asked was by Deputy Mulcahy as to where this money was coming from.  I suppose we collect money from certain sources, put it into a pool and take it out again.  I do not know exactly where this particular portion comes out of but we place it against the £5,000,000 that had been <Col N="2949" /> going to Britain.  Our idea in starting these bounties and subsidies was that we felt the agricultural community were bearing the brunt of the economic war and we wanted to soften things for them so far as we possibly could.</P>

In addition there was probably a £1,000,000 subsidy thrown in, so that that is, for one half-year, £5,500,000 or £5,250,000 gone.

      <P>It was a scandalous performance on the part of the President not to be able to stand up to criticism.  It was still more scandalous for him to put up a person who tries to smother a debate with rather nonsensical talk&mdash;more noise than sense, as Deputy O'Higgins said.  He put up that person in derision of his own Vote.  That is the only use the President makes of the Minister for Finance &mdash;to put him up for a derisive purpose. We had that attitude following on the speech by the President in which he had the nerve to say about anybody so clear-minded as Deputy Morrissey that to him his mind seemed to be a chaos of ignorance.  To anyone who has had experience of the wild and whirling words of the President, there is no more appropriate word than the word &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; accurately to describe his state of mind.  What did we get from him?  Nothing but the peculiar output of a chaotic man.</P>
      <P>He set out to prove three items.  He said there was no hatred between him and anybody in England, nor was there hatred&mdash;taking himself as representing and personifying the Irish people, which is his great habit, but which he should not be entitled to do&mdash; between the Irish and the English people.  He did not think it was right that this country should give in to foreign rule, and the country, he said, would never be at rest while any portion of the soil was under the domination of a foreign power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the hatred point was introduced for I do not know.  I have not heard anybody here talking about hatred as between the Irish and English people.  There has been a considerable amount of talk as to the various hatreds which the President has.  They are not of the English people.  That is not his type.  He has talked of foreign rule, ending up with the phrase that of course we might take a leap too far; we might attempt things that were impossible; we might not be able to make our will effective <Col N="2953" /> in this country under certain circumstances. Why does not the President make up his mind between those two dilemmas?  If he cannot make his will felt in this country because of something outside, why does he prate of this business about foreign domination? Does he not know well that there would not be a trace of foreign domination in this country if he liked to declare that there should be none. He does not think he could make his will effective over a certain part of it. What is he going to do about that part? He told us here in a debate at one time about the infinitely distant date when the two parts of this country would be united.  Are we to put those two things together, and assume his declaration which will rid us of foreign domination in this country is going to be delayed until that infinitely distant date has come?  That will be great news for all the Republicans this House has.  As far as the twenty-six counties are concerned, the President knows that there would not be the movement of a single troop against him if he declared to-morrow whatever form of government he likes to establish, but he dare not do it.  What makes him hesitate about this?  What is the good of talking rubbish about foreign rule in this House, on an estimate from which he eventually ran away, if he still has at the back of his mind the paralysing thought that he cannot make his will effective in this country?  He is thinking only of the twenty-six counties of this country. Any Government can make its will effective in this country to-morrow without any fear of foreign domination. Why is it not done?  The President is a Republican still.  He is going to get a Republic established here; at least, he hopes he will see the day when it is established, apparently for the whole country, on that infinitely distant date when the two parts of the country are to be united.  And the man who talks that way refers to a Deputy here as having a mind that is a chaos of ignorance.  What is that but the outpouring of a chaotic mind?</P>
    <P>When we were discussing the estimate that is on this paper for the Governor-General's establishment, the <Col N="2954" /> estimate upon which members of the Fianna Fáil Party voted in a Division for the first time, the President's excuse with regard to the keeping of the Governor-General, to whom he has apparently assigned no duties except to keep out of his way and not dim his limelight, was the threat of immediate and terrible war.  He threw out that phrase before.  When it was thrown out before it was used always in derision of the cowards who accepted the Treaty because of the immediate and terrible war threat.  Now that bravest of all the heroes who led this country through a certain amount of turmoil and destruction for ten years finds that he has to accept the Governor-General because of the threat of immediate and terrible war.  Does the President believe that there is any threat of immediate and terrible war now?  I am using the word &ldquo;war&rdquo; in its ordinary sense&mdash;in the sense in which it was used in or about 1921. Does the President believe in the use of that phrase now?  Does he not know &mdash;again I repeat it&mdash;that there would not be a movement of a troop of any kind against the people of this country if he liked to declare either a Republic or some hybrid type of State, something at any rate which would not have a Governor-General, something which would not require the closing in of a decent type of man so that he would not get in the President's way?</P>
    <P>The President told us that there are ways of making a settlement, and that one of the ways is surrender.  Another way which is worse than surrender is persisting in a policy when it has been shown that it is steadily weakening, and that the end will be that you will have to crawl for worse terms than could have been obtained when your position was stronger.  The President has halted and faltered because he is afraid he cannot make his will effective. On the question of the economic war that is being waged has he been halted at all by the fact that he cannot make his will effective, or does he think he is making his will effective in that matter?  That is the point upon which consideration of the whole problem should turn.  Are we making our will effective in relation to the British in <Col N="2955" /> respect of the economic war?  Are we getting stronger and stronger as the struggle develops?  Are we getting nearer and nearer to a better settlement? The British who are interested in this matter can see the returns of our market, the returns of our imports and exports, they can simply survey the various measures brought in here by Ministers from time to time&mdash;the relief schemes, the provision of milk, and the provision of peat&mdash;and can read at the end of all this that the unfortunate Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce had to admit to-day that in spite of all those things he is going to have 50,000 able-bodied men idle in this country next autumn.</P>
    <P>Will any of them read from that that the people of this country are better off, or that this country next autumn is going to be able to stand up any more strongly to what will be against us than we are doing at this moment? If I had any belief in a Republic in this country, and I have none, I would feel enraged at the present policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.  If there are some Republicans in this country, and there are certainly not any in the Fianna Fáil Party, they must feel enraged at what Fianna Fáil is doing, because they are certainly exposing in the clearest light the weakness of our situation.  In fact, they are doing worse than that; they are making an exposure of this country as if it were weaker than it actually is.  So far as the opposition to England is concerned, there is not a decent belief in this country that what is being done is either necessary to be done or is being done efficiently.  The only result of all that is happening at the moment is that it is the clearest demonstration to the people on the other side that, if they are to take the effort that is being made here at the moment as the best effort we can make at fighting this dispute, then they must have a very poor regard for us.  It is a regard they should not have for us, and it is one which we do not deserve.  If they looked at our history, they would not have it.  But when they look at the people in power and see the state to which the country is reduced by the <Col N="2956" /> efforts of these people, they cannot have any belief except that, if they do hold on a little bit longer, our resistance must collapse.</P>

      <P>I am making no argument except the one I was precluded from making by the cowardice of the President in not being here, and his absence, I suggest, is solely due to his inability to face criticism.  In running away, he is following on the practice he has followed many times in his previous history&mdash;running away from difficulties.  I talked to-day on various items of the Government's industrial policy.  Every step that they have taken in regard to industry or an industrial policy in this country has been a clear confession that the previous step was a mistake or, at any rate, was not a success.  The only thing they can point to is their agricultural schemes.  Is there a scheme of theirs yielding a dividend at the moment? What about the great seeds plan?  It was a complete break down.  How many of the envelopes, marked in the top left-hand corner &ldquo;Heifers&rdquo; have come in?  How many of these heifers have been sold?  What about the new markets?  Belgium was tried, and it meant a big loss.  Germany is being tried now with a big subsidy, and an <Col N="2957" /> outside association thinks that Spain ought to be exploited.  What about the money that was paid for seed wheat? How many thousand tons were bought? What fraction of the tonnage bought was disposed of by sale even at a low price?  How much of it had to be thrown away?  How much of it was allowed to go almost to the point of germination and had to be thrown away and given to flour millers for whatever use they could make of it? Did we not hawk butter around France and did we not have to bring it back again, and was it sold almost for the price of cart grease?  Has there been a single scheme of an agricultural kind that they can say has been a success? We know there has been no success on the industrial side, and, financially, we are reduced to the point of borrowing&mdash;borrowing of a highly dubious nature and borrowing of a type which, if ventured upon, would certainly destroy the credit of this State.  Yet the President, although he fears his power to make his will effective politically, is not afraid to try to make his will effective economically, although it has been a failure.</P>
      <P>The Deputy whose mind was so courteously described by the President as being in a chaos of ignorance had irritated the President when that remark was made.  He had reminded the President in the course of the argument that the President had warned the people of this country at one time that the financial settlement was going to result in a payment by us of £19,000,000 per annum to England. The President denies that.  He issued a statement to that effect in 1925.  I do not care how it was phrased.  The object of it was to make the people of this country believe that this country would be saddled with a debt of £19,000,000 a year.</P>

Does he not know that the statement was made, and would he argue with me on any occasion he likes as to what is the implication of the statement issued as a warning to the people of this country, if it was not to <Col N="2958" /> make them believe that the country was going to be saddled with a debt of £19,000,000 a year?</P>

      <P>We were warned to-day by the President that the settlement of the economic war is not in sight, and he brushed his Minister for Finance aside in the usual derisive way.  The Minister had been putting up that sort of bluff for months past.  The President, however, does not believe it, and he does not mind kicking his Minister for Finance about. Neither does anybody else mind kicking him about, I think, and he takes it well.  He is used to it.  But the Minister for Finance on the 8th of June had accused Deputy Cosgrave here of spoiling the chances of Senator Connolly who was going to go into one of the most important conferences and one of the most fateful so far as this country was concerned.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that Senator Connolly was going into a most fateful conference for this country.  There is another Deputy who is very anxious that the good prospects of this country in relation to a settlement should not be frustrated.  The President has no nonsense of that type about him.  There is no settlement in sight.  I do not know that he wants one.  There is certainly none in sight.  We are just going to go on as we are.  Funnily enough, in the President's speech we had joined up to the continuance of the economic war the question of disorder.  The President is going to use the powers he, as a member of the Government, possesses only when it is necessary to use them. I wonder when will the necessity arise? The President had been informed of a certain phrase added to something written on a wall in Limerick.  He had been informed.  He did not tell us who told him.  He might have told us if it was the police told him.  He does not appear to hear much from the police these days.  I do not know whether it is because the police have got to know that information of a particular type is not acceptable.  He has not been informed, funnily enough, of any examples of intimidation through the country.  His Attorney-General could have told him of one.  A man named McWalter attacked an ex-captain's house and the ex-captain shot him.  The Attorney-General prosecuted McWalter for having a gun without a licence-the man who made the murderous raid on another man's house. His excuse was that he had to remember <Col N="2960" /> that the man was hovering between life and death for some period-an excuse which would almost always, if taken as a principle, excuse the Attorney-General for not prosecuting a man, for instance, in a perverted sexual type of crime, because his physical condition will be so weakened by sexual malpractices that the Attorney-General will have to take that into consideration, and will not think it human to put such a man in prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the comparison is a good one, and I should like to repeat it.  The Deputy has heard what I said about the attack by a man named McWalter and how, in making a murderous raid on a man's house, he was shot himself.  The Attorney-General prosecuted him-for what? For a raid, for a conspiracy, for anything done under arms?  No, but for having a gun without a licence, and the excuse of this strong upholder of the law was that he had to remember this poor fellow, who only engaged in a murderous attack on a man's house, had lain for some months hovering between life and death.  Does the Deputy understand that?  I take it that the analogy to make is that if that is accepted as a principle by the Attorney-General I suppose eventually we will refrain from prosecuting in sexual perverts cases as their malpractices will have reduced their physical condition to such a point that it would not be human to prosecute.  Does the Deputy get that? Disorder in this country has been spoken of and how it arose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether Ministers think their conduct has conduced to order or to disorder in the country.  We know of a certain occasion upon which a man who had been brought up on a certain charge and convicted by a judge was released. Is there any truth in the statement which has been made that the ex-Minister for Justice was coerced into signing the release because of the fact that armed men visited him in his house? Do any members of the Government know of that?  If that is the sort of weakness that masquerades as, &ldquo;We are going to use power when it is necessary to use it,&rdquo; we know where we are.</P>
      <P>I end where I began.  The President is afraid to take certain steps in relation to England because he is not sure whether he can make his will effective.  What is he afraid of?  Is it armed force against him?  I argue that he cannot be so afraid.  I will read what he himself said in 1927, in a notorious interview which he gave to the <i>Manchester Guardian.</i>  Speaking about partition he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Those elements in the North which have wilfully assisted in mutilating their motherland can justly be made to suffer for their crime, and I do not think they should continue to receive the favoured treatment which they now enjoy in the Free State.  They have chosen separation.  Let them feel what separation means.  Public opinion in Ireland will insist on high protection. If Ulster chooses to remain outside our political system, she can have no special right of access to our markets.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good statement.  Choose separation and you will not have free access to our markets.  Is the President afraid that that is the particular policy that might be enforced against him by the British Government if he chose to separate?  Is that what he is afraid of?  If that is what he is afraid of, why not lean a little bit more heavily on the Minister for Finance, the <Col N="2962" /> Minister for Agriculture, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who have told him that the situation, industrially, agriculturally, and financially in this country is better than it ever was before and that we are going from strength to strength?</P>

      <P>May I suggest sir, before you accept that, that in moving the resolution yesterday the Government, in summing up the amount of time they thought the business on the Order Paper would take, fixed it at 12 to-night as their estimate. I suggest that this is a continuous attempt to stifle discussion on the part of the Government.  This interference was particularly noticeable on the President's estimate, on which many Deputies wanted to speak. I suggest that this conduct is highly reprehensible on the part of the Government, they having by their own motion made it clear that they did not think this business could be fully discussed before 12 o'clock to-night.  They themselves, by their act, showed that that was a reasonable time for this particular business.</P>

      <P>I understand that amendments have been handed in.  On that question, I would submit that it is not possible at this stage to take amendments to the Appropriation Bill in view of the Title of the Bill, which accurately describes the principle. The Title of the Bill is: &ldquo;An Act to apply certain sums out of the Central Fund to the Service of the year ending on the thirty-first day of March, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-four and to appropriate the supplies granted in this session of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  An amendment would provide for an alteration in the sums just voted by the Dáil or in the appropriation of the supplies just granted. The purpose of the Bill is to apply sums which the Dáil has already determined and to appropriate them to their proper services.  I suggest, therefore, that no amendment can be taken at this stage.</P>

      <P>I have just handed in an amendment which I suggest is clearly in order and within the scope of the Bill, and it is not directed to either of the purposes mentioned by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance may possibly learn from his Attorney-General that the only power of issuing a National Loan is under this Appropriation Bill which is now going through the House.  It is a very important matter from the point of view of the country.  If the Minister searches in the files of the Department of the Attorney-General, he will find a very elaborate exposition <Col N="2967" /> of the powers in connection with Loans.  He will find that the only power to issue a National Loan is under this Bill, and the amendment I have put in&mdash;I think there is another one in Deputy O'Sullivan's name&mdash;seeks to provide that before the borrowing powers are exercised and before the National Loan is issued this House will have an opportunity of expressing its opinion on the loan.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I want to submit that we are now discussing the Bill and that this Bill has to go through its five stages just the same as any other ordinary Bill. It has always done so.  I say, sir, again with all respect that the more the Minister seems to study the Standing Orders the less he seems to understand them.</P>

      <P>I can at least afford some for the Minister and the Minister is now calmly suggesting that we ought to take the five stages of the Bill and that you, sir, should not accept amendments which are not in order.  Is the Minister suggesting that the amendment should not be accepted because sufficient notice has not been given in accordance with the Standing Orders? I think it is an insult to your intelligence to suggest that you should not accept the amendments if they are in order and relevant to the Bill.  I think the Minister for Finance should have some respect for the Chair and some respect for the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I submit that the provisions of Standing Order No. 25 in regard to giving due notice of amendments have not been complied with.  Secondly, I submit that the House has determined by its previous practice on such Bills that due and formal notice should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the procedure of the House was determined in previous years in regard to this Bill, and secondly, I suggest that this Bill has some significance.  If you are to accept the point raised by the Minister for Finance, the only conclusion we can come to is that the Bill has no significance and that it cannot be amended&mdash;that, in other words, there is no use at all in going through the formality of passing the Bill.  I suggest that it is making nonsense of the procedure of the House to suggest that a Bill which has to go through five stages means nothing.  I suggest there is nothing to differentiate this Bill from other Bills, that it is a Bill which must become an Act.  It must go through five stages.  We have had amendments handed in before now. Therefore, the last point raised by the Minister for Finance, I suggest, is not relevant, so far as precedents are concerned. It was always at the discretion of the Opposition or any member of the Opposition to object.  The fact that you have a Bill means that the Bill must mean something, and unless it can be amended the Committee Stage means nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same point I have another amendment, but it is not one of the two types to which the Minister for Finance has objected.  I want to get an opportunity of putting a point of view in relation to the point of order that amendments of these two types are out of order.  I put it to you that the Appropriation Bill is not a Bill of a peculiar type, at least peculiar by itself.  It is only one of the classes of Bills which found on resolutions which originate in Committee on Finance.  There are Bills other than the Appropriation Bill which so originate.  The Butter Prices Standardisation <Col N="2969" /> Bill was a Bill of exactly the same sort and it originated in Committee on Finance.  There was a certain subsidy, or a certain price, fixed by that particular measure, and it will be within the remembrance of Deputies that many amendments were moved on the Committee Stage.  On that analogy, I think it is quite clear that an amendment either to remove an appropriation or to reduce an appropriation is quite in order on this Bill. The Bill is not of a class peculiar to itself.  It is one of many Bills arising out of this type of resolution, and amendments have been moved to such Bills.</P>
      <P>There is the second point raised by Deputy O'Sullivan that if the Minister's point is correct it would render the whole scheme of the measure futile.  That is not exactly the objection from the Minister's point of view.  The procedure of the House is in general that there should be five Stages of a Bill, and the five Stages must admit of some amendment.  On the point of the amendments, it is quite clear that the Chair is at liberty to receive amendments at shorter notice than is laid down in the Standing Orders.  It is quite clear that to a measure which only passed the Second Stage about ten minutes ago, there was no chance of handing in amendments previously.  Therefore, the point of time does not arise.</P>

      <P>I should like further to point out that the relationship between this Bill and the Resolutions which have been passed already is quite analogous to the relationship between the Finance Bill and the Financial Resolutions that precede that Bill.  To suggest that this Bill is incapable of amendment in an orderly way, is analogous to suggesting that the Finance Bill should be left untouched, and should simply consist of the Resolutions that were passed previous to the introduction of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to stress what Deputy McGilligan has stated.  He said that this Bill is <Col N="2970" /> founded on a series of Resolutions adopted, many of them, by this House to-day, and most of them within a very recent period.</P>

The first section is only the statutory form of what has been agreed to by this House within the last hour.

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I want to say a few words.  This section asks for power to borrow some £17,000,000.  In the critical circumstances of the country and in the light of the amounts of money mentioned here, I feel it necessary to draw attention to the fact that the interest of the credit of this country and the interests of economy, as having some bearing on the price at which it may be possible to borrow money, make it most desirable that the statements that have been made in dealing with some of the Estimates here by the Minister should be amplified and that some statements that have not been made, by reason of the closure of some of the Estimates, and the omitting, therefore, of some of the Minister's speeches, ought to be made in however brief a form.  The Minister for Agriculture, in dealing with the Estimate for bounties, under which £2,450,000 are being provided for the purpose of assisting, to a large extent, the agricultural community to export their agricultural surplus, was not able to tell us how exactly this money was to be got or how the country was to sustain in the years to come a payment of that magnitude annually. He has already made known to the public at large that, in his opinion, it will be necessary to sustain the agricultural interest in future, that is, year after year, by bounties, subsidies and tariffs, and it is known that our farmers had two-thirds of their normal market outside this country up to recently.  The greater part of that two-thirds has been taken from them, and we are told that there is very little likelihood of being able to recover it in full.  That two-thirds represents about £17,750,000.  When considering that in relation to the amount of assistance being given to the export of agricultural produce, and the amount that agriculturists have dropped in their income during the twelve months, we find under the heading of live animals that their income has been reduced by £9,000,000, that in the first five months of this year the drop has continued, and that, as the Minister for Agriculture says, they may expect a drop of income in that way.  The money that is being provided by way of bounty must come either from agricultural production or from industrial production. Therefore, we require some further encouraging statement, either from the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the President, which will remove some of the doubts that have been created regarding industrial development, so that the investing public may have some assurance, that if agriculture is dwindling in its capacity to bear the burden of providing something that would go back to it in export bounties, there is some prospect of development taking place in industry, by bringing about a situation that those engaged in industry, other than agriculture, may have it in their power, as a result of their production, to help to raise this sum either in taxation or to support them by other means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain points to which the Minister should refer.  Speaking in Kilkenny recently, the President indicated that there had not been as much industrial development as he <Col N="2977" /> expected, and he pointed out that there was a way, which had not been availed of, by which that development could be assisted.  He stated that local bodies could do much to promote industrial development.  I have endeavoured to find out from various Ministers, for the information of local authorities, what these bodies can do, so that such powers as they have will be exercised to the full to bring about that quickening in industrial development, that the statistics recently provided for show leave much to be desired.  The Ministerial Party has stated that local bodies can be of assistance.</P>

      <P>I am loath to interrupt the Deputy, but, on a point of order, I suggest that the only discussion which could be relevant to this discussion is whether the Minister should be permitted to issue the various resolutions or whether the amount should be raised by taxation by borrowing.  That is the full scope of this section.</P>

May I point out that Deputy Mulcahy is perfectly entitled to adduce the reasons he thinks fit, and, as long as they are relevant he cannot be ruled out of order.

      <P>The Minister has stated what the section means. The terms of reference are contained in the title to the section, and the Deputy is quite in order in adducing reasons why the powers of borrowing should not be given to the Minister.  But the Deputy went on to discuss how local bodies might help Irish industries, which is pretty far away from the powers of the Minister, and he had not related or begun to relate that to the powers of borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not going to argue that the Minister should not get powers for borrowing but, that in giving him the powers the House should, at least, ask that an additional statement should be made, in view of matters that are at present reflected on the credit of the country and on its financial capacity to bear these borrowings.  The making of a certain statement may create a position by which the Minister might be charged a rate higher than that at which the money might be borrowed if there was a greater assurance given the investing public that things were more satisfactory than discussions in the House suggested.  I asked if the President would indicate the way in which local bodies could help to quicken industrial development here.  I suggest that a statement would make that a little clearer, and would affect very favourably the position in the borrowing market.  The President's organ also stated that even with the circumstances that exist, and which are creating great havoc to the agricultural industry, local bodies could do more to rescue the country from the attack made on it.  If the President would state how local bodies could assist in this very important matter, and how borrowing could be more satisfactorily carried out, perhaps we would not have to bear big burdens in the shape of interest that might otherwise fall upon us.  The House will admit that the circumstances in this country are critical, and that nothing should be left unsaid which would create confidence. I would like to urge that what is called the economic war is inflicting more hardship on this country <Col N="2979" /> than any of the wars we have spoken of.  To some extent we passed unscathed through the great war. There were family losses and experiences that were poignant, but the country, as a whole, could not be said to have been economically affected very prejudicially by it.  Large sums of money were earned by the agricultural community and even by the industrial community during that period.  The economic improvement of the country created an atmosphere and nerved and strengthened our people, so that even during that period of war they energised themselves in such a way that we have to-day this Parliament directing the affairs of the Free State.</P>

      <P>I submit that there there is at present a state of affairs that is crushing to our agricultural and industrial life.  Some statements that the Minister might make with regard to local bodies would give the country heart that industrial development was proceeding.  Not only do we see the agricultural position reduced by present circumstances, but the Minister for Agriculture says that this year £2,500,000 must be given towards its assistance and that that must continue.  We see industries that have pretty well rooted themselves, as a result of favourable tariffing during the last eight or ten years, being reduced to a position in which not only has there not been a great increase in employment, as Ministerial statements led the country to believe there would be, but in which employment has been reduced in many cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have some information as to what this particular declaration is which is required in certain cases before a grant can be received, who are the types of people before whom it is to be subscribed, and what it contains.  Is this a hidden oath of allegiance?  If so, what is the reason for having this offence which may be tried summarily and make a person liable to a fine of £30?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear from the text.  This is the usual statutory declaration made by a person who may receive payment in respect of superannuation or any other non-effective service.  That means the person properly entitled to receive the payment. The declaration is made and the Paymaster-General or some other officer makes the payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get some better enumeration of the people who may get the grants and who are forbidden to receive such grants until a declaration of a particular kind has been made.  What is the form prescribed by the warrant of the Minister, and who are the persons who will subscribe to such declaration?  In the Schedule I find &ldquo;For the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, including certain other services administered by that office.&rdquo; I do not know if the Minister can inform us whether there is any person who has been in receipt of a grant such as has been referred to in Section 4, which we are discussing.  There is a person called a distributor of stamps in the office of the Commissioners who gets paid a poundage.  Is that a grant for the purpose of Section 4?</P>

      <P>I thought it was a reference to the Minister being in the police courts himself.  One has only to mention Smithfield&mdash;I hope the Minister understands.  But let us get back to whether it is a grant made in pursuance of the Act and whether this type of grant is to be prescribed by warrant of the Minister.  I would like to ask what is the type of warrant which the Minister would prescribe and who are the people who tick the warrant before he gets paid poundage. I don't think there is much more in the Revenue Commissioners that would call for a grant of this type.  Under Vote 7, the Old Age Pensions, there are people who are clearly here getting grants&mdash; pensions.  I would like to know if it counts as a grant for the purpose of the section.  I would like to know if the form of declaration used is the same in the variety of cases and if the Minister could tell us the type of warrant and tell us who are the people prescribed by the warrant.  I may point out here the terrible injustice of imposing even on summary conviction a penalty not exceeding £30 on a person who is in receipt of an old age pension of a limited amount.  Under Vote 11 I cannot see that there is anybody who might fall under this particular type of grant.  Forty-one is for grants in aid of housing.  The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; under the Interpretation</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2991" /> Act includes, of course, &ldquo;any body or persons corporate or unincorporate,&rdquo; so that the word would include local authorities getting grants under the Act of 1919.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>At the opening of the debate on this section, Deputy McGilligan made a statement to which I have given full and sufficient go-by. He persists in repeating the statement, possibly in greater detail, but with the same effect.  I don't think there is any <Col N="2992" /> useful purpose in that, and I should like to move that the question be now put.</P>

      <P>On Schedule B, and before the Minister gets an opportunity of moving the closure, I want to ask a question&mdash;not to make a speech.  This is really a very important question.  We are in this particular measure appropriating a number of thousands of pounds under different Votes.  They all refer to certain departments and in respect of each of these departments a Minister is in charge.  There is a Minister's salary voted and the money is appropriated under this Bill.  The President's salary is mentioned in the Vote as £1,500.  Item two of that particular Vote says &ldquo;Income tax say possibly £250.&rdquo;  Having sat in this House for 26 hours I want to ask this question. Is there any reason why the President, the Minister for Finance, and the Executive Council generally could not publish their salaries as such, showing exactly what they are, because public money is being voted away and the public want to know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to direct the attention of the House to a very serious and misleading defect in the Title of this Bill.  The House will notice that the Title of the Bill is &ldquo;An Act to apply certain sums out of the Central Fund ... and to appropriate the supplies granted in this session of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  That the Title is misleading is borne out by the fact that it misled the Minister for Finance himself on an earlier discussion of this Bill, because he pointed out incorrectly that this Bill only dealt with the application of certain sums out of the Central Fund and the appropriation of supplies.  In fact, it deals with much more radical subject matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the Fifth Stage, sir, item No. 56 of Schedule B, against which an amount of £175,286,000 stands, includes in that figure an amount of £33,215 in respect of the staff of the Trade and Industries branch.  That figure is an increase of £10,500, giving additional employment to 32 persons engaged in the Trade and Industries branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce. Pivotal on and fundamental in all the discussions that we have attempted to initiate, and things that ought to be foremost in the minds of the Ministers who have addressed themselves to the presentation of Estimates before this House, ought to be the serious state of affairs in the country from the point of view of employment and unemployment to-day and the prospects that are before our people industrially and agriculturally. I have pointed out that the Minister for Agriculture to-day, also presenting to us a figure enshrined in these <Col N="3011" /> amounts of £2,450,000, asked for the vote of that amount so that by way of subsidy and by way of bounty he might pay it out to exporters of agricultural produce in order to help them to get rid of their agricultural produce and not leave the farmers in the position that they were getting too small a price for it.</P>

    <Title>In Committee on Finance. - Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Bill, 1933&mdash;Fifth Stage (Resumed.)</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we might describe this Bill as a Bill to provide that certain citizens of an alien country acting through a person named de Valera shall control a newspaper purporting to be national&mdash;the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;for the purposes of saying that the Irish people's minds shall be moulded not according to the wellbeing of their own country but according to the policy that these aliens wish to dictate.  I base that on a statement made by the President (column 1930, volume 48 of the Official Debates).  He said: &ldquo;The only case where I would intervene actively&mdash;and I would intervene as trustee on behalf of those who subscribed the moneys&mdash;would be if the policy of the paper were to depart from that of supporting the movement for Irish independence and supporting the policy of economic independence also.&rdquo; It is rather interesting to notice how typically that phrase is worded: &ldquo;The only case in which I would intervene actively&rdquo;&mdash;one gathers from the word &ldquo;actively&rdquo; that there are other occasions when intervention of a nonactive sort might take place.  The House will remember when this Bill was being debated before, the President, who is not announced as a director, who stated time and again he had no interest in this paper, was able to tell us that he had told the newspaper to publish its balance sheet owing to misunderstandings outside.  I do not think its non-publication was a departure from the policy of Irish national independence or whether his action was some other form of passing intervention. I would not call this &ldquo;graft,&rdquo; because &ldquo;graft,&rdquo; within the meaning of the word used in America, the country which controls this newspaper, implies a form of getting public moneys into one's pocket by a method not in accordance with the law.  In this country&mdash;I do not know if it is happening in any other country in the world &mdash;we go out of our way to legislate, and permit a politician to put public funds, I will not say into his own pocket, but to use them for the purpose that is most likely to make for his own betterment and his own glorification. I maintain that this Bill, being for that purpose, is a Bill moulded in such a way as to see to it that the unfortunate people who subscribed these moneys originally and who were misled into parting with their bonds some years ago, should have no opportunity of getting even part of their money, which, as the President and the Minister for Finance told us, they needed very badly.  It was suggested in that usual vague way we associate with the President, that these people, in handing it over, had every possible notification of the value of what they were handing over.  &ldquo;Everybody with these bonds got notification that these claims were to be met&rdquo; (col. 1783, volume 48 of the Official Debates). What does this mean?  &ldquo;Every person who had these bonds got notification of the fact that the claim was to be met.&rdquo; Did every person get notification telling them that they were to get 125 cents to the dollar?  The most they knew was that they would get 58 cents to the dollar, and now we are told that we are bound to hand over these dollars to this kept newspaper because the people who handed them over originally knew what they were doing. <Col N="3017" /> Again, the President's statement you find of such a contradictory nature that he always puts in because, as the Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce admitted, their whole policy, indicated clearly, consists in sharp practice and trying to pull the wool over people's eyes. He says this money was to go towards this kept organ to be controlled by one person in the interests of people abroad: &ldquo;It was because of that assignment which I regarded as worth money and as an equivalent to the cash coming in at the time that I expected according to the Estimates we went on with the enterprise.&rdquo;  (Col. 1784, Volume 48 of the Official Debates.) He regarded it as worth cash.  How much cash?  He has stated that he has formed a corporation of bondholders and every bondholder is given a share equivalent in value in the ownership of the paper.  He stated that has been done in the first instance here.  He invited us, challenged us, offered to bear an examination on oath and so on, but he has not told us that when he assigned, when he gave his interests to his corporation, he, I suggest, never told them that the bonds were equal in value to 125 cents.  I think it is much more likely that the most value they were given was 58 cents.  I pointed out that Miss MacSwiney had stated that most of the people holding the bonds were &ldquo;Free Staters.&rdquo;  Consequently, one must assume that most of the people who handed over bonds to this organ were holders of bonds of low denominations.  Low denominations would generally be less than ten dollars.  The prospectus sent to these people in America gave them no promises whatsoever that they would have any interest in the ownership of the paper or any profits if their bonds were value for less than ten dollars. The President made great play about the confidential document.  He said there has been so much publicity that we could not go into the courts to say that the people did not know there was value in their bonds.  The value of their bonds, by virtue of this Act, is 125 cents to the dollar.  Did it imply that the people realised the bonds were worth 125 cents to the dollar, and did <Col N="3018" /> some of them who were sufficiently wide-awake know that the bond was worth 58 cents to the dollar?  If you happen to put a comma wrong, the President denounces you as a blackguard and a liar.</P>
      <P>When Deputy McGilligan challenged him on that point he said that the Deputy was not here and asked what did he know about it.  I used no such remarks.  I said no such thing.  If it had been the other way about, the President would have got up, thumped the board, denounced us, and said it was part of our continual policy to misrepresent what he says.  He, himself, the man who cannot remember whether he was Minister for External Affairs in the Irregular Organisation in 1925, will purport to give what we meant to say and give as a version of our statements something that we neither meant to say nor suggested. I made no reference to Irish servant girls but his paid organ, kept for the intelligent people of the country, has in this day's or yesterday's issue&mdash;in view of the present circumstances I am not quite sure of the days&mdash;a letter from some unfortunate individual who was obviously impressed by that statement that we had talked about servant girls in America.  That is the way the President does it.  He invents a thing and passes it on to somebody else but when anybody seeks to place a meaning on his words, that any intelligent person must necessarily put on the words, he denounces him as carrying on a propaganda against him and misrepresenting what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President called it quibbling to suggest that there was any difference between these bonds and the bonds of the National Loan.  If there was ever a dishonest quibble, that is an instance of it.  As I pointed out, the National Loan is the direct equivalent of national money.  You can open your paper and see what it is worth; you can go to the bank to discount it or you can get your broker to sell it.  It has a fixed value.  These bonds had no value whatever beyond the 58 cents, and before the finding of the courts, they had not even that value.  It has had, as I said, a negotiable value, a realisable value, is fixed on the <Col N="3019" /> strength of the Government who promised it.  These unfortunate people were induced by a method that makes me almost invoke the shade of that comparatively honest man, Horatio Bottomley, to part with their bonds, first of all because they attached no value to them and did not realise that they had any value, and secondly because the agents of these company promoters went round, and if the people were inclined to favour Cumann na nGaedheal, they were assured that Cumann na nGaedheal was intensely anxious that this paper should be brought into existence.  In order to get the money they maligned honourable Irish newspapers.  They suggested to the people in America that the existing Irish newspapers were owned, controlled and directed from England, and that these newspapers existed for no other purpose but to subject this country and to make it malleable to every wish of the English Government.  That was blackguardly misrepresentation.  The newspapers of this country then existing were in every way more honourable, more upright and, consequently, more Irish.</P>
    <P>When I suggested that these unfortunate people who subscribed this money should at least have the opportunity of getting not their 100 cents in the dollar, not the 125 cents in the dollar we have to pay now, but that they should be allowed to get 67 cents in the dollar, of their own money, I was denounced as being inspired by Party motives.  That suggestion of mine was inspired by nothing but spleen, I was told.  It was only because we wanted to injure this national newspaper that we ever thought of such a thing!  I invited the President to tell us whether or not when we were taking the steps to repay in 1924 or 1925 the Loan raised in Ireland we had not taken steps to see that anybody who obtained possession of a receipt for that Loan here in Ireland, without giving an adequate equivalent payment for those bonds, would not get possession of the money that was going to be paid on them.  I pointed out that we gave a warning to the <Col N="3020" /> people that such transfers would not be recognised, if an unfortunate person in the country were induced to part with his bonds or receipts not realising the actual value of them.  This Government acted in that way as it was bound to do for the protection of the weak and the honest and for the frustration of the dishonest.  We were prepared to bring in a Bill with exactly such a clause as I proposed should be introduced into this measure.  There was no thought then of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  We had no object in our mind then except to protect people who subscribed money of that kind.  But when we proposed that the same thing should be done in relation to the American Loan, because in that case it was eminently more necessary that it should be done as the people in America as I pointed out had not the same opportunity to know what was being done in the matter&mdash;when I proposed that it was said that it was motivated by nothing but spleen.  It was mean and vindictive.</P>
    <P>Why was that said?  The man who said it revealed his mind.  He could not understand, he is temperamentally and characteristically incapable of understanding, why any man should want to protect the weak.  He sees everything which everybody else does through the spectacles of his own mind and he gave expression to his own mind when he leant over that board, with his lock hanging over his forehead as I said before, and when he stated full of venom:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I know it is gall and wormwood to them that they are not here to do it and that is the whole trouble. They are not here to do it, and it is the great and supreme pleasure of my life to know that they will have to digest that gall and wormwood.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the mind of a man who is preaching around the world that he is trying to create a new civilisation in which only the tenets of Christianity will have force.  What does he say? &ldquo;I know it is gall and wormwood to them that they are not here to do it.&rdquo; To do what?  To do what we endeavoured to do in 1924 in relation to the Home Loan, to see that the people who subscribed the money <Col N="3021" /> would get the money and that it would not go to the Horatio Bottomleys, the tricksters who got possession of the bonds from these unfortunate people. It is gall and wormwood to us that the rightful subscribers do not get the money.  It is gall and wormwood to us to-day to see that the people who subscribed that money will not get it and that the people who swindled these people will get it.  It is gall and wormwood to us that we should have handed over the government of the country to a Party who are disgracing this country by passing a Bill to make legitimate what would be known in any other country in the world by the one word &ldquo;graft.&rdquo;  I do not know, as I said before, of any other country in the world where there was such shamelessness as we have here where a Government comes in to put a Bill through to make their graft legal. The most they can do in other countries is to use a word I myself learned from the President in 1917, to be sufficiently &ldquo;ikey.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that a sum of 1,500,000 dollars is to be taken from this country if this Bill becomes law.  The President in his long speeches assured us time and again that there is no inconsistency in the various gyrations, if I may use that word, that he has indulged in since 1922.  He told us here how a Deputy named Boland in 1922 had asked the Minister for Finance at that time whether we were to pay these bonds, and we were.  The Treaty had been approved by the Dáil at the time and everybody knew what the result of the election was going to be.  There is no question about that.  Everybody knew that the result of the election was to be the acceptance of the Treaty and the establishment of the Free State. That Deputy asked the Minister for Finance would the new Government pay back this loan and he was told the new Government would.  The President quoted that to show the continuity of the intentions to pay this money.  You had got that assurance from that generous man.  When these proceedings took place to get 2,500,000 dollars into the possession of himself and his friends I gathered from his statement that while he was trying to get possession of that money he had intended that the traitors and those usurpers who voted for the setting up of this State would have to pay it back and just what was that based on?  He may say that something else had turned up, the civil war or a coup d'etat which had driven him to wage <Col N="3023" /> civil war and destroy this State.  You may say that the evidence in the case for Mr. de Valera in America was that &ldquo;We have an organisation, and that we have the existing Republic with authority residing in the Second Dáil.&rdquo; Even his opponents, we are told, admit that the President is honest and sincere and so on.  But this man had in mind at that time to take steps to see to it that this Parliament representing the people should not get possession of that 2,500,000 dollars which he was then demanding to get.  Was it only later circumstances that changed his mind? Just note his letter of 7th September, 1922, published in the White Paper correspondence, &ldquo;E de Valera and others,&rdquo; page 8: &ldquo;If we issue a statement it will tie our hands and if at a future time a course other than non-attendance would seem wise we would find ourselves precluded from taking it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Deputy to show how the question of non-attendance in the Dáil is related to the Fifth Stage of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments in justification of the action taken in America involved this country in enormous legal expenses which have to be met because this Bill is not merely for paying back the money subscribed by the bondholders but also to pay all the expenses and legal costs in America as well as the expenses of the trustees in distributing that money.  The President was particularly anxious in his speeches here to suggest to us that there was something completely harmonious and continuous in his attitude when he took action against us in the courts in America and the action taken here now in 1933.  He promoted that action in America.  The second action of the Hearn bondholders was based directly contrary to the affirmations which he had affirmed in the previous cases when he suggested time and again that something had happened in 1925 when he was fighting the allocation of this money and some date between that and 1933&mdash;something altogether outside <Col N="3024" /> of himself.  He says we owe that money.  In 1925 he said we had no right to the money but he suggests now that it is something quite harmonious, nothing wrong at all between his outlook that time and his actions of to-day.  It does seem to me to be implied that somehow or another something happened between 1925 and 1933 for which we are answerable.  We cannot think what it is but in his tortuous mind before 1927 he and his friends could stay outside the Dáil while retaining their seats.  In 1927 we took steps to see that those who were not prepared to take their seats should cease to be members of the Dáil or could not become members of the Dáil and then he came in.</P>

The first time the Deputy appears here after getting out of bed, he begins to make remarks of that kind.</P>
