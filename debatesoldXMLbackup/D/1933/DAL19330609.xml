      <P>Amendments 1 and 2 are associated and I move that the <Col N="313" /> Committee agree with the Seanad in these amendments:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Amendment 1:</P>
      <P>Section 2.  Lines 13-17 inclusive deleted in page 4.</P>
      <P>Amendment 2:</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 3 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>3.&mdash;(1)  Any person who claims that he is a person who carried on an existing merchandise road transport business, within the meaning of this section, or that he is the successor in title to a person who carried on an existing merchandise road transport business may, not later than one month after the date of the passing of this Act, apply to the Minister for the grant of a certificate under this section.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every application under this section shall be in writing and shall state fully the facts upon which the applicant claims that he or his predecessor in title is a person who carried on an existing merchandise road transport business.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where any application is made to the Minister under and in accordance with this section, the Minister shall, if, but only if, he is satisfied that the applicant or his predecessor in title is a person who carried on an existing merchandise road transport business, issue a certificate to the applicant accordingly, and any person to whom a certificate is issued under this section and no other person shall be an existing carrier for the purposes of this Act.</P>
      <P>(4)  A person shall for the purposes of this section be a person who carried on an existing merchandise road transport business, if he was carrying on such existing merchandise road transport business at the date of the passing of this Act and such business was during the whole of the period necessary to constitute it an existing merchandise road transport business carried on either by such person or successively by persons from or through whom such person claims to be entitled to such business and by such person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> (5)  For the purposes of this section the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  each of the following shall be an existing merchandise road transport business, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  any merchandise road transport business which was commenced after the 1st day of July, 1932, and before the 8th day of February, 1933, and was carried on in the manner required by this sub-section during the whole of the period beginning on the date of such commencement and ending on the date of the passing of this Act,</P>
    <P>(ii)  a merchandise road transport business which was carried on in the manner required by this sub-section during the whole of the period beginning on the 1st day of July, 1932, and ending on the date of the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>(b)  a merchandise road transport business shall not be deemed to have been carried on in the manner required by this sub-section during any period unless during such period such business was</P>
    <P>(i)  having regard to its nature, carried on with reasonable continuity, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  carried on with mechanically-propelled vehicles duly licensed in Saorstát Eireann under Section 13 of the Finance Act, 1920, as amended by subsequent enactments.</P>
    <P>The matter dealt with in these amendments was discussed when the Bill was passing through the Dáil.  There was a question raised concerning the definition of &ldquo;existing carrier.&rdquo;  A question was raised in the Seanad also as regards this matter and, finally, this amendment was produced to deal with the situation.  It provides that any person claiming to be an existing carrier can apply to the Minister for a certificate to that effect.  The definition of &ldquo;existing carrier&rdquo; is one who has carried on a <i>bona fide</i> transport <Col N="315" /> business from 1st July to the passing of the Act, with reasonable continuity, having regard to its nature. The person who gets the certificate is then automatically entitled to a licence.  The amendments do not involve any change in the principle, but merely effect a change in the machinery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of &ldquo;reasonable continuity,&rdquo; will the Minister be empowered, under that phrase, to consider the case of a man who is driving his own lorry and who is incapacitated for several months?  Could the Minister take that circumstance into account in deciding whether or not a service had been carried on with &ldquo;reasonable continuity?&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  To some extent, this amendment is designed to meet unusual cases of that kind and to give a certain amount of discretion in determining whether an applicant is an &ldquo;existing carrier&rdquo; or not.</P>
      <P>Amendments agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendments 3, 4 and 5 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3.  After the word &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; in line 41 the words &ldquo;or a vehicle drawn by a mechanically-propelled vehicle&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>Section 8, sub-section (1).  Before the word &ldquo;road&rdquo; in line 57 the word &ldquo;merchandise&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>Section 10, sub-section (2).  After the word &ldquo;licensed&rdquo; in line 59 the words &ldquo;in Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; inserted.</P>

      <P>Section 37, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;months&rdquo; in line 59 the words &ldquo;or such longer period as the Minister may allow&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>Section 38, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;months&rdquo; in line 29 the words &ldquo;or such longer period as the Minister may allow&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> These are really drafting amendments and they permit of a certain amount of elasticity in the periods fixed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendments agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 8 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 50, sub-section (2).  Before the word &ldquo;send&rdquo; in line 14 the following words inserted:&mdash;&ldquo;at any time (other than during the period commencing at the expiration of one year after the date of the passing of this Act and ending at the expiration of three years after the said date).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to meet a certain objection raised by persons licensed under the Road Transport Act, 1932, to the provisions in this Bill.  These persons contended that if application were made to have their licences transferred under the compulsory section to an authorised merchandise carrying company and if that application was refused, they should be protected against further application being made on the initiative of an authorised carrying company for some period following the rejection of the first application.  It was not possible to meet that view entirely, but this device was adopted as going some part of the way towards meeting the objection.  It provides that the Bill shall operate as intended for a year but at the end of one year there shall be, as it were, a close season for omnibus operators during which no order for the compulsory transfer of the licence can be made.  At the end of the three years, we hope the position will have so regularised itself that there will be no further question of compulsory orders.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 56.  The section deleted and a new section substituted therefor as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>56.&mdash;(1)  Where an arbitrator in any arbitration before him for fixing compensation under this Part of this <Col N="317" /> Act awards compensation, such arbitrator may, if he so thinks fit, award to the person entitled to such compensation, in addition to such compensation, such sum as he thinks reasonable to cover the expenses of such person in relation to such arbitration, and any sum so awarded shall be payable by the person liable under this Part of this Act to pay such compensation.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where</P>
    <P>(a)  a transfer order or a reduction order in relation to a merchandise (existing carrier's) licence is made on the application of an authorised (merchandise carrying) company, or a transfer order in relation to a passenger licence is made on the application of an authorised (passenger carrying) company, and</P>
    <P>(b)  an arbitrator in arbitration before him for fixing the compensation payable under this Part of this Act in respect of such order to the licensee under such licence does not award compensation,</P>
    <P>such arbitrator may, if he so thinks fit, award to such licensee such sum as he thinks reasonable to cover the expenses of such licensee in relation to such arbitration, and any sum so awarded shall be payable by the company upon whose application such order was made.</P>
    <P>This is intended to provide that the arbitrator may award costs if he thinks fit.  As the Bill originally stood he was required to award costs to the person whose licence was transferred, payable by the transferee. The section now, with amendment No. 9, leaves it to his discretion.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Dáil agrees with the Seanad in amendment 10:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 58.  The words &ldquo;by the person liable under this Part of this Act to pay such compensation&rdquo; deleted in lines 20-21 and the following words substituted therefor:&mdash;&ldquo;by, in case such arbitrator awards compensation, the person liable under this Part of this Act to pay <Col N="318" /> such compensation or, in case such arbitrator does not award compensation, the person who, if compensation had been awarded in such arbitration, would have been liable under this Part of this &lsquo;Act to pay such compensation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is really a consequential amendment. It provides that where costs are not awarded the fee of the arbitrator shall nevertheless be paid by the transferee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendments:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Section 3, sub-section (1).  The word &ldquo;existing&rdquo; deleted in lines 41 and 52 and the word &ldquo;major&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
      <P>2.  Section 3, sub-section (1). Before the word &ldquo;capital&rdquo; in line 45, where it secondly occurs, and also before the word &ldquo;capital&rdquo; in lines 48 and 51, the word &ldquo;major&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>3.  Section 3, sub-section (2). Before the word &ldquo;capital&rdquo; in lines 3, 5 and 7 the word &ldquo;major&rdquo; inserted.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> 4.  Section 3, sub-section (3).  The word &ldquo;existing&rdquo; deleted in line 9 and the word &ldquo;major&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    <P>5.  Section 3, sub-section (3). Before the word &ldquo;capital&rdquo; in line 14 the words &ldquo;the major&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    <P>6.  Section 3, sub-section (4).  The word &ldquo;existing&rdquo; deleted in line 16 and the word &ldquo;major&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    <P>7.  Section 3, sub-section (7).  The word &ldquo;existing&rdquo; deleted in lines 42 and 43 and the word &ldquo;major&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    <P>8.  Section 3, sub-section (8).  The word &ldquo;existing&rdquo; deleted in line 55 and the word &ldquo;major&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    <P>These amendments, No. 1 to 8, are consequential upon No. 19.  Deputies will remember that I promised to reconsider the capital reconstruction scheme as it affected the minor stocks of the company.

    <P>This amendment is really here by error.  The Seanad Committee passed an amendment changing the scheme of Section 3, which involved a number of consequential amendments.

      <P>8.  From the appointed day for the ordinary stock of the company until the next annual election, within the meaning of the foregoing section, sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the Great Southern Railways Amalgamation Scheme, 1925, shall apply to directors of the company subject to the modification that the reference to £2,000 contained therein be construed as a reference to £200, and from and after the said next annual election shall apply to such directors subject to the modification that the said reference to £2,000 be construed as a reference to £1,000.</P>
      <P>This relates to the qualification of directors.  At the present time a director to be qualified must hold ordinary stock to the nominal value of £2,000.  When the Bill becomes law that stock will have a nominal value of £200, and it is proposed to provide that in future a director must hold ordinary stock of a nominal value of not less than £1,000.</P>

    <P>This is designed to create the same legislative position in respect of the road transport employees of the railway company as at present exists in relation to the rail service employees of the company.  Under the Act of 1924 the companies are required to regulate rates of wages and conditions of service in agreement with the trade unions and this makes the same arrangement in respect of the road transport employees of the company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>New section.  Before Section 10 <Col N="324" /> a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>10.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may at any time by order (to be known and in this section referred to as a uniform rate order) direct that any particular merchandise when carried by rail by any specified railway company or railway companies on the conditions (in this section referred to as the special conditions) prescribed for such merchandise by such order shall be so carried at a rate (in this section referred to as a uniform rate) fixed in relation to each distance (in this section referred to as a prescribed distance) prescribed by such order in accordance with this section and whenever the Minister makes such an order a uniform rate shall be fixed under this section in respect of each prescribed distance and from and after the date on which such uniform rate becomes operative under this section while such order remains in force each such uniform rate shall be the rate which, notwithstanding any other enactments, shall be charged for the carriage of such merchandise on the special conditions by such company for the prescribed distance to which such rate relates.</P>
    <P>(2)  In every uniform rate order the Minister shall specify the particular merchandise to which such order relates and the unit of quantity of such merchandise by reference to which the charge for the carriage of such merchandise shall be calculated and shall prescribe the special conditions for the carriage of such merchandise and the distances in respect of which uniform rates shall be fixed under such order.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may in any uniform rate order prescribe the distances in respect of which uniform rates shall be fixed under such order by prescribing a graduated scale of distances, by fixing maximum distances, by reference to zones round any specific point, or in any other manner which the Minister may think fit.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister may include in the special conditions prescribed by any uniform rate order conditions as <Col N="325" /> to all or any of the following matters, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the minimum quantity in respect of which a uniform rate shall be chargeable;</P>
    <P>(b)  loading and unloading;</P>
    <P>(c)  packing;</P>
    <P>(d)  the train services available for carriage;</P>
    <P>(e)  liability for loss or damage;</P>
    <P>(f)  any other matter which in the opinion of the Minister might reasonably affect the cost of transport.</P>
    <P>(5)  Whenever the Minister makes a uniform rate order in relation to any merchandise it shall be the duty of any railway company specified therein within one month after the making of such order to estimate in accordance with this section in respect of each prescribed distance a uniform rate to be charged in respect of the carriage of such merchandise on the special conditions by such company for each such prescribed distance.</P>
    <P>(6)  For the purpose of the estimation of a uniform rate by a railway company under the foregoing sub-section to be charged in respect of a prescribed distance for the carriage of any particular merchandise the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  such company shall select a period (in this section referred to as the standard period) which in the opinion of such company is suitable, in the particular case, as a period for estimating the probable volume of traffic to be expected from the carriage of such merchandise for such prescribed distance;</P>
    <P>(b)  if such company has carried any substantial quantity of such merchandise during any substantial period prior to the time of such estimation, and if no material change has taken place or is anticipated in the volume and conditions of traffic resulting from the carriage of such merchandise, the standard period shall be a period prior to such estimation;</P>
    <P>(c)  if such company has not <Col N="326" /> carried any substantial quantity of such merchandise during any substantial period prior to the time of such estimation, or if a material change has taken place or is anticipated in the volume and conditions of traffic, the standard period shall be, at the discretion of such company, partly before and partly after or wholly after such time;</P>
    <P>(d)  if the standard period or part of the standard period is subsequent to the time of such estimation such company shall make an estimate of the probable volume of traffic for such prescribed distance resulting from the carriage of such merchandise during such standard period or such part of such standard period and such estimate shall for the purposes of this section be the volume of traffic for such standard period or such part of the standard period;</P>
    <P>(e)  such company shall calculate the gross income from the volume of traffic for the standard period for such prescribed distance on the basis of the charges which have been or which would but for this section be made in respect of such traffic, making allowance for exceptional rates when such might have been applied or would be applicable, and shall estimate a uniform rate which would in the opinion of such company produce a similar gross income from the same volume of traffic carried for such prescribed distance in a period equal to the standard period.</P>
    <P>(7)  Every uniform rate estimated by a railway company in accordance with the foregoing sub-section shall be submitted by such company to the Railway Tribunal forthwith and the Railway Tribunal, after hearing all parties desirous of being heard and appearing to it to be interested, shall fix the uniform rate either at the amount estimated by such company or at such other amount as may appear proper to the Railway Tribunal and shall appoint a date on which the uniform rate so fixed shall become operative and every <Col N="327" /> uniform rate so fixed shall become operative on the date so appointed.</P>
    <P>(8)  Every uniform rate fixed by the Railway Tribunal under this section shall be reviewed by it on the expiration of every calendar year from the date on which such uniform rate was fixed and the Railway Tribunal may upon any such review make such modification as it may think proper in such uniform rate.</P>
    <P>(9)  The Minister may in any uniform rate order direct that such order shall apply to the carriage of the particular merchandise specified therein by canal or by canal and road and may if he thinks that the circumstances so require prescribe by such order special conditions for the carriage of such merchandise by canal or by canal and road either in addition to or in substitution for any other special conditions prescribed thereby and thereupon this section shall apply to the carriage of such merchandise by canal or by canal and road as if a canal company were a railway company and the special conditions for the carriage of such merchandise by canal or by canal and road prescribed by such order shall be special conditions for the carriage of such merchandise when carried by canal or by canal and road.</P>
    <P>(10)  The Minister may in any uniform rate order direct that such order shall apply to the carriage of the particular merchandise specified therein by the road services of a railway company as if such road services formed part of the railway services of such company and whenever the Minister so direct the provisions of this section shall apply to such railway company and to the carriage of such merchandise by such company as if such road services formed part of the railway services of such company and carriage by road were carriage by rail by such company.</P>
    <P>(11)  The Minister may in any uniform rate order direct that a separate uniform rate shall be fixed for the carriage of the merchandise specified in such order by road by any <Col N="328" /> railway company and may if he thinks that the circumstances so require specify in such order special conditions for the carriage of such merchandise by road either in addition to or in substitution for any other special conditions prescribed thereby and thereupon this section shall apply as if carriage by road were carriage by rail by such company and the special conditions for the carriage of such merchandise by road shall be special conditions for the carriage of such merchandise when carried by road by such company and a uniform rate shall be fixed for such carriage independently of any uniform rate fixed for the carriage of any merchandise by rail by such company.</P>
    <P>(12)  The Minister may by order made under this sub-section revoke, amend, or vary any uniform rate order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During the course of the discussion on this Bill in the Seanad, an amendment was proposed designed to give the railway company power to charge flat rates for the conveyance of merchandise. The amendment, however, contemplated the railway company charging such rates more or less at its discretion and in a manner which would permit it to give very favourable terms to one trader and to deny them to another or to give very favourable terms to goods conveyed to or from one port as against goods conveyed to or from another.  An amendment of that kind, of course, was not acceptable.  It was contrary to the principles on which railway rates legislation had heretofore been based. It was felt, however, that, in certain cases and in respect of certain classes of merchandise, a system of flat rate charging might prove operative and useful and, consequently, this amendment was devised.  It provides that, in certain cases, subject to the approval of the Minister and submission to the Railway Tribunal, the railway company may charge flat rates for the conveyance of goods.  This flat rate may be either in respect of the system as a whole or graduated in respect of defined distances.  The amendment provides that, where such flat rate is fixed, it shall be available <Col N="329" /> to all traders and shall operate uniformly so that it cannot prejudice the interest of any particular individual, particular town or port.  The amendment also provides that, where such order is made, it shall apply also to canal companies which, otherwise, might be put in a disadvantageous position.  Canal companies, like railway companies, at the present time, are unable to charge flat rates.  The amendment also makes consequential provision to provide that, where a flat rate is agreed upon, it shall be regarded as an exceptional rate under the Railways Act of 1924.</P>
    <P>It is, by no means, certain to what extent this provision will prove effective.  It is considered, however, that it would be desirable to have some experience of it in operation.  It is not unlikely that we will find it necessary to revise and codify all the legislation relating to transport charges at some future date and, in that event, it would be desirable that we should have experience of the operation of a scheme of this kind.  The railway company are very anxious to have facilities in this matter.  What they requested, of course, was considerably more advanced than what is proposed here but, so far as this section goes, it does meet the railway company's contention, while, at the same time, not removing the safeguards for the public interest which we consider to be necessary.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister give us some information with regard to sub-section (4).  It appears that there is going to be interference in what usually would be matters left to the discretion of the company.  Surely, the matters dealt with in sub-sections (a) (b) and (c) would be matters left to the discretion of the company?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That section is really a protection for the company.  If the flat rate is fixed, it might be held, if that section were not there, that the company would have to concede that flat rate to everybody, irrespective of the quantity of goods offered, the manner in which they were to be loaded or unloaded, the manner in which they were packed, or the other <Col N="330" /> matters set out here.  This provides that, where a flat rate is fixed, the Minister may fix conditions relating to these matters which would be a protection to the railway company. In other words, the rate will only apply to goods which are sent in the minimum quantities or loaded or unloaded in a defined manner or packed in a defined manner or which meet regulations which may be made under sub-sections (d) (e) and (f).  It is necessary that some such condition should be laid down, otherwise there might be considerable hardship imposed on the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A Senator moved a section which was remarkably similar to one the company itself had suggested and which set out to confer this power of charging flat rates on the railway company.  The section moved by the Senator went much further than we were prepared to contemplate in so far as it would override all existing provisions and principles with regard to undue preference and matters of that kind.  This section provides for the charging of flat rates but preserves the interest of individual traders, towns and ports by ensuring that, where a flat rate is fixed, it shall be available, under similar circumstances, to all persons desiring to transport the same class of merchandise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister has had very sound advice with regard to the section, but one's first impression, on reading this, is that it was designed to meet some form of traffic which the Minister had in mind but which had not yet been carried, to any great extent, on the railroad.  The first five sub-sections of the section deal with the Minister's power to make an order regulating certain traffic, prescribing distances and prices and so on.  The second portion of it, sub-sections 6 and 7, deal with the railway company's estimate of costs and, then, apparently it comes before the Railway Tribunal.  The Minister has already fixed the rate, if I read the first portion correctly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is not intended that the Minister will make an order except on the application of the railway company.  The company will say that they are desirous of introducing a flat rate arrangement in respect of some commodity, let us say, peat, for example.  The Minister would then make an order authorising the company to enter into a flat rate arrangement in respect of peat.  The company would then estimate, in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (6), the flat rate that could be charged, but that flat rate would be submitted to the Railway Tribunal, which would consider the representations of all interested parties, and be subject to revision by the Railway Tribunal if they think the rate should be revised.  The amount of the rate and the conditions attaching to it will be subject to the review of the Railway Tribunal.  The Minister's order merely authorises the making of a flat rate in respect of the commodity mentioned in the order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be chronologically correct, but there is no provision in the section allowing the railway company, although, of course, it does not prevent them, from applying to the Minister.  The first sub-section says that the Minister may, by order, direct that any particular merchandise shall be carried under certain conditions and at certain rates.  Obviously, that is the first step.  The Minister's explanation of it is that that is not really the first step, but that the first step would be the application by the railway company, in respect of a particular class of merchandise, that a flat rate would be desirable.  It does not appear to be clear, although, I presume, the Minister has had advice on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly looks as if the Minister makes the order and, having made the order, the railway, or transport companies, make certain estimates and, having gone with these estimates to the Railway Tribunal, probably against the Minister's order, may get the price varied.  If that is <Col N="332" /> not in the second portion, from sub-section (6) to sub-section (7), I must say that I have misread it altogether, but it does appear to me that the railway company, having been presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> by the Minister, proceeds to estimate whether or not they are losing money on that particular class of traffic and approach the Railway Tribunal which then operates but, again, the Minister comes in afterwards.  I must say that that struck me as being an extraordinary innovation in the Bill.  I know that the railway company desires to be able to quote low rates.  I understand that one of the principal objections that businessmen have is to discrimination and so on.  If the Minister is satisfied I am.  I am not sure that the section carries out what the Minister has explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite certain it carries out what we intend, but does not carry out entirely what the railway company desired.  They desired to be in the position to offer a flat rate, say, to one merchant with a large volume of goods to be transported, and to refuse that rate to another merchant transporting the same goods, perhaps subject to the condition that the merchant in the first case would convey all his goods by rail.  Such an arrangement might be desirable from the railway point of view, but undesirable from the public point of view, as it might prejudice certain towns, ports or individuals.  This section goes some way to meet the desire of the railway company and brings in for the first time the idea of a flat rate charge. The section merely provides that the commodities to which a flat rate must be applied must be approved by the Minister, when the Minister shall make an order authorising the company to charge such a rate on definite commodities. The company estimates what the rate will be and submits it to the Railway Tribunal which, having heard all the parties, fixes the amount of the rate for the commodity in respect of a definite distance.  The Railway Tribunal comes in to protect other interests, as everyone likely to be prejudiced <Col N="333" /> by the order can appear before the Tribunal.  There is a provision that the Minister may revoke the order if it is proved to be working inequitably, or of no avail to the company in its operations.  My own view of the section is that it will not prove to be operative in a large number of commodities, but it gives an opportunity of examining the manner in which such a rate would operate with a view to a possible revision of legislation affecting rates at a later date.</P>

      <P>I would point out that the machinery set out in the new section is going to put very considerable difficulties in the way of the railway company in quoting rates for traffic.  It is hardly necessary to point out to the Minister that a railway company is expected to quote a rate within 48 hours.  They are not asked to give a rate until the traffic is practically ready.  Possibly if the rate is not given within 48 hours the traffic goes to some other form of transport. From the reading of the new section it would appear as if it was going to tie up the powers of the railway company to compete freely against others.  The desire of the Minister was that the railway company should be put on the same basis as other transport companies. As Deputy Cosgrave has pointed out the other companies are free to quote rates and have not to submit them to the Tribunal or to the Minister.  Here we have the railway company still in the difficult position that it cannot compete against other companies.  It appears to me that the new section, of which I cannot see all the implications, is going to hamper considerably the railway company in getting traffic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstands the position.  At the present time, rates and charges for all commodities are fixed by the Railway Tribunal, but the railway company may, at its discretion, reduce these charges by 40 per cent.  Any standard charges fixed by the Railway Tribunal may be reduced 40 per cent. by the railway company.  If the railway company wants to go below the 40 per cent. it has to go to the Railway Tribunal to get sanction for an exceptional rate below that percentage. That is the position since the Act of 1924 came into operation, and that would remain the position in respect of any commodity, unless and until a flat rate order came into operation, in <Col N="335" /> which case that flat rate would apply to that commodity and would be known to the parties interested and would not be liable to variations of that kind.  Where no flat rate order is in force the position is not changed. With the consent of the Railway Tribunal, exceptional charges below the 40 per cent. can be given.  It is not until that flat rate has been superimposed in respect to any particular commodity that this section applies. In that case, the flat rate is available for everyone and cannot be modified for the benefit of one party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what we denied the company.  The company desired to be in a position to quote a special flat rate at 48 hours for a particular trader for a large amount of traffic.  We did not give the company that power.  We say that if they desire to charge a flat rate, then they must make that flat rate available for everyone in the country consigning the same merchandise under the same conditions. It will not be open to the company to enter at 48 hours' notice into a flat rate arrangement with one particular trader.  We think it would be most undesirable that the company should have that power of discrimination as between traders, because it would operate to prejudice the interest of particular traders, and very likely to prejudice also the interests of particular towns.</P>

I think it is possible to offset by this order the advantage which motor haulers have got up to this.  The railway company may say: &ldquo;We will have to go to the Railway Tribunal to get the flat rate restored.&rdquo;  It can go on that way all the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty about the matter is that this is cumbersome machinery for fixing rates, which prohibits the railway company from making a special rate for special conditions. Call it whatever rate you like, a uniform rate, a flat rate or anything else; it is a special rate.  I can quite understand when the railway company gives this special rate to one trader that there would be some obligation on them to give it, under similar circumstances, to another trader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has nothing to do with special rates.  There is power at the present time for the railway company to charge special rates with the approval of the Railway Tribunal.  The section has nothing to do with that.  It inaugurates a new form of rate, namely a flat rate, which will be available to all persons.  I admit it is cumbersome machinery, but necessarily so in order to protect certain interests.  I have said that we have under review and may introduce special legislation, bearing upon the system of charging for transport at present operating here, but that is going to be a matter which will require very careful consideration.  Personally, I should like to see a flat rate of some kind in operation for a period beforehand, in order to get some experience of the working of it.  The whole law relating to the rates of charge for transport at the present time is based on the principle that there should be no undue preference.  Any modification of that principle would be very undesirable, until we saw clearly where we were going.  To give the company power to charge exceptional rates at their own discretion would cut across <Col N="340" /> that principle entirely, and might produce a very undesirable state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I could quite understand that, if their competitors had similar obligations placed on them.  Here are two companies competing for traffic, and an obligation is placed on one which is not placed on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  Every person carrying merchandise by road will be under the direct obligation, when the Road Transport Act becomes law, to give the same facilities and charge the same rates for the same merchandise to one person as to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  You do not give exactly the same facilities to the railway company.  I do not object, once the railway company gives a certain rate&mdash;call it a flat rate if you like&mdash; to certain people for a certain commodity, that that rate should be available to other people transporting the same commodities.  That would be only reasonable, but this prohibits the railway company from being free to give rates in competition with others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently, the Minister's idea about a special flat rate must be connected with some very large commodity, and from one place. Has it anything to do with either cement or the mails?  It seems to me that there must be some special idea which the Government have in their minds, that has not yet come <Col N="341" /> out in which they envisage some very large class of merchandise being distributed from one central point over various parts of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The railway company asked for powers somewhat similar to these.  I could not say off-hand what would be the full range of commodities for which they intended to exercise these powers.  They have indicated to me their willingness to fix a flat rate charge for the conveyance of peat.  Certain other commodities were also mentioned but, perhaps, it would be undesirable for me to mention them now.  The intention would be, in respect of certain commodities to which a flat rate charge might conveniently apply that the railway company, having considered its position, and having decided to operate it, would then come to the Minister to discuss the matter.  The Minister would have to have regard to the effect of such an arrangement on the public interests generally, and only when he was satisfied that it was not going to be prejudicial to the public interests would he make the order.</P>

      <P>It could be, but it is a matter for the company to decide which it requires.  We proposed to introduce another section relating to the fixing of rates for goods collected and delivered, but again it meant bringing in the Railway Tribunal and the company indicated that they would prefer not to have the power if they had to go to the Railway Tribunal and so the amendment is not in the Bill.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It says that the Minister may include in the special conditions prescribed by any uniform rate order conditions as to liability for loss or damage.  That means that the Minister may, with a wave of his hand, sweep away&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not understand it at all.  The rate will be fixed subject to conditions.  In other words, the company will say: &ldquo;We are authorised to carry these goods at a flat rate subject to (1) a minimum quantity being offered; (2) the goods being loaded or unloaded in a particular manner or at a particular place or particular time; (3) packed in a particular manner; (4) availability of train services,&rdquo; and so on.  These are the conditions under which the rates will be available.  The rate would not apply at all if a quantity less than the minimum was offered or if the goods were not packed in a particular manner and so on.  What is provided for here is that the Minister may state the conditions under which the rate will be available.  One of these conditions might be that the goods be carried at the owner's risk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that the Minister may have certain things in his mind.  What he has in his mind is one thing; what the amendment has on the face of it is another thing; and the power the Minister takes under paragraph (e) of sub-section (4) is, I think, quite beyond the scope and purpose of that amendment.  He can prescribe any conditions for liability for loss or damage under the 1932 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Only when he is making an offer fixing a flat rate.  If the condition is that the goods shall be carried at owner's risk then a person desiring to take advantage of the flat <Col N="343" /> rate must subscribe to that condition.

      <P>I think the principle is dangerous and I think the point raised by Deputies Good and Thrift is one deserving of serious consideration.  As Deputy Good said, this legislation is supposed to strengthen the position of the railway companies and he pointed out that they are precluded from competing with their competitors now for special consignments.  They may go 40 per cent. below the standard charge unless they go through all this performance.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that if I want to get 50 tons of merchandise from Sligo to Roscommon, I am not going to go to the railway company six weeks ahead of the time I want my consignment and then go to the Railway Tribunal in order to get a rate fixed.  If I cannot get it from them, I go to the road transport company. The Minister has a section, a page and a half long, to grapple with this.  I think the Minister is trying to promote his peat industry.  It has the appearance of relieving the railway company of the difficulty they are in, but it leaves them in the same position as before.</P>

      <P>If it is not, goodness knows what it is intended to do except to fill this paper with verbiage.  I think it is a pity, if the Minister did desire to frame a document of this kind, that he did not decide to do something useful instead of giving his mind to turning the bogs of this country into &ldquo;Aikenized&rdquo; gold mines.  It is a great pity, when he was introducing this amendment, that he <Col N="344" /> did not take steps to simplify the proceedings a little further and place the railway companies in the same position as their competitors by giving them the right to go out and look for remunerative traffic; that is, traffic in bulk, which is, at the present time, going to be filched from them unless, as the Minister mentioned, they acquire all the road transport companies. The Minister says that perfectly blandly, knowing that he so drafted the Railways Bill to make it absolutely impossible for the railway companies to raise sixpence for the purpose of acquiring the road transport companies that he has put within their reach.  That is a point that the Minister himself made in defence of his proposal, that if the railway companies were embarrassed by the competition of the road transport companies they could acquire them, if they can get the money.</P>

      <P>One would imagine, from the speeches we have heard from the Government Benches, that the Free State is in a thriving condition. I will ask Fianna Fáil Deputies to take their cue from one of their colleagues who spoke last night, Deputy J. Flynn, of Kerry.  I am sure they are perfectly well aware that the same conditions exist all along the Western seaboard as prevail in the County Kerry.  Deputy Keely told us last night that for the last ten years we have given away 25 per cent. of the revenue of this country.  He said that the present fight will have to be continued. I, for one, believe that this is not the time for fighting.  The Deputy told us that for years past we have been throwing away £5,000,000 per annum, but he omitted to tell us that in one year the Fianna Fáil Government have thrown away £30,000,000.  I invite Deputy Keely to go back to County Galway and put the true position before the farmers there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> The Galway farmers sold lambs yesterday in the Dublin market and the highest price paid for fat lambs was 18/-.  They went as low as 12/-. What price will be paid for store lambs during the next month?  In Galway we carry on the sheep-rearing industry.  As a result of the economic war that industry has been seriously affected.  A few days ago Deputy Corry told us that the Fianna Fáil Party have put the dairying industry on its legs.  He said the farmers were getting 4d. a gallon for milk.  They are, but we are paying for it.  We are paying so that John Bull will get our butter at 7d. a lb. less than the small farmer in the West of Ireland can get it.  There are about one and a half million sheep produced annually in Ireland. We are getting a bounty of 3/- for each lamb and there is a duty of 12/- on each lamb entering England. From that fact alone it will be evident that the farmers are placed in a very unhappy position.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister going to do with regard to wool?  We have heard a lot about the woollen factories that are in a thriving condition.  They are, no doubt, but it is at the farmer's expense they are so prosperous.  There is not a twopence-halfpenny woollen factory in the country that is not protected and it is protected at the expense of the farmer who produces the wool.  The producers in Galway, Roscommon and Mayo get 4d. a lb. for their wool.  How can the Galway, Mayo or Roscommon farmer live under such conditions?  We are paying for the bounty that Deputy Corry and others are getting, and surely we are entitled to something also?  The producers in Galway are entitled to some help in respect of the wool they are distributing in order to keep those factories going.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Kelly told us last night about the lady commercial traveller who travelled down the country.  He said she was in very close touch with the small farmers.  I am sure of this, that she did not know very much about agriculture, perhaps as much as the Deputy, and I am blowed if I can make out what that lady commercial traveller had to do with the small farmers.  The Deputy <Col N="348" /> also told us about a lady traveller who is dealing in hats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The only hats that that man could sell in the country&mdash; in the West in any case&mdash;are the 2d. sunshades.  The position, particularly in the West, is very serious.  I am aware of farmers who were not able to purchase manure for their crops this season.  If the Minister asks his Inspectors on the Western seaboard they will, I am sure, confirm that statement.  I am aware that many farmers were unable to pay for seeds or manures.  In numbers of cases small farmers had to sell their cattle at £4 and £5 10s. 0d., when ordinarily these cattle would not be sold until October.  The farmers had to get rid of the stock at that terribly low price in order to enable them to get seeds and manures.  That is the position that exists, and I appeal to the Minister to make some effort to help those unfortunate people.  He should certainly extend some help in the case of the woollen industry.  The Minister must know that the price paid for Galway wool&mdash;4½d. per lb.&mdash;and 4¾d. per lb. for best Galway wool is not fair to the farmer&mdash;the producer&mdash; seeing the protection that the mills throughout the country are getting from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with some of the sub-heads.  Under sub-head F 2, I notice that the sum of £632 is provided for Clifden Rural Domestic School, County Galway. About three weeks ago I read a report of a meeting of the Galway County Committee of Agriculture and Technical Instruction at which the Reverend Chairman said that it was a disgrace that the Department would not take some notice of that particular school.  There were thirteen or fifteen pupils put up for examination, and of these the examiner said that they were more proficient in the Irish language than they were in the English language.  Fancy, in that school there is not a word of Irish being taught.  These girls who are all Irish speakers go into that English speaking school where they spend a <Col N="349" /> year or two years.  From it they go to another school.  At the present time they must be fluent Irish speakers to get a position in this country, but here is a school supported by the Minister for Agriculture in which not a word of Irish is being taught.  I would ask the Minister to take notice of that.</P>
    <P>I could hardly believe that such a position could exist were it not for the statement made by the Reverend Chairman who presided at the meeting. He said that in the case of the present Government there was too much lip service.  Under sub-head G. 2 the grants for cow testing associations in 1932-33 were £10,800.  For 1933-34 the sum is £9,000.  That is a reduction of £1,800.  But when we come to the allowances to supervisors, the grant for 1932-33 was £5,125 and for the current year it is £5,700. Therefore, the position is that while the grant for the cow testing association has been reduced by £1,800, the allowances to supervisors have been increased by £575.  I think that needs some explanation.</P>
    <P>I also find that the sum of £300 is being provided this year for courses of instruction for supervisors.  There was no such provision last year.  Why is such provision made while the grants are being cut down?  That, surely, needs some explanation from the Minister.  Under sub-head (1), I find that in 1932-33 the sum of £120 was allowed for additional technical staff in the Gaeltacht.  There is no provision in the Estimate this year under that heading.  When Fianna Fáil were on these benches they criticised the Government of the time because, as they said, they were not doing sufficient for the Gaeltacht.  I ask Deputies who represent the Gaeltacht areas to consider that no provision is being made in the Vote this year for technical training in the Gaeltacht.  We have been told time and again by the Fianna Fáil Party that it was the duty of the Government to see that the Gaeltacht got its due, but now we see with a Fianna Fáil Government in power that no provision is made this year for technical training there.  I think that is <Col N="350" /> most unfair.  Only very small provision was made last year&mdash;a sum of £120&mdash;but there is no provision at all this year.  Instead of that being the case, I think that last year's sum should have been greatly increased.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (m) 4 deals with loans for agricultural purposes.  The provision here has been reduced from £29,300 last year to £27,000 this year.  I ask Deputies to consider that the reductions here concern such things as hand-sprayers and agricultural implements. We see every day throughout the country notices such as this issued by the Department of Agriculture: &ldquo;Spray your potatoes early and spray them a few times.&rdquo;  In spite of that we find the Vote reduced so that farmers will have a poor chance this year of being able to purchase hand-sprayers.  The same remark applies to agricultural implements. That is the position, although the Minister for Agriculture is appealing every other day to the farmers of the country to increase the area under tillage.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what is in the Minister's head, or is he responsible for this Estimate?  In the case of the demonstration plots the Vote is also reduced.  Deputies are aware that in the congested areas these demonstration plots have been a great advantage. The small farmers in particular got valuable information from them as regards seeds and manures.  I would appeal to the Minister and also to Deputies who represent the congested areas and the Gaeltacht areas to consider this Estimate seriously and to insist that some better provision should be made for them.  It is most unfair, I think, that the Estimate should be reduced so far as they are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow the lines adopted by other Deputies on this debate.  I have begun to realise that the position of the Minister for Agriculture is not a very enviable one, because as the result of his policy the agricultural industry is going to the dogs.  I would be inclined to sympathise with him if only his colleagues would allow me. <Col N="351" /> It is hard sometimes not to have a feeling of sympathy for the Minister, particularly when his colleagues get up and tell the House that their policy is making for such prosperity in the country.  I congratulate Deputy Flynn, of Kerry, on the new note that he struck in this debate.  He had the courage and the honesty to stand up and speak for his constituents, and to rise out of the narrow rut of party politics in the interests of his country and his constituents.  The Fianna Fáil Party have been appealing to all of us to stand behind President de Valera.  I think Deputy Flynn has done quite a lot to help in that direction, because there is much in common in the view he expressed and in the views held by me and other members of the House.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Flynn said with regard to cattle in the County Kerry applies to the County Cavan.  The flat rate in operation is knocking out the cattle industry altogether.  It is hitting the poor class of farmers in the areas I have mentioned far more than it is hitting the more prosperous farmers in other parts of the country.  I hope the Minister will consider that point of view, and see that something is done to ameliorate the position of these poor farmers in the mountainy parts of the country, not only in regard to their cattle but also in the case of their sheep and lambs.  Deputy Corry, when speaking, dealt a very heavy blow at the Minister for Agriculture for he completely knocked the bottom out of his case before the Minister, so to speak, had put a bottom into it.  I do not pretend to recollect very clearly all that Deputy Corry said, and I am open to correction if I misquote him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood that he said he was just after returning from Aberdeen and I was very anxious on behalf of the Centre Party to extend to him a hearty céad míle fáilte back to Dáil Eireann, but I was not so anxious when I heard the news he brought us.  He told us about the price of oats over there.  If we are now to get away from cattle raising and other agricultural industries we have had, and go in for grain growing, he held out a very poor prospect, <Col N="352" /> if the only market he can find is Aberdeen.  He told us that they were selling oats over there at 4/6 or 3/6 per cwt.  When we deduct 40 per cent. from that price on account of the tariff, and also deduct the middleman's profits and freights, I think the price we would get would be about 1/6 per cwt. That offers a very poor prospect for extensive grain growing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, the statement I read was taken from the Scottish Letter in the &ldquo;Farmers Gazette&rdquo; of 27th May last.  It was a reply to the complaint made by Deputy Hogan that the price of oats here was only 9/- per barrel. I pointed out that the price, according to the Scottish Letter in the &ldquo;Farmers Gazette&rdquo; in Aberdeen was only 4/8 per cwt. which would work out at something like 7d per stone or 8/2 per barrel.  I did not say I had been in Aberdeen but if I do go there I think I will take Deputy McGovern with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, Deputy Corry could not tell us that we are going to have a great market for our surplus oats if we go in for extensive grain growing.  In any case it matters very little what the price of oats is. When we look at things in the proper light, we come to realise that oats after all is the raw material for agricultural products in this country, that a certain amount at all events of the oats that we grow must be used for feeding purposes, so long as we have not a market in Aberdeen&mdash;for producing eggs, poultry, and cattle. That is really the purpose for which it can be used.  Therefore, these products must be sold at a price which will pay for growing oats. You cannot get men to till land and grow oats unless they find that it pays them and if it does not pay them to feed it to cattle, pigs or poultry, what is to be done with the extra corn that is grown?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil must have been pretty hard put to it when they had to rely upon Deputy Kelly to support the Minister's policy because he said he had not a 31st cousin a farmer.  He admitted that he knows nothing about farmers except what he learned from <Col N="353" /> a lady who met a gentleman who was talking to farmers' wives down the country.  That lady brought him good news, that this gentleman had made a great discovery&mdash;that the hats had not been taken off the heads of farmers' wives and daughters yet.  If it is the policy to take the hats off farmers' wives and daughters I hope that policy will never succeed.  I was glad to hear him state that one of the places visited by this gentleman was County Cavan and that the farmers' wives and daughters there do not mean to surrender their right to wear hats.  I hope we shall see Deputy Kelly, Deputy Corry and all the Ministers coming in here in their &ldquo;bawneens&rdquo; before these ladies surrender their right to wear hats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say a word about the policy of the Department of Agriculture, with regard to instructors and the means by which they are earning their salaries.  This Vote is concerned with the payment of these salaries.  I must say that I have been living 25 years where I reside at present and that only once have I seen or heard of an agricultural instructor coming into that area. Nobody seems to miss him; nobody bothers whether he is there or not, and the reason is that they have no faith in him, not but that the agricultural instructor can do his work all right, but the method by which the business is being run makes the farmer despair altogether of the position. Instead of consulting the agricultural instructor about any matter in which they are concerned, they simply read the local paper, &ldquo;The Anglo-Celt,&rdquo; and if there is any point upon which they want information, which does not appear there, they write to the paper in regard to it, and it is explained to them in the next issue.  The same practice applies in the neighbouring <Col N="354" /> counties.  They never think of consulting the agricultural instructor.</P>
      <P>The House may be interested to know why they do not.  When they look up the accounts of the Department of Agriculture, they find that instead of these agricultural instructors teaching the people how to make money out of their land, they are teaching them how to lose money.  Take for instance that portion of the Vote expended upon farms run by the Department.  We find that the estimated receipts from these farms fall some thousands short of the expenditure incurred, and that money has to be voted by the House to make good that loss.  Is it any wonder that farmers have such little confidence in these instructors if that is all they can do?  We find that the estimated receipts from students' fees, sale of live stock, farm produce, rent, etc., for Athenry is £3,600, and that the expenditure is £6,543 for the present year.  That is very nearly double the estimated receipts.  Then, in the case of Ballyhaise, we find that the estimated receipts are £2,800, and the estimated expenditure for this year is £6,553.  The same remarks apply to Chantilly, Clonakilty and all the others. Why do the Department not take over some of the derelict farms that we see throughout the country, run them as average ordinary farms, keep their accounts, show how farmers can make money out of their land, and in this way put their theories to the test as practical men?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the farmers, if they heard of a man being able to make a profit out of his land, could examine these accounts and see how the thing was being done.  Certainly, they do not want to learn how to lose money, because they have no money to lose.  They can find many ways of doing that without going to these agricultural instructors.  There are some things these agricultural instructors might do.  They might teach these mountainy farmers how they can produce lambs at 4/- each.  They might show them how they can produce pork at 28/- per cwt., what it was when the farmers had the bulk of their pork for sale.  They might show the women how to produce eggs at 3d. and <Col N="355" /> 4d. a dozen.  They might show them how to sell their produce at 40 per cent. less than their neighbours in Northern Ireland and, at the same time, pay more for their hats and shoes and everything else, and still be prosperous.  These are some practical questions which are worthy of consideration, and which I ask the Minister to deal with when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter I should like to raise on this Estimate and that is, to ask the Minister to give us some information as to the reasons which prevented his giving continued effect to his promise made to a deputation on 2nd May, 1932, with regard to the putting up of butter in Irish-made beech keels.  On that occasion a deputation representing the workers and employers interested in this industry got an assurance that orders for at least 150,000 cwt. beech keels for the cold storage of butter for the home market would be given to the Irish merchants and their men, and that was going to be a guarantee for the preservation of the cooperage trade, which shows signs of disappearing from this country.  The benefits which would accrue from that are perfectly obvious.  The suitability of this class of keel cannot be questioned. It has been stated to be most suitable for the presentation of Irish butter on any market.  The Danes have recognised the suitability of beech as against the resinous woods of their country.  The result is that they import beech from Sweden in which to send out their butter.  We grow beech here, and our saw-millers have the necessary plant to have it felled, sawn and seasoned.  There is at present just a remnant of the coopers left to hand on their craft to the younger generation, if we step in in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that, owing to the protection which the Government has given to the butter industry, this particular matter ought not to be neglected.  It is rather difficult to understand what is the influence that is standing between the Minister and the carrying out of what I believe is his desire.  I have heard reasons alleged, but I cannot <Col N="356" /> substantiate them.  I fear that there are too many people interested in the importation of these handy resinous boxes.  We are told that the cwt. keel is too large for purveyors of butter.  Yet I can see in Limerick and other places Danish butter made up in cwts. and nobody seems to object.  Peculiarly enough, the only people who gave the Minister a chance to give effect to his promise last year were German importers of Irish butter.  They seemed to think that these keels were quite all right.  It certainly seems very peculiar, and almost beyond comprehension, that the Government are unable to force their will on the people, whether creamery managers or others, who are standing in the way of effect being given to this most desirable object.  This particular wood is indigenous to our soil and the felling, haulage, manufacture, and seasoning of it would give a large amount of employment. The Minister knows perhaps much better than I do that when butter is taken from beech wood boxes it is in good condition, but when it is taken out of resinous boxes a considerable amount of the outside of the butter has to be stripped to do away with the taste of the wood.  Having regard to these facts, I should like the Minister to state his intentions in the matter.  I hope he will see that the matter is attended to at once, so as to enable the merchants to put in a stock of this beech for seasoning.  They can do that if they get an assurance that the demand will not be fluctuating and if they get a guarantee for a certain number of keels.  It will mean that in Limerick 14 coopers will be given continuous work all the year round and that six apprentices can be taken on to learn the trade, whereas at present there are only two coopers working in Limerick owing to the uncertainty prevailing. We look to the Minister to help in this matter and we believe that he will be doing the best thing possible for the butter trade, as well as for the preservation of the cooperage trade.</P>

      <P>Instead of offering something constructive to the Minister for Agriculture and the Executive Council, whether on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, or on the motion moved by the Centre Party, or by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, we have the usual whine about the condition of the farmers, how they suffer and how they stand, and how they are being treated as a result of the policy operated by the Government.  I suggest to members of the Opposition interested in the farming community that it would be much better for them to apply their minds and whatever ability they may have to facing the situation as it is.  When we were in Opposition and put forward our point of view, the then Minister for Agriculture time and again told us in his flippant way that the Government had the sanction of the people; that they had been sent here on many occasions by a majority of the people.  &ldquo;We put our policy before the electorate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and they sent us back here to implement that policy.&rdquo;  He used to twit us and ask: &ldquo;What are you crying about.  Why do you not go out to the farmers and try to convince them that the policy that I am operating is wrong?  Why not try and get a mandate from the farmers to reverse that policy?&rdquo;  That was the sort of argument and the line of reasoning adopted by the predecessor of the present Minister.  I do suggest to the members of the Centre Party, and to the members of the entire Opposition that that would be a more practical and a more honest method of approach, as well as a more honest method of criticism than that which has been adopted since we became the Government in the Twenty-Six Counties.  I have listened to the speech made by Deputy McGovern just now, and to the other speeches made by him in this House on other occasions. It was only to-day he referred to a speech made by a member of this <Col N="358" /> Party, Deputy J. Flynn&mdash;a speech which I did not hear.  He referred to that speech and congratulated Deputy J. Flynn on having done more than any other member of the Fianna Fáil Party to cut this narrow rut of party politics. I do suggest to Deputy McGovern that he is the last person who should refer to the rut of party politics, because as long as I remember him and those associated with him they have, more than any other body in the country in party politics, always pitted themselves against the will of the majority of the people.</P>
      <P>The Deputy knows more about party politics than does any member in the Fianna Fáil Party.  To claim, or to allege, that he speaks here for the farmers of Cavan is to state a falsehood. I put it to him now, as one of the representatives of Cavan, to say what the small farmers in Cavan, the small farmers in Curragh or Glen or Dubarrow have gained from the policy which had been operated by our predecessors for ten years and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to him to convince them that they gained anything from the English market.  The Deputy made a statement that the farmers in Northern Ireland were a lot better off than in the Free State and that prices in Northern Ireland were much better.  As a man who lives convenient to that Border, I ask him what would the Nationalist farmers of the Six Counties say to-morrow if they were asked or given an opportunity to come in here?  I challenge him on that, in spite of the statement made by him that the farmers in Northern Ireland are getting more for their produce than we are.  I say if these farmers were given that opportunity they would say with a 100 per cent. vote that they would come in here <Col N="359" /> and put up with whatever impediments&mdash;which I assert do not exist&mdash; that they say are here.</P>

      <P>They could not come in while there are criers like you here. The Deputy said that Deputy Kelly had referred to the fact that he had not a thirty-first cousin engaged in or interested in agriculture as far as he could remember.  Well, I say that Deputy McGovern and the rest of the members of the Centre Party should be very slow to refer to the action of any member of this Party or to their connection with agriculture, when they look down towards their own Front Bench and see there the type of agriculturists who are leading and directing the destinies of the Centre Party.  It is the first time in my life that I knew of an agricultural party or an alleged farmers' party in this country being controlled from a flat in Paris.  I am a farmer.  I am a farmer's son, and I do claim that I know the farmers of my county and every county surrounding it as well as any other Deputy.</P>

Every time I hear a man making the assertion that the farmers are whiners I will stand up and contradict him.</P>

The Opposition tried that.  They are entitled to play the ordinary game of party politics but surely we are entitled to say since we came in here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But surely we are entitled to operate the policy which we set before the people, the policy which we explained to them.  The Opposition made sure that that policy would be made known to every elector in the country.  We are not asking the Opposition to agree with us.  We are not asking them to troop into the Lobby and support what we introduce.  The Opposition are the people who preached about the majority will of the people for ten years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Chair to protect me from the interruptions of Deputy McGovern.  I repeat that for ten years he and those with him went round the country preaching about majority rule and the will of the people and they did many things to enforce the will of the people, a will that had not been half as clearly expressed as it has been on many recent occasions. The Opposition went very far in that direction.  I am not going to deny the Opposition their right to criticise our <Col N="361" /> policy or to criticise the action of any Minister.  They are at perfect liberty to do that but when they come in here and discuss matters like those now before the House, they ought to come in and face up to the fact that we, at the moment, have the responsibility for putting into effect the policy that we guaranteed to the majority of the electorate we would put into operation if we were elected.  If the Opposition do not succeed in getting their recommendations accepted by us, then they have their Saturdays and Sundays to go down to their constituencies and convince the farmers there and the rest of the electorate that we are on the wrong road.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be a sensible recommendation to the people on the opposite benches.  I would also like to remind the Opposition that, while agriculture is a very important matter and a very important industry here, still they should not forget that there are other classes in the community. I am a farmer and there are many other farmer Deputies on these benches who take the same point of view as myself.  If I am a farmer I am not going to fall into the same type of mind as Deputy McGovern who suggested that it was because the Minister for Agriculture was from a grain-growing county, this policy of an admixture in feeding stuffs was resorted to by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say that we, in Cavan, are going to derive very much benefit as a result of that admixture but I am prepared to co-operate with the farmers in other constituencies and other counties.  I do prefer as a farmer to assist the farmers in the midlands and the grain-growing counties to assisting the farmers in the Argentine.  I think that we, farmers, should be more broad-minded than we are in these respects.  We should remember that this community is composed of every class and we should do what is fair and just to implement the policy that is best for every class.  I believe as sincerely and honestly as any man <Col N="362" /> could believe that the Executive Council and the Minister for Agriculture are making a genuine effort in that direction.  I am completely confident that the policy they are operating will ultimately be proven to be the wise policy.  I am confident that the wisdom of those who have gone out and worked very hard to secure the position we have brought about will ultimately be proven. Members of the Centre Party will never get anywhere.  In the words of Deputy McGovern, that it is the most unpopular Party in this House.  How he discovered in a couple of months that he was the most unpopular member of it, I do no quite understand.</P>

      <P>Let me say this in conclusion, to Deputy McGovern and every other member of that Opposition Party&mdash;they are making attempts to influence a majority of the people, and they are making some sinister moves. We had Deputy MacDermot here yesterday expressing hopes for a settlement of the economic war.  He suggested, also, that a settlement was in the offing.  Deputy MacDermot had not the faintest reason or the slightest grounds for making that statement except that he wanted to get the people of this country again thinking in those terms&mdash;that he wanted to raise them up, if he could, and then let them flop down following the policy of the &ldquo;Irish Daily Independent&rdquo; in trying to break the morale of the people of this country.  Do not worry about the position over here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that some of you are not losing any sleep over the condition of the farmers.  I suggest to Deputy McGovern, when he proceeds to prove that the County Cavan farmer lost £26 10/- per annum as a result of the economic war, that if he went to the Department of Local <Col N="365" /> Government to prove a case in favour of an applicant for an old age pension he would endeavour to establish that that farmer's entire income did not, in fact, exceed £26 10/-.  That is the sort of nonsense and the sort of tomfoolery that is trotted out here by members of the Centre Party and, particularly, by Deputy McGovern. Of course, I am a young man, and most members of this Party are young. Deputy McGovern is old, and you could not expect him to be doing or saying anything but foolish things.</P>

      <P>The pathetic and humiliating silence of the Minister for Agriculture in introducing this Vote is, I take it, symbolic of his silence as head of the Department which is supposed to be the watchdog of agriculture when the Executive Council set out to force an economic war upon this country&mdash;an economic war which has practically resulted in wiping out agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?  If the Minister for Agriculture had waited a few minutes I think I would be able to prove to him, out of the mouths of his leaders, that the economic war was not an accident at all, that the fact that we cannot sell our cattle and sheep is not at all an accident.  The economic war was deliberately entered upon.  At least the President of the Executive Council said clearly that this country was too long dependent upon cattle, and he was going to take it off cattle.  He said that this country was too long depending on the British market, where there was no security, and that he was going to take it off that market.  The Minister for Finance said that we were too long feeding John Bull and he would take us off it.  These things represent, not an accidental result of the economic war, they represent the considered policy of Fianna Fáil.  When <Col N="366" /> the Executive Council put into execution their economic war policy, that brought ruination to this country, the Minister for Agriculture stood in the same dumb position that he is in to-day.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows they have not rid us of 92 millions, but he is callous to our interests.  We were to have some wonderful alternatives from the Fianna Fáil Party when they were looking for our votes.  I maintain that the Fianna Fáil Party did not get a mandate for the economic war.  The Fianna Fáil Party asked our votes in order to enable them to put an end to the economic war.  They told us that the way to end the economic war was to vote Fianna Fáil.  Was that straight dealing I ask?  I agree it is good enough for us.  All this time that the Minister for Finance said that he had rid himself of this burden of 92 millions he did not say that he had rid us of it.  On the contrary, we are paying it on the double and on the treble, and the Minister for Finance knows that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am one of the farmers who have to work, and I have made a success of my own place.  I do not run away from my responsibilities as a farmer, or in politics or in anything else.  I am not one of those who went out and told the people one thing and did quite another thing.  I stand over what I said, and will always do so if I possibly can.  When the Fianna Fáil Party were looking for the <Col N="368" /> suffrages of the people they told us that there was to be greater prosperity for the farmers and the shopkeepers, greater employment and work for all. What steps did the Minister for Agriculture take to bring about that state of affairs?  I am trying to keep as near as I can to the Estimate, and I do not know whether it is quite in order to discuss, to such a wide extent, the policy of Fianna Fáil.  But everyone who has spoken has done it. Fianna Fáil asked for the suffrages of the people on the distinct understanding that if they got them the farmers would get better prices for their produce.  Shopkeepers were to have better sales, and as a result of all these wonders, more employment was to be given.  Yet we find that the only result is that the farmers have lost not only 40 or 50 per cent. of their prices, but much more of their income. The Minister for Agriculture comes in here to introduce his Estimate, and does not say one solitary word about the alternative activities which he and his Party were supposed to have in mind for the farmers of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened during the Fianna Fáil regime?  We hear a lot from the Fianna Fáil Party about the bottom having fallen out of the British market.  But notwithstanding that the bottom has fallen out of the British market, and that it is not worth looking after, we find from the Board of Trade figures this year that, comparing April this year with April of 1932, notwithstanding the disabilities of tariffs and everything else and the goodwill we lost in the British market, there were practically 4,000 more cattle exported to Britain in April 1933 than in April, 1932.  But what was the price that we got for the cattle sold in April, 1933, as against the cattle sold in April, 1932?  The price was £299,000 less in 1933 than in 1932.  That is what Fianna Fáil has brought us to.  The Minister for Agriculture has no alternative to that.  He has not even stood up here when introducing this Vote and recommended his wheat policy, the policy by which he advised the people of this country to grow wheat at 23/6 a barrel. When the Minister was a member of the Wheat Commission, and when <Col N="369" /> President de Valera was also a member of that Commission, they thought that the farmers of the country could not be asked to grow wheat at less than 32/6 a barrel.  At that time we could have grown wheat for nothing in comparison with now.  Now we have no profit on our live-stock trade.  We are losing on it, and yet we are supposed to be able to live and make a profit on growing wheat at 23/6 a barrel&mdash;the wheat that some people, apparently, will not grow, according to somebody in the House recently.  I have not got that to say.  What has happened with regard to the pig industry&mdash;the industry about which the Minister has become a little alarmed?  Taking the first 18 weeks in the years 1931, 1932 and 1933, we find that the number of pigs bought in this country for that period in 1932, either for home curing or for export, was 12,000 less than it was in 1931, and that, in that period in 1933, it was 56,000 less.  There is no explanation offered by the Minister and there is no alternative offered to the people. The Minister comes into this House and sits here in silence and waits to hear what is being said without saying any word whatever in extenuation of his policy which has brought such poverty and such ruination on this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith, some time ago, spoke about &ldquo;the usual whine&rdquo; from these benches.  It is a pity that Deputy Smith would not read the usual whine we were accustomed to from these same benches when Fianna Fáil was in opposition.  Is it not a wonder that Deputy Smith, or some of his fellow-Deputies, would not try to get down to the Estimate, to the Department of Agriculture, to what their policy has brought to this country and what remedies they were going to offer us? It is of no advantage to this House, and, I think, it is of very little interest, to hear what Deputy Smith thinks of Deputy McGovern or what the voters in Cavan did with regard to Deputy Smith's third preference votes.  That has absolutely no interest for the rest of us, but it would be interesting to hear from Deputy Smith what he thought the Fianna Fáil policy was going to do for the farmers.  He said <Col N="370" /> that they had a mandate to come in here and carry out their policy.  Their policy, so far, has had only one result, and neither Deputy Smith nor the Minister has endeavoured to tell us what they are going to give us as an alternative.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about turf.  I think that that matter will answer itself and does not call for any comment from me.  Deputy Cleary said yesterday that he was speaking on behalf of the small farmers of Connaught and he said that there was no man in this House or in the country who would try to bring back the 200-acre farm as an economic proposition.  What struck me very forcibly in that matter was whether Deputy Cleary represented the ordinary mentality of the farmer element of Fianna Fáil.  Has he given any thought to the matter at all?  As a matter of fact, the 200-acre farmer is not the man who has got the worst of this war at all.  I know 200-acre people who sold their cattle at a dead loss at the beginning of the economic war, but they bought at very bad prices and they are selling at a reasonable profit now, but the men whom Deputy Cleary thought he was representing, the people who rear young calves, who have the young stock, the producers, those are the people who are getting the real stroke in the economic war.  They are the real small farmers and, to my mind, if the economic war continues, the 200-acre farmer has a much better chance of surviving than the small farmer.  He is not in the same category at all.</P>
    <P>Then, again, we have the Minister either agreeing or sitting as silent as he has sat here when the Government tells the country that there is only one market for it&mdash;the home market. The Executive Council then proceeds to cut the salaries of the non-producers in this market so that the purchasing power will be reduced, and so that this market will be further depressed.  Yet the Minister sits as silent as he has sat here to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <P>Or votes for it. There is all this inconsistency while <Col N="371" /> the country is becoming poorer and poorer.  A long while ago, the Napoleon of the Bourbons made the remark: &ldquo;They have learned nothing and they have forgotten nothing.&rdquo; That seems to be the position of Fianna Fáil.  There is absolutely no chance in the world of this country making any progress industrially unless the farming community is put on its feet and kept on its feet.  The prosperity of the agricultural community is absolutely the first essential to industrial prosperity, and if the Government lose sight of that one fundamental fact they cannot expect any progress.  The investing public in this country, at all times, have been the people who are, in some shape or form, dependent on the farming community, and the extraordinary thing about it is that we find the President of the Executive Council and members of his Cabinet complaining of people in this country not investing their money in local enterprise and industry.  What money? Where have they got the money? The farmers are not able to pay their accounts and the shopkeepers are running out of funds.  The Minister knows that as well as I do; it is no news to him.  What is he going to do about it?  What is his alternative to the present position?  It is not 40 per cent. that the people are losing on their live stock at present.  Like Deputy Kelly, who told us about meeting a lady who met somebody who had met somebody else, I happened the other day to be travelling in the train with three of the most prominent cattle buyers in this country.  They were coming from a fair, and one of them told me of 22 cattle he had bought at £7 10/- each. They were aged cattle and they were bought off stall at £7 10/- each. Those cattle cost the owner £9, 11 months before.  He had put them on stall and had fattened them and he got £7 10/- each for them.  I said to the man: &ldquo;You must have robbed that man; you got them unfairly,&rdquo; but he said, &ldquo;No, each of those is going to cost me £6 a head to put them across and £3 in feeding and freight.</P>

      <P>The Minister talks about bounties saving the situation.  I have very little faith in bounties.  I suppose they do a certain amount of good, and that there is no use trying to discredit them.  I think many Fianna Fáil Deputies, who are farmers, will agree with me that bounties are of very little use when paying rent. Whatever good bounties were up to this, according to the new plan which the Minister for Finance has devised for finding the money for them, they are going to be of much less use to the country in the future.  The bounty system is about the best illustration there can be of feeding a dog on its tail.  We are paying for the bounty, and then we are supposed to get the money back.  I say that the people are not getting their money back. Others say that they are getting a very little of it back.  In his Budget speech the Minister for Finance brought in new proposals on behalf of agriculture and proposed to pay £2,500,000 by way of bounties in order to deal with the economic war.  The Minister stated that an asset on which he was going to borrow had been created by the economic war&mdash;the asset being the deferred annuity payments.  The Minister for Finance got away with that.  The Minister knows very well that he cannot borrow on an item like that.  If he borrows at all he must borrow on the credit of the country. The Government is not going to borrow to pay the bounties, in other words, to feed the dog on its own tail, because the dog has the tail eaten off now. They are not going to borrow to get the dog more tails.  They will pay him <Col N="373" /> off with his life blood.  That is the new system.  There could hardly be anything more eloquent in this matter than the Minister's silence.  Anything I could say would not be as eloquent as the Minister's silence.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister for Agriculture realises just as acutely as anyone else the present position in this country.  He realises that the farmers cannot continue, and that agriculture cannot continue in its present position.  Something must happen. I have a certain amount of sympathy for the Minister for Agriculture, not that he appreciates it.  I cannot help having sympathy for him, considering that in the present world depression the position under any circumstances was going to be one of fighting for existence, fighting for the top.  Conditions have become so bad, by the policy of Fianna Fáil, that it is really a puzzle to the Minister to know what to do, or to know what he can do.  If I was in the Minister's position I would feel very humiliated.  I suppose he will try to make some excuse.  I will be very interested to know what remedy the Minister has.  I hope he will make some attempt to deal with the situation.  I have at least this much faith in the Minister that I believe he is honest.  I am sure Deputy Kelly is glad to hear me saying that, because the Deputy stated recently that it was a pity people on the Opposition Benches would not give to those on the Government Benches the credit of having good intentions.  I would like to remind Deputy Kelly of what a famous figure in European history said and I would recommend it to Fianna Fáil: &ldquo;Here lies a man who, with the best of intentions, never achieved anything.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have been accused by certain members of the Opposition of doing the rather unprecedented thing of introducing this Estimate without making a <Col N="374" /> speech.  I think I have been amply justified by the speeches we heard from the opposite benches.  I knew very well what was going to be said on this Vote, and I knew that we would hear about the economic war, in order to try to break the morale of the people.  Deputies talked about a settlement of the economic war and pretended that they would like to see a successful settlement.  They do not want to see a successful settlement, because they know very well that a successful settlement means the end of Cumann na nGaedheal and the Centre Party in this country.  They took the opportunity to point out to the British Government, all the time, that the farmers were suffering, and that they could not stand it very much longer. They tried to hold that hope out in order that British Ministers might feel that if they held out a little longer they were going to beat us, and if the British Ministers could beat us, Cumann na nGaedheal and the Centre Party would come back strong and it did not matter about the country. That is the attitude they adopted. They did not want to see a successful issue of the economic war, because if they did, they would not have gone on with that kind of talk.  Deputy Brennan said that we went out at the last election and told the people that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power there would be an end to the economic war.  Would there be?  Does not everyone see, after the speeches that were made by Deputy Brennan, Deputy Belton, Deputy McGovern and others that if we had been thrown out by the electors at the last election there would be an end to the economic war and that the British Government would get&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brodrick raised some points on the Estimate.  He asked about the technical staff officers in the Gaeltacht.  The Deputy was quite right when he stated that £120 was voted last year for this service, and that nothing is provided this year. Before I came into office last year it was considered that it might be necessary to appoint additional poultry overseers. It was not found necessary to do so by the Department, and, as the Deputy will observe, the money was not spent.  It was put down as a Token Vote and is removed this year.  The Deputy also asked about sub-head M4 being reduced, and complained that although we were advocating a policy of increased tillage we were at the same time cutting down the allowance for machinery.  That is not right.  The reduction in this Estimate has been made principally for stallions and premium bulls.  The amount for hand-spraying machinery has increased by £200, and for agricultural implements is increased by the same amount.  Up <Col N="376" /> to recently the Agricultural Credit Corporation only sanctioned loans for implements down to £50.</P>
      <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation loan came down to £50, and the Department of Agriculture loan went up to £50.  Now, the Agricultural Credit Corporation goes down to £30, so the Department need not give a higher loan than £30 for any of those purposes.  With regard to sub-head G. 2, he also complained that although we had reduced the grants to milk testing associations we had increased the payment to the supervisors.  That, of course, is because the Department has really undertaken a greater share of the cost of those schemes, and the members have to pay less than they did previously.  Instead of the Department, as Deputy Broderick thought, giving less encouragement in this direction they are, as a matter of fact, giving more encouragement.  With regard to the Clifden Rural Domestic Economy School it was mentioned that there was a complaint at the County Committee in Galway with regard to the teaching of Irish there. I cannot answer that at the moment, but I have taken a note of it.</P>
      <P>Another matter was raised by Deputy Roddy in connection with sub-head M 5.  He says that for this very useful scheme for the improvement of the creamery industry we have reduced our Estimate by something like £85,000.  As a matter of fact we have increased it.  Last year it was £146,500.  Out of that £146,500, £112,000 went to pay losses on the Dairy Disposals Board that were incurred during my predecessor's term of office.  I had the magnanimity, when I came into office, to wipe out the debts incurred by my predecessor, and I have now started off with a clean sheet.  That £112,000 that was voted last year was to clear off those debts.  When we deduct that £112,000 we have an Estimate of £64,000 this year, as against £34,000 last year.  I think there was nothing else asked on the sub-heads.</P>

      <P>Loss on resale of stallions; that is not an ordinary trading loss.  The stallions are bought at the best possible price we can get them for, but they are invariably sold to the purchaser at what would be considered a reasonable price for the purchaser.  As far as we can go back into the history of the Department since the Free State was established that has been the practice.  It is not an ordinary trading loss through bad judgment on the part of the buyer.  It is a subsidy, if you like, to the purchaser.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keyes asked a question also about Irish-made keels and kegs.  I promised, as Deputy Keyes said, to try to encourage this industry, but I found on investigation that I had no power to make regulations that, say, butter for the home market should be put into keels and kegs, and that butter for the foreign market should be put into pyramid boxes.  Members will realise that the market we had in Great Britain was for pyramid boxes and not for keels and kegs, but that on the other hand, the market we have been succeeding in getting on the Continent is a market for keels and kegs. To that extent, the demand for keels and kegs has been growing.  As a matter of fact what Deputy Keyes said may be true, that there are at present only two coopers working in Limerick; but I had a letter from the manufacturer towards the end of last year and he told me that his 14 coopers were working overtime.  The question is rather involved in that way, that under the present Creamery Acts I have no power to prescribe one type of container for the home market and another for the export market.  I must prescribe the same for them all. The matter is involved in many other ways, and, as Deputies know, the whole question of keels, kegs, barrels, and containers has been referred to the Tariff Commission.  We hope to have a report from them on the position before very long.  I do not think there will be very much delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To go back on what was said in other directions, Deputy Dillon opened the debate when the Estimate was introduced.  I thought, as a matter <Col N="378" /> of fact, that it spoke rather badly for the Opposition to have Deputy Dillon opening the debate on this Estimate.  However, he did not consider it very much, except that he complained that the Fianna Fáil Benches were empty while he was speaking, which I thought was a tribute to the good sense of this Party.  He spoke in the usual A to Z fashion.</P>

      <P>No, there is quite a number here.  In any case, I do not require them here.  I am speaking principally for the benefit of the Opposition.  Deputy Dillon spoke, as I say, in the usual A to Z fashion.  He knows everything about every subject that comes up.  He himself said here several times: &ldquo;I know this subject from A to Z.&rdquo;  The peculiar thing was that when Deputy Hogan began asking him a few questions he said that those were things which should not be discussed in this House. When asked to get down to details he was not prepared to face the issues. He said they could be discussed outside the House, but not here.  His boast about A to Z was shattered in a few moments.  I do not think there was anything else worth while raised by Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bennett opened his speech with the usual accusation made by Deputy Brennan and others, that this Executive Council, of which I am a member, were responsible for the economic war; that is to say, that Great Britain had no part in or responsibility for it.</P>

I admit that it suits the Opposition to do so, but I would ask them to try to be a little bit patriotic and keep it to themselves and if they want to send the information to Mr. Thomas, at least to send it by registered post and not broadcast it all over the country, because it will come against them some time.</P>

    <P>Deputy Bennett, as I say, said that the Executive Council was responsible for the economic war and I have got, I think, general agreement from the other side now&mdash;both from the Centre Party and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party&mdash;that all the blame lies on us and that no blame whatsoever attaches to the British Government. As a matter of fact, Deputy MacDermot went further and said not only that the blame lay on us but that we were dishonest.  The British Government, of course, according to him, were honourable, as usual, in all their undertakings, and we were responsible for the whole thing.  The British Government, according to Deputy MacDermot, had no responsibility. Then, Deputy MacDermot commenced to point out Britain's case. He said that against the £5,000,000 which we claim, that, if ever it comes to a conference the British could claim £1,000,000 from the land stock holders, £750,000 in respect of the R.I.C. Pensions Fund and £2,000,000 in respect of the ex-Army men.  In other words, he made up a bill of £3,750,000 as against the £5,000,000; and if Deputy MacDermot were the chairman of this <Col N="381" /> tribunal or conference I have no doubt that he would say: &ldquo;Ireland is paying £1,250,000 more than England but, after all, you have to take into consideration the dishonourable and dishonest attitude of the Irish people in this matter and it is only fair that Ireland should pay the total.&rdquo;</P>

That was all we objected to as far as that is concerned.  Deputy Hogan spoke on this Estimate.</P>

Deputy Hogan, who appeared in this House&mdash; having summoned up the courage, I suppose, to come here three or four months after the election&mdash;had the confounded cheek to talk about the Fianna Fáil attendance or lack of attendance.  Deputy Hogan, who had not the courage to appear since the results of the last election were declared, comes here three or four months afterwards and goes on to talk about prices, and he supports his contention on the question of prices by saying that he knows what he <Col N="382" /> is talking about.  He talks about lambs selling at £1 a head, and that last year they were selling at 36/- a head.  I wonder where he got the information that lambs were selling at 36/- a head last year?

      <P>Deputy Hogan said another thing.  He said: &ldquo;We hear nothing about agricultural tariffs now.&rdquo;  Of course not, but if they are taken off you will hear plenty about them.  Take the tariff off butter and you will hear a lot about it.  Deputy Hogan says that we hear nothing about tariffs now, but take off the tariff and the prohibition on imported butter and you will have Australian butter coming in here at 80/- a cwt. Perhaps the Dublin people will get it cheaper; 80/- a cwt. would be about 9d. a lb., but surely the wholesaler and the retailer have to get something out of it and that would probably mean that it would be sold at 11d. a lb. here.  Where would the creameries come in in that case, and where would the farmers who supply the creameries come in, if we take the prohibition and the tariff off?  Where would we be if we allowed Polish bacon to come in at 27/- a cwt.?  There is talk about mutton and lamb.  There is a tariff of 6d. a lb. on mutton and lamb and, in in spite of that, New Zealand lamb came in a month ago and paid 56/- a cwt., and it was sold here in the Dublin shops.  The same applies to poultry, about which some Deputies talked so much.  If these Deputies only examined the position they would find that poultry was getting more for the last three months than it had been getting in the last three years.  That was due to the tariff, because we allowed no Russian or Chinese or other kinds of chickens to come in. The same applies, as Deputy Corry said, to barley.  Deputy Corry was right when he said that the farmers here were getting 14/- and 15/- for their barley, while in the Six Counties and in Britain they were getting only about 9/-.</P>

      <P>While we are at rhubarb, we may as well dispose of it.  I remember Deputy Belton telling us how a tariff should be imposed.  He wanted to illustrate the point that it was dangerous to put a tariff on overnight, because you might hit the consumer. But when the British put the tariffs on overnight they always hit us; according to Deputy Belton, they did not hit the consumers at all.  Deputy Belton talked about people going to the Minister and asking him for a tariff on rhubarb next November.  I think that implies that he did not know there was a tariff.  I said on that occasion: &ldquo;Is the Deputy aware that there has been a tariff on rhubarb for 12 months?&rdquo; Deputy Belton said: &ldquo;I did not get time to answer, but it will be interesting to the Minister to know that I, and not the Minister, was responsible for that tariff, because I was behind the deputation that put the case up to him.&rdquo;  There was no deputation to put the case up to me.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's observations in relation to wheat show his extraordinary ignorance of the whole subject.  That was more than I expected from Deputy Belton.  I thought he knew something about wheat but he evidently does not.  His whole contention is that we have not got a variety of hard milling wheat for bakers' bread.  Evidently Deputy Belton is not aware of the fact that two-thirds of the flour of this country is used as household flour and is entirely composed of soft wheat.  That is just the type of wheat we grow in this country.  We can go ahead with our wheat scheme and be content that we have a market for two-thirds of our entire supply&mdash;the soft wheat that we can grow more successfully than they can grow it in Canada.  We can get double the amount per acre than they can in Canada.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take bakers' flour.  One would imagine, listening to Deputy Belton, that bakers' flour is composed of all hard wheat.  That is not the case.  It is composed of 60 per cent. hard wheat and 40 per cent. soft wheat.  That means that until we reach 650,000 acres of wheat we need not grow hard wheat at all.  We have all the necessary soft wheat here.  Deputy Belton alleges that we are going ahead without thinking of strains.  He is really speaking in ignorance of the whole subject.  The strains we have are all right.  We have the strains we want.  We have the soft <Col N="387" /> wheat that is being used to the extent of two-thirds in the household and to the extent of 40 per cent. in bakers' flour.  We have some hard wheat also that can be used in bakers' flour.</P>

Then there is a report underneath from the baker who made the flour into bread.  He said it formed a loaf which had sufficient glutin to make the loaf rise in a proper way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the result of an experiment recommended by a conference of the Committees of Agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I did not want to say it, but the Minister asked the question.  The conference met in the chamber of the Dublin County Council and I, as Chairman of the Dublin County Committee of Agriculture, called the conference together at a time when the Minister and his colleagues would not recognise this <Col N="388" /> House.  We recommended that to the Department.  The Secretary to the Department was at the Conference, with Dr. Hinchcliff, Mr. O'Connell and a few others, and it was finally recommended to the Minister for Finance at the time.  We asked for £300 to carry through the experiment.  The experiment was that an acre of wheat be grown, seeded with Yeoman, in each county in the Free State.  I agree with the Minister that the object of our experiment was successful.  The object of the experiment was not as regards quantity but to ascertain in how many counties and how widely apart this hard wheat could be grown.  The experiment demonstrated that in every county in the Free State a good grain could be grown.  The pamphlet referred to, the report of the Department, and the experiments generally show that.  The fault in this strain of wheat is that it is not suitable for economic cultivation in this country.  We were out to demonstrate if it could be grown. The glutin was a little less than in the best Manitoba.  Mr. Odlum, Mr. Shackleton and Mr. Browne were the three bakers responsible for milling and baking the bread.  I ate some of the bread.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only fair to say that as a result of that experiment it was found that it is an economic proposition to grow Yeoman, too.  The Minister said that if he had time&mdash;he has the Secretary to the Department at his elbow&mdash;he could get in ten minutes the leaflet issued by the Department.  If he had told me about it yesterday I could have produced it for him to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have it admitted, at any rate, that the soft wheat grown in this country can be grown up to about 650,000 acres.  In the meantime we will consider the question with regard to the hard wheat.  Deputy Belton says we cannot grow it. Deputy Belton says that we have only a lecturer on plant breeding in the university, and that we should have a professor instead.  Everyone admits that the man who holds the lectureship is the best we could get.  I do not think that changing a lectureship into a professorship is going to make very much difference.  That is the kind of criticism we are getting.  The suggestion is that if we cannot breed suitable wheat under a lectureship then we should have a professorship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Canada they are going much further north now as a result of the breeding experiments carried out.  The Deputy said that as a result of that they ought to be able to realise in Canada probably 100,000,000 dollars more for their wheat.  He was talking, I think, of 1928.  What would the figure be now? I should say that the gain to them now would be about 20,000,000 dollars, and they have no economic war there. That is the point I want to bring out. The change in values is due to world prices and not to an economic war. The position, therefore, is that what was worth 100,000,000 dollars in 1928 is now worth 20,000,000 dollars.  If Deputy Brennan was a member of the Canadian Parliament he would be <Col N="390" /> kicking up a terrible row and saying that the economic war was the cause of the drop in value.</P>

      <P>In slaughter houses in America they keep an old sheep for leading cattle in to be slaughtered. When the cattle go through to be slaughtered the sheep goes out.  Deputy Belton says he brought us in here, but he went out himself.  I want now to deal with the speech of Deputy Mulcahy.  He said that I should listen to the complaints made by farmers at their meetings throughout the country. I am told that Deputy Mulcahy is the most active man in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party; in fact, that he complains of the amount of work that is thrown on him.  I know all that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party have done to work up meetings throughout the country in order to have complaints made, to pass protest resolutions and so on.  We see a good deal about that in the newspapers.  I was not impressed by a lot of what went on at those meetings, because I know how the thing was worked up.  As a matter of fact it is dying off a bit now. People are beginning to see through it. They are beginning to see through the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and the Centre Party.  I have been speaking to farmers about this. They told me they now realise that if that kind of thing had stopped long ago the economic war would have been ended by now.  These people are not <Col N="391" /> interested in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party again coming back to power, or in the Centre Party, or even in Fianna Fáil.  What they want is to see the question settled, and they are going to remain quiet in future, no matter what advice they get from Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy said that butter was selling in the Free State at 1/4 per lb. and at 9d. in London.  I would like to know more about the philanthropic wholesalers and retailers who are selling butter in London at the price they pay for it.  Australian butter is selling in London at 82s. per cwt.  Does anybody think that Australian butter, after passing through the hands of wholesalers, retailers, and being made up in pounds is going to be retailed at the price paid for it to the importers?  The figures that the Deputy gave are like a lot of figures we get from that side of the House, absolute nonsense, but now and again we are able to catch them out.  Deputy Mulcahy also said that the output of Irish agriculture consumed in the Free State was value for in or about £11,000,000.  I would like to know where he got that figure.  He said that our exports of butter were worth at one time 4½ millions.  They were never worth that under Cumann na nGaedheal government.  As a matter of fact they were never worth that except &ldquo;in the good old days&rdquo; when the British Government were here, and some of the people opposite would like to see them back again.  At the time the Cumann na nGaedheal Government came into office the value of these exports was reduced very substantially, and by the time we came in the figure was down to £2,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>By the end of the year we will see.  Deputy Roddy says there are savings of £100,000 but that is after wiping out the losses made by my predecessor under the Dairy Disposals Board.  He says that there is <Col N="392" /> need for a reorganisation of the creamery industry in Sligo and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The same point was made by Deputy Kent and Deputy Corry in regard to East Cork.  We are very anxious to reorganise the whole creamery industry if we think we are going to be helpful to the industry.  Usually when we bring in a Bill or proposals such as these before the Dáil we have the cry of &ldquo;interference&rdquo; from the Opposition and we are told that the Government should not interfere in these matters. We agree that we should interfere as little as possible.  If we take Sligo as an example, possibly very much good would be done to the industry if the creameries were reorganised so that there would be two or three or four economic units.  Unless that can be done we do not see the use of spending money on such a scheme.</P>
      <P>The only distance we could get in Sligo at present is to organise one group at the cost of a few thousand pounds and leave the rest as they are. We do not see the use of doing that. East Cork is in a different position. Deputy Kent said that promises were made in East Cork by Fianna Fáil that if we were returned creameries would be built.  That is possibly true, because the Department had surveyed the area in East Cork.  We intended to see if it was possible to improve the position by the erection of creameries.  We have not dropped this question by any means.  As a matter of fact, I think part of that scheme will be proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>How soon does the Minister think they will be built? Considering that at Castlelyons creamery they have to deal with 11,000 gallons of milk, the need for these creameries is very urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing we have to try to do is to get the co-operative creameries to erect auxiliaries.  That method does not succeed sometimes.  To a small extent it has in East Cork.  There are two auxiliaries being attached to a co-operative creamery there.  There has been another type of scheme in County Clare, where the Dairy <Col N="393" /> Disposals Board built a whole group attached to one central creamery. Having got them working economically, they hope to hand them over to the suppliers and the co-operative concern after some time.  These two ways are being considered.  I could not say for the moment whether it will be necessary to resort to the second method.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

We want to know now when that scheme is going ahead without any more nonsense about it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Roddy said that the Danes would not allow any sentimental nonsense to stand in the way of any trade agreement with Britain. I am sure they would not.  Neither would we, but £5,000,000 a year is no nonsense.  I think if it were put to Denmark that they could get an agreement with Britain provided they handed over £5,000,000 a year they would not want the agreement.  They would not consider it sentimental <Col N="394" /> nonsense, and if they were asked to come in as part of the British Empire they might not be so anxious for an agreement.</P>

That is the longest lease we got since we came into power.  A Deputy of the Centre Party gave them only one or two months. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that next harvest would finish it.  When the economic war was started in June or July last we were told that October would see the end of it.  When it came to October, things had not become so bad perhaps as they had hoped and they said that Christmas would finish it.  When it came to Christmas things were not as bad as they had hoped and they said that in Spring the farmers would not be able to sow their crops. Now that we have got over the Spring they hope that next harvest will finish it, but their hopes are all in vain.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kent made another observation.  He said that we should have veterinary inspectors to <Col N="395" /> examine calves going into the market, because many of these calves were spreading disease.  I should like to hear the sarcastic remarks of the deputy leader of Deputy Kent's Party on that question.  When I brought in a motion here dealing with the pig and bacon industry, he made a speech about my trying to interfere, by veterinary inspection, with bacon factories. He said that I was going to interfere with bacon factories by appointing veterinary inspectors to visit them.  I did not know what interest he had in farms or in bacon factories at the time he made his speech.  I believe he had some visitors in the gallery, but he objected to my interference with bacon factories by veterinary inspection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have power to examine them but their powers are limited in that respect.  Deputy O'Sullivan next contributed to the debate.  His contention was that we, by our policy, were likely to increase <Col N="396" /> the number of live stock in the country and at same time were destroying the market for that live stock.  I have been accused of not seeing that point some time ago, that an increase of tillage will increase live stock.  At all events, Deputy Brennan was one of the men who said that I only saw the point lately.  I know very well Deputy Brennan never read the report of the committee on wheat on which he sat in 1928.  He put his name to it without reading it.  That is obvious now.  In that report there is a reference to it.  We referred to it in our Minority Report and we pointed out as plainly as could be that an extension of tillage by way of wheat growing or anything else would inevitably lead to an increase in the number of live stock.  I signed that report.  I always suspected that Deputy Brennan never read the report, but I am quite sure of it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to follow the reasoning of Deputy O'Sullivan, because his was the most able contribution to this debate.  I pay him that tribute.  He said we were embarking on a policy of growing more grain which would lead to the production of more live stock and, at the same time, that we were killing the market for live stock.  We set out on this policy in this way: We were importing things such as maize, wheat and flour.  We say: &ldquo;There are things we can at least give our own farmers a market for and, what is more, we can make such regulations as will give our farmers a good market for them.  We can fix the price of wheat at any price we think the farmers should get.&rdquo;  We cannot do that when we have an exportable surplus. That is how we started on the problem.  We say: &ldquo;Let us grow all the feeding stuffs for which we have a market.&rdquo;  Why should we be supporting farmers in Minnesota and the Argentine when we have our own farmers to do it?  We can grow the quantity of grain which we have been importing.  If we only grow the amount we have been importing, I presume we will not increase our live stock; because, if we did increase our live stock, we would have to grow more grain than we have been importing. That may be disputed.  It does not matter very much to the argument, however.  Suppose we did go beyond the amount of grain required to replace the imports, and we did increase live stock, then we would be up against the question of marketing.  Whatever market we get, whether the British market or the Continental market or the home market, what we produce does not matter very much, as our production is a very small proportion of the world production.  If we produce 20 per cent. more mutton than we have been producing; 50 per cent. more bacon, or 50 per cent. more cattle as a result of this policy, it makes very little difference in the world supplies. If we put the produce into England, France or Belgium, and if we put in 5 or 10 per cent. more, we will not influence the price, if we have a foreign market at all.  At any rate, whatever success we may have with regard to <Col N="398" /> foreign marketing, we are not going to make a difference anywhere by having a little more cattle, pigs or sheep. The question of marketing is a different problem.  I want to make it clear that we, at least, by increasing tillage, and as a result increasing our live stock output, are not making matters any worse as a result of that policy alone.  Now take the marketing. The home market, of course, is not insignificant.  For instance, if you take bacon, mutton, poultry, and all the milk products, it consumes well over 50 per cent. of our output.  As a matter of fact, in bacon it goes up to 85 or 90 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The average output for the last ten years will take that.  We will consume about 1,000,000 pigs on the home market and the average output, I think, is not more than 1,200,000.  I am only quoting these figures from memory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The average over ten years.  I say the home market is not insignificant.  However, we require foreign markets and that is a separate problem.  We admit that we require foreign markets because we believe that we will always require to import certain things if we are to have a high standard of living.  Some people want tea; some want coffee and some silks, etc.  Then we want steel and other things, and we must export something to pay for them.  For that reason alone, we must export something, and the easiest thing appears to be to export agricultural produce.  That will be a benefit to the producers if they get good foreign markets.  We require foreign markets and we hope to get them.  As to the economic war, I have already dealt with that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was not in the House when I was dealing with that.  I say this, however, that whatever Deputies opposite may think about the British market, or whatever encouragement they may wish to give to the British Government on this question, I do not consider the British market worth £5,000,000 per year as a free gift to Great Britain.  The proposition of Cumann na nGaedheal and Centre Party Deputies, whatever they may think about it themselves, amounts to this &ldquo;Settle this question, pay over the £5,000,000 per year; and get us our market back.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There has been only one cry in this House from Deputies opposite for the last ten months, &ldquo;Give us back our market&rdquo;.  The Centre Party put up a policy at the last election.  Deputy Belton claimed to have started it and then they put him out.  They said they were going to come in here with the balance of power and rule this Dáil.  Just imagine what the Dáil and the country would be like if they had the balance of power!  What policy have they? I never heard a single word of policy from them on anything since the last election except, &ldquo;Give us back our market&rdquo;.  They never contributed an idea on any subject that arose. God help this country if the Centre Party had the balance of power. Deputy Belton did well to leave that Party.</P>
