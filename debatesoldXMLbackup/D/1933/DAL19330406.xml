    <Title>Ceisteanna.&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Flour Duty in Donegal.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state why certain bakers in County Donegal are allowed to import flour duty free, while others in that county are refused permits to import under the same circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has recommended the issue of licences enabling Donegal bakers to import flour free of duty only in two cases and in exceptional circumstances.  Licences have not been issued in any case in which my Department was satisfied that Saorstát milled flour was readily procurable.  Special arrangements have been made with the Irish Flour Millers' Association for the supply of flour to County Donegal and the issue of licences in the future is very unlikely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I should like to ask him, firstly, if he is aware that one of the licensees is retailing some of the flour that he has been permitted to import for the purpose of baking and, secondly, if I place in his hands facts to show that other persons exactly similarly circumstanced have sought permits and have been refused them, will he take steps to get permits granted to them and to have such duty as they have been obliged to pay, as a result of his refusal, refunded to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, the answer is in the negative.  As regards the second <Col N="2392" /> part I would direct the Deputy's attention to the reply I have given to him, that in consequence of the arrangements made with the Irish Flour Millers' Association it is most unlikely that any permits will be issued in future.  In each case where an application for a permit was received the Flour Millers' Association was consulted. Only where it is clear that Sáorstat flour is not procurable, or that other exceptional circumstances operate to necessitate it, is a licence issued.  In fact only two licences were issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If I bring to the Minister's notice circumstances exactly similar to those of the merchant in Dungloe, who received a permit to import flour under licence, will he see that the duty is refunded to persons who were axactly similarly circumstanced and were refused permits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If these persons applied for permits the Deputy's information is, I am certain, incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister if I place certain facts in his hands will he take steps to redress what is contrary to equity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has information I shall examine it, but I am quite certain he has not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will place it in the Minister's hands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>addressed the following questions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If he will state the owners or the names and the town or other district of location of each of the eight factories for concrete products stated by him in his statement of the 13th January last to have been opened since March, 1932.</P>
      <P>If he will state the owners or the names and the town or other district of location of each of the four new factories for builders' woodwork stated by him in his statement of the 13th January last to have been opened since March, 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2393" /> If he will state the different classes of manufactures for which new factories have been opened since his statement of the 13th January last and the owner and town or other district of location of the additional factories which have been opened in each class since that date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to Nos. 2, 3, and 4 together.  I would refer the Deputy to my reply to similar questions which he addressed to me yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In what way is No. 4 involved in that reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of opinion that Deputies anxious to procure information as to the industrial position in the Saorstát should await the publication of the information which will be contained in the Directory of Manufacturers so that they will get a complete picture and not a partial picture arising out of the publication of information of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that we in this House and the people generally are not only concerned with getting a picture as to the whole position with regard to manufactures in the Free State but we are concerned with seeing what additions to the factories are being made as a result of the industrial policy that is being pursued?  Will the Minister say in what way will his new Directory give us information as to increases in manufacturing industries in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to the Deputy that the most substantial development takes the form of additions to existing factories.  A reply to his question would give no information on that score at all.  Information concerning the location of factories is one part of the picture. Information concerning the output in each industry will be available when the annual census of industrial work is published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the question <Col N="2394" /> of location an important part of the matter considering the policy of the Government in the matter of the distribution of industries throughout the country?  The Minister said that it was undesirable to give the information asked for, information as to the location, etc., having regard to the interests of the firms concerned and the interests of other firms in the same industry.  Will the Minister say in what way the interests, say, of the four factories for builders' woodwork could be affected prejudicially with reference to any others in the industry by letting us know where geographically these four industries are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no objection to giving a reply to a question directed to procuring information as to the location of the new factories.  If the Deputy puts down a question seeking information I shall endeavour to get him information on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, having put down one already with regard to upholstery, he declined to give the name of the owners, but gave me the location, two in Dublin and one in Navan?  I understood from him yesterday that he was declining to give even that information in respect to the questions down on the Paper.  I would like to know whether he still declines to do that or will he review his attitude and will he, in respect to the questions put down on the Paper, give us the information as to the location of the new factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider what answer can be given to any question the Deputy tables, but I would strongly urge the advisability of waiting until the full report, which will give complete information, will be available.</P>

    <P>6.  The sums paid into the Purchase Annuities Fund Suspense Account were appropriated on 31st March, 1933, as Miscellaneous Revenue pursuant to the Land (Purchase Annuities Fund) Act, 1933.  The sums paid into the other Accounts were repaid, during the period from 20th to 29th March, to the accounts at the Paymaster-General's Office of the several services from which they had been drawn, thus reducing by equivalent amounts the Exchequer issues for those services in the said period.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, I would like to ask if he does not consider it is turning the procedure of this House into a farce that the Minister responsible for the Department should have answered me last September that he was going to open the Crolly factory immediately; that he answered me again, in December, that he was going to open it immediately; that the Parliamentary Secretary answered me six weeks ago that he was going to open the factory at Crolly immediately and he now tells me that certain proposals are under consideration in connection with the building at Crolly? Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that Crolly is in the centre of one of the hardest hit areas in the whole of County Donegal, and one of the poorest?  Is he further aware there are varieties of knitwear which cannot be had from the Gaeltacht Depôt?  I have tried unsuccessfully to get certain varieties from them.  Is he further aware that there are hundreds of young women in that area of County Donegal ready and willing to do the work if the factory is started?  If he is not aware of these things, will he go to Donegal and find out for himself, if he does not believe me?</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Dáil approves of the International Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs, and Protocol of Signature, signed at Geneva, on the 13th day of July, 1931, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 31st day of March, 1933, and recommends the Executive Council to take the <Col N="2405" /> necessary steps to accede to the said International Convention and Protocol of Signature.</P>
    <P>I have a statement here which is rather long.  If I tried to summarise it perhaps it would be equally as long, and possibly it is just as well that I should read it to the House.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In 1931, a Conference was held at Geneva, under the auspices of the League of Nations, for the purpose of limiting to strict medical needs by international agreement, the manufacture of narcotic drugs.  This Conference, in which more than 50 States took part, adopted a Convention, to which the formal accession of the Irish Free State is now proposed.</P>
    <P>The first Opium Convention, which was signed at The Hague in 1912, organised the national control of the internal traffic in narcotic drugs. Under that Convention the international trade was not subjected to any restrictions.  The Convention of 1925, which was ratified by the Irish Free State on the 1st September, 1931, bridged this gap by providing for the control of the international traffic by means of a system of importation and exportation permits.  Thus, a country, party to the 1925 Convention, is permitted to export habit-forming drugs only on presentation of a certificate of authorisation to import, obtained specially from the authorities of the importing country in respect of each delivery.  A central committee, composed of eight members appointed by the Council of the League receives periodically from all the contracting States full details of their production, manufacture, consumption, importation and exportation of drugs, and these reports enable the committee to watch the movement of the international market.</P>
    <P>The control provided for in the 1925 Convention was, however, found to be insufficient to curb the illicit trade in habit-forming drugs.  The Convention did not limit the manufacture of drugs, which continued to be in excess of medical necessities, and it was clear that the excess found its way into the illicit traffic. It was decided, therefore, by the <Col N="2406" /> League of Nations that a serious effort should be made to bring about a limitation of manufacture.  There were many difficulties, however, in securing this, e.g., the difficulty of fixing the total amount of the world requirements; of apportioning restrictive quotas which would be accepted by the different manufacturing countries; and of apportioning its due quota of the manufactured drugs to each consuming country.</P>
    <P>The Convention of 13th July, 1931, is the result of the discussions at the Conference on limitation of manufacture. Under this Convention, the contracting parties bind themselves to furnish annually to the Central Permanent Committee, set up under the Convention of 1925, an estimate, in a particular form, of the quantity of each drug required for their medical and scientific needs, reserve stocks, Government stocks, export, etc.  On the basis of the estimates received, a total world figure of manufacture will be established, and each manufacturing country party to the Convention will bind itself to manufacture only the quantities of drugs required to satisfy its own internal needs, within the limits of the estimates furnished annually to the Central Committee, and to enable it to execute the orders, accompanied by importation certificates received from other countries. It will be the duty of the Central Committee to verify that the orders given by importing countries do not exceed the annual estimates of their requirements.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provisions relation to the estimates, limitation of manufacture, prohibitions and restrictions, the Convention also contains provisions relating to the measures of control to be exercised by the contracting parties, and the administrative and general provisions.</P>
    <P>The present Convention shall come into force 90 days after the Secretary General of the League of Nations has received the ratifications or accessions of twenty-five States, including any four of the following: France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan <Col N="2407" /> Netherlands, Switzerland, Turkey, U.S.A.</P>
    <P>In the Protocol of Signature, the parties agree that if on July 13th, 1933, the Convention is not in force, a new Conference of the States which have signed or acceded to the Convention may be held to consider what further measures should be taken in the matter.  Note is also taken of a reservation made by the Japanese Government on the subject of crude morphine resulting from the manufacture of prepared opium in the factory of the Government-General of Formosa.</P>
    <P>The Government of the United States, which is specially interested in all measures aimed at the suppression of illicit traffic in drugs, has urged the Government of the Irish Free State, amongst other Governments, to accede to the Convention on limitation before the 13th April, 1933, in order that the Convention may come into force on the 13th July, 1933, the date named in the Protocol of Signature.  It is proposed, therefore, to accede at once to the Convention on behalf of the Irish Free State.  The Irish Free State is not a &ldquo;manufacturing country&rdquo; of narcotic drugs, but nevertheless it is essential if effective control of the illicit traffic is to be secured that all countries, even those not directly affected, should accept the obligations of the Convention.</P>
    <P>The legislation in force in this country is not at present sufficient to enable the provisions of the Drugs Conventions of 1925 and 1931 to be carried out, as the law at present in force is contained in the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1920.  As the latter Act has now to be amended in order that it may provide for the obligations of the Convention of 1925 of which the Irish Free State is a party, it is proposed that a complete code of laws should be introduced, embodying in a single statute of the Oireachtas not only the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1920. but also the legislation involved by our acceptance of the Conventions of 1925 and 1931.  A Bill is accordingly <Col N="2408" /> at present being drafted which the Minister for Justice will introduce in the Dáil as early as possible.  The Minister for External Affairs is advised that it will meet the requirements of the Convention of 1931 if, when the Irish Free State's instrument of accession is being deposited, the Secretary General of the League is informed that the necessary legislation giving effect to the provisions of the Convention will be in force at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of last night's discussion I wonder if the Minister could now give us some indication of what was intended under this section.  He stated last night that it was intended definitely that the standard revenue should, when refixed, bear some relation to the new situation created by the capital reconstruction. The only phrase which the Railway Tribunal would have to direct them in that consideration are the terms of reference, &ldquo;shall adjust and vary the said standard revenue to such extent (if any) and in such manner as appears to the Railway Tribunal to be just and equitable in consequence of the reconstruction of the capital of the company.&rdquo;  I gathered from the Minister's phrase that it would not be his view of a just and equitable reduction of the standard revenue to have it cut down to meet the full diminution of the capital set out in the schedule.  If it is not that, would he consider the advisability of indicating the point of view and getting that expressed rather more clearly in the section.  These will be the only terms of reference that the Tribunal will have before them hereafter when it comes to fix the new standard revenue.  Apparently it is not the old standard revenue of three years calculated accounts, and apparently not the other standard related to the payment of the stockholders <Col N="2409" /> and reduced to the full amount of the reduced payments to be made hereafter.  If it is somewhere in between, will the Minister tell us where it would be?</P>

      <P>I had the section examined and it is quite clear that it carries out what it is intended to achieve.  I did not say that it was not my view that the reduction in standard revenue should be proportionate to the reduction in capital.  Under the terms of the section a general reduction should take place.  I think there should be a reduction in the standard revenue in consequence of the reorganisation of the company's finances, and it is for the Railway Tribunal to say what reduction would be equitable.  The Deputy is incorrect in saying that the original standard revenue fixed under the Act of 1924 had no relation to the company's capital. It had relation to revenue in the three years which are fixed in the Bill as years in which the company is considered to have earned revenue capable of giving a normal return on the capital of the company as it existed then, and in addition to taking into account the revenue of the company in those years they had to take into account capital expenditure incurred since then and additional capital raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that the reason why these three years were taken is that they were years in which the railway company were considered to have earned revenue which gave a normal return on the capital then existing, and in addition the Tribunal had to take into account the additional capital raised in the meantime and the additional capital expenditure incurred, and fix the standard net revenue having regard to <Col N="2410" /> all these considerations.  The reorganisation of the company's finances, involving a reduction of the total capital liability, brings a new factor into account and, because of the new factor, we say to the Railway Tribunal: &ldquo;Reconsider the standard net revenue which you fixed in 1924 in consequence of this reorganisation of the company's finances and fix the standard net revenue which is held to be fair and equitable in the new circumstances.&rdquo;  That is what the section purports to do and that is what it does, in fact, achieve.</P>

That is what he is there for and, if the Dáil had any sense, it would not pass legislation until he had explained it. This Section 5 directs the Railway Tribunal to re-examine the question of the standard revenue in the light of the reduction of capital that is being made.  I want to know, in the event of their doing that now, have they power under this or any other Act to consider it again and to fix it again, if the railway company sets about raising fresh capital in the future, or if they fix it under this Bill, will they require some further authority to fix it a third time in the event of fresh capital being raised?</P>

Surely it can be so explained to a layman's mind in this way.  A term of reference was given <Col N="2413" /> to the Railway Tribunal with regard to the standard revenue.  It was clear and distinct as to what the criterion was, and the criterion was not&mdash;I will put it in this negative way&mdash;the sums paid out in dividends to the various stock holders in certain years, but simply this: &ldquo;The annual aggregate net revenue for a named three years of account.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not agree that that is the argument that falls from the third of these lettered subparagraphs. Even assuming that it was, his whole argument is based on an assumption, he asks the Railway Tribunal to make from certain paragraphs, but surely there is a precise term of reference given to them in the first sub-section of Section 53&mdash;the annual aggregate net revenue in three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter on the point at issue now.  It does matter to this extent, that it indicates that, in taking these three years of account, the Railway Tribunal were to have regard to the capital of the company in those three years, and then to make allowance in the standard net revenue for any changes that took place in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, again, this effort at construction.  The clear <Col N="2414" /> term given to them in the subparagraph, the real rule given to them, is the three years of account&mdash; the aggregate annual net revenue for those three years.  Anything else that follows is merely by way of minor addition or exception to the thing and we are supposed to tag on to that exception what is going to be in the future the real principle.  Is that not so?  The real principle for the future is going to be the adequate, or, in the new circumstances, the deemed adequate, remuneration of the capital. That is what is going to be the principle for the future.  The change-over is effected by saying to the Railway Tribunal, under the powers in this measure when the Dáil has passed it: &ldquo;There is a capital reconstruction. Will you revise your standard revenue in accordance with that?&rdquo; I say that, if they do take the Minister's argument that the original object&mdash;no matter how they fix it&mdash;of taking the standard revenue at any figure was to have remuneration given to the stockholders, then, they are bound, I think &mdash;and I wonder would the Minister correct me if I am wrong in any of the points&mdash;to go back and say that that £1,100,000 had paid all the guaranteed 4 per cent. and other percentage to all the people who were guaranteed and it did, in fact, pay something like 3 or 4 per cent. to the ordinary stockholder.  They have to accept the Minister's argument if they are to get away from the merest calculation as to what was earned in certain years and they have to look at the purposes to which those moneys were applied and say, &ldquo;Very good.  All the stockholders guaranteed were paid their guaranteed preference amounts but the ordinary people were paid 3 per cent., 3½ per cent. or 4 per cent.&rdquo;  Now we are asking them to say what is just and equitable seeing that the capital has been reconstructed. What else should they do in those circumstances than say, &ldquo;Four per cent. used to be paid on the guaranteed preference stock.  That has been reduced by half; therefore, we will apportion 2 per cent. over the old sum or 4 per cent. over the new, and reduce the standard revenue by <Col N="2415" /> cutting it down completely and entirely according to the diminution of the capital here.&rdquo;  Does the Minister intend that?  He said last night that he did not&mdash;that he is not, at any rate, giving those orders.  I think, in fact, he is giving those orders; once they get over the preliminary hurdle of bringing this matter before themselves at all they then have to go fully into the matter, and the only basis of argument they can have for reduction of the standard revenue is to say: &ldquo;Reduce in accordance with the reduction in the capital.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is in the section is to make such reduction as is just and equitable, but it is not to be framed on the basis of the calculation merely as to what was earned in certain years and it is not to be on the basis of the purposes to which the money was applied in those years&mdash;and the amount of money is now reduced because the amount of the stock has been reduced &mdash;it is to be something in between. Surely it is for this House to tell them what it ought to be.  We tell them: &ldquo;Whatever you think is just and equitable.&rdquo; The Minister should put himself in the position of the Railway Tribunal when they get this matter brought before them.  If he says: &ldquo;I will not have a reduction corresponding to this stock&rdquo; is that not by implication passing judgment that the reduction is not just and equitable? Does the Minister think that the Railway Tribunal will take on themselves the odium of making that decision?  I do not think they will.  I think, in fact, what this means&mdash;or what, in practice, it is going to work out at&mdash; is the reduction of the old standard revenue according to the reduction of <Col N="2416" /> the stocks as made, and accurately according to that reduction.  The Minister says he does not intend that. Is it not for this House to give a direction? We have done a far bigger thing. We have said that the 4 per cent. debenture stockholder is not going to get 4 per cent.&mdash;that he is only going to get three pounds odd.  We say that the 4 per cent. guaranteed preference holder is not going to get 4 per cent.&mdash; that he is only going to get 2 per cent. When we brazenly do so much why should we not say to the Railway Tribunal: &ldquo;You are to modify the standard revenue in accordance with certain precise terms of reference which we give you?&rdquo; The Minister's whole purpose has been that for the future the new transport organisation is not going to be conducted by people with their eyes set mainly upon the payment of dividends, and that is his explanation of the reduced capital proviso. Why not carry that to the only point where it will save the railways anything? Why not carry it into this term of reference to the Railway Tribunal, saying to them: &ldquo;You are to reduce by so much?&rdquo; I think it is a definite blot upon the Bill to leave it in this vague wording&mdash;whatever seems to them to be just and equitable in consequence of the capital reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Section 5, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
      <P>(1)  Within three months after the passing of this Act the Company shall prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme (in this Act referred to as the postal voting scheme) whereby every election of a director of the Company which would, but for this section, be required by law to be made by the votes of members of the Company given at an annual general meeting of the Company shall be made by the votes of members of the Company given by means of ballot papers sent or delivered by such members by post or otherwise to the Company or to a returning officer on behalf of the Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  When the postal voting scheme is submitted to the Minister by the <Col N="2417" /> Company under this section, the Minister shall, as he shall think proper, either by order confirm such scheme without modification or make such modifications in such scheme as he shall, subject to the provisions of this section, think proper and by order confirm such scheme as so modified.</P>
    <P>(3)  Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions of this section, the postal voting scheme as confirmed by the Minister under this section shall provide for the following particular matters in relation to every election held under such scheme, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the method of nominating candidates for election at such election;</P>
    <P>(b)  the appointment of a returning officer for the purposes of such election;</P>
    <P>(c)  the furnishing by the Company to the members of the Company of ballot papers for the purposes of such election;</P>
    <P>(d)  the returning of such ballot papers by such members by post or otherwise to the Company or to such returning officer on behalf of the Company;</P>
    <P>(e)  securing that each member of the Company shall be entitled to give at such election the like number of votes as he would have been entitled to give at such election if this section had not been enacted and such election had taken place at an annual general meeting of the Company;</P>
    <P>(f)  securing that representatives of the members of the Company may be present at and, if they so desire, take part in the scrutiny and counting of the votes given at such election;</P>
    <P>(g)  providing that the result of such election shall be published at the annual general meeting of the Company at which such election would have taken place if this section had not been enacted, and securing that such election shall be held and completed at such time as will enable the result thereof to be so published.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2418" /> (4)  The Minister shall, by the order confirming the postal voting scheme under the section, appoint the day (not being later than twelve months after the passing of this Act) on which such scheme shall come into force.</P>
    <P>(5)  At any time after the postal voting scheme has been confirmed by the Minister under this section, the Minister may, either in consequence of representations made to him by the Company or on his own motion after one month's notice to the Company, by order amend (by addition, omission, or variation) such scheme in such manner as he shall, subject to the provisions of this section, think proper.</P>
    <P>(6)  On and after the day on which the postal voting scheme comes into force under this section, every election of a director of the Company which, but for this section, would be required by law to be made by the votes of members of the Company given at an annual general meeting of the Company shall take place and be held under and in accordance with such scheme, subject to such (if any) amendments or variations of such scheme as may for the time being be in force under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 6 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The provisions of sub-section (4) of Clause 34 of the Great Southern Railways Amalgamation <Col N="2419" /> Scheme, dated 1st January, 1925, shall henceforth apply to the election of a director as if the words &ldquo;thirty days&rdquo; were therein substituted for the words &ldquo;ten days&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(2)  No proxy sent out by the directors for the general business of the Company shall be available for the election of directors.</P>
    <P>(3)  A list of candidates who have duly submitted their names for election as directors shall be sent by ordinary post to the shareholders of the Company not less than ten days before the date fixed for the meeting at which an election of directors is to take place.  The names of the retiring directors shall be indicated on the list.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly obvious that if shareholders are to get ten days' notice of the election of a director, the company must have some time to prepare the machinery and send out the circulars. I do not know how the Minister proposes to deal with that aspect of the matter, because in any case it would seem to require some modification.  I therefore formally move amendment 16.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear what the Deputy's point is.  I am moving, later on, certain amendments designed to secure modification in the election scheme originally proposed in the Bill, particularly to secure that the election will not conclude until after a general meeting, so that shareholders who desire to attend the general meeting, and consider the affairs of the company there, can do so before making up their minds as to which of the candidates in the election they will vote for.  It is definitely intended to abolish proxy voting, and it seems to me that that is the issue arising on this and other amendments.  I do not see that there is any substantial difference between the proposals which are contained in the various amendments, moved by Deputy Dockrell and other Deputies, and what is, in fact, the practice at present.  There is a slight difference, but not a material one.  Our view is that in connection with the election of directors of the company <Col N="2420" /> the personal element should enter in; in other words, that the shareholders should vote for particular individuals because they approve of those individuals as directors of the company. The necessity for such a change has been argued by a number of people interested in the railway company, and by a number of the shareholders of the company.  It seems to be a desirable thing, and does not seem to inflict hardship on anybody, in so far as it merely provides a means of ensuring that there will be no doubt whatever that the directors elected will be adequately representative of the shareholders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out to the Minister that we are not attacking the principle of this proposal?  He probably sees more in it than appears to the ordinary layman.  I think the Minister is aware that under the law as it stands ten days' notice must be given of any candidate going forward for election as a director.  Under the Minister's proposal in this Bill the law could not be carried out, so it is desirable on the face of it&mdash;even to carry out the Minister's proposal&mdash;that the ten days' notice should be extended. We suggest that it would be only reasonable to substitute thirty days for the ten days in the Minister's proposal. I think it would make it a much more workable arrangement.  I want to make it clear to the Minister that we are not attacking the principle of his proposal.  It is only in order to give the necessary time to carry out the principle embodied in it that we are anxious that this should be done. With that object this amendment is put forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more in it than that.  The amendment in the name of Deputy Thrift undoubtedly provides that no proxy sent out by the directors for the general business of the company shall be available for the election of directors, but it maintains the system of proxy voting.  Although it effects a nominal change, in substance there is no change to the present system to which objection is taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and meets another point.  As the Bill was drafted, the ballot papers had to be returned to the secretary of the company at or before the general meeting.  The argument was advanced that a shareholder might prefer to attend the general meeting, listen to the directors' report and the discussion on it and then make up his mind whether he was going to vote for the retiring directors or other candidates.  Consequently, in amendment 17, we provide that the election shall not close until seven days after the general meeting so as to permit of a shareholder exercising that discretion.</P>

      <P>Much as I venerate the Minister's gifts for establishing precedents, I think this business of electing directors by postal voting is the purest ballyhoo for consumption by the demagogues of the country.  One can imagine Deputy Hales on the ditch talking to his friends about Caitlin ní Houlihan free from her bonds and the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways system restored to their democratic rights by being enabled to put patriotic men on the board.  The ultimate effect of the Bill on the railway company is quite another story. It must be well known to the Minister that many shareholders in this company prefer to leave a discretion, in a matter of this kind, in the hands of directors whom they have had good reason to trust in the past and whose judgment they trust.  The result of this section will be simply to make the cranks crankier and more of a nuisance than they have been heretofore.  Any really responsible shareholder who has a grave matter to raise, one that will command the support of reasonable men, will go to the ordinary meeting at the present time and make his case.</P>

What I want to point out now is that the kind of public nuisance who goes to shareholders' meetings to raise objections to the colour, perhaps, of a director's beard is going to be facilitated by this amendment. I believe that the section has been put in at the request of responsible cranks, that it will do no good but will simply give them an opportunity <Col N="2423" /> of making themselves a greater nuisance than they already are.

They are used to curb and, in some cases, to prevent discussion which the directors do not like.  I think the Minister is very well advised in giving this opportunity to shareholders to vote through the post.  That will enable them to wait until after the shareholders' meeting before recording their votes.  They will then be in possession of the explanations usually given by the directors at the meeting, and will be able to make up their minds as to whether the explanations were satisfactory or not.</P>

In connection with these matters, I would remind the Minister that the Charter under which the Governor and the Directors of the Bank of Ireland are elected was recently revised by a Committee set up by this House.  That was done during the lifetime of the Government with which Deputy McGilligan was associated.  I think it is desirable that the whole method of election of directors to the railway company should be looked into&mdash;such matters as the shareholding value that will qualify a shareholder to become a candidate for the position of director. Matters of that kind might, I think, be taken into consideration by the Minister when framing a section for the election of directors.</P>

      <P>The first part of the amendment we are discussing states that certain provisions of Clause 34 of the Great Southern Railways Amalgamation Scheme &ldquo; shall henceforth apply to the election of a director as if the words &lsquo;thirty days&rsquo; were therein substituted for the words &lsquo;ten days&rsquo;. I understand that under the existing scheme a director had only to give ten days' notice of his intentions to go <Col N="2425" /> forward for election as a director. Considering that the railway company must give notice to the shareholders&mdash; it provides, I think, for ten days' notice of the meeting&mdash;that only leaves them twenty days to get through all the machinery which may be necessary. I submit to the Minister, no matter what scheme is afterwards set up by the railway company, that it is desirable now to alter the law to the thirty days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The second reason which the Deputy gave for approving this was that the directors used to get proxies and that they used them for all sorts of purposes other than the appointment of directors.  I think that was the Deputy's contention.  I think that, by implication, the Deputy suggested that the proxies were used to rule out objectionable people.  At any rate he said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know in what connection the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; occurred, either in the Deputy's words or my own.  At any rate, the implication was that the proxies were used for purposes other than voting for directors, that they were being used to rule out objectionable people, and that that was being stopped.  Is it being stopped?  The Deputy thinks it is, but I wonder where he will find that in the Bill.  The only thing that is changed is the question of proxy voting for directors, so that, if they were able to knock out objectionable directors because they had proxies, they still have that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Deputy's enthusiasm for the section has waned.  But that is not in the section.  The Minister has explained his position, which is, that it is desirable to get away from proxy voting.  Why?  The Minister seemed to hint that it was <Col N="2427" /> because some of the shareholders asked him to do so.  I should like to know how many asked him.  Apart from this, has the Minister any means of assessing the strength of the demand for the cancellation or amendment of this system of proxy voting? There was a certain amount of agitation about that matter this year and one association, at any rate, of the shareholders set out with that as almost the main plank in its platform &mdash;to get rid of this system.  In the end, how many proxies did they get in opposition to the directors?  If we are to go by the strength of the feeling exhibited at that meeting, it would seem to show that there is no such feeling.  If the Minister is not going to tie himself to proxy voting, it must be remembered that they are not coerced into using these proxies.  They may attend in person.  People who are interested in the railway system and who think that there is anything wrong generally attend personally at the meeting.  But the Minister apparently has some argument in his mind against proxy voting as such.  If so, I think we should hear it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is not desirable that the directors should send out a general proxy to all shareholders which they can use at elections.  What the Bill provides, in fact, is that shareholders will vote for individuals and vote for them because, in their opinion, they regard these individuals as the most suitable to act as directors.  It eliminates other considerations or undue influences coming to bear in the election.  A list of candidates will be sent to each shareholder, at the company's expense, and he will mark on that list those for whom he wishes to vote and who seem to him to be preferable.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good knows that the auditor, from his point of view, is regarded as a most important person.  At that meeting Mr. Prost represented a section of the shareholders who held properties to the value of £2,000,000.  He put some of the following questions:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2429" />&ldquo;(1)  What is the accountancy relationship between John Wallis and Sons, the I.O. Company and the Great Southern Railways Company? (a) The profit or loss of the first-named; (b) the profit or loss of the second-named; (c) what fees, if any, had been derived by the directors of the Great Southern Railways in addition to the fees paid by this company to such directors; (d) the purchase price paid by the Great Southern Railways Company for John Wallis &amp; Sons; (e) the purchase price paid by this company for the I.O. Company; (f) the purchase price&mdash;an awkward question&mdash;paid by this company for Motorways; (g) and if any other road services have been acquired during the past year and, if so, what service or services and what was the purchase price&rdquo;&mdash;an awkward question.</P>
    <P>&ldquo; (2)  What are the names of the directors of this company who are also directors of the United Irish Investment Co., Ltd., the I.O. Company, John Wallis &amp; Sons, and what remuneration do they get from the aforementioned companies in addition to the remuneration from this company?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Questions 3, 4, 5 and 6, which Mr. Prost also put, have a more indirect bearing upon Nos. 1 and 2. It is well known that the Chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company is one of the most plausible and delightful men to be found, and is well able to please disgruntled people asking for proper information, which they are perfectly entitled to get.  The chairman, on this occasion explained that Mr. Prost was absolutely entitled to an answer to his question but he regretted he had not the necessary information available just then, as the information was not to hand.  I am in a position to say from information that I got that there was a gentleman sitting at the back of the chairman, at that moment, with that information ready.</P>

      <P>There are some half-a-dozen amendments here which I think can all be lumped together.  With your permission, a Chinn Comhairle, I shall try to deal with them together.  They are all concerned with the same subject, namely, the desirability of trying to secure some continuity in the board. The purpose sought is to get the Minister to allow three members to be chosen, by the outgoing board, and continued on the new board, the remaining portion of which would be chosen by vote.  It is, I think, obvious that in any scheme of this kind continuity is essential. An entirely new board might be very ignorant of policy, and matters might have been under discussion, pending contracts and a whole variety of business, in regard to which a minority of the old board, if continued on the new board, might be able to render most valuable assistance.  I move this amendment, which, as I say, will secure that there should be that continuity. The minority will not be in office, of course, permanently, but at each election a minority of the previous board would come on to the new board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That question would arise after the first election.  At the first election seven directors will be elected.  I think it is desirable, and, personally, I have no reason to suppose <Col N="2433" /> it will not happen, that a number of the retiring directors should be elected.  I think that would inevitably follow.  It is the invariable practice; and we are arguing about something that is not likely to arise.  I am not convinced, however, by the continuity argument.  We do not provide for the retention of a minority of Ministers when a change of Government takes place, yet no serious dislocation is caused.  At any rate, I think you would incur a much greater responsibility if the practice that prevailed heretofore had to be different.  In the matter of the management of a company the board of directors are responsible for policy, not administration. Some part of the trouble of the railway company is due to the fact that the board of directors insisted upon supervising details that should be dealt with not even by the manager but by subordinates of the general manager. That does not arise here.  The outgoing directors are going back unless the shareholders want to get rid of them.  It is likely that the same outgoing directors will be re-elected by the votes of the shareholders.</P>

      <P>The proposal here does not prevent the names of the other <Col N="2434" /> directors going forward, and the shareholders expressing their opinions on the matter.  The only object the amendment seeks to achieve is that there should be some continuity in the business.  The Minister indicated the practice in this House.  I am not at all sure that the practice in this House and that of a board are at all synonymous.  The Opposition in this House knows just as much about the carrying on of the business, after 12 months' experience of the House, as the Government does.  It seems to be only a difference of method.  The matter is quite different probably in connection with a board.  A board enters into trade contracts.  It has, therefore, to test the position from day to day which no body of shareholders outside the board knows anything whatever about.  To take persons from the body of shareholders and put them into the position of directors could not achieve at all what is achieved here by moving from one side of the House to the other.  Deputies on the Opposition side of the House are in touch with everything done, as the Minister knows, having, himself, sat on both sides of the House.  Under the new régime there will be only seven directors, and I think a minority of three might well be preserved from the previous board. It is proposed by the amendment to elect four directors to the board, and to continue three from the previous board in order that when new men come in there will be somebody there to enlighten them as to what to do precisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential in any board of directors that this principle should be carried out in the interest of the shareholders and of the community.  I would ask the Minister to consider this proposal favourably, not that I have the least doubt as to what the Minister says about the board.  I am quite sure he will find in future, as in the past, sanity amongst the shareholders. It is a very difficult thing to find samples in this country, but from what I have seen of shareholders, and from the way they have acted in the past with regard to the proxies, nobody can accuse them of any want of sanity.  As I said, I am quite <Col N="2435" /> sure that that policy will be carried out, as it has been in the past.  But in the interests of the business of the company, and of any body that is directed by directors, it is essential that you must have somebody on the board who can explain to the board what these matters are as they come up.</P>

The discussion on the later section does not make the least difference.  What is the use of discussing this on Section 13 if we have already passed Section 7 which settles it?

If he can, I am prepared to await the discussion on the later section.  I suggest that sub-section (4) knits the issue immediately. I think before we proceed to pass the section with sub-section (4) in it the Minister should tell us if he has examined the agreements that exist, if he has formed any opinion as to the liabilities that may accrue, and if he is prepared to say that the Government will indemnify the railway company against any possible claim that may arise as a result of Government intervention.</P>

      <P>The Minister is a most fascinating man when conducting a Bill.  He comes in blandly and says that he is most anxious that the House should know he is approaching this problem in no Party spirit, that he wants the assistance of everybody, and that he wants to discuss it freely and frankly.  But the fact of it is that the moment you bring his attention to something of vital importance, with his leader he is inclined to say: &ldquo;Put out the Government and find another Executive Council&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>You might as well put the closure on, or at least say it is a Party Bill, because if you pass sub-section (4) it means that the discussion on the later section is worthless.  If the Minister means to listen to reason, which I very much doubt, he might as well listen to it now and in the Committee Stage signify his intention to accept an amendment on the Report Stage to get rid of it.  I take it from his attitude that he does not intend to <Col N="2439" /> discuss the matter in the least, that he is prepared to take the risk and to charge straight ahead.  If that is so, there is not the least use calling attention to the danger.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister knows, and it is only right to say that there are many people who have previously studied the Minister's speeches regarding the necessity for the re-organisation of the transport industry, and the protection of the railways section of that industry in particular, who are surprised that he is going to hand over to the same body of people possibly the administration of a measure which professes to save the railways from bankruptcy.  The Minister was quite right when he said that the directors, if they were doing their work properly, would only deal with matters affecting policy, and should not, as they have been continuously doing, interfere in the most minute matters of administrative detail.  I want to assure Deputy Good that I have no possible prejudice of any kind against any individual member of the board of directors who have been responsible for bringing the railways to the present state of semi-bankruptcy; but the directors are men who are also acting as directors of various other concerns, and all of them, or almost all of them, are without any technical knowledge or experience of railway work.</P>

At any rate, it is immaterial as to what the number of the board is going to be, so long as it will consist of individuals who have brought the industry to its present state of semi-bankruptcy.  I suggest to the Minister that it might be considered advisable between now and the time when the Bill comes to be considered on Report&mdash;certainly before it comes up for consideration in the Seanad&mdash;if he wants to save the railways, to insert a sub-section making it imperative on the shareholders to select a certain number out of the seven proposed directors who will have qualifications for positions of this kind.  It is very desirable&mdash;I am sure that Deputy Good will not disagree with me in this&mdash;that one of the directors, at least, should have high engineering qualifications.  If it is possible, I hope the Minister will insert the new sub-section I suggest.</P>

      <P>May I congratulate Deputy Davin on the big advance he has made since the Second Stage of this Bill?

Now, in two successive speeches, he has proved that it is entirely due to incompetent directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that there ought to be opportunity given for discussing the rather important point Deputy Davin has raised.  With respect, I think it can easily arise on <Col N="2441" /> this section because we are discussing the limitation of the number of directors.  I should like to say that I consider the limitation to seven to be undesirable because I feel, with Deputy Davin, that there ought to be some allowance made by enlargement of the number to permit members of the technical staff to go forward for election as directors and, therefore, to be allowed to become directors.  So far as I understand the situation, there is a legal impediment at the moment to such a thing occurring. I do not know whether this impediment arises in the case of all the old absorbed or amalgamated or amalgamating companies but most of them had in their original Acts incorporated a certain clause of the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act which effectively prevents any person in receipt of emoluments from the railway company from putting himself forward as a director, or, at least, eventually emerging as a director. A clause might easily be introduced as a sub-section to this section or an alternation might be made by enlarging the number in this section, so as not only to permit but almost to give a direction that, year by year, there should be put on the board of directors some one member of the technical staff.  It seems to me that there may be two types of boards of directors, either of which would be very good. You could have a board of directors composed almost entirely of technical people, with a full appreciation of the technical problems that would come before them and a very definite capacity to enter into discussion and take decisions upon the points that arose.  Alternatively, you might have a board of directors from which technical people would be excluded. I think that the better attitude for that type of board of directors to take would be only to interfere in administrative policy, leaving technical matters to be carried on by the staff, with only supervision on general lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how far the comments made upon the present directors of the Great Southern Railways Company are accurate, but one does hear <Col N="2442" /> the statement made from time to time that, not being technical and not pretending to be technical, they have not confined themselves to matters of general policy but have interfered in the technical management of the system and that, to some extent&mdash;not to the extent that Deputy Davin in his exaggerated speech of a moment ago said&mdash;that contributed to the decline in the railways.  Again, how far that whole system would be established on a better basis by having one technical man associated with the board, I am not in a position to argue at the moment.  However, I think the matter is one worthy of being ventilated here, and one upon which a Deputy like Deputy Davin, with his internal information and even expert knowledge of some matters appertaining to the railway system, should be allowed to speak.  I should like the Minister to turn over in his mind the possibility of excluding the operation of that excluding clause of the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act which prevents technical people in the employment of the board from securing seats as directors.  I should like him to consider the advisability or desirability of enlarging the number of directors even by having a separate seat&mdash;selection to be made by the shareholders or, if necessary, by a system of rotation&mdash;given to some member of the technical staff.</P>
    <P>The whole scheme of company formation in Germany, where company formation has advanced to a greater degree than it has here, is on an entirely different foundation from what it is here.  In Germany, they rather go in for the type of scheme which enables the technical men to be supreme.  In the Scandinavian countries, there are many examples where technical men&mdash;this is decidedly the case in Germany&mdash;have the right to be heard in all matters that pertain to their technical work before the board take decisions at what are described as &ldquo;plenary meetings&rdquo;&mdash; the only meetings at which they can take decisions.  These meetings are not legally held unless the technical man, whose work is being supervised, has been called in and given his chance to <Col N="2443" /> explain.  In the majority of cases, he has the right to vote.  Perhaps a mixed system of that sort would be the best system here, but I am very glad that Deputy Davin gave us an opportunity to have this matter raised.</P>

    <P>(2)  The Minister shall not make an order under this section unless he is satisfied that the railway company on whose application such order is made has lawful authority by statute, order, licence, or otherwise to carry on a road transport service affording to the public transport facilities constituting an adequate substitute for the railway services authorised by such order to be discontinued and that such railway company has given sufficient public notice of the establishment or intention to establish such road transport service.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever the Minister makes an order under this section the following provisions shall have effect in respect of the railway line or section of railway line to which such order relates, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  it shall be lawful for the railway company owning or operating such railway line or section of railway line, notwithstanding any statutory, contractual, or other obligation to the contrary, either (as the terms of such order may be) to cease to run any trains on such railway line or section of railway line or to reduce in the manner and to the extent specified in such order <Col N="2446" /> the service of trains on such railway line or section of railway line;</P>
    <P>(b)  such order shall not relieve from or affect any liability of such railway company to maintain all bridges, level crossings, fences, drains, and other works constructed and maintained for the use, accommodation, or protection of the public generally or of any section of the public or of the owners or of occupiers of particular lands;</P>
    <P>(c)  where such order authorises such railway company to cease to run any trains whatsoever on such railway line or section of railway line, so much of Section 47 of the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, as makes it obligatory on a railway company to employ proper persons to open and shut gates at a level crossing shall not apply to any level crossing on such railway line or section of railway line if and so long as all the gates of such level crossings are kept and secured in such position as to permit the free passage of road traffic across such line at such crossing;</P>
    <P>(d)  such railway company may, notwithstanding any agreement or practice as to the dismissal (in cases of redundancy of employees) of the latest employed of its employees or as to the division of such railway company's railway system into districts for the purpose of the promotion or dismissal of employees, redistribute its employees in such manner as appears to such railway company to be proper, but not so as to impose any undue or unnecessary hardship on the employees of such railway company;</P>
    <P>(e)  all employees of such railway company who are dismissed on account of their services being rendered redundant by steps taken by such railway company under the authority of such order shall be entitled to be paid by such railway company compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Third Schedule to the Principal Act as amended by the Railways <Col N="2447" /> (Existing Officers and Servants) Act, 1926 (No. 25 of 1926).</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (1), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In this section the expression &ldquo;service of trains&rdquo; means a service of trains in respect of which the railway company running such service wishes, for the purposes of more economical working, to provide by means of road transport such transport facilities as are required by the traffic theretofore carried by such service.</P>
      <P>This amendment is in reality a drafting amendment.  The Bill as drafted contained sub-section (4), the effect of which as read by certain persons, who had given it an interpretation which was not intended, would be to make the Minister a sort of super-manager of the railways.  The interpretation which was given to it by certain people, or the interpretation which might be attached to it, is that no alteration in a railway time-table could take place except by Ministerial order.  It is quite clear that is not the intention.  What was intended was that no alteration in railway policy in respect of the running of a road service instead of a rail service could be made without Ministerial order.  If the company decides to vary the hours of running of trains, the nature of the trains run on a particular line or the other rail services that might be provided, that is a matter of company management.</P>

      <P>The term used there is &ldquo;service of trains,&rdquo; proportionate to the traffic offering.  If, on the critical week in January, 1933, the particular service of trains met the traffic which was offering at that time, then, proportionate to the traffic that is offered, the same service of trains must be provided, but if the company determines to substitute for a rail service, a road service, an order under the Bill is required and the provisions of this section come into operation.  That is what these amendments are intended to achieve.  We intend that the company shall be required to maintain over all these lines, a service of trains, which, having regard to the traffic offering, will be as good as the service provided on the last week of January, 1933, having regard to the traffic offering then.  If it is decided to reduce the service below that point and to substitute for the rail service, a road service, to carry either the whole or portion of the traffic which otherwise would be carried by rail, then the section comes into operation and a Ministerial order is required.  It is somewhat complicated, but it does meet the point and prevents the misunderstanding which arose out of the original draft.</P>

      <P>I hope under this amendment the Minister will not unduly interfere with the running of the company. The Minister says he must be satisfied on these points.  A few moments ago the Minister objected to the present directors because they interfered unduly with the officials.  It appears to me that one of the objects of the Bill is to take power out of the <Col N="2449" /> hands of the directors and to give it to the Minister.  I do not know how better off the company will be if there is to be interference by the Government in future instead of by the directors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite correct.  At the present time the G.S.R. is required by law to maintain in respect of portion of its system a particular service of trains.  It cannot reduce or stop that service without the sanction of the Government in the form of an Order authorising it to do so.  There are other parts of the system on which it is not under that statutory obligation.  Other railway companies operating in the Saorstát are also free from that statutory obligation.  They can stop a service or shut down a line on their own decision.  This Bill, I submit, has created a new set of conditions under which the railway companies may have a monopoly position. In these circumstances obviously there must be some provision under which they will be required by law to provide services, that they will not be free to stop services or reduce services as they were in the past.  What is provided here is that they shall maintain proportionately as good a service as they provided in the last week of January of this year; in other words, that the service in regard to traffic shall be as good as the service in the last week of January.</P>

      <P>If there is a diminution of traffic there might be a diminution of services.  There is no question of an Order for that purpose, but if the railway company decides to go beyond that, if they decide to shut down or reduce a service, so that the traffic cannot be carried on rail and that some part will have to go on road, they are prohibited from doing that by this section unless and until a Ministerial order is issued to them.  If there is a Ministerial order, then, of course, the provisions come into effect.</P>

      <P>What I want to point out to the Minister is that certain services <Col N="2450" /> may have been remunerative in January by reason of the amount of traffic offering, but owing to road competition, or for some other reason, these services might not be so remunerative six months subsequently. Would the railway company have power to reduce these services?  I think they should have power to reduce them. They must really have a certain amount of control.  I want to be assured that they will have that in future.</P>

      <P>If there are fluctuations in traffic&mdash;say that last year so many thousand people went to Howth by train and this year a smaller number wanted to go to Howth&mdash;then fewer trains will be required, and fewer trains will be run.  There is no question of a Ministerial order there, because that alteration would correspond with the fluctuations in the traffic offering. If the railway company, despite the fact that the same number of people wanted to go to Howth by train, were going to run a smaller rail service and force a number of people to go by bus, then a Ministerial order would be required, but fluctuations or alterations of the service arising out of fluctuations in the traffic, are within the discretion of the company.  But decisions which, in effect, mean that traffic is going to be taken from the railways and put on the roads, require a Ministerial order.  That is the simplest explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, at a later stage this evening, to get a discussion at greater length on Section <Col N="2451" /> 8(4).  Sub-section (4) is brought before us immediately by reason of this definition.  I would like the Minister to consider his definition and all that he has said in the light of the phrase used in sub-section (4).  That sub-section terrified me when I read it first. I can see the Minister's intention of modifying what is in the sub-section, but I do not think he achieves his purpose. I am not sure whether the Minister intended his statement about the railway situation to be comprehensive. It was, at any rate, very brief.  He said the railway company was bound, over certain sections of the line, to run certain train services.</P>
      <P>Under the measure of 1932, on baronially guaranteed or State-aided portions of the line the railway company is bound to keep up a certain service of trains.  On the main line, generally, I think the company was more or less at liberty.  There was a parliamentary train arrangement, but that did not amount to a whole lot.  There might be a certain amount of confusion and doubt as to what would happen before the railway company would decide to abandon the whole line.  As sub-section (4) stood, it meant that even on the main section the railway company was bound to run such a service of trains as would give the same facilities for the transport of passengers, merchandise and mails, as was given during the last seven days of January, 1933.  We now have an amendment which attempts to cut down that very rigid limitation upon the previous powers of the railway company &mdash; to cut it down to a certain extent.</P>
      <P>Train service is defined as being the train service which the company intend to replace by motor transport.  This phrase occurs:</P>
      <P>...to provide by means of road transport such transport facilities as are required by the traffic theretofore carried by such service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid the word &ldquo;theretofore&rdquo; is going to cause difficulty.  Read into sub-section (4) of Section 8 it means that the railway company in some way has to provide for the same volume of traffic as passed over their service during <Col N="2452" /> the last seven days of January, 1933.  Why should not the word &ldquo;theretofore&rdquo; be changed?  Could it not read &ldquo;traffic at any time offering to be carried by such service&rdquo;?  It really makes a standard of the traffic that was previously offered, and I do not understand the reason for that.  If read into Section 8(4) it would have the effect of stabilising the traffic that was offered in the last seven days of January.  I do not think that is the intention, and it certainly would be imposing a frightful hardship on some of the railway companies.</P>
    <P>Traffic is disappearing, and if this particular period is to be taken, especially in regard to the Great Northern Railway, I do not know how they are going to bear up against the burden that will be imposed upon them. I think all this follows from the word &ldquo;theretofore.&rdquo;  If it does not, then I think there has been a big change made.</P>

      <P>When Deputy McGilligan spoke of baronially guranteed lines I expected to see him blush, but he did not.  The Minister spoke of these lines when he was introducing the Second Reading.  He spoke emphatically about the freedom which he would give to the railway company to close down certain lines, and he pointed out that he would receive no deputations and would hear nothing on the subject; he would let the railway companies close down railway lines freely and he was not concerned with the effect that would have on the towns concerned.  It is, I think, under this section that he takes powers to authorise the closing down of lines.</P>

      <P>Let us assume that the railway company decide to shut down or reduce the service on a certain line and substitute for that service a road service.  That road service must be competent to carry the kind of traffic which normally would be carried on the railway line.  It does not mean that the service must be such as to provide <Col N="2453" /> for the volume of traffic that might have been carried on any particular date, if, in fact, such a volume of traffic was not offered.  The quality and convenience of the service must be such that nobody is going to be at any greater disadvantage in consigning goods or travelling by omnibus than he would have been if the railway service had been maintained at the old level.</P>

      <P>This amendment, together with amendments 38(a), 38(b) and 41(a), are more or less on the same point.

It seems to me that this does.  Part II of the 1932 Act is being repealed by Section 13(2) of this Bill.  It imposed on the railway companies a certain obligation.

      <P>The 1932 Act refers to railways constructed with the help of public moneys and it provided that until a certain date a certain service of trains had to be continued.  Now the Minister extends that beyond those lines so constructed to the whole system of the railways.  What is the reason for that?  It is a very serious handicap to put upon the railway company. If it was a case where traffic was not operating, that they wanted to close down a section of the main line, or to cut it down to an equivalent to closure, which they had a right to do over great stretches of the system, they were tied by the circumstances of the 1932 Act which concerned particular services of trains. That Act only applied to lines on which they were helped in the building by State moneys.</P>

In the absence of an explanation I want to cut out these words and to leave in &ldquo;only.&rdquo;  I think the railways would prefer to go on as they were rather than give these particular powers to the Minister.

If there is no contract apart from statute, the word &ldquo;statute&rdquo; covers the whole thing.

      <P>I do not think that any circumstance is likely to arise in which anybody is going to allege that a contract of value to them was broken, but, in connection with railway companies, all sorts of old obligations of one kind or another, which have ceased to be effective exist, and one has got to provide in an Act of this kind for covering every possible contingency. One finds some obscure legal bar arising in connection with sections of other Railway Acts, by which a section which purported to do a certain thing did not do it because of certain legal provisions which were <Col N="2459" /> not foreseen at the time the Act was being drafted.  That is why you get a phrase of that kind in order to ensure that what you purport to get power to do, you are, in fact, getting power to do, that is, to authorise the railway company to cease running a service on a branch of a line where the service is not required.</P>

      <P>That is one way of stating it, but there is the other, that the Minister is looking for power to break contracts.  The Minister may nod his head.  In this case, it may probably not result in misfortune or difficulty, but it is a rotten principle, and a very unsafe and undesirable thing to do &mdash; to take statutory power to break contracts.  You may wipe out debentures.  That is bad and calculated to jeopardise credit in the country, but, if you are going a step further and saying that you are going to get statutory authority to break contracts where it is convenient, trade in this country becomes exceedingly difficult. I see the Attorney-General sitting in the House, and I should very much like to hear him on the principle of getting statutory authority to amend or break contracts without reference to the parties.</P>

I suggest that the real safeguard for both sides to the contract will be found in the spirit or principle of amendment 39 by which we ask that an inquiry be held before a Ministerial order would apply.  The same thing would apply, perhaps, in the case of the Carlow Beet people or anybody having a siding on the railway, if, when the railway company make application, the Minister, before making the order, would hold an inquiry as between both parties and both parties should get the opportunity of stating their case.

      <P>At the end of sub-section (1) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) before making such order the Minister shall consider all the relevant circumstances affecting the specified railway line or section of railway line the subject of such proposed order in relation to the other portions of such company's undertaking and shall cause a public inquiry in regard to the making of such order to be held, and any persons, bodies, or trades unions who or whose members claim to be affected by the making of the proposed order may lodge objections or representations to and appear before the person holding such inquiry (the provisions of <Col N="2462" /> Section 10 (other than sub-section (1), of the Railways (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, shall apply to any such inquiry.)</P>
    <P>The future existence and profitable working of the main railway line of this country will, I think every sensible man will agree, depend on the revenue which will be contributed to the main line in the future from the branch lines now operating.  On reading this section of the Bill, I thought it was one of the most drastic proposals brought forward in this Railways Bill, but, after reading the speech made by the Minister on Second Reading, I, like every other railway man interested in the preservation of the railways, certainly thought that there was no future hope even for the existence of the main line much less the branch lines of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when speaking on the Second Reading of this Bill referred in particular to the proposal dealt with in this section and, when questioned by Deputies from this side, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I might say definitely that, in my view, quite a number of branch lines of the company must close if the railways are to survive on a profitable basis.  Most of them have been losing money since they were constructed, and nearly all of them are losing money under present conditions... I want to tell the Dáil that I will not refuse applications for an order to close a number of these branch lines.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Questioned, as he went on to develop his case, which, I think, was a very weak one, he said, at a later stage, as reported in Col. 380 of the Official Debates of the 8th March:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In fact I would like to say to the Dáil that Deputies must face realities in this matter, and if they agree to these powers being conferred, I would ask them not to lead deputations asking that uneconomic, unprofitable, and non-paying services should be continued, because it would lower the prestige of a particular town or district.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I can quite understand that the administration of these two Bills now before the Dáil will, in whatever form <Col N="2463" /> they may be finally passed, mean a considerable amount of additional personal worry to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I would like to relieve the Minister from any personal responsibility, if that responsibility could be placed upon shoulders that are better able to bear it.  I would like, and I am quite willing, to relieve the Minister from the responsibility for receiving and hearing deputations to deal with a matter of this kind. The only way in which he could be so relieved to his own advantage is to make necessary the holding of a public inquiry, at which all interested parties could be heard before he is asked to make an order for the closing down of a branch line.  As far as I can read into the Minister's mind from the language he used in his Second Reading speech he appears to be quite satisfied &mdash; some silly person has satisfied him &mdash; that what could be regarded as a good case for the reduction of the number of trains on a branch line is an equally good case for the closing down of that branch line.  The proof of that is this: I asked him how many applications he had received for the closing down of branch lines, and he said none.  I know as a matter of fact that he has received and dealt with a number of applications for the reduction of services. Naturally, one must conclude from that information given by the Minister to the House in his Second Reading that the only facts and figures which he has before him up to the present are facts and figures to justify an application for the reduction of services, and not for the closing down of the branch lines.  Will the Minister, if he is going to refuse to accept this moderate and protective amendment, give the House any figures which he has in his possession even now to justify him in making the statements which I have just read to the House and which he made in his Second Reading speech?  In other words, will he give us the information which&mdash; without any technical knowledge of the internal working of the railway&mdash; he has in his possession to justify him in saying that he will not refuse  <Col N="2464" /> application for an order to close down a number of branch lines?  I have made some inquiries into the matter, but I am not sure whether the railway companies themselves have made any case to justify the closing down of any large number of branch lines, or the doing of any of the things which the Minister, even before he has received any such applications, says he is prepared to do.  That statement of the Minister's has caused a considerable amount of alarm all over the country, especially to those who have any real knowledge of the present methods of working, and the way in which the revenue is derived by the railway company for its maintenance and existence.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister look at the map of the Great Southern Railways Company, and make certain &mdash; after having studied the map very carefully &mdash; as to the number of market towns situated on the branch lines, the number of towns where monthly fairs are held, as a result of which a high percentage of the railway revenue comes to the main line and to the company as a whole.  There is a picture of the position left in my mind as a result of the Minister's speech, and I must consider its possible effects on my own constituency. I would like Deputy Moore, who has been worrying about Baltinglass and Blessington and Tullow, to look at the matter from the same, if you like, narrow standpoint.  Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the Minister would be so foolish&mdash; if the House allows him to get these powers &mdash; as to close down the Limerick to Ballybrophy section of the railway. On that section you have three towns, Birr, Nenagh and Roscrea, where monthly markets are held, as a result of which a huge revenue is contributed to the main line from the number of wagons normally sent from those fairs and transferred on to the main line of the Great Southern Railways for the carrying of cattle traffic from Nenagh, Birr, and Roscrea to Dublin or anywhere else.  I find that the number of wagons of cattle, sheep and pigs, sent from Nenagh to Dublin or elsewhere on the main line during the year 1930 was 2,054.</P>

Assuming that it is not the policy of the Government to finally destroy the cattle rearing industry of this country, I would ask the Minister to tell the House how any alternative road service &mdash; or air service if you like &mdash; could handle the equivalent of an average of 174 wagons of cattle sent from the Nenagh fair to Dublin or anywhere else, if the Minister is allowed to get and use the powers asked for in this Bill?</P>

It is not possible to provide a road service to deal with the traffic which comes from the fair and market towns situated on the branch lines, and I suggest that if those branch lines are finally closed down by the Minister in this arbitrary <Col N="2466" /> way it will mean such a reduction in the revenue of the main railway lines of the country as will make it necessary in the future to close down the main lines as well.</P>

The amendment merely makes it compulsory on the Minister to hold a public inquiry before agreeing to the closing down of a line or a section of a line.  There is nothing unreasonable, I suggest, in any amendment which puts that forward.  I want to say to Deputy Thomas Kelly that this amendment is not put forward in any destructive way, but merely to help the Minister to achieve the object he has in view, namely to preserve the railway system of this country.</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure whether Deputy Kelly is prepared to accept the spirit of this amendment or the meaning which prompts it, but I will pay him this tribute, that unlike many other members of his own and other Parties he at least hears the case put up in support of an amendment; the Minister, in other cases, has had no difficulty whatsoever in convincing a very large section of his own members, who have not even listened to the case for or against any of these amendments.  The Minister talks about a branch railway line being uneconomic.  I wonder how does he arrive at that conclusion?  In arriving at that conclusion, does the Minister realise the contributive value to a main line of the traffic that comes to it from a branch line?  Are we to understand that the economical working <Col N="2467" /> of a railway depends on its revenue earning capacity as a whole, or upon the separate branch lines?  It would be impossible for the Minister to give figures, or for the company to present figures to him, which would prove to his satisfaction whether a particular branch line was paying or not.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to apply that kind of argument to the postal services of the country and see whether the Government takes the view that they should depend on the number of people who require a daily, bi-weekly or weekly postal service. If the Minister applied that kind of argument to the postal services of the country &mdash; I know that he would not and that no sensible Government would &mdash; where, I ask, would you have a daily, a bi-weekly, or a weekly postal service at the present time?  This section, I know, provides for an alternative road service in case a branch line is closed down by order of the Minister.  I wonder what the increased cost on the ratepayers in certain localities for the maintenance of the roads would be if the heavy traffic now carried on railway branch lines had to be carried on the roads?  The Minister talked about providing an alternative road service in case these branch lines were closed down.  He should not forget that the people, the poor pauperised individuals for whom Deputy Moore has been pleading continously in this House, have paid nothing whatever to the constructional costs of these roads, and I doubt if they are paying even now a fair percentage of the maintenance costs.</P>

I imagine, from the look on Deputy Moore's face, that his future has been <Col N="2468" /> almost confiscated during the last four or five days of this debate in Committee. We will have another opportunity of dealing with other aspects of the effects of the Minister's claim to secure these arbitrary and dictatorial powers.

      <P>The Deputy has been speaking in favour of branch lines when he should have been speaking to the amendment, which raises only the question of procedure in relation to branch lines.  The Deputy, in discussing the branch lines, starts off by quoting an extract from a speech of mine on the Second Reading debate. I want to start off my speech by quoting an extract from a speech made by the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Keyes, on the Second Reading of the Bill. He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Railways Act of 1924 only helped to make confusion worse confounded. As Deputy Norton mentioned, there are many thousands of victims who have been thrown out of employment by those who were responsible for that Act.  The Great Southern and Western Railways was then a prosperous system working its own lines, but it was compelled by that Act to take over all those little railways in Ireland.  The much-discussed Lartigue Railway was the only one that escaped coming under the panel.  The Great Southern was pulled down to the level of the animal with a tin can tied to his tail when all these lines were tacked on to it.  We have thousands of men who gave loyal services to the Great Southern Railways now idle because of that muddle.&rdquo;</P>

I want Deputy Davin to answer a question that he refused to answer before: Under what circumstances, whatsoever, would he contemplate a branch line being closed down?  If one <Col N="2469" /> passenger a week offered, would the Deputy say that one passenger was sufficient to justify the line being kept open?</P>

      <P>Is it the Deputy's point that the line should not be closed down if one passenger a week offered; that the whole service in connection with the line should be maintained because that one passenger a week offered? The Deputy asked me what I considered an uneconomic service.  In connection with one railway in this country as I learned from returns I saw quite recently, during the month of January, before the strike, now happily ended&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was unable to put anything against the cost of depreciation in rolling stock or permanent way.  It had to borrow money to pay the wages of its workers or to draw from its reserves, if it had any.  In any event, it did not earn sufficient to enable it to pay the wages of its workers or to buy the coal required for the service.  Obviously that service was uneconomic, and yet Deputy Davin expects railway services to be carried on under such conditions.</P>

      <P>No, but there are sections of the Great Southern in precisely the same condition.  Deputy Davin says, &ldquo;Let us hold a public inquiry.&rdquo;  We have done so, and all I can say is that they are the biggest joke imaginable.  The railway company came to me and represented that they wanted to reduce the service on a branch line by knocking off the 9.10 train.  I asked, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  The answer <Col N="2470" /> was, &ldquo;Because no one is travelling on it.&rdquo;  That seemed to be a good reason. There were then produced to me long tables showing the number of passengers that had travelled on that train each morning for six or seven months to justify the assertion that no one was using the train and, consequently, to support the assumption that no one wanted the train.  As soon as I proposed to take it off there were big deputations up from the district concerned asking that the train be kept on. In a couple of cases we decided to hold a public inquiry.  All those interested from all over the country came in by bus to attend the local inquiry and to urge that the railway should be kept open although not one of them had the slightest intention of ever travelling on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they were making a good joke of the whole business. What I want to say to the Deputy is this: that where the traffic that is offering, whether it be merchandise or passenger, is not sufficient to pay the ordinary working expenses of a line or section of a line, then there is a case for the shutting down of that line or a reduction of the service on it.  It will depend on the amount of traffic that is offered whether there should be a complete cessation or only a reduction of the service.  Obviously we cannot possibly maintain railways merely to provide employment for persons or to ensure that the convenience of the service will be there if the people should happen to want it when the facts demonstrate that the people do not want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was struck by one particular remark in Deputy Davin's speech yesterday, when he complained that the railway company, in certain cases through their subsidiary, had omnibuses starting from the same town at the same time as the railways.  In each case he said it was an obvious attempt to destroy the railway.  Why was it an attempt to destroy the railway?  Will not Deputy Davin admit that in certain circumstances the public prefer the road services to the rail services, and <Col N="2471" /> that if the two are available they are going to travel by road?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>We are anxious to preserve the railways, and this is a Bill to do that.  You will not do that unless you put them on a sound economic basis.  You cannot do that if all these tin-can lines that Deputy Keyes spoke about are to be kept tied on to the system, and if there is to be taken out of the receipts on the rest of the system the amount required to make good the losses on a service that nobody appears to want.  If the people want a service, and if the statistics show that they are making use of whatever service is available, then the service will be maintained.  If there is any reasonable prospect in the future that the services available on the railways will be utilised by the public, the services will be maintained.  But where they are not being utilised, and where it is obviously possible to provide cheaper transport on the road and when, by doing so, you are making the prospect of keeping the main lines open better, then there is undoubtedly a case for the closing down of these branch lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy spoke of a Ministerial order, but I pointed out to him that over by far the greater part of the railway system there is no Ministerial order to close them down necessary.  At the present time the company could shut down the branch line to Nenagh, which the Deputy mentioned, if they wanted to.  There might be a certain difficulty in connection with the Railways Abandonment Act and there might be certain <Col N="2472" /> flaws in it, but they could evade that. We propose, under this section, to say that they must maintain services; that they must maintain proportionately the same services that they maintained in the first week of January this year and that they will only be released from that where it is clearly shown that these services are not being used by the public and that the maintenance of these services is jeopardising the whole system.  The Deputy says that the branch lines should not be closed down without a public inquiry.  The Kinsale branch line was closed down, the Cork, Blackrock and Passage branch line and the Killaloe branch line were closed down without any public inquiry and, in some cases, without protest; and owing to the fact that they were not being availed of to any extent their closing down improved the prospect of the railway company being able to carry on, improved the prospects of railway employment and the whole transport system of the country generally.  Deputy Davin is asking for too much in asking that every branch line, every foot of railway line, should be kept open and that every train which can be run should be run.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking for that. I am asking that there should be a public inquiry before a branch line is closed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What can a public inquiry reveal that is not already known?  The circumstances under which a branch line would be closed would be when it was demonstrated that, over a reasonable period, the traffic offering for the line was not sufficient to meet the working costs and that the services available were not being really availed of by the public. In these circumstances an order would be issued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But it would be a matter of facts and figures.  Under the existing law, we may hold a public inquiry, but there is no obligation to hold it. The Deputy holds that, no matter how clear the facts are, we should hold an inquiry.  That is a completely unreasonable <Col N="2473" /> demand in view of the fact that for the first time the railways are to be compelled by law to maintain services over their whole system.  A public inquiry merely gives an opportunity for local politicians to make speeches.</P>

      <P>We have held such public inquiries in the past and they did not reveal one fact that was not already known, and that had not been previously taken into account.  You can easily determine whether a service is required by the public by the use the public are making of it.  That is purely a matter of facts and figures.  I can assure the Deputy that, as far as I am concerned, the balance would be weighed down in favour of keeping the railway there unless I was convinced that the maintenance of the branch line was going to jeopardise the whole system. As Deputy Keyes and Deputy Davin must realise, I am sure, if something is not done in such cases we are speeding up the day on which not alone the branch lines will be closed but the whole service.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister justify what he said on the Second Reading?  It is on page 378 of the Official Report of the 8th March.  He said: &ldquo;I might say definitely that, in my view, quite a number of the branch lines of the company must close if the railways are to survive on a profitable basis.  Most of them have been losing money since they were constructed and nearly all of them are losing money under present conditions.&rdquo;  What information had the Minister when he made that statement?</P>

Most of them have been losing money since they were constructed, and nearly all of them are losing money under present conditions. Where it seems reasonable to assume that road services can be provided <Col N="2474" /> which will serve the needs of the country, I want to tell the Dáil that I will not refuse applications for an order to close a number of these branch lines.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out also that if, in fact, we were to decide here that these lines should be kept open and, consequently, brought into the reasonable condition of repair which would justify their services being maintained for any considerable time to come, an immediate expenditure of £800,000 would be necessary, and that the railway company could not provide it.  If we were to say to the railway company here and now that these lines must be kept open for a certain number of years to come, and that they must be kept in the condition which, having regard to the public safety, they should be kept in, the railway company would be up against a proposition right now that it could not possibly get over.  The company would be up against an expenditure that it could not possibly meet, and not alone the branch lines would go but the whole lot would go.</P>

      <P>I hope the Dáil will not dismiss the proposal contained in this amendment as airily or as easily as the Minister seems to wish to dismiss it.  The Minister has been very adroit in this matter, because he is endeavouring to show that this is a proposal to keep open branch lines no matter what financial condition they are in.  That is not the proposal.  This is an amendment to ensure that there shall be an examination of the matter. I fail to see what harm it is going to do to the railway company or any other interest to have proved beyond yea or nay that the view of the railway company was right in the matter or, vice versa, that the view of the railway company was not completely justified. Now this is going to be a particularly serious matter for some parts of the country.  It is going to be a particularly serious matter for the people of the constituency which I represent, because the people there have, over a number of years, paid considerable sums of money for the maintenance of baronially guaranteed railways.  Next year they will be free of that liability, but they have got very little hope from the Minister in the opening statement he made introducing this Bill.  It seems to me that the Minister has made up his mind, quite definitely, that the branch lines must go; and it is because of the attitude of the Minister that, in my opinion, the Dáil should decide that whether the branch lines should go or not should be decided, in the only way it ought to be decided, namely by the holding of a public inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked of branch lines that cannot pay their way.  No one expects that such lines should be kept open, but there must be cases where there is reasonable doubt.  An inquiry held for two or three hours, cutting out local politicians, and getting up the facts without the examination of witnesses affords no real evidence that <Col N="2476" /> certain branch lines cannot pay their way.  The Minister talked of the public inquiry as the biggest joke imaginable. I am surprised to hear that, and I am surprised at the rapid knowledge the Minister has got on these matters since he reached a particular part of the House where he now sits.  I feel, in this particular matter, that there is a very strong case for an examination into the whole question.  It need not be a prolonged inquiry.  Very little time would suffice to get through it. The Minister talks about closing down small lines.  I would like to know how many small lines have been closed down already without any justification for the action of the company in that connection.  No steps of that kind should be taken unless it is made incumbent on the Dáil, having authority to make provision of the kind, to see that the matter is fully inquired into whenever such action is contemplated in the future.  If the Minister's attitude is to be as he indicated on this Bill, and that we are to have no safeguard, I can see no protection for the Clonakilty and Courtmacsherry and the Skibbereen and Baltimore lines.  In fact, the whole service in West Cork might be jeopardised whenever the railway company cared to do it.  I think the people should get an opportunity of putting their point of view, generally, at a public inquiry whenever the question of closing down branch lines arises.  I know there was a threat to close down certain parts of the branch railways in West Cork already, and that determination was come to in the absence of the knowledge of facts which could have been put forward at a public inquiry.  I hope the Minister will not be in a hurry in matters of this kind in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister does not take power in the Bill to compel the Great Southern Company to substitute road service for branch railway service. It is the Great Southern Railway itself that has to make the proposal.  Is there any temptation to them to make a proposal to substitute road service? It would be a great gamble, the biggest gamble in existence, if they were to avail of this section for any length of line.  They would have to provide new capital equipment.  There is this phrase &ldquo;adequate substitute.&rdquo;  They might have to face a Minister who would have very strong ideas as to what is an &ldquo;adequate substitute&rdquo; for the railway service they propose to close. They would have to provide buses and lorries.  They would have to face the uncertainty in the running of these buses, the cost of road services, and of unfavourable variation in regard to the prices of petrol and the prices of tyres. They would also have to face the demands of the Minister for Finance in regard to road taxes which a railway company going on its own permanent way would not have to face.  They are not likely to say in these circumstances &ldquo;we will go on the general highway and take our chances there.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that there will be a very small stretch of line where the railway company will substitute road service for the existing service.  Deputy Murphy may say they did so in his constituency but that was before this Bill came along.  Since this Bill has come along; it will not be so easy to make this substitution.  What I am interested to hear is how the Minister proposes to get over the difficulty that I pointed out on Second Reading. What is to be the criterion of &ldquo;adequate service?&rdquo; Does it mean service for some towns served by a branch line now closed?  Will a road service have to be attached to each one of these towns and villages, or how near must the road service run to the railway line?  Remember you have not got, in many places, a main road running parallel to the railway line.  Consequently, you might not have any road at all, serviceable or suitable, for those lorries and buses so that an &ldquo;adequate substitute&rdquo; could not be provided.  I do not know how this <Col N="2478" /> difficulty is to be got over, and before the section is passed, I should like if the Minister would be good enough to explain.</P>

      <P>I am in entire agreement with the amendment moved by Deputy Davin.  I was astonished to hear the Minister describe a public inquiry as a joke.  His conception of a joke is entirely different from mine. I was still more surprised to hear his contemptuous reference to local politicians upon whose assistance he relied, and was very glad to rely, during the recent election.  I cannot see what objection the Minister can have to this most reasonable amendment which I am sure will be, and ought to be, supported by the general body of Deputies in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment notwithstanding the quotation from my speech on the Second Reading made by the Minister, and which was not very relevant to this amendment at all. Speaking then of the prosperous Great Southern Railway, I was visualising a prosperous Great Southern Railway with its main lines and its branch lines.  I was speaking of the Great Southern Railway as it then existed. Deputy McGilligan, and those with him, who interfered did so without sufficient Governmental responsibility. The Minister did not quote my statement that nationalisation would be the only solution, and so far as you do not get that realisation you ought at least to keep as near as possible to the right line when dealing with the railways. The amendment only asks that before branch lines are closed down a reasonable inquiry will be instituted. Are we to believe that the branch lines are so unimportant as not to justify an inquiry?  Are we to accept Deputy Dillon's view that people who go to shareholders' meetings and public inquiries are only capable of discovering the colour of the directors' beards?  These are the common herd.  I am surprised to find that the Minister thinks that there can be no intelligence in the local districts, that the people who were elected members of <Col N="2479" /> public boards by a more conservative franchise than that on which we were elected must be treated in that cavalier fashion.</P>

      <P>They must not be asked whether a railway should be removed. I have no fear that the railway company will remove the line indicated by Deputy Davin from Nenagh, but I am not so sure of lines like that from Birr which serves a big town which has many fairs and markets.  There might be a reasonable temptation, as has been suggested by Deputy Moore, who has asked would any temptation be possible.  There is a temptation to the railway company and that is that the railwaymen, Deputy Good's pet aversions, with their cross-Channel unions, succeeded in wringing from the railway companies a tolerably decent standard of living which has had several inroads made upon it in recent times&mdash;eight cuts already, nine now.  That standard has not yet been reached by the disorganised workers on the transport system on the roads and there is a tendency to get back to the old inhuman conditions when the men had to work long hours for impossible wages.  The temptation for the railway company will be naturally to get on to the services where no permanent way has to be maintained, where the ratepayers will do it for them, and where they will have workers less organised, working for lower rates of wages and under poorer conditions.  That is the temptation.  I suggest that in fairness to the railway company itself and the local authorities, a public inquiry should be held, representative of the people with responsibility in the district, as set down in the amendment, where they would be entitled to be heard in all matters relative to the closing or otherwise of a branch line. That is going to be no hindrance or barrier to the Minister doing the proper thing according to the evidence laid before him.  I suggest that he should not take one-sided information from the railway companies but should have further evidence from other channels before taking the responsible and <Col N="2480" /> serious step of closing down a branch line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a pro-railway Bill brought in by a pro-railway Government.  As far as we can see, the general tenor of the Bill and particularly of this section is to put the railways on to the roads as soon as possible and give them every facility to get on to the roads and get rid of the responsibility with regard to the smaller lines. I am particularly interested in the point with regard to the inquiries because I happen to live in a town where the branch line was one of the very first to be closed down.  If adequate notice had been given, it would have been possible to reorganise trade in that district in such a way that it would perhaps be possible for the railway company to get it.  Naturally, of late years, railways, particularly these branch lines, have found themselves in a very difficult position.  I will admit that many traders and other responsible persons have not acted in support of the railways in the way they should. They naturally followed the line of least resistance and the line of least resistance with regard to the carrying trade was the facility with which goods were being transferred from door to door.  In other words, the cutting down of handling, particularly in connection with small lots of goods, and sometimes very heavy goods, made it very much easier for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the adequate facilities that must be afforded before the line can be closed down, on that particular point especially it is very necessary to have public opinion brought to bear.  It is very necessary to have the local traders and others consulted as to their requirements before deciding what is an adequate alternative service. On that account, particularly with regard to branch lines, I think it is very necessary that these inquiries should be held.  They will not be matters of any great cost and they will not be a joke, because any town that is threatened with having its railway service cut off will realise that it is a very important thing for that town and district.  There is one thing you will <Col N="2481" /> not find an adequate service for other than by the railways, and that is the proper transit of cattle.  Cattle are one of the things that cannot be carried on the roads very satisfactorily. Of course, owing to the economic war, the railway traffic in cattle has gone down considerably. The railway returns have proved that. However, that will revive again sometime or other, when some sort of political sanity returns.  I think an adequate form of road service has yet to be found which can replace goods trains for the transit of cattle.  On that account, this amendment should recommend itself to the Minister and there should be no objection to accepting it.</P>

But that is not the case he has made even in his speech this evening against the acceptance of the amendment.  The case he has made against my amendment, and the case that has convinced him and obliged him to make the speech that he made on Second Reading, is that what was a good case for the reduction of services is an equally good case for the closing of a branch line.</P>

      <P>If the Minister's mind is in the made-up-way in which he spoke, he is going to invite the company to send in applications for the closing down of branch lines, not a reduction of services, but the complete closing down of branch lines. I would not trust&mdash;that is the <Col N="2483" /> position&mdash;the Minister in view of the statements which he made in his Second Reading speech with power to make an order for the closing down of a line on application even from the railway company.  The corridors of Leinster House, as every Deputy knows, were crowded during the first ten months of the life of the present Government.  The corridors were crowded with local politicians coming in to make representations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleagues.  I remember waiting for the Minister one day with some colleagues of mine and a deputation came out from the Minister. I discovered it was a deputation from Kilrush asking for the erection of a beet factory in the nearest place to Newfoundland, in an area where no beet was ever grown. I know that the corridors of Leinster House were so crowded with deputations that Deputies could not get in. Who were on these deputations but local politicians seeing the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the people who would ask for an inquiry of this kind from the Minister would be local politicians.  If an inquiry is held on the application of the railway companies, I am satisfied that local traders who use the railway and who know the value of the maintenance of the line will be the first to go before the inquiry.  All I am suggesting is that the opportunity should be afforded people to make their case for the maintenance of a branch line.  The Minister knows that the cost of the inquiry will have to be borne by the railway company.  What is the objection then except that there is some sort of offence to the dignity of the Minister?  Before he became Minister, aye up to the last general election, he was as pliable to the requests of deputations of local politicians as any member of the Ministry. The Minister, in my opinion, was one of the ablest politicians associated with the Ministry.  He got more votes <Col N="2484" /> by false promises and did more to bring his Party into power than any other member of the Government. The proof of the false promises is the contents of these two Bills when compared with the promises he made in the House and outside the House, at street corners and cross-roads, as to the transport policy of the Fianna Fáil Party since 1929.  I would advise Deputy Kelly to read some of the speeches made by his colleague in the representation of South Dublin.</P>

If the Minister agrees to accept the amendment and to have an inquiry held in the area, and if after all interested parties have been enabled to put forward their case before the inquiry, the person holding the inquiry reports in favour of the closing of the branch line, and if the Minister confirms that order, I can give him an assurance that, as far as I am concerned, I shall never ask him to receive a deputation in protest against the making of such order.  I shall never ask him to do so if he takes the necessary steps to see that all parties have a fair chance of making their case against such an order, as the result of a proposal such as is contained in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two opposite policies before us, and I want to point out that there is a third established by the previous Act, the 1932 Act, which it is proposed to repeal.  Deputy Davin's amendment insists on a public inquiry in every case.  That is quite definite.  The amendment says that before making such order, &ldquo;the Minister shall consider all the relevant circumstances affecting the specified railway line or section of railway line ... and shall cause a public inquiry to be held.&rdquo;  The rest of the amendment by its reference to Section 10 of the Act of 1932&mdash;in this amendment it is erroneously referred to as the Act of 1931&mdash;brings in the point to which Deputy MacDermot referred, because it is there laid down that &ldquo;every public inquiry held under this section shall be held by such person and at such time and place as the Minister shall appoint and the person holding such inquiry shall have power to take evidence on oath and for that purpose <Col N="2487" /> to administer oaths.&rdquo;  It then goes on to say that &ldquo;all expenses incurred by the Minister ... shall be paid by the company owning the railway line,&rdquo; unless the Minister with the sanction of the Minister for Finance otherwise directs.  Then it goes on to give this power against irresponsible and vexatious people appearing before the public inquiry and causing trouble:</P>
      <P>The person holding a public inquiry under this section may, if he thinks proper so to do, order the costs and expenses incurred by any person of appearing or being represented and adducing evidence at such inquiry to be paid by any other person who appeared or was represented at such inquiry.</P>
      <P>In other words, there is power contained in that, by imposing costs and expenses upon vexatious people, to prevent their making a nuisance of themselves and an absurdity of the public inquiry.  Deputy Davin wants to have it that no order can be made until a public inquiry is held.  The Minister's measure wipes out the permission which was given to hold public inquiries under the 1932 Act.  I do not see why that should not have been kept.  Deputy Davin would object to it probably because it gives the Minister discretion, but I think it imposes a slight obligation.  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>the Minister may, if he thinks proper so to do, cause a public inquiry ... ... to be held</P>

      <P>If the Minister orders an inquiry to be held but only then.  The Minister obviously considers it an embarrassment to have this continuing section of an Act which gives him power, if he thinks proper, to refer a matter to a public inquiry.  I do not understand why he is so anxious to get rid of the section.  Of course it will be easy for him to say that the Dáil decided they should not have public inquiries and therefore he was not going to order another; in fact, he was not empowered to have them.  That possibly is the type of barrier he may want to erect against the local politicians who have now become so distasteful to him.  The Department, we are told, has had experience of local inquiries.  I do not think inquiries have been found to be so expensive or cumbrous or vexatious as to annoy anybody.  Local inquiries, no doubt, will be held on a matter with which we will be dealing soon in connection with the taking away of sand from foreshores.</P>

I do not know that experience shows these public inquiries to have been very obnoxious. The Minister says he does not want public inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, in relation to a majority of matters the public inquiry system is thoroughly sound; but in relation to these branch lines, which must be considered as part of a whole system, the information which will be the basis of any decision is procurable otherwise than by a public inquiry.  A public inquiry cannot add to it.  It is a question purely of what use the public was making of the service proposed to be discontinued.</P>

      <P>We have it now from the Minister that the public inquiry system has not worked badly.  I would not go so far as to say that it has been working very well, as the Minister appears to think now.  It has not, however, worked badly.  There is no case on the merits which would be sufficient to make a person abhor the idea of a public inquiry.  The Minister's defence of his attitude is in relation to branch lines.  This applies not merely to branch lines but everywhere.  It applies to every case in which the Minister will be asked to authorise the transfer of facilities given previously by train services to road services.  He says that the facts are well known elsewhere and there is no necessity for an inquiry.  But the 1932 Act gives him ample powers&mdash;&ldquo;if he thinks proper.&rdquo; I do not think he can be forced, if he has any sturdiness of character about him, to hold an inquiry.  It might be a good thing to hold an inquiry in order to expose the hollowness of a contention when it is made.  The Minister does not want to have an inquiry because he does not think an inquiry is necessary.  He is endeavouring to take away the enabling section of the 1932 Act.</P>

I would hesitate to impose on the Minister the necessity for holding an inquiry on every occasion when an order is sought. I think that would be going far too far and much beyond the necessities of the case.  I do not think Deputy Davin would be wise to press this amendment. I cannot see the necessity for getting rid of the old enabling power.  The expenses imposed on the railway company are only the expenses of the Minister's appointee, who holds the inquiry.  If there are interventions made before the inquiry, which the Minister does not think desirable, surely he can end that by a system of apportioning expenses.  He should hesitate before he takes away this power which enables him to order an inquiry if he thinks an inquiry is the proper course.</P>

When this amendment was being drafted we had in mind the provision made for the holding of an inquiry under the 1932 Act.  We concluded that a proposal such as an application from the railway company for the closing down of a branch line was of sufficient public importance to justify an inquiry being held, even in spite of the wording of the 1932 Act.

      <P>We were asking yesterday evening for greater constructive critical thought as to the position of the Irish language on the part of people who speak about the position in the schools, and the position of education generally in the schools, and we turned aside to the big position the Irish language holds in the Report of the Minister for Education.  Practically speaking, it is the main burden of his report.  Here I draw attention to the fact that we are unfortunately in the position that there is no machinery available or responsible to the House to give the people interested &mdash; as the people of the country as a whole are interested &mdash; in the saving of the Irish language as a living language, information as to how that position stood from time to time.  I was suggesting to the Minister that the Deputy who intervened might take the responsibility upon himself.  I think he would find that the people would be grateful to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking of the position of Irish in the schools, I refer again generally to the position that the Minister finds himself up against.  He explained in November last that in the whole of what is called the Irish speaking districts 422, or 41 per cent., were schools in which Irish was the medium in which the entire work was conceived or carried out, the position being that the teaching staff was not available in these districts.  We do not know when a teaching staff is going to be available in these districts which would enable the Minister to report that 100 per <Col N="2492" /> cent. of the schools in the purely Irish-speaking districts were doing their ordinary work through the medium of the natural language.  This information was provided in May last.  It was then 12 months old, having been collected with the agricultural statistics, showing the position of the language as a living language in the homes in districts called Irish-speaking districts. The information was that out of 31,545 families in these districts only in 10,775 of these families was Irish, which was the natural language of the old people also the natural language of the young people.  In 14,305 or 45 per cent. of the families in the purely Irish-speaking districts, where Irish was the natural language of the older people, it was not the natural language of the children.</P>
    <P>In 20 per cent. of the families in what are called purely Irish-speaking districts English was the natural language of the older people and the young people.  That is the linguistic conditions of the people served by the schools which the Minister says was only staffed to the extent of 41 per cent. to teach through the medium of Irish. That provides a problem to which Deputies interested in the matter might bring some constructive thought to bear, rather than serving up the suggestion that English must be wiped out of our schools.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien says that if the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission was put into force it could be done in the morning.  If the Deputy is seriously interested in putting Irish as the only language of instruction into the Irish-speaking districts, that is, in 59 per cent. of 432 schools in the purely Irish-speaking districts, will he say what part of the Gaeltacht Commission's Report put into operation at once would settle that difficulty for the Minister?  If he can we will be very grateful, and no one will be more grateful than the Minister.  When we come to the partly Irish-speaking districts, where in 11,000 homes out of 50,000 homes Irish is the sole natural language of the older people, we find that the position is very bad from the point of view of the language being <Col N="2493" /> passed on.  Out of 51,000 only in 1,000 is Irish the natural language of the children.  Although Irish is the natural language of the parents in 10,000 homes, the natural language of the children is English, and in 39,000 cases, or in 77 per cent. of the families in the partly Irish-speaking districts, English is the natural language of both parents and children.  In the areas where you have that valuable residue of the living language amongst the older people, we are told by the Minister that in eight schools alone out of 780 is Irish entirely the medium of instruction.  The Minister is entitled to any help he can get from any Deputies who have opinions as to how that state of affairs might be improved.  It is no good coming in and saying: &ldquo;Cuir Bearla amach as na scoileanna.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister again to consider the question of having a separate Irish inspectorate for those districts which may in any way be called Irish-speaking, because there is not only a definite problem there as regards the schools, but a definite problem as regards the effect the schools will have of getting the language in these districts into the day to day language of the population. It is not criticising the inspectorate in a way that is unreasonable, or not criticising them in a way that is simply critical or unhelpful to say that the inspectorate have not, in their outlook on their work, anything that would be a driving force to help them in the concentrated way in which it is necessary to have work done that would help them to get the best and the quickest method in improving the conditions in the Irish-speaking districts.</P>
    <P>I referred last night to the position in Dublin where, because of the greater number of people, you have a more concentrated opinion than elsewhere, looking to the Department of Education to give them in primary education, and also in secondary education, facilities throughout the whole educational life of the child, through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>All my experience makes me feel that there is lacking in Dublin a real appreciation of the watch and the assistance that it is necessary should be given <Col N="2494" /> from the Department of Education itself, and from some particular branch of the inspectorate, to help in every possible and quick way in having satisfactory arrangements made for giving primary education entirely through the medium of Irish to boys and girls in Dublin.  The same applies to secondary education.  I referred to difficulties in which an initial effort was made.  I said that the residue of difficulty arising from that period still lies around the primary schools of the City of Dublin that are entirely Irish-speaking. I would ask the Minister to keep a watch over the development of those schools, and to see that there is an inspectorial check on the type of child that passes into the purely Irish-speaking schools.  To give effective primary education through the medium of Irish in the City of Dublin is difficult enough, but it can be done, and is being done satisfactorily.  At the same time, it is being done under difficulties that ought to be avoided, and that will prejudice the development of primary education through the medium of Irish if they are not avoided.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself, speaking on the difficulty of developing secondary education for boys entirely through the medium of Irish, referred to one of the difficulties being the insufficient qualification of the boys in the Irish language.  If that is a difficulty in the secondary school it is also a difficulty in the primary school.  Although a preparatory school has been set up here to take non-Irish speaking infants who are intended to receive their primary education entirely through the medium of Irish, I would ask that a critical examination be made of the material coming from that school &mdash; whether boys or girls &mdash; before they are transferred to the primary schools. Again, in speaking of the difficulties in the matter of secondary education, particularly as regards boys, although the Minister mentioned a number, he did not talk of the difficulty in the matter of accommodation.  The Minister knows that there is that difficulty, and that the start made in the matter of providing secondary education through the medium of Irish for boys in the City of Dublin is being prejudiced <Col N="2495" /> by the lack of suitable accommodation. I know that it was intended to provide or help in the provision of such accommodation, and that there have been difficulties about that, but I would impress on the Minister that assistance is necessary and urgent in the matter of provision of suitable accommodation in connection with the secondary education of boys in the city, and &mdash; to harp back to primary education again &mdash; that the development of primary education through the medium of Irish, in the city particularly, is being stifled by the absence of suitable accommodation.</P>
    <P>I was told some time ago that there are 200 children unable to get into the special preparatory school in Marlborough Street through want of accommodation.  I understand that the primary school in the south side of the city &mdash; Scoil Brigidh &mdash; is also in difficulties in this connection.  In this matter, and in the review of the standard that is being attempted and the standard that is being reached in both primary and secondary schools in the City of Dublin, I would ask that there be that assistance in regard to the inspectorate which I suggest is absolutely essential in connection with the inspectorate in the Irish-speaking districts.</P>
    <P>Deputies have spoken here as to the necessity for teaching local history through the medium of Irish.  I think that that is being done, and that it is both local and modern.  I know of houses to which children come home from schools in the north side of the city, and so far as history is concerned they are quite local and quite modern; they are able to say: &ldquo;Sé Seán T. O Ceallaigh do chuir na Sasanaigh amach as Eirinn.&rdquo;  There is nothing to be complained about in the local or the modern aspect of that history.  I know it is a theory, among some people who are inclined to be careless of the standard they require, to suggest: &ldquo;Oh, any children may be put into the Irish-speaking schools, because children really learn Irish from the other children more than they do from the teachers.&rdquo;  I do not know whether <Col N="2496" /> the kind of history I speak of is learned from the other children or from the teachers but I suggest that the Minister should take an opportunity of replying on those Estimates to the demand that has been made by the national school teachers for information as to how they stand with regard to the Pensions Fund lest the history-teaching take a different turn.  There is nothing in the Estimates that are before this House from which &mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <P>May I point out to the Deputy that the Pension Fund is not under the control of the Minister for Education?  It is under the control of the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It does provide an opportunity for saying a few brief words, which would not be more out of order than some of the other things said here on these Estimates &mdash; to give the teacher a little bit of information, particularly in view of the fact that it may affect the teaching of history in the schools.</P>
      <P>I should like to revert to a matter I mentioned here before, and that is the question of physical education in the schools.  The Minister has said nothing about it, and I would like to ask him to take an interest in the matter.  Again, I repeat that it is a very one-legged business to be spending large sums of public money in looking after the health of the children from the point of view of taking out teeth, adenoids and tonsils, without having any systematic way of setting children up either afterwards or before.  There are some schools in which there is satisfactory physical instruction given, with resultant educational benefit. While a considerable amount of work has been done in the secondary schools in that matter, although the secondary schools get grants for music, choirs and so on, I do not think there is any subsidy for physical education.  I say it is a one-sided business to be training the children in the schools from the point of view of the county medical officer of health, without training them from the point of view of physical education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2497" /> The Minister, in his introductory statement, made a certain amount of reference to the position of the chief executive officer in the vocational educational schools.  He said that the chief executive officer requires to have a good education, or good experience in general matters concerned with the world; that he requires a special training in his own work, and that if he has not that it will be very difficult for him to arrange and to correlate the different courses of instruction as between the ordinary educational subjects and those that deal with industry and agriculture.  Again, he must know sufficient about schools and about students so that there will be no great difficulty in his settling any difficulty that may arise, and doing it in a sensible and understanding way.  He says that men of this kind are scarce, that we must seek them out and induce them to take up these profitable positions under the committees if we want the work of the committees to go ahead properly.</P>
    <P>Now, I subscribe to all that the Minister says with regard to the importance of the chief executive officers of vocational education committees.  I agree that they are not as plentiful in the country as we would like to see; that the experience that the Minister speaks about is necessary, and that they do require some inducement to take up the very difficult work that lies before them.  If the work of the vocational education committees is going to be brought into full connection with the industrial and agricultural life of the country, it requires a lot of improvement and a considerable drive towards progress.  I submit that the Minister's policy, he being a member of the Executive Council, puts a very serious obstacle in his getting the type of man that he is looking for.  A man looking for posts now as chief executive officer under vocational education committees, not only has to be selected after interview by a selection committee, but instead of facing a selection committee knowing that if he is the best man in the eyes of the committee that has been set up specially to deal with the matter &mdash; a committee fully qualified to make a <Col N="2498" /> selection &mdash; he will get the position, he is put by the Minister's policy into this position: that if he is selected as the best man he has to go and canvas and cadge locally not only among the members of the local vocational education committee, but to get after them through the medium of their friends, political and otherwise.  He knows all that faces him.  If unsuccessful, after running that kind of gauntlet, he has a stain on his professional escutcheon because of the fact that he was turned down by this county and that county, and perhaps another county, in looking for a position, although he may have been absolutely the outstanding man for the position, but political and local considerations were allowed to drag across the principle of appointing the best man.  I submit to the Minister that his policy is utterly detrimental to what he says he has at heart.  I would ask him to see whether a review and a change in that position would not make a satisfactory development of the work of his vocational education committees more rosy than it is, perhaps, at the moment.</P>

      <P>Traosluím don Aire mar gheall ar an óráid a thug sé as Gaedhilg ar fad.  Chuir sé áthas agus bród, ní hamháin ar Theachtaí na Dála, ach ar Ghaedhilgeoirí uile. Rinne an Teachta Ó Díolúin agus an Teachta Antóin tagairt d'abhair léighinn atá á múineadh tríd an nGaedhilg.  Ní dóich liom go bhfuil aon chúis ghearáin fén rud so.  Tá rialacha soiléire leagtha amach in a thaobh so.  In aon scoil ina bhfuil na múinteoirí oilte go leor chun múineadh do dhéanamh tríd an nGaedhilg, agus ina bhfuil na páistí ábalta ar an dteagasc san do thuiscint, is ceart agus is cóir teagasc do thabhairt tríd an nGaedhilg ach nuair ná fuil an múinteoir oilte go leor ná a ndóthain Gaedhilge ag na páistí chuige seo, ní ceart é dhéanamh.  Tá an dá choinníoll san ann.  Má tá an Roinn, no eigire no bainisteoir no aon duine eile ag briseadh na rialacha so, ní ceart é. Deich mbliana o shoin, rinneadh iarracht ar é seo do dhéanamh i seoileanna ná raibh na múinteoirí <Col N="2499" /> ná na páistí oilte go leor chuige, ach níor bhfada gur cuireadh deire leis.  Ní bhaineann na rialacha so le scoileanna na naoidhneán.  Ní bhíonn thar 300 focal Béarla no mar sin ag páiste trí bliana d'aois i scoil sa Ghalldacht, agus is cuma ce'ca as Gaedhilg nó as Béarla a tugtar an teagasc dóibh.

      <P>An saighdiúir atá taobh thiar den smaoineamh san? Rinne an Teachta Antóin tagairt don chlár agus dubhairt sé go raibh sé ró-throm.  Aontuím leis sin.  Admhuím go bhfuil an clár ró-mhór do scoil bheirte.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil an clár oiriúnach do scoil in mBaile Átha Cliath ina bhfuil múinteoir fé leith do gach rang, ach i scoileanna fén dtuaith ina bhfuil trí nó cheithre ranganna fé mhúinteoir amháin, ní ceart an clár do chur i bhfeidhm.  Tá Cumann na Múinteoirí a d'iarraidh an chláir seo do laghdú, agus tá áthas orm go bhfuil an tAire comh-choisde de mhúinteoirí agus do chigirí a chur ar bun chun an chláir d'iniúchadh.

Dá ndeintí é sin, dhéanfadh sé diobháil.  Bheadh éad i mease na scoileanna ná faghadh an aithniúint sin&mdash;rud ná fuil ag teastáil uainn.  Do mhol sé, leis, drámaíocht do mhúineadh sna coláistí oiliúna.  'Sé mo thuairim-se go bhfuil clár na gcoláistí so lán go leór fé láthair agus níl aon bhaint ag múinteoirí le cúrsaí drámaíochta.  Tá go leór le déauamh acu.  Is dóich liom gur leór dráma no dhó a léiriú 'sa bhliain, ceann um Nodlaig agus ceann um Cháisg, agus ní chreidim gur cheart drámaíocht do chur ar an gclár mar adhar léighinn.

Níl éinne i gcoinne Sacs-Bhéarla mar adhar neamh-riachtanach i gcóir na scoláireachtaí seo ach ní ceart é bheith ar an gclár mar adhar riachtanach.

      <Col N="2503" /> Cé go bhfuil sár-obair á dhéanamh ag na múinteoirí, ní samhluítear dom go dtuigeann an tAire Airgid chó comhachtach agus atá sé do réir an Bhille Sheirbhísí Puiblí a tugadh isteach cúpla lá ó shoin.  Mar gheall air sin ba mhaith liom alt do léigheamh as tuarasgabháil na Roinne i gcóir na bliana 1931:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In considering the work accomplished by teachers one must have regard to considerations other than mere proficiency and success in examinations.  The inspector, in reviewing the teacher's work, gives an important place to the teacher's function in the training of character, and to the behaviour, manners and deportment of the children.  Frequently this aspect of the teacher's work is the hardest to assess correctly. The discipline of the school is as much moral as intellectual.  There, habits are formed for good or evil. From the example of his master, from the example of his fellows, the character of the future citizen is being formed.  Will he be honest and truthful, will he be kind and courteous, will he be self-centred or will he have his life coloured by an ideal, will he be faithful to the best traditions of his race and will his outlook be Irish?  These questions will to some extent be determined by &lsquo;little nameless, unrecorded acts&rsquo; of school life, by the sympathetic guidance and friendly admonition of a good master.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this connection an inspector writes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cad a gheibheann an leanbh as an obair go léir?  Múintear cneastacht is deigh-bhéasa dhó. Múineann na h-oidí creideamh is deinid a lán dona scolaírí nach mbíonn innsint scéal air.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is fíor an méid sin agus is dóich liom go mba chóir do sna daoine meas a bheith acu, dá réir, ar obair na múintcoiri. Is eagal liom, ámh, ná fuil an meas san ar a bhfuil déanta ag na múinteoirí.</P>
    <P>Ag labhairt ar an Meastachán so anuiridh dom, do dheineas tagairt do chúrsai no hoifige féin agus don <Col N="2504" /> bheagán úsáide a baintear as an nGaedhilg i gnóthaí na hoifige.  Do scríobhadh leitreacha i mBéarla go dtí muintir na Fíor-Ghaeltachta.  Níl fhios agam an bhfuil san á dhéanamh fós ach, má tá, iarraim ar an Aire an scéal d'atharú i dtreo gur i nGaedhilg a scríobhfar gach leitir a seolfar chun na Gaeltachta feasta.  Ní haon mhaith an Roinn a bheith ag gríosadh na múinteoirí agus na bpáistí mar gheall ar an nGaedhilg mara mbaintear úsáid aisti in Oifig an Oideachais féin. &ldquo;Dein mar a deirim, ach ná dein mar a dheinim&rdquo;&mdash;sin é an scéal atá ag an Oifig í gcúrsaí gnótha.</P>
    <P>Dheineas gearán anuiridh agus tá an gearán céanna le déanamh agam i mbliana&mdash;ná tugann an Roinn solas no léargus do sna múinteoirí i dtaobh modh múinte na Gaedhilge.  Do gealladh dúinn go dtabharfaí &ldquo;notaí&rdquo; dhóibh ach ní bhfuaradar léas solais i dtaobh an scéil ón oifig fós.  Is mithid tosnú ar an rud san do dhéanamh.  Tá gearán le déanamh agam i dtaobh na tuarasgabhála a cuirtear amach gach bliain ón Roinn. Bíonn na tuarasgabhála so tur agus tirim agus ní bhíonn ann ach freagraí ar cheisteanna oifige.  Go minic sé deir cigirí ná: &ldquo;Ní dheineann na múinteoirí so&rdquo;; no: &ldquo;Ní dheineann na múinteoirí siúd.&rdquo;  Ní fios cá bhfaghann na cigirí an méid eolais atá acu ar na múinteoirí.  Rachaidh cigire chun scoile áirithe uair na dhó sa bhliain agus níl fhios agam conus a gheibheann sé an t-eolas ar na rudaí a dheineann an múinteoir agus ar na rudaí ná deineann sé taobh amuigh d'obair na scoile.  Is beag ná go dtugtar masla dos na múinteoirí uile ó am go h-am ins na tuarasgabhála so.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na eigirí, tá na múinteóirí lán-tsásta le na bhfurmhór ach tá cigirí ann atá ró-dhian agus atá tugtha do locht fháil.  Sean-ghearán iseadh é sin.  Rud eile, níl na cigirí chó cabhruitheach agus ba chóir.  In ionad a bheith ag scríobhadh gearáin sna leabhra, ba chóir don chirgire dul don gelár-dubh, píosa cailce d'fháil agus a theasbáint don mhúinteóir conus an locht do leigheas.  Sin rud ná deintear.  Tá céard na cailce caillte acu.  B'fheidir nách ar na <Col N="2505" /> cigirí atá an locht ar fad, ach ar an slí oibre.  Bíonn orra a lán oibre do dhéanamh seachas cigireacht.  Bíonn orra páipéir do scrúdú le haghaidh teastas na n-oidí agus le h-aghaidh scoláireachtai do leanbhai na mbunscol. Dubhairt cigire liom gur chaith sé an tríú cuid den bhliain ag gabháil d'obair seachas cigireacht.  Más fíor é sin, ní ceart é.  Má tá an méid sin oibre le déanamh ag cigire, ní féidir do bheith chó dúthrachtach agus ba chóir i n-obair na scol.</P>
    <P>Mholfhainn don Aire an taos scoile d'árdú go dtí 15 bliana déag ó thosach na scoil-bhliana seo chughainn. Fágann leanbhí an scoil anois ar shlánú na 14 bliana dóibh agus ní ar foghnamh a chaitheann siad a saoghal go minic.  B'fhearr go mór dóibh beith ar scoil ná bheith ag seasamh ag cúiní sráide.  Rud eile tá droch-bhéas ag lucht gnótha agus lucht monarcain leanbhaí a chur ag obair de bhrigh ná bionn orra ach beagán tuarasdail a thabhairt dóibh.  Tá de thorradh ar seo gur minic leanbh ag obair i n-áit duine fásta.  Ní rud maith don tír é sin.  Tá fhios againn go maith go bhfuil ceal oibre ag luighe go dian ar an dtir seo fé lathair agus aon obair atá le fagháil ba cheart é thabhairt do dhaoine fásta comh fada agus is féidir sin.  Is minic indiu gurab é an leanbh i n-ionad an athar a chimeádann a tig suas.  Ní rachaidh san chun tairbhe na tíre agus ba chóir deire a chur leis.  Dá ndeineadh an t-Aire an t-aos scoile d'árdú bheadh sé ag déanamh a chion féin chun an scéil do leigheas.</P>

    <P>Amendment 39, Debate resumed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of this discussion, Deputy McGilligan was endeavouring to make a case for the adoption of the middle course policy which he quoted from the 1932 Railway Act as being the best course to adopt in case of any applications coming before the Minister for the closing down of a branch line.  As I <Col N="2506" /> briefly pointed out, before the closing of the debate, we considered this matter very fully before the amendment was drafted and had in mind the provision that was inserted in the 1932 Act for dealing with applications of this kind. I would not have pressed this matter so strongly, nor do I think any members of this Party would have pressed it so strongly, were it not for the very positive attitude adopted by the Minister in regard to this matter on the Second Reading debate and were it not for the very positive statements made by the Minister that he was satisfied that a large number of branch lines should be closed down, and would be closed down by him, if applications came before him.  Were it not for that attitude, I do not think we would have pressed this matter so strongly, or perhaps have felt so strongly about it.  I was not, of course, anticipating the attitude which was adopted by the Minister in this amendment, namely, that he looked on all local inquiries as a joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Where did I say that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister did say that, and I think that if he takes the trouble to read the Official Report of the previous debate he will find that the report will confirm what I say. However, I do not want to misrepresent the Minister.  At any rate, he said &ldquo;a public inquiry merely gives an opportunity for local politicians to make speeches.&rdquo;  I might remind the Minister that local politicians are the people who built up his own Party and the people on whom all Governments or Parties have to rely to get them into office and to keep them there.  However, I do not think that the local politicians would be the only class of people to come before an inquiry or to demand an inquiry of this kind.  If an application comes before a railway company for the closing down of a branch line, I think that such an application naturally would be bound to create a very live interest for the local traders and merchants who use that branch line, for the workers employed on the branch line whose livelihood would be likely to be involved by the closing down of the line, and for the people in the market towns situated on these lines <Col N="2507" /> whose produce is carried on them.  I think that the local ratepayers would be inclined to take a considerable interest in the proposed closing down of the line, because, naturally, they must conclude that the closing down, after the application of the company was confirmed by the Minister, would be bound to mean an increased rate for the upkeep and maintenance of the roads that would be the only alternative means of transport for the people who formerly used the railways.  This proposal has been turned down because the Minister looks upon public inquiries as a joke.  Although there might be, to some extent, some justification in the Minister's mind, perhaps, having in view some peculiar or exceptional experience, I think that local inquiries are justifiable from the point of view that they allow to local people the democratic right to decide certain matters in which they may be personally and financially interested.  Would a public inquiry into an arterial drainage scheme, for instance, be a joke, or could a public inquiry into anything of that kind be reasonably regarded as a joke?  When a member of the public is financially interested in any matter, where his pocket is likely to be affected, the Minister may make certain that such a person will go before these local inquiries and give whatever evidence is in his possession to prevent the Government or anyone else from piling up additional charges or putting him to unnecessary additional expense. I think that it is the proper democratic procedure to adopt, and that it is a policy which the Minister should encourage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot, rushing in as Leader of the Centre Party, of course, as he has done on certain occasions, to save the Minister from defeat, refers to this as a local inquiry.  The amendment proposes that an inquiry should be held on the order of the Minister, and any persons, bodies, or trade unions who or whose members claim to be affected, may appear before the person holding such inquiry.  The people going before that inquiry would <Col N="2508" /> not be a collection of publicans and local politicians and people of that kind.  The person appointed would be a person with some sense of responsibility and would be able to give a proper report as to the merits or demerits of the matter, and it would not be publicans or local politicians or people of the kind, whom the Minister does not want.  We stand, on an important matter of this kind, for the right of people who are interested to go before some local body, that body to hear the evidence, and the Minister to have the duty of appointing the person to hold the inquiry and give the report. I think that I can give the Minister positive assurance that if, after having gone through that procedure, he eventually decides to close down a branch line.  I would not be one of the Deputies, after his adoption of such a procedure, to trouble him with any representations or the reception of any deputations of the kind which the Minister says he does not want to receive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputy, under these circumstances, would undertake not to bring deputation. Our experience has been that a local inquiry adds no information and does not satisfy anybody.  The inquiry is held and the same deputations come and the same representations are made. The only question is whether these representations should be got by a local inquiry or not.  I think that the importance attached to a local inquiry is entirely exaggerated.  Everybody who is interested will make whatever representation they have to make beforehand and they will be given every opportunity to do so and it is only following full investigation that the line would be closed down.  A local inquiry should not be insisted upon because it involves some expense, a considerable amount of trouble, and leads nowhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister anticipate that there will be many applications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (An Clár) Mr. P. Hogan (An Clár)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(An Clár): The Minister took as his text that we must look on the whole system as a unit, and he says that it is on that basis he is working. <Col N="2509" /> Let us take the case of the baronially guaranteed lines.  The Minister thinks the railway company should have the option of closing down a line.  Do they take the whole system as a unit when the ratepayers have to meet the alleged deficit on the baronially guaranteed lines?  Do they take into account that these baronial lines helped them to make a profit and, when it is alleged that there is a deficit on a local unit of a railway, is that what the ratepayers are now to get&mdash; that after paying for lines on railways that, probably, some of them never saw, that the trade which the baronial lines brought is not to be taken into account but now to be taken as part of the general scheme and to be closed down, forsooth, because the general system thinks they are not worth while to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me put it this way.  Take the case of the Great Southern Railways line, where it meets the traffic from Clare at Limerick.  Has the traffic that comes by water along the Shannon been considered, or will it be considered&mdash;the traffic that comes by water and is picked up at Limerick by the Great Southern Railways line?  Will that be taken into account in considering the deficit of the baronially guaranteed lines?  If we are going to have an inquiry with reference to tourist places, will nobody have any arguments to advance to see that these lines should not be closed?  Is the Minister aware that there are many places that will not lend themselves to road traffic to these particular districts?  Is he aware that in many of these districts the roads cannot be used because of their boggy nature? Are we simply to add up the traffic for a particular line and to say that because a particular bit of that line does not pay it is to be closed down whether the people on that particular bit of the line are to be mulcted or not.  Is that a calculation that has to be made?  Are we to consider another line of argument?  In a health resort, for two or three years past, perhaps, there may have been some falling off in the traffic to that district possibly because of some alleged insanitary arrangements, or want of a proper <Col N="2510" /> water supply.  Are we to take that as a criterion as to whether the branch line in that district is to be closed down or not?  Is it to be on the basis of a three years' traffic?  I think there is a great deal to be said for having the local people examined at such an inquiry, and having the members of the local council and the merchants and the hotel keepers heard, and allowed to put forward their views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously people cannot be coming up on deputations to the Minister from my constituency. Kilrush is an important place upon the map, and before branch lines to it are closed down I hope that the people will get consideration, and that the people of Kilkee will also get consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. John Flynn Mr. John Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. John Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider very carefully and to keep in mind the importance of this question of local inquiries.  In Kerry we have a branch line to Cahirciveen which is paying its way, and we have a baronial guaranteed system on the Dingle line which is not paying its way.  Are the people of that district to be deprived of that service after their 35 years' expenditure upon that line?  They had to pay high rates during all those years in contribution to the upkeep of that line.  The line is certainly important to the district.  It would be a hopeless state of affairs if the people of that district were to be deprived of their railway, especially where the roads do not lend themselves to the traffic that would be required for the transport of goods if the line were closed down.  It would be a terrible state of affairs if no provision was made to obviate the closing down of a line like that.  We in Kerry take a very serious view of it. We object to calling a railway line such as I have described, a tin pot business, as Deputy Keyes did.  I hope whatever branch lines are closed down the <Col N="2511" /> Minister will give very special consideration to the needs of the outlying districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see why the Minister would not accept Deputy Davin's amendment.  I would draw his attention to the fact that there are a number of important residential quarters within a dozen miles of Cork that have been very badly hit because of the closing down of the Cork and Passage Railway.  That line was closed down because it was considered uneconomic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And the railway company had not to ask anyone's permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>They might try that on other lines also.  I cannot understand why the Minister does not accept the suggestion in this amendment.  The I.O.C. with the best possible intentions, cannot cater for the people who wish to go to the seaside resorts in the summer.  That outlet is at present cut off, in the district in Cork I have mentioned.  Between 5,000 and 6,000 people used to be conveyed to the seaside every year when that line was in existence.  If we are to gather anything from precedent it means that more branch lines will be closed down in the future.  There is nothing to stop the Minister.  He is looking at the whole system as a unit.  I should like to draw an analogy in this matter.  The Minister is a business man and has had a good business training.  He must know that even in the drapery trade where there might be five or six departments it may be found that one is not paying, or to use a much hackneyed phrase, it may be found to be uneconomic.  Is that a reason why the directors should abandon that department altogether? If that were to hold good in all business undertakings, I am afraid we would be all specialists and we would have specialisation carried so far that one house would only sell gloves and another ladies' silk stockings.  I suggest there is a practical analogy between the ordinary business enterprise and the railway system.  Is it because one branch line, like a department in a drapery store, is found to <Col N="2512" /> be non-paying that it must be closed down?  I subscribe to what the Minister said as to treating this as a unit, but taking an ordinary enterprise&mdash;a dry goods store &mdash; would the directors because branch &ldquo;A&rdquo; was not paying decide to get out of gloves or boots or some other commodity in that particular line of business?</P>
      <P>I feel sure if the Minister would look into the matter, at greater length, he would see there is nothing extraordinary in asking that an inquiry should take place and not an inquiry of parish politicians from Ballydehob and other places such as Deputy Hogan comes from.  I do not want to treat this matter with any levity, but, seeing that there are so many factories to be started, under the ægis of the present Government, I think we would want to be increasing branch lines to places where they are growing wheat and where beet factories and so on are to be set up.  They are only potential factories, I know, but, at the same time, I ask the Minister to give further consideration to the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used the phrase I would like to relate better to the circumstances.  When one of the last speakers was addressing the House he interjected a remark: &ldquo;They can do this without the leave of anybody at the moment.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was brought into the discussion on the application for an order and whether that should be followed by a public inquiry.  I understood the Minister, when bringing in amendment 36, to be quite precise, but quite different from his interjection.  I think the situation for the future is still this: that over a big section of the line if the railway company by reason of traffic think fit to discontinue a service they are at liberty to do it without applying to the Minister for an order at all.</P>

      <P>Let me put it positively in another way.  The only time when an application for an order must come to the Minister is when the railway company decide that they are going to carry certain traffic, still offering, by road rather than by rail. The House should remember the other point, that the power is still being left to the railway company, and I hope it will continue to be left to them, that if by reason of diminution of traffic they have to deplete services over a big portion of their line they are at liberty to do it without applying to the Minister for any order.  There is no local inquiry or order of the Minister necessary for that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The point raised is that it has hitherto not been compulsory, or the custom, to allow compensation in cases of redundancy where loss of traffic has caused disemployment.  Where the redundancy could be proved to be due to the consequences of amalgamation, <Col N="2517" /> compensation was enforced by the 1924 Act.  When it became unnecessary to employ certain hands because traffic had disappeared, the compensation has not been enforced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not payable under this Bill.  Sub-section (e) provides that where the railway company, by a change of policy, causes redundancy, that is by putting upon the roads traffic which was previously carried by rail, thus closing down or reducing railway services, compensation shall be paid to the employees rendered redundant in consequence.  In so far as railway employment may change because the volume of traffic decreases, or anything like that, the sub-section does not apply.  It applies where an order is made for the closing or reduction of services on a line in consequence of the decision of the railway company to carry traffic, heretofore carried on the line, by road.</P>

Could the Minister give any idea as to whether it would be possible for a man who may be redundant to receive compensation through the channel indicated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, that has been deleted by a subsequent amendment and the conditions are set out in the Bill.  I admit there is a difficulty at the moment, due to the fact that a constitutional point has been raised. Until that point is settled by the court, the position will stand as it is. It is not a point that we could remove by legislation.  It is a question in regard to the arbitrator.  Until the decision of the court is made known, or until a constitutional amendment of very great complexity is carried. the situation must remain as it is.  I admit the delay in coming to a decision <Col N="2519" /> by the court has caused considerable hardship, but I have no means of expediting that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in full sympathy with the views of Deputies in this connection.  It is a point about which one can feel very strongly but unfortunately there is no machinery open to us to redress the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister look into a point that is analogous to the point raised by Deputy Thrift.  To answer it he will require to read together the Third Schedule of the 1924 Act and the amendment as established under the Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Act of 1926 and also to some slight degree the Second Schedule of the amendment to which we have now come.  The scheme of the Third Schedule and its later amendment was this, that if there was a servant in one of the absorbed or amalgamating companies and if he were not taken into the service of the amalgamated company, certain things began to operate in his favour.  We are moving to a position where still the amalgamated company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for this amendment and the putting of the Schedule into the amendment arises out of the fact that there are other railway companies affected by the situation other than the Great Southern Railways.  That was the original intention of making a reference to the 1924 Act.  We have now <Col N="2520" /> got to put in a separate and distinct Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>My point still remains.  Supposing the railway company operates a lorry service.  I want to confine my remarks to the Great Southern Railways Company.  Suppose they operate a road service.  Can they operate that hereafter on any basis other than a road service operated by the amalgamated company because if there is the slightest divergence I am not sure whether the provisions about hiring would not apply.  If that is possible then persons offered employment in one of these out-services would not be offered employment under the amalgamated services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not provide for that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it provided for it under the scheme of the Schedule of the 1924 Act.  If you are offered alternative employment in the service of the amalgamated company that prevents a claim for compensation. I thought that lorry services run by the Great Southern Railways Company would be regarded as part of the amalgamated company and these people would be covered.  However, the thing is much wider.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 45:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) (e) line 10, page 8, after the word &ldquo;company&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;in anticipation of the making of or.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was referred to during the Second Reading discussion, when members of this Party endeavoured to point out to the Minister that under the wording of the sub-section, as it now stands, it would be possible immediately before a branch line was closed down for the company to reduce the staff on such a branch line to skeleton form.  The employees could be transferred to the main line from the branch line subsequent to the closing of the branch line, and they would then have no claim to compensation under the terms of the Bill.  Notwithstanding <Col N="2521" /> the fact that they would not be entitled to any compensation as a result of a manipulation of this kind, which is not unheard of, they might be dismissed by the company as being redundant after the branch line had been closed down.  The Minister invited us to suggest another form of words to safeguard the position of men who might be dealt with in that way.  The additional words suggested in the amendment would cover people who might be otherwise sacrificed and who might be removed from the branch line service immediately before it was closed down, deprived of compensation and, perhaps, subsequently dismissed without compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point is that the Deputy's amendment does not alter the meaning of the section.  I fully examined it, and it is quite clear that the interpretation of the section is not changed.  The words &ldquo;services being rendered redundant by steps taken by such railway company under the authority of such Order&rdquo; mean precisely what they would mean if the Deputy's amendment were accepted.  I do not think it is possible to get any form of words in this connection which could not be evaded if there was a deliberate attempt at evasion, and the only thing I can do is to give the Deputy this assurance, that if I were to find that the obligations of this lettered paragraph (e) were being evaded by the railway company, in consequence of an Order made under the Bill, it would have a very definite bearing on the administration of the Bill.  In other words, it is unlikely in these circumstances that any additional Orders would be made until any attempt at evasion of the Order were put right.  In view of the fact that the power given is a continuing power, in one respect I do not anticipate that the Deputy's fears are well-founded. Where something is done, having been done, that ends it.  But where something is being done now, as only one step in a general scheme that will involve something being done later on, I do not think the same danger arises.  Consequently I <Col N="2522" /> think the surest safeguard is to see by administration that no injustice is done, that the idea behind the section is put into effect.  I can give the Deputy an assurance that if I find that idea being defeated, a very definite state of affairs would arise in relation to the administration of the whole measure.  The Deputy's amendment does not meet the point really.  I am advised that the section as drafted does meet the point of people being disemployed before the Order does come into effect, that such people can apply &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>For transfer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For compensation on the ground that their dismissal arises out of an Order, even though the dismissal followed on a transfer before the Order from the line that is being closed to some other part of the system.  The words which the Deputy suggests would cause a certain amount of ambiguity and certainly would not improve the section in any respect.  It would have precisely the same meaning. I think a better safeguard is the assurance which I am giving the Deputy in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing the railway company decides that it is going to make application to the Minister three months hence for the closing of a branch line.  With the object of reducing the amount of compensation which would be payable it might decide to transfer four railway clerks engaged on clerical work on the branch line, to Dublin.  Three months hence it would make application to the Minister for an Order to close the line.  Six months afterwards these four railway clerks who were transferred to the head office in anticipation of the making of the Order might be dismissed. Does the Minister say &ldquo;in anticipation of the making of or&rdquo; has no greater strength than &ldquo;under the authority of&rdquo; in a case of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be quite open to the clerks to argue that their dismissal was in consequence of the order and that they would be thus entitled to compensation.  There will be all <Col N="2523" /> sorts of borderline cases which it will be the duty of the arbitrator to decide. It is quite clear to me that it is open to them to submit that argument and, if they are in a position to sustain it, they will be entitled to compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in accepting the Minister's assurance, but the question regarding their rights to compensation after the branch line has closed down will depend entirely on the arbitrator, who will pay due regard to the meaning of every word in this sub-section.  That is the difficulty that I see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This applies to any of the companies in the Saorstát, and if an attempt were made on behalf of any one company to evade the obligation contained in paragraph (e) after an order is made in relation to that company, there would be a definite change of policy and quite possibly additional legislation here.  That is the best assurance I can give the Deputy. What is in the section is, I think, quite clear.  Anybody rendered redundant in consequence of a reduction of service brought about by an order, is entitled to compensation.  That is quite clear. If, on a quibble, an attempt were made to deprive a person who clearly should <Col N="2524" /> get compensation from getting compensation, then we would have an entirely new situation.  The policy would be affected and it would give rise to the prospect of additional legislation in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite see that the Minister is going as far as he can go with his assurances in a positive way; but of what value are those assurances to members of the staff who may lose their positions and, having lost their positions, may lose the compensation which the Minister now declares they should get?  They will have no means of recovering their employment or obtaining compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I said there might be a prospect of additional legislation.  It is quite clear that if I were to find something of that kind happening, the first step to be taken would be, by representation to the company, to endeavour to secure redress of the position.  In the event of that not taking place, and in the event of people being deprived of the rights that I consider under the section they are properly entitled to, then it would be a matter of how they would get compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

Supposing by reason of the economic position of one of these lines it is necessary in order to keep the line open to dismiss certain employees.  Supposing that later, because of failure in the endeavour to keep the line open, an order is issued to close down the line &mdash; let us take it the order is made six months subsequently &mdash; would the employees whose services had been dispensed with make an effort to claim compensation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking at it from the point of view of the railway company. There are two sides to this question.  The position is that already there is a very heavy pension list; there is a very heavy obligation to discharge the pension list lying on the railway company.  It appears to me that in view of what the Minister has now stated, the closing of a line, instead of being a certain advantage to a railway company, will now become a very questionable advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What the arbitrator will have to decide is whether or not the dismissal arose out of the decision to close the line.  If it did, then compensation is payable, but if it did not, there will be no compensation.  It is <Col N="2526" /> quite clear what the liability of the company is.  It is a liability to pay compensation to any employee who loses his employment in consequence of the decision of the company to substitute a road for a rail service.</P>

      <P>It relates to the compensation to be paid and to superannuation allowances to employees whose services will be dispensed with owing to a discontinuance of services on certain sections.  As far as it goes, that amendment is very good, but it does not cover all the cases.  It does not cover the cases of men in the service <Col N="2527" /> of the railway company who were interned in 1922 and 1923.  When these men were released they were refused employment, being informed that owing to their political activities they could not be granted the allowances they were entitled to under the terms of their agreement.  For a period of 540 days a sum of money was withheld from them.  In that way a break occurred in their period of service, which, I hold, is dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to superannuation owing to a break in the services by money being withheld and the agreement not being adhered to by the employers, thus interfering with their superannuation rights.  I ask the Minister to see that under the amendment these men will be safeguarded.  I go so far as to say that the railway company should be compelled to pay them back the amount which was withheld. A fine of 1/- a day was imposed and was withheld for 540 days.  The other provision was that the men should get a clearance certificate from an Officer in the Army.  Some of these men were not employed until 1924.  The curious thing is that men in the same type of service, and having the same experience and qualifications, who served in the National Army, were not put to this test when they came back, and no such fine was imposed upon them.  At this stage, I maintain that the men I am referring to should get the justice to which they are entitled.  Under Cumann na nGaedheal, which in most respects was a rotten system of Government, we can prove that the men who were in the National Army and who came back were not deprived of these sums of money and were not denied the justice which was denied to the men I am referring to.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the matter, and to compel the railway company to restore the rights which were interfered with owing to the break that occurred in their service during internment for 18 months.</P>

      <P>I do not know what is <Col N="2528" /> the position concerning the sums of money due to the railway men, but this has nothing to do with the conditions that the Deputy speaks of.  If the Deputy gives me information I will have the matter looked into.  It is quite clear that any time spent on active service in 1922 or 1923 or in internment is reckoned as service for compensation for men who served pre-truce or who were interned until the end of 1923.  That period of internment is reckoned as service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that because he had discovered that the Third Schedule of the 1924 Act and a later amendment applied to the Great Southern Railways he had to move to amend the provisions of the section.  He wants now to extend it to further bodies to which this measure will be applicable, in addition to the Great Southern Railways. I understood him to say that what he had done is to be embodied in the Second Schedule by amendment 65.  The provisions of the amending Act No. 25 of 1926&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We adopted the relevant parts of the provisions of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is that compensation shall be payable, whether by way of gratuity or otherwise, for years of service.  The clause says &ldquo;certain people shall be entitled to be paid compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Second Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;  Then we get this new point introduced and the provisions of the Third Schedule of the Principal Act as amended by the Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Act, 1926, &ldquo;relating to arbitration shall apply to claims for compensation made against any amalgamated company.&rdquo;  I want to query the use of the phrase, &ldquo;of the provisions of the 1926 Act relating to arbitration.&rdquo;  When I look at the Act there is one section towards the end with the headline &ldquo;Powers of Arbitrator.&rdquo;  That was clearly brought in.  Section 2 of the Act of 1926 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2529" /> Every officer and servant... shall, if his services are dispensed with by the amalgamated company within seven years after the passing of the Principal Act... on account of his services having become unnecessary in consequences of changes in administration due directly to the amalgamation and absorption of companies effected by or under the Principal Act and not shown by the amalgamated company to have been caused by decrease of traffic, reduction of renewal or maintenance work...</P>
    <P>the person shall become entitled.</P>
    <P>Further to that there is a clause which states that if any dispute or question arises there may be an appeal to the standing arbitrator.  Does the phrase &ldquo;the provisions relating to arbitration&rdquo; drag in not merely that arbitration board, and not merely that reference to the arbitrator, but also the terms and conditions on which arbitration may be resorted to?  In other words, if the question at issue or in dispute is whether or not men's services have been dispensed with because of a reduction in traffic, is that the matter hereafter which will come before the Board of Arbitration under the 1926 Act?  Does the reference to the provisions relating to arbitration drag in not merely the arbitration board, and not merely that there might be reference to arbitration, but that there might be enough to satisfy what is laid down in the Act of 1926?  The second question is: Does this method of giving compensation by a reference more or less to the earlier Act achieve this object?  Is there anything to decide that the consequences of the change of administration were due directly to the amalgamation or absorption of the company affected under the principal Act?  Of course that is an entirely inapplicable criterion at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is whether a person has been dismissed in consequence of an order made under this Act, and if so to what extent the compensation provisions are applicable to him.  All the rest <Col N="2530" /> comes in &mdash; that the terms and provisions of the 1926 Act relating to arbitration shall apply to all claims for compensation under those Acts.  It brings all that in, and I do not think there is any possibility of evading it. I do not clearly follow what the Deputy's difficulty is in that connection. It seems to be an abstruse point, and I must say I did not quite get it.  What I set out here is that in the different circumstances, namely, the different occasions for the redundancy, the same provisions relating to arbitration operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to put the point more clearly.  Let me confine myself to the part of the section, as amended, which deals with the 1926 Act.  That reference is merely this &mdash; I think I am reading the last part of it correctly, as the section will appear hereafter&mdash;&ldquo;the provisions of the Third Schedule of the Principal Act as amended by the Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Act, 1926, relating to arbitration shall apply to all claims for compensation made under those Acts.&rdquo;  The application of the Third Schedule, as amended, of the 1926 Act, is to be limited to the provisions relating to arbitration. What are these?  The special provision, Section 8 of the 1926 Act, said certain things about that.  The only other reference to arbitration is in Section 2 of the 1926 Act.  Sub-section (2) of Section 2 says: &ldquo;If any dispute or question shall arise between the amalgamated company and any officer or servant of the amalgamated company on any matter arising under this section, such officer or servant may appeal to the standing arbitrator.&rdquo; On what?  On any dispute or question arising between the amalgamated company and any officer or servant of the company on any matter arising under the section.  What matter could arise under the section?  The matter mentioned in sub-section (1) of Section 2, that is where a man's services have become unnecessary in consequence of changes of administration due directly to the amalgamation.  That is no longer at issue.  How then do they get a footing before the arbitrator?  The <Col N="2531" /> second part of the clause in which reference was made to the arbitrator is only incidental.  The first question that had to be discussed was whether a man's services had become unnecessary in consequence of changes of administration.  The second part of the clause only arises as a rebuttal to the first point, namely, whether the services were unnecessary owing to the amalgamation; but the first point can never arise.  How then does this come into force?</P>

In addition to the matters that arise on the last section amendment 46 provides that claims for compensation arising under this Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Amendment 46 says that the provisions relating to compensation payable by the company under this Act shall apply in like manner as such provisions apply to claims for compensation made against the amalgamated company under those Acts.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has admitted that the application of clause (e) of sub-section (3) is going to affect quite seriously the advantages given to the company with reference to the uneconomic parts of <Col N="2533" /> their land, and sub-section (4) proposes to impose very serious restrictions on the company's present powers.  At present in certain parts of the lines they are free to discontinue the service, and the Minister proposes to take away that power from them.  I just wish to point out that in so doing he is going to take away the greater part of the advantages which he proposes to give the company.  It will be a most serious disability, and there appears to be no reason why such further restrictions should be put upon them in a Bill in which the Minister professes to confer benefits on the railway company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy of course must take into account the fact that in this legislation we are also putting the railway companies in a position to acquire an effective monopoly of transport services, and what, in effect, we say to them here is that if they get that monopoly they must supply the services.  They cannot leave the country without transport facilities. In effect, what sub-section (4) as amended says is this: You may increase or decrease the services according to the traffic offering without any reference to the Minister or without any part of this section operating, but if you decide to cease the services altogether or to reduce them so that, in proportion to the traffic offering, they are less than they were in the first week of January this year, then certain conditions operate.  One is that they must provide an alternative road service in adequate volume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  In effect, what we are saying to the railway company is this: We are assuming that the conditions created by this Bill are going to enable you to get a monopoly. In these circumstances they are not merely going to benefit by that situation, but we are putting on them this obligation: that they must provide in each part of the country the services that are required.  We say, in effect, to the railway company: you were providing a railway service of a certain <Col N="2534" /> magnitude in the first week of January this year.  You must continue a railway service, as regards convenience and volume, having regard to the traffic offering, not less than what you provided in the first week of January this year.  If you decide to shut down or to reduce the service so that the public convenience is definitely lessened, then you must get a Ministerial order, and at the same time provide on the roads a compensating service that will ensure that the public convenience will be met, and also provide compensation for redundant employees.  That is the effect of the section.  In a sense it is putting an additional obligation on the company.  As the Deputy said, they could in fact at the present time close a great part of their system. They are under no statutory obligation to maintain the services on it. There is some doubt as to whether they could abandon the railway, but they could undoubtedly reduce the service to a train a week without breaking any statutory obligation. Now they will be required to keep a service going on all the system in the circumstances I have mentioned similar to that operated in the first week of January this year unless they get a Ministerial order to the contrary: that is unless they satisfy the public authorities that it is in the public interest to do so, and unless they provide an alternative road service in equal volume and compensate the employees rendered redundant. We do not think it is unreasonable they should do that as we will have to rely on them entirely for our transport convenience in the future.</P>

      <P>Amendment 49 proposes that the service to be maintained upon the system, or any part of the system, shall have the same relation to the traffic that is offering as the service in the first week of January had to the traffic that offered then.  I grant to Deputies that is not very easy to follow, but I think I can make it somewhat clearer.  In effect, it means this, that if only half the number of passengers are ordinarily travelling, or only half the volume of merchandise is ordinarily being offered as against the number of passengers and volume of merchandise in the first week of January of this year, then the railway company can reduce their services roughly by half without any order, but if the number of passengers travelling and the volume of traffic offered is reduced to half, and they want to stop the service altogether, then in the first place they must get an order and provide a road service to convey the half that is left.</P>

I recognise that in this correlation between traffic services and changes in traffic demands you must take some particular period.  I do not know why the Minister took the first week in January.  It does not matter much, I imagine, unless you were to take a period which did happen to go before some particularly important changes in the company's services.

      <P>I get muddled and I do not think I can be blamed for getting muddled because there have been four destructive amendments of the first point.  I assume that it is correct that the phrase &ldquo;service of trains&rdquo; has disappeared from sub-section (4) and, consequently, that there is not imported into it the idea which is at the back of the definition of &ldquo;service of trains&rdquo; as given in amendment 36, which was that you could not take the traffic off the railway and put it on the road without a Ministerial Order?</P>

      <P>The sub-section as it stood said, or I think this was the general import of the sub-section, that some period in the month of January was taken as the normal period.  It used to be the last seven days and it is now the first seven days of January. It was assumed that the railways were running a service of trains which was only just economical at that time for the traffic which was then offering. Of course, that first argument can be shown to be a falsity.  I think that one <Col N="2538" /> of the railway companies argued that it was losing many thousands of pounds running services in the first week of January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be due to the fact that they had to carry at uneconomic rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, then, they were running services which were uneconomic.  The Minister pretends in this sub-section that he is going to prevent that by reducing the rail service given in that week except in the proportion by which the traffic then operating falls, and then only to the extent of the facilities given during that week of January.  That is a terriffic thing for him to say in relation to train services.  What is to be the new allowance?  That is one phrase here that will cause considerable difficulty in interpretation.  As a matter of fact, I cannot see any phrase here that would not cause considerable difficulty. What I am seeking is how it is to be interpreted.  We are told that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;no railway company shall reduce or alter the service of trains run over their railway line or any section thereof to such an extent or in such manner as to afford facilities for the transport of passengers, merchandise, or mails ...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantially less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, &ldquo;substantially less.&rdquo;  And here is the criterion by which it is to be judged: &ldquo;In proportion to the traffic for the time being available for transport by rail.&rdquo;  What does that mean?  Let us take the passengers as being the subject of consideration. Does it mean the passengers who can be driven on to the rail by some means or those who would prefer the rail to the road or who could be induced to go back to the rail by some other means?  What does &ldquo;available for transport&rdquo; mean in that connection? That, I think, is the biggest thing the Minister will be up against to decide and the most difficult point on which any layman could be asked to make up his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that there are going to be considerable difficulties in any of the <Col N="2539" /> phraseology used in this sub-section. Why should any stated period in the year be taken and why should it be assumed that the service at that period was economic in relation to the traffic operating?  I have down an amendment which I do not think would offer any great help to anybody trying to decide the matter.  My amendment says: &ldquo;They shall not reduce or alter the service of trains over their railway line or any section thereof to such extent or in such manner as to afford facilities for the transport of passengers, merchandise, or mails, substantially less in quantity or convenience than the facilities reasonably required to deal with the amount of passenger, merchandise and mail traffic offered, having regard to the facilities alternatively afforded.&rdquo;  I would not care to be the person having to pass a judgment on that amendment either. But, at any rate, I think that it is not founded on a bad basis, in the way in which this particular sub-section is. However, I think, right at the start, that it is to be taken for granted that the services as run on the first week of January this year were not economic and that this was being regarded as a standard week for this purpose.  I think the service would have been much less than what would have been given then.  Would it not be better, on the whole, to say &mdash; we have now in the previous part of this section dealt with the case where deliberately and obviously the aim is to remove traffic then offering on the rail to the road &mdash; that that cannot take place unless the Minister has an application made to him, unless the Minister is satisfied that the railway company should be authorised to do so, and unless the Minister is so satisfied and thereafter gives his order.  That, I think, is the change that the Labour Deputies and anybody else in this House, who is particularly concerned with railway traffic, is particularly interested in &mdash; the change from road to rail.  But this sub-section should deal with an entirely different matter &mdash; not substituted services but the dropping of services &mdash; not because the railway wants to drive traffic on to the roads but because they <Col N="2540" /> feel that there is not any traffic.  Why should not that be left to the railway company?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if it is, I could approve of the whole thing, but the Minister harked me back to sub-section (2) which has been amended by his amendment 40 and that seemed to drag in the Ministerial Order.  If the Ministerial Order has nothing to do with this, then, I have been arguing futilely.  But I understood him to say that it is required for a reduction of services below a point.  It is not if the traffic falls, but if the railway company are, as I hope, the arbiters who will decide that the train services may be discontinued because in proportion as the traffic available for the time being is less proportionately than in the first week of January, 1933, would it not be better to be clear, definite and decisive about it and leave it to the Railway Company, always having the hold over them that they will not be enabled to substitute road traffic in order to draw off traffic from the railway? The Minister still has that hold over them.</P>

      <P>Oh, surely!  The Minister is the guardian hereafter of two things &mdash; the new licence to be granted to the railway company and the transfer of licences to the Railway Company.  Can he not always control that?  Is the traffic still offering and ordinarily borne by the railway to be borne by it still, or the traffic borne by the road to be transferred to the rail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand we are concerned here with preserving an adequate railway service, because we are giving the railway company a monopoly.  There was no question that the service was adequate up to January for all the traffic the railway was carrying.  If anything it was superfluous.  Here we are now giving a real safeguard to the railway.  But what I would like to see would be this: The Minister saying to the railway company: &ldquo;You have been employing <Col N="2541" /> X trains carrying Y traffic and you shall not reduce to half X trains unless traffic falls to half Y without coming to me.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, you have brought in this term &ldquo;available for transport.&rdquo; That means a phantasmagoria in consequence of which it is very hard to arrive at a conclusion.  It would be best to use terms that could be easily checked.  It might be said that the railway carried £100,000 worth of transport in ten trains, at a given period, and that they must satisfy the Minister that their traffic, for the last few weeks, has been not more than £50,000 on that particular branch line or else they could not reduce their service.  The Minister would say to the railway company: &ldquo;You have done wrong if you reduced your service unless you can prove the existence of these facts.&rdquo; There you have a concrete calculation, but if the railway company can introduce a question as to traffic that was available for transport, it reduces the thing to an endless mess as to the meaning of these words.  What I have suggested is a rough and ready way of putting a check on the railway company. I suggest it should be a question of so much traffic, and so many trains, and that the Minister should say to the railway company: &ldquo;You must not alter these conditions without a special order from me which I will not give unless very special considerations are raised.&rdquo;  I agree with Deputy McGilligan that introducing these words &ldquo;available for transport&rdquo; must raise serious difficulty.  I entirely differ from Deputy Thrift in his attitude towards this matter, and I am amazed that Deputy Good and Deputy Dockrell would consent to the removal of the sub-section.  We are giving the railway a great deal and we ought to do something to compel the railway to maintain an adequate service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure will be that the railway company will vary its service having regard to the demand.  If they do not lessen the public convenience we will not hear about it.  If they do, and a complaint <Col N="2542" /> is laid that the public convenience is interfered with, that services are substantially less than those that existed on the 14th of January, having regard to the traffic offered for transport, then an inquiry will take place.  If the inquiry shows that, in fact, the railway company is lessening the train services to such an extent that they have fallen below the point which is equivalent to the January services they are acting contrary to this section, they will have to apply for an order under this section. That is clearly what would happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see considerable administrative difficulties arising, if the volume of traffic offered continues to decline substantially.  But I think we can contemplate that in relation to the first week of January in this year the volume of traffic, having regard to the Road Transport Bill may increase, and if it increases, the difficulties that would arise are diminished accordingly.  If there is no diminution of traffic a minimum service of trains is clearly indicated.  It is only if traffic falls substantially that administrative difficulties will arise.  I do not say that they are impossible of solution.  It is a rough and ready way of dealing with the matter.  The railway company can vary their service downward if the traffic diminishes.  If they are forcing traffic on to the roads then the railway company must provide the road services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is clear. Take the figures for a week or a fortnight or a month before the date on which you are investigating the service. You know what volume of merchandise was offered in that period and you relate that to similar figures for the 1st of January this year.  If the figures show there is a continuous falling off of traffic then a reduction of <Col N="2543" /> the train service is called for.  If the figures do not show that you decide that there should be no diminution of the service.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to keep this phrase in and not to omit it by going back.  The Minister quoted the phrase line 20 sub-section 4 &ldquo;substantially less in quantity or convenience than the facilities for such transport given by the service of trains run over such lines or sections during the last seven days of the month of January, 1933&rdquo;. I think that is so befogged that it will waste the Minister's time to an extraordinary degree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want them kept in, because they will give the railway companies much more power to fit their services to the traffic offered than the impediments put upon them by the original sub-section.  The original sub-section tied them up in every possible way without any relaxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  The railway companies should be allowed to vary services in proportion to the traffic, but if they vary their policy, and put on the road, traffic that was available for the rail, they must get an order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two other points to make.  It seems to me the <Col N="2544" /> Minister has not power now if this is passed to meet a situation like this. Supposing it is proved to him with with regard to a particular railway line that on a service given on the 1st of January, 1933, the company were in fact losing money.  Could he allow them to reduce their services after and what will then be the economic point if the traffic is still further gone or must he always keep them on that datum line of loss?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At any time they can reduce the service by order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I want to find out.  How can he reduce by order?  He can only allow a reduction as authorised under the section. What does the section authorise? The whole thing, under the rest of the section, is tied up with this peculiar definition which has come in late and has upset the section somewhat &mdash;&ldquo;service of trains.&rdquo;  I think the Minister will agree, as he did previously, that &ldquo;service of trains&rdquo; as defined means a substituted road service for the future.  The Minister can only allow a reduction on the rail if there is to be a substituted road service.  How is that going to help the railway company out of the difficulty it finds itself in hereafter &mdash; that it is losing its traffic by so many thousands of pounds per week, and traffic has gone still further away from it?  It appeals to the Minister and he says: &ldquo;I am sorry, but under the measure I have to tie you to the £9,000 loss; I can transfer part of the loss to the road, but I cannot relieve you from the loss.&rdquo;  Is that the situation?  If it is not the situation, how does the Minister propose to get out of the difficulty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the second point I want to urge, that the introduction of the phrase: &ldquo;service of trains,&rdquo; has, I think, given a completely new turn to the whole section.  I thought it was meant to be so important, that the turn given was so deliberate, that you had to read that definition into this sub-section (4) of Section 8.  Then I found the phrase &ldquo;service of trains,&rdquo; had disappeared.  But there is still the connection that the railway company cannot reduce under sub-section <Col N="2545" /> (4) its train service except as authorised by the section, and the only thing authorised by the section is that the Minister can give an order to discontinue, wholly or in part the services of trains, and the services of trains means not to discontinue services altogether, but to substitute road for rail.  I think that is the correct linking together of the different clauses, and if it is, I think the Minister is in the difficulty I have outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has taken a certain date and says it is more or less a random date.  As a matter of fact, it is a random date taken at a very bad time when admittedly services, as compared with traffic, were uneconomic.  Will the Minister think of taking the month&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The following amendment appeared on the Paper:&mdash;</P>
    <P>51.  Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Subject as hereinafter provided, upon the expiration of six months from the passing of this Act it shall be lawful for the company to abandon and cease to work so much of that part of their undertaking authorised by and constructed under the provisions of the Cork City Railways Act, 1906 (hereafter referred to in this section as &ldquo;the Act&rdquo;), and formerly known as the Cork City Railways, as consists of the bridge across the North Channel of the River Lee and the bridge across the South Channel of the River Lee, both in the County Borough of Cork.</P>
    <P>(2)  It shall be lawful for the Cork City Commissioner to maintain, open and close the said bridges in the manner provided by the Act subject to the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>(3)  Within one month from the passing of this Act the Cork City Commissioner shall give notice in writing to the Minister and to the company that he undertakes to maintain, open and close the said bridges in the manner provided by the Act or that he is unwilling to do so.</P>
    <P>(4)  Upon the expiration of the period aforesaid or upon the taking over of the maintenance, opening and closing of the said bridges by <Col N="2547" /> the Cork City Commissioner, whichever event shall first happen, all the powers, rights, duties and liabilities of the company in respect of the maintenance, opening and closing of the said bridges (whether existing pursuant to the Act, the Great Southern Railways Amalgamation Scheme, 1925, or any Statute or Order, or existing at Common Law) shall be and are hereby determined.</P>
    <P>(5)  In the event of his undertaking the maintenance, opening and closing of the said bridges as aforesaid the Cork City Commissioner shall have such of the aforesaid powers, rights, duties and liabilities of the company in respect of the said bridges as are necessary for the purposes aforesaid, and the company shall be liable to maintain the road surface of the roadways of the said bridges to the same extent only and in the same manner as if the said roadways were roads to which Section 10 of the Act applies and shall continue to work and maintain the railway over the said bridges as heretofore as part of their undertaking.</P>
    <P>(6)  If the Cork City Commissioner will not undertake to maintain, open and close the said bridges in the manner aforesaid the company may at their sole expense remove the said bridges and restore the sites thereof to their former condition in such manner and within such time as may be approved of by the Minister.</P>

      <P>If the Great Southern Railways Company want to get that enacted they should do so by Private Bill.  They attempted to do so by Private Bill but it was defeated. Whether it would meet with more success now I cannot say, but it should be by Private Bill, so that there should be by Private Bill Committee before which all the interested parties could appear by counsel and make their case. In any event, I may point out to Deputy Dockrell that this amendment was resurrected from 1928 and does not make allowance for changes which took place since, such as the restoration of the Cork City Council.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment. I should like to urge on the Minister that people cannot have it both ways.  As far as the citizens of Cork are concerned, when the railway company put up this bridge representation was made to them and a bridge was put up which provided for rail traffic and for pedestrian and vehicular traffic.  Undoubtedly the portion of the bridge put up for carrying vehicular and pedestrian traffic was put up at the representations of the citizens of Cork and for their advantage and it conferred considerable advantage upon them.  It saved a long detour for certain traffic and saved congestion and wear and tear on the streets.  The position is that if the railway company had merely put up a railway bridge there would have been no question now when they come forward and say: &ldquo;We will either give it to Cork or we will take it away.&rdquo;  What could be fairer than that?  By reason of their having convenienced the citizens of Cork they are now to be told that they cannot take the bridge away.  &ldquo;It is no good to you, you must leave it there for us.&rdquo;  Is that fair?  I submit that this proposal of the railway company, &ldquo;Either we will leave the bridge there or we will take it away,&rdquo; must be decided by the Cork people saying: &ldquo;Either we want the bridge or we do not want the bridge.&rdquo;  What is the position of the Cork people?  They are being dowered with a bridge.  All they are asked to do is to walk in and work it, to open it and shut it.  I submit to you that that is an eminently reasonable proposal.  I suggest that the Minister should find out what the suggestion of the citizens of Cork is. Either they want the bridge or they do not want it.  I suggest that is the only decision that this House has to come to.</P>

      <P>As I follow his argument, his whole case against the railway fulfiling its obligation here is <Col N="2550" /> simply that these bridges facilitate the people of Cork &mdash; a purely selfish attitude to take up.  There was an amalgamation of the services of the whole railway traffic of Cork City and County.  I do not want now to go into the matters referred to in the petitions when the Private Bill was brought forward in 1928 except merely to say that the Bill was withdrawn as a result of the petition.  I oppose this amendment on behalf of every interest in Cork City and County &mdash; the Cork Harbour Commissioners, the Cork County Council, the Cork Corporation and in the interests even of labour.  Let me quote from a letter of the Cork Harbour Commissioners on this matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My Commissioners desire me to inform you that they most earnestly protest against the acceptance of this amendment, as the removal of these bridges will most seriously affect traffic through the port of Cork, while paralysing communication between other portions of the County of Cork and the railway system of the country generally. These bridges and the railway crossing them form a vital link binding together for traffic purposes the trade and commerce of the country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a resolution from the railwaymen affected:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the retention of the Cork City railway bridges for rail, pedestrian and vehicular traffic is a vital necessity to the well-being and prosperity of the trade and commerce of the City and County of Cork and the South of Ireland generally.  Therefore, the closing, removing or restricting of the free use should not be permitted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that such a considerable time after those bridges were built such a proposal should be made.  When these railways were linked up much jubilation was felt in Cork City and County.  It is extraordinary that such a retrograde step is now to be adopted under this Bill as to break asunder again that whole centralisation.  The only reason Deputy Dockrell could assign was that it was a convenience to Cork City and <Col N="2551" /> that if it was a convenience they had a right to pay for it.  He said nothing at all about the fact that it was a connecting link for the railways.  The Minister in this House has shown every disposition to help the railways as far as possible and I for one would support him in that, but this thing can be brought to too fine a point.  The attitude, apparently, is that you must facilitate them in every way, but once they are called upon to pay for anything, it must be lopped off.  If you develop that principle sufficiently it may be said that the only obligation that should be imposed upon them is that of collecting revenue and that every other national interest should be left to pay their liabilities.  On behalf of every interest in Cork City and County, I oppose this amendment as a retrograde step.</P>

      <P>The situation as it presents itself to me is as follows: <Col N="2552" /> This railway was one of the babes that were handed to the company in 1924 to hold.  We got a whole flock of them.  Nobody would look after them and we gave them to the railway company to nurse them.  This was a very expensive child.  As far as I can see these bridges are not wanted for the transport services which we are commissioning the railways to carry out in future.  Their use at present is admittedly for the vehicular and pedestrian convenience of Cork.  The city did not pay for the bridges originally. If I am rightly informed the bridges were put up by the Cork City railways originally and a big capital sum was spent on them.  The railway company proposes to hand over these bridges, built and all, for the convenience of the pedestrian and vehicular traffic of Cork City.  Because the railway in the past has used these bridges for this railway traffic and on that account had to open and close them and regulate them, the city proceeds to say: &ldquo;You do not want to use them for the railways; that does not mean that we do not want to use them, but because we do, you are going to pay for the upkeep of them.&rdquo;</P>

That is the case as it presents itself to me.  If any Cork Deputy can show me I am wrong I will apologise both to Cork and to the Deputy.  I do not love Cork Deputies any the less for their action in championing their city so vigorously but I think sometimes they do present a case that is not quite logical.  I hope that to charge a Cork Deputy with being a little bit illogical is not going beyond the bounds of order.</P>

      <P>I am sure we are all very grateful to Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Alton for their interest in Cork.  They are both very charming gentlemen and very popular in this House, but I do not think they have made even a shred of a case for the adoption of this amendment.  As my colleague, Deputy Burke, pointed out, those bridges were put up originally at the request of the railway company. They have served the railway company for a number of years and they are serving them still but perhaps not entirely to the extent originally intended.  The Deputy and I, when on the way to the station this week, could see employees of the railway company repairing the permanent way that goes over the bridges in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Broderick, the chairman of the Cork County Council, has rightly said that he represents the feelings of the people when he expressed determined opposition to the adoption of this proposal.  The fact that no Deputy from the city or county, who would have some right to discuss this matter with a sense of responsibility, will utter a single word in support of the proposal, proves conclusively that the <Col N="2554" /> people of Cork City and County are definitely opposed to the suggestion. The bridges were erected originally for the convenience of the railway company. They have served that purpose up to the present and are still serving it.  I think it is a particularly shabby proposal to endeavour to introduce into this Bill.  I will support the attitude taken up by Deputy Broderick on behalf of the county council and other bodies.  I hope the House will, without any hesitation and even without any prolonged debate, reject this amendment.</P>

Had it been it would have spared us a great deal of the nonsense and the foolish talk we have listened to from the learned professor.  Like many professors I have known, the Deputy was talking here upon a subject of which he knows little or nothing.  It happens that I know some little thing about the building of these bridges in Cork.  I happened to be called upon at the time to give evidence in connection with the building of the bridges.  I am aware that those bridges were not only sponsored by the railway company, but the company contributed large sums of money towards the expenses incurred in their construction.  It would be a grave injustice to Cork if this proposal, which undoubtedly has been put forward by the railway company, were adopted.  I never knew of any proposal before the House against which there is a stronger feeling.  I trust the House will reject it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say it causes me serious concern to find myself in opposition to Deputy Broderick and Deputy Burke.  On this occasion I feel that justice demands that it should be said the railway company were doing a favour to the people of Cork when they built these bridges.  The railway company, when building the bridges, might very well have built them for the exclusive use of railway traffic and they might have denied the Cork people all the incidental advantages <Col N="2555" /> that the Cork people have for many years enjoyed.  Instead of that the railway company, acting in a public spirited way, when the bridges were being erected at very little additional public expense, made them available to the citizens for daily use.  For years the citizens have enjoyed the amenity.  Now comes the time when the Minister for Industry and Commerce sets his hand to the task of plundering the widow and orphan for the purpose of maintaining the finances of the railway company.  The Deputies from Cork suggest that we should proceed to confiscate the property of trustees and charities to an even greater extent than we are doing for the purpose of subsidising the railway company in order to maintain these bridges which they desire in the cause of economy to be rid of.</P>
      <P>The company do not propose for a moment to withdraw them from the people of Cork; they do not propose to incommode the people of Cork.  The people of Cork have enjoyed these amenities for nothing.  All the railway company say now is: &ldquo;Our financial conditions are such that we must get rid of these structures if reasonable economy is to be observed in our operating costs, and before we get rid of them we invite the people of Cork to take them over at no expense except the cost of maintaining them.&rdquo;  Was there ever a more reasonable proposal made by any body of men?  They will hand them over to the people of Cork on one condition and that is that they relieve the railway company from the statutory obligation to maintain the bridges. They want no other compensation.</P>

      <P>It will be for the people of Cork to say whether they will or not.  Deputy Murphy said that a powerful argument against this amendment was the unanimity of the Cork Deputies in their opposition to it.  The fact of the matter is that the Cork Deputies are here getting for the people of Cork something for nothing. I can assure the Deputy that if I ever <Col N="2556" /> asked the Minister to give something for nothing to the people of Donegal, Deputy McMenamin and other Deputies would be hot on my heels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely a question of what is considered fair and just.  I fully appreciate that Cork County contributed to the construction of the bridges.  I am perfectly certain, however, that a county council which had the sagacity to choose Deputy Broderick for its chairman did not offer to contribute unless they had made up their minds that the people of Cork would derive considerable benefit, and they did derive considerable benefit in the past.</P>
      <P>Now the railway company says: &ldquo;We are not able to maintain these luxuries any longer.  If Cork is to maintain them they are welcome to do so.  We ask for no compensation except that they should take over the statutory obligation to maintain them.&rdquo;  Taking into consideration what we are doing with the capital of the company, and that we may be passing legislation which may mean unemployment for many men owing to redundancy, is it not reasonable for the company to say: &ldquo;Here is a chance of saving £3,000 yearly without injuring anyone.  All we ask for is power to end an archaic state of affairs.&rdquo;  I think that is not unreasonable.  If Deputy Broderick examines the matter, not as a Cork man, not as a lawyer, and not as a custodian of the people's right, but in a detached way, looking at it as if this were a bridge in County Donegal, I think he would be the first to confess that the proposition of the railway company was an equitable and a fair one, and that to ask that the public should maintain these bridges is fair and just.</P>

      <P>It would be just as equitable to ask the Lord Mayor or the Corporation of Dublin to maintain Kingsbridge, as to ask Cork Corporation to maintain these bridges, which are as integral a part of the railway company as Kingsbridge is.  These bridges were not entirely built by the railway company.  Cork County contributed a very large proportion of the cost, not alone for the actual structures, but to promote the Bill under which they were built.  The railway company at the time derived such important advantages from the construction of the bridges that they moved heaven and earth in that direction. No obstacles were placed in the way of their erection, and for very many years the company did not offer any objection to their maintenance, not only of the railway portion, but also of the portion for passenger and vehicular traffic.  The railway company also derived advantages because Cork Harbour Board, and other persons interested, made quays and sidings there, and in that way traffic was directly moved on to the railways that previously went by road.  It was essentially a case where road traffic was diverted to the railways.  Some Deputies do not realise that if this service is cut off, and if there is any interference with the bridges, West Cork will be cut off from the rest of Ireland.  Would not that be a calamity? The importance of Cork County may be realised when it is remembered that we pay one-seventh of those important things known as the land annuities.  In this matter, we expect that the views of the County <Col N="2558" /> Cork, and particularly the commercial interests of West Cork, will be heard. We must remember that this is not the last generation.  We must not imagine because the railways are in the position they are to-day that that will last forever.  There will be a change some time and the railways will come into their own again.  The world is becoming smaller every day and facilities for quicker linking up with places far apart are becoming more frequent.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk about an airport for Galway and an airport for Cobh.  In West Cork we have more advantages than either of these places. We have Bantry, which stands out by itself, whether as an airport or as a seaport.  It is 40 miles further west than Galway and it is a day's steaming nearer to New York than Cobh. In the future, when all Europe is linked up more closely with us, it will be more important than ever to see that the bridges are properly maintained and that the railway services between Dublin, Rosslare and Bantry work uninterruptedly.  I maintain that any interference with the bridges would mean cutting the jugular vein of the Great Southern Railways in the south.</P>

I am really pleased on this occasion to use his own words, to hear that he is profoundly stirred and seriously concerned because Cork County, through its representatives here, are objecting to be penalised by the Great Southern Railways Company through being compelled to maintain these bridges, out of which the company must have made considerable profit in the past.  Deputy Dillon asked us to take a detached view, and in that wonderful simplicity of words and mind he went on to say that the Cork Deputies should detach themselves as far away as Donegal, and look at the problem from the Donegal man's point of view. Well, Deputy Dillon was very eloquent the other evening when he referred to <Col N="2559" /> Deputy Davin's crocodile tears, but they were as nought, and were not as a drop of water in the Red Sea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now we find Deputy Dillon all through this Bill shedding crocodile tears over the widows and orphans, and to-night with his usual ingenious kind of speech, he pretends to shed further crocodile tears, which, I am sure, will nearly swell the Lee. He pretends to shed crocodile tears over the citizens of Cork who will be deprived of these bridges.  I do not speak as custodian of the property of the widows and orphans about whom Deputy Dillon has spoken so frequently during this debate; I speak as custodian of the rights of the citizens of Cork.  Those bridges have undoubtedly been of some advantage to the citizens of Cork, but they have been of more advantage still to the railway systems.  The railway company has enjoyed many fat years as a result of the accommodation provided by those bridges, and surely because of the fact that they have now entered on a lean period, they are not going to ask the citizens of Cork to maintain those bridges.  I feel that the Minister &mdash; who may have done some foolish things in this Parliament, and even in the last Parliament &mdash; will not cap all his foolishness by accepting an amendment such as that put down here in the names of Deputy Thrift, Deputy Good, Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Alton.  It requires no stretch of the imagination, even of the most recent members of this Dáil, to suggest that none of those gentlemen represents anything that might be <Col N="2560" /> considered industrial national effort. You are asked to accept in this amendment an idea which will place in a privileged position for all time those people who have endeavoured to maintain that privileged position in this country far too long.  It would be most unfair and unjust, to say the least of it, to expect the Cork County Council, the Cork Harbour Commissioners, or the Cork City Council, to maintain those bridges, simply because the railway company say that they are now in a position when they are no longer able to maintain them.  I am one of those optimistic enough to believe that the railway companies will not always be in the unfortunate position in which they now find themselves, but that in the very near future, as a result of the operation of the Road Transport Bill, the Road Traffic Bill and the Bill we are now discussing &mdash; the Railways Bill &mdash; they will find themselves in a sound economic position.  Because of that fact, and for the other reasons I have advanced, I intend to vote against this amendment, and I ask the House to reject it in the interests of fair play and justice.</P>

It is a curious thing that, whatever way Cork Deputies may differ about anything and everything else, the moment anything affecting Cork City or County is raised in this House they are all fiercely Cork men, and they are all, I notice, jointly and severally, the custodians of the interests of the people of Cork.  What interests are they concerned with here? Deputy Dillon said a good deal about this; I would like to say more.  What is involved here?  What are the facts? There are a few bridges down in Cork &mdash; apparently somewhere across the River Lee, because Deputy Anthony said it is likely to swell with Deputy Dillon's crocodile tears &mdash; and the railway company having ceased to use them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The railway company asks the citizens to give some <Col N="2561" /> consideration for the benefits received. The citizens of Cork who derived those benefits ought to do something in connection with those bridges.  What is that?  The elementary act of maintaining the thing they use.  Deputy Anthony has referred to Deputy Dillon's crocodile tears over the widows and orphans.  Are the people of Cork, and future generations of Cork men and women, to say that they are to receive the benefits and advantages of the bridges across the Lee, while the money that should go to those orphans is to be spent on maintaining the bridges of this gallant City of Cork?  I ask you Deputies of Cork is that manly?  Is it right?  Is it just? Is it moral?  No matter what the people of Cork have said to you, do the manly and right thing.  Even if your constituents take the selfish view of this matter you should take the broad view, the long and just view.</P>

      <P>I trust that this amendment is not going to be debated interminably.  We must bring the thing to a head some time.  I think the issue is quite clear.  On the one hand we have the guardians of public morals, the defenders of contractual obligations, deserting their previous views and asking the Dáil to insist on the breaking of a contract between the Great Southern Railways Company and the Cork Corporation.  I am astonished that we have Deputy Good, Deputy Dockrell, Deputy Alton and Deputy Thrift, putting down an amendment of this sort, in view of their attitude on other questions. It is an interesting development. They are here advocating the breaking of a contract, advocating that an obligation undertaken by the Great Southern Railways Company for a consideration received, should be removed.  That is what they are asking the Dáil to do.  Deputies Dillon and McMenamin butted in, why I do not know.  What particular interest the Donegal Deputies had in this matter I cannot possibly see, as it was quite obvious that they knew nothing at all about it.  Deputy McMenamin's speech was entirely based on ignorance of the position, and little as he knew Deputy Dillon <Col N="2562" /> knew less.  He did not know what the contract was, but he did make a speech on the matter, apparently on the assumption that nothing can pass through this House except he has made a speech on it.  I think this Dáil must be influenced by the fact that the Cork Deputies are united as one man against this amendment. They must feel that a great wrong is sought to be done against their city judging by the united front they are presenting against the would-be violators of contracts who have introduced this amendment.  I think the Deputies opposite should take into consideration, and suggest to the railway company that they should take into consideration, the possibility of some development such as Deputy O'Neill referred to, the possibility of their coming to this Dáil again seeking for power to rebuild those bridges if they are removed now.  Those bridges do something more than provide conveniences for the people of Cork.  They connect two parts of the Great Southern Railways system, and it is not at all impossible that circumstances might arise at some time which may again necessitate the maintenance of them, or their reconstruction if they are removed now.</P>
      <P>I think in view of the contract entered into between the railway company and the Cork Corporation that the Deputies whose names appear on this amendment should not come to this Dáil asking that that contract be broken by one side without at least suggesting to the other side that they should consult with all parties concerned in the matter and try to reach common agreement as to what is the best line to take.</P>

      <P>I think the Cork Deputies ought to be put on their guard against certain powers which have already been given.  Suppose this amendment does not pass, what is the position? Section 8 rules the railway across the Cork bridges as much as it rules any other railway in the country. If we are to take as serious the argument put up that these two Cork bridges are required for railway traffic, <Col N="2563" /> then it ought to be remembered that sub-section (4) of Section 8 authorises the railway company to reduce all rail services across those bridges proportionate to the decrease in traffic standardised to whatever it was on the 1st January last.  I see no reason why these bridges should not be in the position of any other bridge governed by the section.  Sub-section (3) of Section 8 says that even after an order is given allowing traffic to be taken off the rails, that order does not relieve the railway company from the necessity of maintaining all bridges.  Why should the Cork bridges be put in the special position that their maintenance is going to be taken off the railway and put on somebody else?  The section says with regard to all types of bridges that although the railway company is not hereafter asked to run trains in or on them that they are going to have to maintain them.  Is it seriously contended that these bridges are required as a real link with traffic as it is at the moment?  Leave out all the imaginings as to Bantry becoming the air port of the future, and let us ask ourselves this question: has there been any rail traffic in any volume over these two bridges for a considerable time? I had experience of both of them before the falling off in rail traffic started.  These bridges used to be very hard to lift and still harder to lower. Because of the delays occasioned in that way I frequently missed my train back to work.  As a result, presumably, of the difficulty of utilising these bridges, one railway company in Cork about 1914 astonished everyone by puting this on its bills one day: that the &ldquo;9.30 train will in the future run at 10.30 and there will be no last train on this line.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister has made very unfounded charges about the breaking of contracts.  There is no breach of contract.  This is simply to relieve the company of an obligation that was undertaken.  The Bill, in various sections, despite obligations contractual or otherwise, authorises the doing of certain things.  The company asks in a perfectly legal way <Col N="2564" /> that they shall be relieved of this obligation.</P>

Is it fair that when these structures have ceased to be of any use to the company and can be of use to the people who now derive benefit from them, that these people should be asked to keep them in order?  Any impartial person would say that it is simply fair play and nothing more that is asked for in this amendment. A good deal of heat has been unnecessarily brought into this, but the amendment seems to me to be an ordinary piece of fair play.  The company ask to be relieved of this obligation. The structures are of no further use to them It is simply penalising the reserves of the company, already strained, to ask them to continue to maintain structures which have ceased to be of use to them, but are of use and value to another body. Is it unreasonable to ask that other body to keep them in order?</P>

The Minister went on to say that, in speaking to the amendment, we showed that we knew nothing about the circumstances governing the case.  I listened carefully to the Minister, and I am satisfied that we knew everything that was relevant about it, and that the Minister threw no additional light on it.  If common justice is to be done the Minister should accept the amendment, though he may have hopes that there are too many votes in Cork to see justice done in the matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy Thrift concentrated on what an asset those bridges are to Cork in easing traffic, and that because of that their maintenance ought to be a liability on the localities concerned. They forgot that the primary object of the bridges was to facilitate the railway company.  Although the railways have, so to speak, passed out, the bridges may not now be of the same necessity to the company, but still they are a link between east and west and Cork City.  In my opinion it would be a retrograde step on the part of the Government to accept the amendment.  It is really on the principle of the Bill.  Those bridges were built for a primary purpose.  That purpose was the conveyance of railway traffic.  We are asking you to refuse to break that link.  The question of the maintenance or upkeep of the bridges must not be abandoned.  I think we have given plenty of evidence in Cork of the hardships which we have borne.  However, that was during a transitory period. One thing we must insist on and which we are going to uphold with all the <Col N="2566" /> energy at our command and that is that there shall be no disconnection of this link between East and West Cork City.</P>

    <P>(g)  use its money and funds for the purpose of doing anything which such company is empowered by an order under this section to do and, in particular, use for that purpose any money in its hands at the date of such order and also any money raised under statutory power before the date of such order (whether before or after the passing of this Act) and not required for the purpose for which such money was so raised;</P>
    <P>(h)  anything ancillary or incidental to anything which such company is empowered by an order under this section to do.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purpose of this section the expression &ldquo;air transport&rdquo; means the carriage for reward by air of passengers, passengers' luggage, merchandise, and mails, or any of them, but the powers conferred by an order under this section may be limited by such order to any one or more of those subjects of carriage.</P>

    <P>The object of this amendment is to give the railway company general powers to undertake air transport business any time they feel disposed to do so.  The company has asked for that power.

      <P>I move amendment 57:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is rather an important amendment and we have had some discussion upon it already.  It is obvious that unless this sub-section is deleted from the Bill it will throw a very serious obligation on the railway company.  Some time prior to the amalgamation scheme &mdash; I am not quite sure of the year &mdash; the old Dublin and South Eastern Company were advanced a loan of £100,000 by the then London and North Western Railway Company.  That loan was advanced for carrying out certain works in connection with the New Ross and Waterford extension line.  Under that agreement if this line was made that company also enjoyed certain other privileges amounting annually to £20,000.  That liability and these privileges were transferred in 1924 under the amalgamation scheme to the Great Southern Company.  Attaching to this loan was a condition &mdash; and this is the important feature of it &mdash; that the London and North Western Railway should, by reason of this loan, have the right to nominate a director on the board of the old Dublin South Eastern Railway.  When that obligation was transferred that condition was also transferred and was carried out by the amalgamated railway.  When they took over the obligation they took over the conditions attaching to it.  In the particular proposals we have before us these conditions are to be taken away. In other words, the agreement whereby a director was to be nominated is to be withdrawn.  We are informed that <Col N="2570" /> as a result of the withdrawal of these conditions the British company will have the right to call for the repayment of the loan and, also, to withdraw the other conditions which accrued to which I have referred.  We think it is undesirable that that provision should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>No matter how one looks at it, the nomination of one director among seven, even from the point of view of the Labour Party, who are the real proposers of this matter, or from the point of view of the Government, to represent certain interests, could not in the ordinary course, from the point of view of voting capacity, be looked on as very wide.  But that is not the point to which we take the greatest exception.  It was the obvious, and admitted conditions, attaching to this loan that that right should follow. We feel strongly that if that right be interfered with the liabilities which follow, as a result, should fall upon the side which put forward this proposal.</P>

      <P>I regret it should be necessary for me to ask the Minister to remain, after his long day on the Railways Bill, to deal with this particular matter.  I would not do so if there were any more satisfactory way of dealing with it.  The points I want to raise are, in my opinion, vital, and, therefore, I desire to raise them. I would have raised this matter by motion, as the most satisfactory way of dealing with it, both from my own point of view and the point of view of the House, but we go into recess for a fortnight to-morrow and we come back to a very important financial time in which I take it there will be very little Private Members' time and there are already three important Private Members' motions on the Paper.  My reason for raising the matter is to let the Minister know what we want in the matter of information dealing with the industrial <Col N="2571" /> position and the unemployment position and to endeavour to find out from him what exactly he is prepared to give us.  The situation is one in which there is a very strong <i>prima facie</i> case for a very considerable amount of anxiety on our part as to the general position financially and from the point of view of employment.  Our anxiety is not allayed in any way by recent statements of the Minister.  As far back as 12th May, 1932, when dealing with the Budget, and a suggestion of Deputy Hogan that in eight months' time they would know whether their industrial policy was a success or not, the Minister, as reported in Columns 1676-1677 of the Official Reports, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputy Hogan said that in eight months' time we shall find out whether our policy has been a success or not.  I am prepared to accept that.  I am prepared to back that policy, and if at the end of that period there are not more people in employment, there are not more industries in the country, there is not greater productivity, and there are not better conditions all round, then I am prepared to admit that this policy is not a success.  Eight months is not a long period to undo the damage of one hundred years, but I am prepared to accept it as a test of this policy.  I hope particularly that Deputy Morrissey, who has been parading his concern for the unemployed in this House for the past three or four weeks, will give it that eight months' trial.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the beginning of it.  We had the end of it the other day and, as I say, this is what adds to our interest in the matter.  In Column 2026 of the Official Reports of 31st March, after the eight months had passed and the financial year had ended, we find the Minister for Industry and Commerce when dealing with the Economies Bill stating:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...this Government came into office to find the country with a declining population&mdash;(which was not so)&mdash; declining agricultural production &mdash;(which was not so)&mdash;declining <Col N="2572" /> industrial production&mdash;(which was not so)&mdash;stripped of resources&mdash; (which was not so)&mdash;stripped of wealth-producing capacity; in the position that, if a check had not been called to the continuous decline, recovery in our day might have been made entirely impossible.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; can be put in brackets and substantiated by figures in due course.  In Column 2034 the Minister, continuing, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Agriculture, speaking the other day about the agricultural position, said, in relation to that industry, that he found the country stripped of its wealth.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Starting off in this financial year, we are seriously anxious to know what position the Minister is endeavouring to cover up by his wrong description of the circumstances in which he took over office.  In reply to my question to-day, asking for certain information as to where new industries, stated by him to have been started, were located, he endeavoured to draw a political line across the matter.  I want the Minister to understand, whether there is a political purpose at the back of it or not, that there is certain information available to him which ought to be made available to everyone interested in watching how things are going.  This question did not arise out of any political propaganda in connection with the elections. It first arose out of certain statements made in Kilkenny by the President, and statements made by the Minister in September last.  On 27th October I asked, in connection with a large number of industries which the Minister and the President stated had been started, if he would provide certain information.  I asked if he would let us know the numbers and the location of the new factories, the classes of goods produced, the amount of capital, whether the factory was native or foreign, and what number of persons were employed, and the answer I got was that the preparation <Col N="2573" /> of the return giving the information would involve a considerable amount of time and trouble, and that the Minister would consider laying on the Table of the Dáil a report of the kind indicated in the question.</P>
    <P>On the re-assembly of the House on 1st March last, I asked the Minister for the information for which I had asked previously in October, and in connection with which he was considering laying a return before the House.  The Minister then referred to his previous answer about the time and trouble involved.  I was accepting, in a <i>bona fide</i> way, that the Minister was prepared, some time or another to give the information, although as early as this he dragged the idea of a directory of Irish manufacturers, which was being prepared in his Department, across the question.  However, on 8th March, I asked in connection with four new boot factories, which he stated on 16th January had been started during the present Government's term of office, for the names and location of these factories, and I got the names and the location.  Subsequently, on 22nd March, I asked for information with regard to seven new furniture factories and four new upholstery factories, and I was told with regard to these that I could get their location and did get their location; that the seven furniture factories were started in Dublin and that three of the upholstery factories were started in Dublin and the fourth in Navan, but that the Minister was not prepared to give the names of the owners until the position of each firm was examined in the light of the Control of Manufactures Act. That is, we were promised we might have the other information when certain examinations had been carried out under the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I asked the Minister for some further information in regard to new mattress making industries and one or two industries of that nature. I was told that not only would I not get the names of the firms for the same reason previously expressed, but that I could not get the location of them, <Col N="2574" /> that it was undesirable, having regard to the interests of the firms concerned and the interests of other firms in the same industries to give that information and that anybody interested in the matter should wait for the new directory which would give a lot of information about Irish manufactures generally.  The Minister said that he was in a position to give certain information but he could not go any distance to tell us what information he was prepared to give.  When he was asked where the new factory for hay rakes or where the new factory for barbed wire was started he said that he was not prepared to give the information but, when pressed subsequently, in connection with the matter, he thought that as far as the location was concerned, he might give the information and said that if I were to put down a question seeking that information he would endeavour to get it. Again he urged that the various people who are interested in the industrial position should wait for the Directory of Manufacturers so that they could get a complete picture and not a partial picture, arising out of the publication of information of this kind.</P>
    <P>When we asked the Minister for information surely we are entitled to refer to some specific thing and the House, in considering the results of the policy which the Minister, on 12th May last, thought of such considerable importance that he more or less staked his political reputation on its bringing about the economic and unemployment salvation of this country inside eight months, is entitled to get information as to the new factories that are set up. I have asked during the last few weeks for additional information.  I asked the Minister, supplementary to a question put by Deputy Beckett, for information as to the number of persons in tariffed industries in September, in December and again in March, and the Minister's statement was that no information was collected in September as regards the number of persons in tariffed industries, that no information was collected in December, but he held out some hope that the information would be available for 31st March.  Will that information as to the <Col N="2575" /> number of persons in tariffed industries on 31st March last be available and when?</P>
    <P>The Minister is not in a position to give us the total number of unemployed in the different industrial groups for which figures are supplied quarterly by his Department.  The Minister is not in a position to give us the information for 31st December last, that is three months later.  As far as the general returns in regard to unemployment are concerned, they are worthless in indicating the general position of the country.  The Minister has said that the unemployment position has improved considerably.  The most reliable figures that are available, because of present circumstances and because of past circumstances in the City of Dublin, are the Dublin figures.  The figures supplied by the Minister show that from the end of January until the day on which the figures were supplied, 12th March last, there has been a reduction of about 9,900 in the total number of persons unemployed, but of these 8,200 are returned from two areas alone out of the seventeen, that is, from the Athlone and the Sligo areas.  In the City of Dublin alone, the area as I say where the figures are more reliable because of the circumstances, there has been an increase of 1,000 at a time of the year when normally there should be reduction in the number of unemployed.</P>
    <P>Immediately after the Easter recess we shall be approaching consideration of the Budget and I want to persuade the House that very big considerations will be involved in the consideration of that Budget.  Are we going to be in the position that we shall have to consider that Budget without any clear indication of the results of the industrial policy of the Government during the last 12 months?  Is the Minister going to give us any information or make any case that will persuade the House that he is not, as it were, to hand in his gun, in the way he said he would have to hand it in after eight months, if certain developments did not take place?  Can the Minister make any reasonable case why he <Col N="2576" /> should not provide the House at this moment as far as new industries are concerned with the figures that were asked for in October last&mdash;the location of the industries, the capital involved, the type of ownership, the approximate wages paid and the number of persons employed?  Will be put us in the position that we shall have immediately after Easter the total number of persons employed in tariffed industries on 31st March this year?  Will he be in a position to give us figures in regard to unemployment in respect of the different industrial groups in respect to which the unemployment figures are collected and available quarterly?  What can he give us either in addition to or in substitution of the weekly statements of persons who are said to be unemployed that we are now getting?</P>
    <P>He told the House recently that he was having an analysis made of the position on 16th January last.  Will we have that analysis of the situation in our hands after Easter before we start to carry on an important discussion in connection with the Budget? All we do know is that the Minister has completely run away, step by step, from giving us any information in regard to the new factories.  It is not sufficient to say &ldquo;I am going to tell you all about Irish industry in a Directory some time.&rdquo;  Goodness knows when we shall see the Directory if we are going to have it issued from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce !  I ask the Minister to realise that he is treating a very serious subject very lightly in the present circumstances of the country by facing us simply with the blank wall of &ldquo;no information&rdquo; when we are discussing new factories, employment in tariffed industries, and the general position in regard to unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that his main anxiety in this matter is that the success which has attended the Government's industrial policy is ruining the political prospects of his Party.  It is from that source his anxiety springs.  I said eight months ago that I was prepared to accept the challenge thrown out by Deputy Hogan <Col N="2577" /> as a fair test, and that was that if at the end of eight months the industrial position was not substantially improved, if there were not more people in employment, if there were not greater industrial activity and better prospects for the future, I would regard our policy as a failure.  By that test our policy has been a much greater success than we anticipated.  I said the other night that we were left, after ten years of the worst Government ever known by any country, with depleted resources which damaged our wealth-producing capacity.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has been talking about a diminution of live stock.  I said that we could not export live stock that we had not got, and I pointed out that during the Cumann na nGaedheal period of office the live-stock population of the country had been reduced by 300,000 head.  Of course the Deputy will deny that?</P>

      <P>So far as cattle are concerned, the total number in 1922 was 4,375,417; the total number in 1931 was 4,029,084.  That shows a difference of 345,000 head of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister refer to the position in 1924?  Will he compare the position from 1925 to 1932 with regard to cattle in this country and then stand over his argument?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1922 to 1924 there was a slight decline in the total number of cattle.  Then there was a slight recovery and then they started to go down again.  Now, with regard to corn crops, from 1922 to 1931 there has been a decrease of 215,500 acres; in regard to root and green crops there has been a decrease of 89,000 acres; the area under flax has decreased by 4,200 acres and the area under fruit went down by 2,000 acres.  During the same period it might be of some interest to the Deputy to learn that the number of geese in the country also seriously diminished.  Throughout the whole of the period when Cumann na nGaedheal held office, industrial productivity was stagnant.  A number of industries which existed in this <Col N="2578" /> country for many decades before the blight of Cumann na nGaedheal rule came upon it, disappeared.  In the papers we read week after week during the greater part of that decade of industries going to the wall, of their proprietors seeking the refuge of the bankruptey courts, of their employees lining up seeking whatever work was available and generally finding none.</P>
      <P>That situation is changed.  The Deputy is trying to create the idea that the statement made by me that, between May of last year and last January, 149 new factories were established, was not correct.  It is correct.  Every factory and workshop opened in this country must be registered in my Department.  There were 303 new workshops registered, of which 149 were registered as factories. In these factories many thousands of people are employed&mdash;who would have been idle if the industrial policy of the Government had not been operated and if the <i>laissez faire</i> policy of the previous Government were allowed to continue.  We have succeeded in establishing many industries that never before existed in this country.  The figure of 149 has been substantially increased since then.  If the Deputy looks over the papers for the last week he will not find a single issue which does not report the establishment or the pending establishment of another new factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said I would be prepared to take eight months as a test.  That was unfair in a way.  I pointed out that it would be difficult to repair in that period the damage done by a century of foreign government and a decade of home misgovernment on the part of Cumann na nGaedheal.  I accepted that test, and the policy of this Government has been demonstrated to be capable of producing exactly the results we foretold.  The unemployment figures are going down.  The Deputy said that no reliance could be placed on those figures, yet during the three weeks of the election campaign he went around arguing on the basis of those figures that unemployment was getting worse.  So long as the figures were going up they were reliable, but so long as they showed a <Col N="2579" /> tendency the other way, then, according to the Deputy, they could not be relied upon.</P>
    <P>The Deputy ignored the fact that a new system of registration had been brought into operation and that the whole method of computation of the figures had been changed.  We had the figure of 72,000 additional unemployed placarded on the walls during the election and shouted off every Cumann na nGaedheal platform. When the figures no longer suited the purpose of Cumann na nGaedheal, they endeavoured to discredit their accuracy.  They relied upon the figures during the election period. Why run away from these figures now? They cannot have it every way. Apparently when the figures happened to support their contentions they were looked upon as unquestionably accurate; as soon as they went against them, their accuracy must be questioned.</P>
    <P>I gave what I considered to be a satisfactory reason why the piece-meal information which the Deputy has asked for should not be given.  Apart from any other consideration, the additional work which it involves in my Department is considerable.  My Department is heavily worked.  The work which is pouring in upon it in consequence of the Government's industrial policy is so heavy that a very substantial increase in staff had to be made last year.  I do not want to take members of the staff from the constructive work they are doing in order to compile statistics to satisfy the Deputy's curiosity, or assist in removing his political doubts.  We are preparing a directory of Irish factories. The number is increasing so rapidly that the directory will be almost out of date by the time it is published.  However, we are going to do it.  The necessary steps have been taken and the necessary information collected and that directory will give a clear picture in respect of the position in each of the industries.</P>
    <P>Let Deputies look at the trade and shipping returns.  We have reached in respect of clothing, apart from boots and shoes, almost to the <Col N="2580" /> position that we are supplying the whole of our home requirements.  In regard to hosiery, underclothing, ready-made clothing and outdoor garments we have more than doubled production and, incidentally, employment. In the case of boots and shoes we have done the same thing, doubled production.  At this moment there is not a boot factory in the country that is not installing machinery and planning to increase production this year.  We are making a start with one particular item of apparel, men's felt hats.  By the end of this year we will be in a position to supply half our requirements of that commodity. In the matter of woodwork considerable development has been undertaken.  The production of builders' woodwork, packing cases and the various articles of wood required in different industries is being substantially developed and the number of persons employed&mdash;they are all adult men, which makes that industry all the more valuable&mdash;is also increased.</P>
    <P>We have developed the foundry industry.  If the Deputy will inquire in his own constituency he will get some idea of the development that has been made in that industry.  He will find there firms that have doubled their employment and output within the last eight months.  The position that we have created is that this is probably the only country in the world of which it can be said that our major economic problem is one of under-production.  Every other country is complaining of over-production and is trying to devise ways and means by which the surplus products of the different factories can be brought into consumption.  That is not our problem.  We have day after day Irish factories working overtime and yet unable to supply the demand. We have that situation in relation to slates and building materials and other commodities of various kinds.</P>
    <P>The only thing that is required in order to complete the job is the investment of additional capital, the affording of the necessary assistance by the Government, and silence on the part of the Deputies opposite who have <Col N="2581" /> been endeavouring at all times to create doubts and a feeling of instability and insecurity which would wreck the whole thing.  They have not succeeded.  We gave them an opportunity of finding out to what extent they had succeeded and they <Col N="2582" /> learned a lesson.  The wisest course for them to adopt is to remain silent on this matter and let the Government get on with its job.</P>
    <P>The Dáil rose at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 7th April.</P>
