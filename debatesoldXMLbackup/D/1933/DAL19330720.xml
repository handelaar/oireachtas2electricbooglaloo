      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether, having regard to the experiment of hiring steam trawlers which has been in progress for the past two years, he will urge the employment of Irish trawlers by the Sea Fisheries' Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there are only seven Irish steam trawlers, and that these are already in commission for the landing of fish in the Saorstát. The taking over by the Association of these trawlers would not therefore increase the total landings of fish in the Saorstát, which is one of the primary objects of the Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he has received representations from the Associated Easter Week Men, together with a petition signed by a number of Deputies, including 57 members of the Fianna Fáil Party, requesting that similar treatment be given them to that already provided for certain members of the National Forces and Defence Forces of the Saorstát under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, and if he will now state what action, if any, he proposes to take concerning same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister For Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The representations and the petition referred to have been received.  As the Deputy is aware, provision was made in the Army Pensions Act, 1932, for pensions and gratuities to persons disabled as a result of service in the <Col N="288" /> struggle for Independence in 1916 and subsequent years, and to the dependents of those who lost their lives.  A further measure to provide allowances for other survivors of the struggle whose incomes are below certain limits is in preparation, and it is expected to be ready for introduction in the autumn.</P>
      <P>It would not, however, be possible, without overstraining the resources of the State, to grant pensions on the scale suggested in the representations received from the Associated Easter Week Men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering that some of these people are very badly off will the Minister state when he hopes to be in a position to produce some measure dealing with the matter?</P>

      <P>It is proposed to accept amendments 1, 5 and 7, and to ask the Dáil to disagree with amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 6.  These amendments relate to the question of financing a pension scheme for nurses. Subsequent to the decision in the Seanad on these amendments the matter was further discussed and it was realised that the question of a pension scheme for nurses was more complicated than at first thought.  It was then agreed not to proceed with the further necessary amendments on the understanding that if the nursing organisation and the committee of the associated hospitals succeeded in evolving a finished scheme the necessary legislation would be introduced to assist in financing such a scheme.</P>

      <P>18.  Nothing contained in the last preceding section shall empower the Hospitals' Commission to make and submit to the Minister a scheme which shall involve an alteration of the constitution or an interference with the administration of a hospital which did not receive any benefit from any sweepstake promoted under the Public Charitable Hospitals Acts, 1930 to 1932 and does not receive any benefit from a sweepstake promoted under this Act and which does not receive any grant from a local authority.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>3.  Section 23, sub-section (2).  A new sub-section inserted before the sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) For the purposes of this section, but not further or otherwise, the word &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; shall mean a nurse registered by the General Nursing Council or a midwife certified by the Central Midwives Board, who shall have been engaged for not less than 20 years in nursing or in attendance on maternity patients in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>4.  Section 24, sub-section (2).  After the word &ldquo;organisation&rdquo; in line 49 the following words inserted:&mdash;&ldquo;or such organisation for the provision of pensions for nurses as is defined in sub-section (1) of the preceding section.&rdquo;</P>

The following words added at the end of the sub-section:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided, however, that no conditions shall be attached to the receipt of any such grant in any way relating to the appointment, dismissal or control of the staff of any hospital or nursing organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>7.  New section.  Before Section 25 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>25.&mdash;(1) The Minister may at any time, at the request of any person controlling or about to establish a lending library for supplying books for the use of patients or inmates in hospitals, make a grant (to be known and in this section referred to as a hospital library grant) to such person out of the Hospitals Trust Fund, of such amount as the Minister shall think proper, for the purpose of defraying all or any of the expenses of such lending library.</P>
    <P>(2)  A hospital library grant may, as the Minister shall in each case think proper, be in the form of a sum to be paid out of the capital of the Hospitals Trust Fund or in the form of payments to be made annually, for such period as the Minister shall direct, out of the income of the Hospitals Trust Fund and the National Hospital Trustees shall, if so directed by the Minister, set aside a portion of the capital of the Hospitals Trust Fund and invest such portion for the purpose of securing any hospital library grant made in the form of payments to be made annually.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever the Minister determines to make under this section a hospital library grant, he shall direct the National Hospital Trustees to pay such grant out of the Hospitals Trust Fund and thereupon the said Trustees shall pay the amount of such grant out of the said Fund to such person and at such time or in instalments at such times as the Minister directs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> (4)  Whenever the Minister makes under this section a hospital library grant, he shall specify the purposes for which such hospital library grant is to be expended and may attach to the receipt of such hospital library grant such conditions (whether to be performed before or after such receipt) as he thinks proper for securing the due expenditure of such hospital library grant on the purposes specified by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(5)  If, after the making of a hospital library grant under this section to any person and before payment of such hospital library grant or before the making of any particular payment in respect thereof, the Minister is satisfied that any condition attached under the foregoing sub-section to the receipt of such hospital library grant has not been complied with by the person to whom such grant was made, the Minister may certify to the National Hospital Trustees that such condition has not been complied with and, upon the Minister so certifying, the National Hospital Trustees shall not make, and the person to whom such grant was made shall cease to be entitled to, any such payment of or in respect of such hospital library grant or to any future payment in respect thereof unless and until the Minister otherwise directs.</P>

      <P>Section 3, sub-section (2).  A new paragraph added at the end of the sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c)  a person born in Ireland in the area not comprised in Saorstát Eireann who at the relevant time is ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill defines as a national of Saorstát Eireann a person born in the <Col N="297" /> Saorstát or a person ordinarily resident there for five years.  That definition, consequently, makes nationals of Saorstát Eireann for the purposes of the Bill persons who might otherwise be regarded as aliens.  It seems to me that we have gone far enough to meet the situation which exists in the absence of permanent legislation dealing with the definition of nationality. The term &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; has a certain meaning but, in any event, we think there should be ordinary residence for five years in order to comply with the provisions of this Bill.  The only parts in respect of which the question of nationals arises is in the matter of the provision of employment, the investment of capital or the control of the industry.  In these circumstances, we think that extension of the definition should not be agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A person born in the Six Counties is placed on the same footing as a person born in the Saorstát provided he has been resident here for five years.  That is the definition of &ldquo;national&rdquo; in the Bill.  We do not think it is necessary to go beyond that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very important reservation.  My point is that by excluding this amendment you have left a person who was born in the Six Counties, but who has not been resident here for five years, in the same position practically as a person born in England.  I do not wish to make a speech on Partition, but I think the Government ought to make up their minds how far they ought to <Col N="298" /> exclude expressly people born in the Six Counties.  There have been certain other Bills in which this clause has cropped up and there are different definitions of a Saorstát national.  At the same time, I suggest to the Government that they should cease legislating against people born in the Six Counties.  The Minister when replying can tell us whether there is any instance of retaliatory legislation by the people in the Six Counties in placing any bar against people born in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Whether there is or not, I suggest to the Minister that the continued differentiation between people born in the Six Counties and people born in the Twenty-Six Counties is not in the interests of anybody.  I do not know whether it will ever arise under this Bill or not, but they have very efficient cement works in Northern Ireland and it might just come about that a person who had a very precise knowledge of the manufacture of cement, whom the Government would wish to see brought in here, will be debarred under this provision.  I ask the Minister to consider it very sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection I should like to say that our main task at present must be to provide employment for the people of the Saorstát and to regulate the affairs of this part of Ireland so as to ensure the greatest good of the greatest number.  Whatever our wishes may be in respect to the Six Counties, our job is to look after the Twenty-Six Counties at present and to provide employment for the people here in preference to providing employment for other people. The Deputy asks if there is any example of retaliatory legislation in the Six Counties.  I do not know whether it is retaliatory legislation in so far as it has existed from a date preceding by a considerable time the advent of this Government to office, but legislation there practically debars any citizen of the Saorstát from taking any insurable employment in the Six Counties until there has been three years residence.  No citizen of the Saorstát going into the Six Counties is eligible to draw unemployment <Col N="299" /> insurance benefit until he has been resident for three years.  There is no such retaliatory&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that our people suffered disadvantages in Northern Ireland, and I gave as an illustration the case of the Belfast city accountant to show that residents of the Saorstát were quite free to take appointments in Northern Ireland and can take them.</P>

      <P>The disadvantages to which I have referred were brought forward for discussion at a meeting of the International Labour Office by our predecessors as being contrary to an international convention to which the British Government had subscribed, but they have not been removed.  They are still there and we have not retaliated.  This question of definition has nothing to do with the bringing into the Saorstát of people with specialised knowledge to carry out operations in relation to this or any other industry where Saorstát citizens have not got the skill to do it.  If such persons are required they can be brought in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is no question of a licence.  In relation to this industry we take power to regulate the extent to which employment will be confined to Saorstát citizens, but, no doubt, the persons operating the industry will from time to time make the plea that special workers are <Col N="300" /> required for special operations and must be brought from outside until Saorstát citizens are trained for that work, and they will be accommodated by my Department, the same as persons have been accommodated in respect of other industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the question of bringing in persons with special knowledge is concerned, this definition has nothing to do with it. This definition relates to the sections of the Bill which give the Minister power to prescribe the extent to which employment is to be confined to nationals of the Saorstát.  It is concerned with the extent to which the control or the ownership of industries in Saorstát Eireann is confined to citizens of Saorstát Eireann.  In that connection we have given a most liberal definition of nationality&mdash;a much more liberal definition of nationality than is given in other countries.  No doubt, there will be other legislation introduced on that matter, but, pending the introduction of such legislation, we have confined ourselves to this definition which, in our opinion, is much more liberal than the definition given in other countries.</P>

I should like to point out to the Minister that, before you do that, you have got to provide industries.  If you have not the industries, there will be no employment.  This is an industry of <Col N="301" /> which we have no knowledge whatever in the Free State and of which there is knowledge in the Six Counties. There is no cement industry running here at the moment and nationals of this State have no knowledge of the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

      <P>I tried to point out to the Minister for Finance during the absence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;and may I say that we all regretted the Minister's absence, and may I also say that I am very glad to see him back here again&mdash;but, as I say, I tried to point out, during his absence, to the Minister for Finance when the same principle was under discussion, in connection with one or two other Bills which came before us, such as the Industrial Credit Bill, and similar Bills, that other matters were more essential than the provision of capital for industry, and I think the Minister for Finance agreed that experience was one of the essentials.  Seeing that we have no nationals with experience of this industry here, I think we will all agree that, in order to make the industry a success, we must get people into the industry who have a knowledge of it.  I think the Minister will agree that that is a primary requirement in any industry, and I think he will also agree that it would be much better to encourage people with the necessary experience from Northern Ireland, rather than from another country.</P>

      <P>New section.  Before Section 9 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>9.&mdash;(1)  The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the commencement of this Act, by order under this sub-section appoint by reference to quality the standard to which Portland cement manufactured by holders of cement manufacture licences is to conform.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may from time to time by order under this sub-section amend the order made under the immediately preceding sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Every order made by the Minister under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution annulling such order is passed by either House of <Col N="303" /> the Oireachtas within the next subsequent ten days on which that House has sat after such order is so laid before it, such order shall be annualled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such order.</P>
    <P>(4)  If any holder of a cement manufacture licence manufactures any Portland cement the quality of which does not conform to the standard for the time being appointed under this section, such holder shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds.</P>
    <P>The intention originally was that a standard quality of cement should be fixed, to which all cement produced in the country would have to conform. Ordinarily, the standard is fixed by Governmental institutions, but in the special circumstances here I cannot see any objection to having it fixed by the Minister.

The Order relates to duties on boots and shoes, and it operates to reduce or increase the particular duties <Col N="305" /> as the case may be, so that there is only one duty on boots and shoes&mdash;a rate of 30 per cent. on the majority of these goods and 20 per cent. on others.  In respect of men's and boys' shoes, it operated to abolish the preference in respect of English boots and shoes.  In the case of motor cars, it reduced the maximum rate to the preferential rate, and it resulted in only one rate being enforceable on motor cars.  In the case of fabricated steel and certain cast iron articles the preferential rate was increased to the full rate.  The duty on coke and coal will be re-enacted.  With regard to cement, it is intended when the Cement Bill becomes law to repeal by an Emergency Order the emergency duty upon cement because the import of cement will be regulated under that Bill.  The Order also imposed a duty of 20 per cent. upon electrical apparatus imported from Great Britain.  There were certain duties on sugar and saccharine, and a duty upon machinery of certain classes was maintained.  There were exempted from duty printing machinery, machinery, for hosiery, boot making machinery, agricultural machinery, and mechanically propelled vehicles.  It imposed a duty upon certain component parts of bicycles. Order No. 11 was entirely an Order for the repeal of duties mainly in consequence of the fact that these duties had been made permanent in the Finance Bill.  We are advised, however, that it is necessary to confirm Order No. 11 despite that fact, because there is some reason to fear that if Order No. 11 were not confirmed, and if Order No. 5 were confirmed, that Order No. 5 would be in force in the form in which it was originally intended, whereas, in fact, it was considerably amended by Order No. 11. The passage of this Bill does not, of course, involve any change in respect of duties at present in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1 to Section 9&mdash;to delete paragraph (b). Deputies will remember that this matter was discussed upon the Second <Col N="309" /> Reading debate.  The paragraph originally read that compensation should be paid to those men who were over 50 years of age or who had not less than 12 years' service.  After full consideration of the representations that had been made from various quarters, the Executive Council decided to ask the Dáil to make the compensation apply to all former employees of the company by the deletion of this paragraph. That means that compensation will be paid to all former employees.  The result will be that the total amount paid will be increased from £36,000 to £42,000, and this will cause a consequential increase in the annual payment from the Cork Corporation, which will be raised now to £1,745. The Corporation has, however, agreed to the proposal and it appears to have met with the approval of all parties concerned.  I must say, however, that it was with some reluctance it was decided to bring it forward here, because it seemed that the basis for compensation in that case was the contention that the nature of the employment which these men had was likely, if continued over a long number of years, to make them unsuited for employment of another kind.  There are others than the ex-employees of the Cork Tramway Company who lost their employment as an indirect consequence of the Shannon scheme, and no doubt there will be others who, under somewhat similar circumstances, will lose employment as an indirect consequence of other national undertakings from time to time.  Heretofore, the principle has been generally agreed that compensation should be confined to those who have lost employment only as a direct consequence of those measures.  Indirect loss has not qualified persons for compensation heretofore.  This Bill is, in a sense, a departure from that principle, although it is admitted that the circumstances are unique and of a kind not likely to be repeated.  I should like to have it understood that it is those very special circumstances which have occasioned this measure, and that its introduction or passage by the Dáil should not be regarded as an indication that other persons who <Col N="310" /> suffered indirect loss in consequence of that or similar national enterprises will receive similar treatment.  The special circumstances of this case were those I have stated, that the nature of their work was such as to make the persons unsuited for other employment. The statement has been made, and I have no reason to doubt its accuracy, that those who were employed on the trams in Cork are generally regarded by employers in Cork as unfit for heavy work, and will not be offered employment when work of that kind is available.  Only those of them who have been lucky enough to get occupation somewhat similar to their previous occupation can we regard as secure.  The others are likely to find it very difficult to fit themselves into the scheme of things there in future.  That is the reason why this very special action has been taken in relation to them.</P>

It is quite probable that it is maintained by the Board of Works out of a fund which is replenished by contributions from the county council in the areas where piers exist.

      <P>The reason why I asked this question in the Minister's absence was, as I pointed out, that in connection with several of the piers liability for maintenance rests with the Board of Works.  In the case of other piers the liability rests with the county council.  In the case in which I was interested the liability was alleged to belong to the county council. The county council, when called upon to carry out some repairs, said that the liability was not theirs at all. That is the difficulty.  Numbers of those piers are falling into decay. When we come here to the House to know whose is the liability, or whose the responsibility, we are told in one case it belongs to the Board of Works, and in another case to the county council.  When we go to those authorities neither will admit any liability, with the result that the decay still goes on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to correct what appears to have been a minor mistake in the drafting of the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925, in consequence of which compensation cannot be paid to certain persons entitled to it until this amendment has been effected.  The 1925 Act gave the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to acquire compulsorily lands or premises, easements, way-leaves, water-rights, fishing rights or other rights over or in respect of any lands, premises or water; it authorised him compulsorily to terminate, restrict, or otherwise interfere with any easement, way-leave, water-right, fishing right or <Col N="315" /> other right existing over or in respect of any lands, premises, or water; and authorised him compulsorily to divert, close, remove, or otherwise interfere with any public or private road, way or bridge or any canal or other artificial waterway or any artificial watercourse. The Act of 1925 did not, however, empower the Minister compulsorily to interfere with lands or premises.</P>
      <P>The Minister in the course of his functions had compulsorily to interfere with lands or premises, and in consequence of the absence of these words in the Act and the other words set out in Sections 2 and 3, compensation cannot be paid to persons whose lands or premises were interfered with but not acquired.  Investigations have been made in all these matters, and it is desired to have this amendment effected.  It is clear from the framework of the Act that it was intended to have this amendment in providing for compensation for such people, and it was only when the compensation was about to be paid that some legal genius who always discovers such things at awkward times discovered that we had no right to pay out the money.</P>

      <P>No, no.  The Act related only to the consideration of the Shannon scheme.  The Electricity <Col N="316" /> Supply Board was not in existence at the time.  It was brought into existence about 1927.  This has nothing to do with the Electricity Supply Board, only with the construction of the Shannon works.  I do not think it is likely that any lands or premises will be interfered with in the future.  This amendment is to provide for compensation for something that has been done already.  It was only when we came to pay out the money for compensation that the flaw was detected.</P>

      <P>This is to amend the Act of 1925, but under that Act very extraordinary powers were given to the Minister, and naturally they were utilised for the purpose of constructing the works.  So far as I am aware very similar powers have been given to the Electricity Supply Board under the 1927 Act to interfere with private property.  There was a case in which the Minister or the Electricity Supply Board were sued in the courts, and it was sought to restrict them from putting a pole in front of somebody's drawing-room window.  I think it was stated then that the Electricity Supply Board were entitled to put the pole in the middle of the drawing-room floor if they wanted to, and I think it was Deputy McGilligan's intention when he went out of office to introduce some kind of amending legislation to restrict these powers.</P>
      <P>This Bill, I recognise, is merely introduced to correct an anomaly, but I think this is the occasion to draw the Minister's attention to the powers that were given to the Minister under the 1925 Act, and are at present in operation under the 1927 Act to the Electricity Supply Board.  I wish to draw his attention to the powers that have been given to the Electricity Supply Board to acquire property belonging to the citizens of this State. I want to submit that some of the rights given to the Electricity Supply Board and the Minister are preposterous and those rights should be closely examined and drastically revised.  I know it will be a matter of some difficulty to examine the whole question but this is a matter that deserves to be very fully examined, and urgently requires remedying.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to a legitimate grievance that the Limerick fishermen have.  This grievance led to a very serious fracas last year.  Some sort of provision should be made to put up a grill or something to prevent fish going into the turbines and thus depriving the fishermen there from what should be their natural property. The difficulty could be avoided if an effort were made to put up a grill but efforts to have that done have met with failure and I wish to draw attention now to the necessity, if it is necessary, to have a clause inserted to restore the natural right of the fishermen. It is time to do something for those men.  They have lost very heavily and I do not want any further interference by the military or the police to prevent people getting what they consider they are naturally entitled to.  If the Minister puts in any necessary provisions for the erection of this safeguard it would prevent any recurrence of these affairs and leave the natural run of fish to the fishermen who have been fishing there all their lives.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is the payment of compensation to persons whose lands or premises were compulsorily interfered with in the course of the erection of the Shannon works.  Those responsible for the works proceeded on the assumption that they had the right to interfere and could pay compensation for any losses occasioned by their interference.  It was when the question of paying compensation arose that it was discovered that certain defects existed in the Bill. It has not anything to do with the fishermen.  As I mentioned in reply to a Parliamentary question some time ago, we have had an Inter-Departmental Committee considering the whole question of Shannon fisheries.  It has reported now and its report is being examined.  On the face of it, I can say that it is probable legislation will be introduced at an early date but what will be the nature of the legislation I am not in a position to <Col N="318" /> say.  It is clear that it is a matter distinct from that covered by this Bill.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that where the owners of fishing rights had their property destroyed, or its value reduced by the operation of the Shannon scheme, they are entitled to compensation under the Shannon Act of 1925, and there is no question of our right to pay them compensation. This Bill remedies certain defects in respect of land and premises.  The Deputy's question is a somewhat different one.  It relates to the future of the fisheries.  Those who have lost, or whose property has been damaged, are entitled to compensation, but the men on behalf of whom Deputy Keyes speaks have been getting their livelihood from the fisheries, and are anxious that their livelihood should continue, and it is in connection with their case that we have the Inter-Departmental Committee at work.</P>

      <P>This is rather a technical Bill the necessity for which has arisen out of certain legal difficulties that have appeared both here and in Great Britain in respect of certain superannuation and similar funds.  The Finance Act of 1921 empowered the Revenue Commissioners to exempt from income tax certain superannuation funds provided that the Revenue Commissioners were satisfied that they complied with certain conditions set out.  In Great Britain when the Revenue Commissioners were examining the trusts of certain of these funds they came to the conclusion that a number of them were invalidated by reason of the fact that they were in conflict with the rule of law against perpetuities.  It is a rule of common law that property cannot be disposed of or transferred so as to delay the period in which it will pass into the hands of an absolute owner for longer than a life or lives or 21 years afterwards. The general principle is that as soon as possible property must pass into the hands of an absolute owner who may dispose of it or use it as he wishes and the period for which it would be in the possession of a limited owner such as a tenant for life should be as short as possible.  There is consequently this rule of law against perpetuities and the Revenue Commissioners came to the conclusion that a number of these trusts were invalidated because they were in conflict with this rule.  A test case was heard in Great Britain in 1924 and the court held that the trust of the particular fund in question was void because of that reason. The position then arose that there were a number of these funds, some of them of very great importance, the legal position of which became questionable and also the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="320" /> could not grant the exemption contemplated by the Act because these funds offended against the law. A British Treasury Commission considered the matter and made recommendations which were ultimately embodied in the Bill passed by the British Parliament in 1927&mdash;a Bill very similar to that now before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The position here was examined in or about that time and it was found there were a number of funds, some of which were of considerable importance, in the same position and similar legislation would be required here. The legislation is necessary, of course, because the position in respect of these funds would be serious if allowed to continue.  Most of these funds are superannuation funds for the employees of particular concerns receiving contributions both from the employer and the employees.  In so far as these funds are bad in law, the employer's contributions, in the event of his bankruptcy, could be claimed by a creditor to meet his liabilities and, in some other way, the position of the payments now being made might be seriously jeopardised.  It is proposed to set up a Register of these funds and to exempt from the operation of this rule against perpetuities such funds as in the opinion of the Registrar comply with the conditions set out in the Bill which are embodied in Section 2 of the Bill and the rules of which comply with the conditions set out in the Schedule.  The Bill is practically similar in effect to that enacted in Britain and puts the law here on a par with the law there, which is desirable because some of these funds operate in the Saorstát and in the area of the jurisdiction of the British Parliament.  It is a technical measure, the necessity for which cannot be denied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act is designed to legalise perpetual funds.  The decision of the British court is that these perpetual funds are void.  These are funds which are in the ownership of trustees for a limited period only. They never at any stage, pass into the hands of absolute owners.  They are only for a limited period in the hands of particular trustees, and consequently, they are in conflict with the rule against perpetual trusts.</P>

      <P>This section relates to registration.  As the Minister says, the Bill is a highly technical one.  I do not know how these superannuation funds are perpetual.  I imagine that they are operated largely by firms like Guinness, Jacobs and the Imperial Tobacco Company.  We are prescribing a whole set of rules for their future administration.  I do not know how far these rules are going to conflict with the administration of those superannuation funds, or whether they are going to make the firms that provide funds of this character liable for any inconvenient sums of money.  For instance, there may be arrangements with some of these firms to invest sums of money in their undertakings, and to credit the proceeds of these sums to the registration fund.  It may be that the rules we are making in this Bill will seriously conflict with the rules at present obtaining in connection with many of the superannuation funds in this State.  Has the Minister had an opportunity of investigating that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>We have this practical experience, that most of the important funds are not confined to this State. They are funds that operate outside the State in connection with companies whose activities extend beyond the borders.  There are some of them whose business extends to Great Britain: and this legislation has been in operation for the last five years in Great Britain without any difficulty. I am certain there will be no difficulty in bringing the rules here into conformity with the rules of the Schedule.</P>

On the face of it I do not think that is an unreasonable proposal, but it might create confusion if a large firm was required to find £10,000, £20,000 or £30,000 immediately out of their own company.</P>

It is not a case of a comma.  In other words, if neglect is proved it is not a good defence.  The words &ldquo;and was not facilitated by any neglect on his part&rdquo; are a qualification of the words &ldquo;occurred without the consent or connivance of such person.&rdquo;  In other words, you will have to prove that the absence of consent or connivance was not due to neglect, or occasioned by neglect; if there is neglect proved it is not a good defence, even though there is absence of consent or connivance.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to see anything in a Bill you are rushing through, but paragraph 13 of the Schedule states that any person who is entitled to benefit under the fund is entitled to ask for a copy of the rules.  Would it not be well to insert a proviso that he must make some token payment, say of 3d. or 1d. before he would be entitled to a copy of the rules?

      <P>I move amendment 1.</P>
      <P>In page 2 at the end of Section 1 to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Each of the following persons shall for the purposes of this Act be a national of Saorstát Eireann, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a person born in Saorstát Eireann or the area now comprised in Saorstát Eireann;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  a person who at the relevant time is and for not less than five <Col N="327" /> consecutive years immediately preceding that time has been ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>This amendment applies to moneylenders the same provision with regard to nationality that was applied in the Control of Manufactures Act, and I think it is reasonable that that should be done.  An inquiry was made into the position with regard to moneylending in this country arising out of certain complaints that were made and certain things that required to be investigated.  I think it will be an additional safeguard in the control of moneylending operations here if the same provision as regards nationality is applied to moneylenders as is now applied to the control and conduct of manufacturing business.</P>

      <P>I have no particular view on this matter, but how is the Deputy going to apply this to a company?  The only other view I have is that I understand, although there is no recommendation one way or other in the report of the Committee, that all these aspects were considered by the Committee and, in the Bill, I followed absolutely the recommendation of the Committee after having examined it and I do not feel justified in departing from what they recommended.  I do not see, however, how you can apply the amendment to a company.</P>

      <P>I submit that it is as important to regulate in this way the position of those in control of the moneylending business as it is the ordinary manufacturing business. We have an example this morning in connection with the setting up of a cement company here.  It is proposed to control by nationality the persons engaged in that particular company. I submit to the Minister that if the structure of the Bill itself creates any difficulty with regard to the control of a company dealing with moneylending, he ought to accept this principle from the Dáil as regards the <Col N="328" /> control of persons and that in so far as some fresh amendment may be necessary in the Bill to deal with companies, the passage of the Bill through the Seanad will give him the opportunity of doing that.  I do not appreciate that the question of a company raises a difficulty in this Bill, because it does not raise a difficulty in, say the Cement Bill or any of the other industries that are being controlled by the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>

      <P>My recollection is not very clear upon this matter, but I am sure Deputy Little will put me right especially as I was not present at every meeting of the Moneylenders Committee.  My recollection is that the subject matter of this amendment was not discussed or did not come before the Moneylenders Committee.  I should like to point out for the consideration of the Minister that I do not think there are any companies really so-called which are moneylenders.  Are not the moneylending firms in existence, even though they may put company in the name of the firm, really a partnership and no more?</P>
      <P>There are no limited liability companies of moneylenders.  There might be one or two gentlemen who set up up the moneylending business, but there are no limited liability companies in the proper sense of the word.  I believe&mdash;in fact, I am quite certain&mdash;that if people embark on the business of moneylending it might be advisable, and I think there is a good deal to be said for it, that if the extraordinarily profitable business of moneylending is to be carried on, the profits should be confined to persons in this country and that gentlemen from abroad should not be allowed to settle down here and make this the sphere of their operations, by which they may manage to collect large sums of money profitably and quickly in the fashion in which moneylenders are, at any rate, credited with getting it.</P>

      <P>I did not quite catch the Minister's reference with regard <Col N="329" /> to the difficulties.  Sub-section (3) of Section 3 describes how a company shall get this licence.  It says: &ldquo;For the purposes of this sub-section the true name of a limited liability company shall be the name under which such company was incorporated.&rdquo; The amendment standing in Deputy Mulcahy's name is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;In page 3, before Section 4 (3), to insert a new sub-section as follows&mdash;&lsquo;(3) A certificate under this section shall not be granted in respect of a person who is not a national of Saorstát Eireann.&rsquo;&rdquo; A limited liability company is a juristic person, but you could not describe a limited liability company incorporated in Saorstát Eireann as a national of Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <P>If it is a juristic person, and if such a person, being incorporated in Saorstát Eireann, becomes a national of Saorstát Eireann, I do not see any difficulty in applying it to limited liability companies.  I think the difficulty we are faced with is that if the moneylending laws become more stringent in England, the greater will be the tendency for them to come over and camp here.  I think we have quite enough of them here already if we are to judge by the report of the Moneylenders Commission. However, I would have preferred to see Deputy Mulcahy employ the term &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; here instead of &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; because I think the less we emphasise the difference in juridical nationality between here and the Six Counties the better for all of us.</P>

      <P>This is a most futile little Bill really.  There was a very large problem here&mdash;that was the provision of seeds and manures for a great number of persons in this State who were not able to purchase manures for themselves, and who were forced in <Col N="334" /> consequence this year to put down their crops without an adequate amount of manure, and in some instances without any at all.  This matter however was very fully discussed on a motion which I brought forward in the House.  My arguments then fell upon very deaf ears, and I do not think that the power of hearing in the Minister for Agriculture has improved since last March, and that there is no use in my going over the same ground again.  What miserable little sums these are to deal with large problems!  The grant to the constituency or rather to the county which I represent falls short even of £2,000.  The Bill as far as it goes is to a certain extent right, but I think it should be upon the Government and not upon the county councils to have solved this problem.  As I said, it is a miserable wretched little Bill which effects nothing.  I have nothing further to say on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Bill introduced last year the county, councils were authorised to supply seeds and manures for the people.  My recollection of that Bill was that the county councils were supposed to supply them on loan, that the people were to pay for the seeds and manures after the harvest.  That is I take it the intention of this Bill.  I would be interested to know how far the facilities provided by that Bill were availed of and in how far were the county councils repaid.  I imagine if we are to judge from our own experience on our farms if people paid for the seeds and manures last spring, very few of them would have been able to repay what they borrow this time.  I will be very much interested to hear if any of them were <Col N="335" /> able to repay.  I hope they were.  But I think we should consider this scheme in the light of our experience.  The sum provided is not quite so small, £25,000.  I think it would be desirable to know from the Minister how the last scheme worked in order to ascertain if some more profitable way of administering this scheme could not be devised.</P>

      <P>Last year a number of county councils on the advice of the Minister gave out seeds and manures. Under the new regulations this year before any person could be supplied with seeds and manures they had to sign some sort of insurance.  They had to get two solvent sureties.  I would think that the county council under this Bill should be recouped for what was lost by them in this scheme. I do not think any county council should be asked to lose this money. Recoupment should be given to those county councils who gave out the seeds and manures last year.  They should be treated so that the loss would not fall on the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have experience in the administering of these schemes for the past two years.  About 50 per cent. of the seeds supplied in 1932 was paid in full and up to about two months ago, I should say roughly speaking 50 per cent. was still outstanding.  Some of that money may have come in since. I estimate that there will be not less than 25 per cent. to fall on the county council.  However it is a good scheme and it justified itself by enabling many who could not obtain the necessary seeds and manures for their land to sow their crops.  The scheme is more than amply justified.  In the modification of the scheme as operated this year the Government is guaranteeing to recoup the local authorities 50 per cent. of the losses on the scheme if there is any losses as the result of its operations.  I think that is the Minister's idea.  I disagree altogether with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney when he suggests that the State should bear the responsibility for the whole cost of this scheme.  Local responsibility is <Col N="336" /> needed because then you will have more careful selection of the people who will be given the facilities under the scheme.  I would advise, with a full sense of responsibility, that the scheme should proceed.  It has justified itself, will justify itself in the future, and will be an earnest of the Government's intention to help those who have certainly had somewhat distressing times, from various causes, in the past.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This £303 is a recoupment of portion of the expenses of a school manager in defending an action brought against him by a former teacher in the school. It is a recoupment of one-half of the manager's legal expenses as certified to the Department.  The circumstances were that an investigation was carried out in a particular school, and <Col N="337" /> the Department decided to withdraw recognition from an assistant teacher. The teacher subsequently took proceedings against the manager, against the divisional inspector, and against two other teachers in the school.  The case was brought before the High Court, and the teacher in question succeeded in getting damages against the two teachers, but not against the manager.  Finally, the case was brought to the Supreme Court, and the judgment was there reversed.  The manager had to undergo considerable expenses in connection with the case, and a promise was given that a recoupment of his expenses would be favourably considered.  Accordingly we have agreed to recoup him to the extent of one-half the expenses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I have to say on this matter is that I am really rather inclined to think the Department would have been well advised, and would have acted more generously, if they had recouped the entire of the expense, because if you consider the position of the manager in this case he had really nothing to do with it.  There was an action brought against him, however, in which he was successful, but he could not get one single penny costs. In all respects he simply did what the Department practically told him to do, and it does seem to me rather hard that he should be put to a loss&mdash;the Minister said this was a recoupment of one-half the expenses&mdash;of £303.  It does not seem fair that the manager, through carrying out what the Department asked him to do, in fact, practically told him to do, should incur a loss of £303.  I think the Department, instead of coming forward with an Estimate for £303, should have come forward with an Estimate for double that sum, and paid the entire costs. It should be the general principle that when a manager of a national school does the thing which the Department tells him to do, and an action is brought against him, the Department should see him safe as to costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney in pressing that suggestion on the Minister.  The <Col N="338" /> Minister will remember that what really happened was that an action for conspiracy was brought against this manager.  When the case was brought to court the complainant was asked with whom had the manager conspired, and the reply was &ldquo;with himself.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>After a lengthy hearing, judgment was entered in favour of the manager. Subsequently the case went to the Supreme Court, which acquitted the manager of any charge of conspiracy or impropriety.  As Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has said, circumstances may arise from time to time when the manager is bound, in the due discharge of his duties, to take upon himself the dealing with a teacher; the position really is that the Department has insisted upon his adopting that course. Where a situation of that kind arises the manager is entitled to look to the Department for indemnity against costs.  There is no use in recovering costs in either court from a person in those circumstances; they cannot put up one penny.  I suggest to the Minister that in this and similar cases he should favourably consider the proposal that the manager should be assured, in defending his good name or the good name of the Department, and rebutting a charge of conspiracy levelled against the Department or against himself, that the Department will indemnify him in cases where it is impossible for him to recover the costs.</P>

      <P>The question as to the extent to which the manager was carrying out the instruction of the Department of Education in this matter is one that I am not going to debate now.  I simply want to say that in connection with the manager's part in the business I cannot admit that he had any legal right to the recoupment of his expenses.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputies who have spoken will recognise that it may happen that there will be occasions on which cases of this or an analogous kind are taken against managers.  Even assuming that the manager is acting in good faith and is <Col N="339" /> carrying out his duties, I do not think that Government Departments, particularly the Department of Finance, could be readily got to agree that we should here and now accept the principle that when a manager is concerned in a case like this the State should bear the entire cost.  The only promise that was made to the manager in question was that the matter would be favourably considered.  Although the case went through a long and tortuous process of law there was never any definite promise made by our predecessors that the whole of the expenses would be recouped.  We think we are fulfilling the promise that was made to the effect that the matter would be considered favourably, by recouping the expenses to the extent of one-half.  Whatever the merits of the case may be, and whatever the losses which the manager has undoubtedly sustained, I do not think there is the slightest chance of having the matter reconsidered further at this stage.</P>

    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £1,420,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1934, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Irish Land Commission (44 and 45 Vict., c. 49, s. 46 and c. 71, s. 4; 48 and 49 Vict., c. 73, ss. 17, 18 and 20; 53 and 54 Vict. c. 49, s. 2; 54 and 55 Vict., c. 48; 3 Edw. 7, c. 37; 7 Edw. 7, c. 38, and c. 56; 9 Edw. 7, c. 42; Nos. 27 and 42 of 1923, 25 of 1925, 11 of 1926, 19 of 1927, 31 of 1929 and 11 of 1931).</P>
    <P>This Estimate is required in order to relieve the Guarantee Fund of its liability to make good the deficiency in the Purchase Annuities Fund due to the non-collection of purchase annuities for the May-June, 1933, gale under the Land Acts, 1891 to 1909.</P>
    <P>Purchase annuities set up under the Land Acts, 1891-1909, are payable into the Purchase Annuities Fund.  On the 31st January and the 31st July in each year the Land Commission certifies the amount of the annuities in arrear on those dates, and an advance of such amount must be made forthwith to the Purchase Annuities Fund out of the Guarantee Fund.</P>
    <P>The position is therefore that the deficiency in the Purchase Annuities Fund on account of annuities not collected on the 31st July next must be made good by a draw on the Guarantee Fund, and it is to meet this position and to enable the Government to make a distribution to local authorities on account of their local taxation grants that this Estimate is presented.</P>
    <P>It should be understood that this Estimate makes no ultimate demand on the Exchequer or the taxpayer. It is merely in the nature of a book-keeping transaction.  The Exchequer will be drawn on for the amount of the deficiency which will be required to be paid into the Purchase Annuities Fund on the 31st July, but under the terms of the Land (Purchase Annuities Fund) Act, 1933, the moneys standing to the credit of the Purchase Annuities Fund are to be <Col N="341" /> paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer&mdash;so that the amount withdrawn from the Exchequer to meet the deficiency will be repaid to or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer and no actual charge will be involved.</P>
    <P>The amount of the Estimate is not, therefore, a matter of any great consequence, but the House may desire to be informed as to the manner in which it is arrived at.</P>
    <P>The total of the instalments of the annuities payable into the Purchase Annuities Fund for the gale due 1st May and 1st June, 1933, under the Land Acts, 1891 to 1909, amounts to £1,504,977&mdash;and of this amount it is estimated that about £85,000 will be received by the 31st July next&mdash; resulting in an estimated deficiency of £1,419,977 in the Purchase Annuities Fund on the 31st instant. This figure has been rounded off to £1,420,000, the amount of the Estimate.</P>

Will this same book-keeping transaction appear in the national accounts or when the Minister for Finance is introducing his Budget did he show the Land Commission annuities as an Exchequer receipt in this year and did he provide for it as an expenditure during the year because it would seem as if we are to draw out this money from the Exchequer to make up the guarantee and put it under the head of general expenditure, we ought to show the land annuities that are coming in and which are going to be transferred to the Exchequer instead of to the Guarantee Fund, as a receipt?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather important to know what we speak about when we talk about a book-keeping transaction. We are receiving into the Exchequer all the land annuities.  It will be necessary to make some payments in order to avoid the ordinary statutory demands being made on the Guarantee Fund but it would seem to be very necessary that all these payments and cross payments should be shown in the national accounts so that persons studying them may know what has become of the land annuities received. They are passed to the Exchequer as revenue or they are spent.  I do not know whether it is the intention of the Government to borrow this money by raising a State Loan or to use the land annuities that will come in to the Land Commission on the next July gale or the December gale in order to meet these payments or to raise Treasury Bills as they have done before or by ordinary ways and means borrowing and paying off these borrowings by some subsequent proceeding. It is very desirable to know whether specific provision is being made for this transaction and where the £1,420,000 that is now required is going to come in.  It must come from somewhere if it is to be paid to the Guarantee Fund.</P>

      <P>Is the Guarantee Fund got anything to do with the moneys going to the local bodies?

I suggest that it was a fund set up and taken off the Established Church of Ireland in order to protect the bondholders. Does anyone know what it is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Guarantee Fund was established under the old Acts and was taken over when the Free State was established, and for any moneys not collected the Guarantee Fund has to be kept up by their being made good and would have to be made good either out of the moneys going to the local authorities, or the second fund, the contingency portion of the Licence Duties grant.  There are also sums going for the maintenance of children in industrial schools and payments for children in national and model schools and sums paid out of the Church Temporalities Fund.  The result of this transaction not being made would be to disorganise the finances of local authorities and other services.  It is legally necessary to have this Estimate go through and the Dáil is not a penny richer or poorer because it is going through.</P>

      <P>The Guarantee Fund will be in operation even after our new Land Bill goes through.  If the Deputy does not want to see the people who advanced the money paid, let him say so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>But what the Minister seems entirely to forget is that the persons who advanced the money to purchase land stock and land bonds are not receiving the annuities at all.  It was to guarantee various sums of money which were payable in interest on the stocks under the Ashbourne Act, the 1923 Act and the other Land Acts.  It was the interest on these sums which was guaranteed by the Guarantee Fund.  Certain taxes were hypothecated and I think that the poor law rate was liable for the payments of these but they are now going into the Treasury.  I am talking now of the Land Act passed this year and dealing with that matter I want to know what is the meaning of the Treasury guaranteeing to itself what it is taking from itself.  It seems a rather confused state of affairs.  We assume there is some explanation for it somewhere.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £4,500 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1934, for Payments under the Railways Act, 1924, the Tramways and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, etc., and for other purposes connected with Irish Transport.</P>
    <P>This money is required to pay half of the amount required to meet losses on the working of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company in respect of the working of the Letterkenny and Burtonport, Buncrana and Cardonagh and Letterkenny railways. This railway company has been subsidised each year up to the present and it was contemplated that with the passage of the Road Transport Act, the subsidy for the period ended December 31st, 1932, would have been the last; that the company would be reorganised and that this would have removed the necessity for a subsidy.  The company during 1932 under the terms of the Road Traffic Act, 1932 did reorganise its passenger services and put them upon a sound basis so that they are likely to continue in the future to be operated in an economic manner and yield returns to the proprietors of the company.  During 1933, however, it is anticipated that losses will occur in consequence of the disorganisation of the merchandise traffic with which the Road Transport Act, 1933, is designed to deal.  As that Act would not come into operation in full anyway until the end of the year, it will not be possible for the company to take full advantage of it and to reorganise its merchandise services until the end of the year.  It is to compensate for the possible losses on the working of this year that this Vote is introduced.  It was proposed to close down the railway and I was not very much alarmed at that prospect because in a considerable part of that area I think that road merchandise services are as suitable, if not more suitable, than railway services.  But in respect of one part of the service at any rate that was not the case; the extension to Burtonport is necessary because the roads in that <Col N="347" /> area are not capable of bearing the traffic which would be occasioned if the railway services were discontinued and on enquiry from the Department of Local Government we found it would not be possible to make the roads in condition for road traffic for the present year at any rate.  We agreed therefore to make good one half of the losses on the working and the Government of Northern Ireland agreed to make good the other half.</P>
    <P>There will be thorough reorganisation, plans for which in tentative form have been already submitted, and a clear understanding that no further contributions will be forthcoming no matter what the developments in the future may be.  There is no reason to believe that the company, which was so successful in the reorganisation of its passenger service, will not be equally successful in the reorganisation of its merchandise service. So far as statistics indicate, the merchandise in the year has not diminished, but rather increased, and is sufficient to maintain a transport organisation of a suitable kind on an economic basis.  The fact that the reorganisation necessary could not be contemplated for some time, and that full effects could not be given to it, until the Road Transport Act was in operation, gave, in our opinion, sufficient justification for continuing this year the same financial assistance as in previous years.  That is why we and the Government from Northern Ireland agreed to make this contribution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, definitely this is the last.  The Deputy will understand that these lines were not built as commercial enterprises.  They were built in the main out of Government money and formed relief work at the time.  At no time was the situation of this company such that it could be regarded as commercially sound in the sense of earning dividends over any length of time.  Dividends were paid for a period when the condition of the company did not justify dividends.  The situation is now that the lines will probably be maintained with services reduced and supported by revenue derived from road services.  The company took advantage of the 1932 Act regarding the control of the omnibus services in its district and to some extent substituting road services for rail service in respect of passengers.  That was a success.  The omnibuses are paying concerns and the loss on the working of the railway was substantially reduced.  It was contemplated that the loan would be sufficient to put the whole company, by the end of 1932, in the position that would <Col N="349" /> relieve the necessity for any further subsidy.  It was announced that the subsidy would terminate in 1932.  In the meantime particular developments took place there.  First there was an abnormal growth of the competitive merchandise services in the year, and secondly some diminution of traffic on the line in consequence of the development of industry &mdash;the establishment of bakeries and other industries in Co. Donegal. The loss of traffic there was not very substantial.  In fact, during 1932 the volume of goods was somewhat higher than in 1931, although receipts were slightly less. It is anticipated there will be some diminution of traffic on the system. We contemplate an examination of the transport system in Donegal and a possible development of a port in that county which will have an effect upon the transport system.  Meantime, we consider it is desirable that this system should be maintained, and an opportunity given to carry out reorganisation in respect of merchandise services.  This service will feed the railway and relieve it in some measure of expense and will make the whole concern one capable of carrying on without State assistance.</P>

The Minister is aware that there are a number of other railways, some of them more important than this one, in very unfortunate financial positions.  I think that the House is entitled to some assurance that if it passes this Estimate the Minister will not have to come on again another year with another application of this sort.</P>

      <P>I can give that definite assurance.  When the position of the company was brought to my notice on this occasion my first conclusion was that the better course would be to <Col N="350" /> allow it to close down.  I could not see any future before it on the position revealed by the figures then available. There was the argument that the Burtonport extension was necessary and that the roads were physically incapable of carrying traffic, and that the roads would have to be reconstructed at considerable expense at that particular part of the system. Some other arrangement might be made to permit that particular line to be kept open if the others were closed. When we came to a decision we found that the company had made genuine efforts to put itself on a sound basis in respect of its passenger traffic.  It had not the advantages then of the Road Transport Act of 1933.  Now that that Act is there and that the same position is created in respect of its competitors as was already created in respect of its competitors in the passenger trade, it will be able to carry out reorganisation there.  The subsidy is merely intended to enable it to carry on trade over the period during which that reorganisation will take place.  I may say that the company themselves put up proposals for a reduction of their expenditure and a certain reorganisation of the system of administration which will also reduce expenditure from their point of view.</P>

      <P>It must warm the cockles of the hearts of all of us to see the Minister and Deputy Good in one another's arms assuring one another that there will be no more extravagance in West Donegal.  &ldquo;Bloody&rdquo; Balfour, peace to his ashes, had a somewhat more friendly feeling towards the unfortunate people who live in the neighbourhood of Burtonport and he took the view that rather than let the people perish on the Atlantic coast of West Donegal it was the State's duty to provide some means of bringing these people in touch with the rest of the world.</P>

      <P>Now that we have a good national Government, supported and criticised by Deputy Good, we <Col N="351" /> have discovered that there must be nothing but hard business administration in West Donegal.  The Minister is bounding to his feet to reassure Deputy Good that he is with him heart and soul and that if these people do not put their house in order he will wipe them out.  I suggest to the Minister that he should take a lesson from &ldquo;Bloody&rdquo; Balfour who first put the railway there, who recognised the necessity of a railway, and who realised that the people he had to deal with on the rocks and the heather of that part of the world, are not in a position to offer traffic to a railway sufficient to make a railway economic.  If the Minister can devise some alternative scheme whereby the traffic of this area will be diverted to Sligo, or to a Donegal port, I shall be glad to hear of him doing it.  But, if he imagines that he is going to run an economic railway through the Rosses and Gweedore, or if Deputy Good imagines that he is going to run an economic transport service through the Rosses and Gweedore, he had better think again. So long as the Rosses are the Rosses and Gweedore is Gweedore, he will never run an economic transport service of any kind owing to the very peculiar conditions that obtain there. So long as we have a large population scattered over that part of the country the transport difficulty will be a constant one.  The Minister had better not be so glib in assuring Deputy Good that his orthodoxy will be not longer outraged by any suggestion of the kind put forward to-day.  The Minister will have to make provision for adequate transport facilities for these people in West Donegal, both as to goods and passengers, whether he proposes a transport service from a Donegal port, which I hope he will, or from Sligo, which is the only reasonable alternative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge) Patrick J. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill. It is a Bill to provide pensions for commissioners of the Gárda Síochána in circumstances not provided for hitherto. Pensions for members of the <Col N="355" /> Gárda Síochána, including the commissioner, are regulated at present by a pensions order made in October, 1925, by the Minister for Justice with sanction of the Minister for Finance under statutory powers which enabled these Ministers to make such order. The terms of that order are to provide for the case of a commissioner who retires owing to age or because he has become incapacitated for the performance of his duties, in which case he would be eligible for pension.  No provision, as Deputies will see, was made in that order for the case of a commissioner who is removed for misconduct, and it is not suggested in this Bill that such provision should be made.  I think it will be agreed that there is no need to make such provision as it is the invariable rule of the public service that dismissal for misconduct deprives the offender of any claim to pension. It would be contrary to the regulations of the Civil Service.  No provision, however, was made in the order for the case of a commissioner who is removed on grounds of public policy, without being charged with misconduct or for incapacity.  It is to meet such a situation that this Bill is being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sense of the Bill is that when a commissioner is removed for reasons other than incapacity or misconduct, a certificate is issued by the President of the Executive Council to that effect and, thereupon, the Minister for Finance is enabled to grant such commissioner a life-pension on the terms set out in the Bill.  As regards these terms, I may perhaps explain that the ordinary pension of a police officer is ascertained by taking a fraction of his salary, the denominator of the fraction being the figure 60 and the numerator being the number of years of his completed service.  If, however, his completed service is more than 21 years then every year over 20 years counts as two, so that 22 years' service counts as 24, 23 years' service as 26, and so on. In the ordinary course, therefore, a police officer with 22 years' service would have for a pension twenty-four sixtieths of his salary at date of retirement. In the case of a commissioner who fails to be pensioned under this <Col N="356" /> Bill we have provided, however, by way of additional compensation, that a certain number of years may be added to his actual service for the purpose of calculating a pension.  The precise provisions in that respect will be seen in sub-section (3) of Section 1. Then, at the end of the Bill, there are certain provisions and safeguards to ensure that pensions may not be obtained by fraud and that they may be forfeited or reduced in certain events, and so on.  These are the usual provisions which are provided, I think, under the Pensions Act of 1924.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that this is the Bill which the President, some time ago, promised to introduce here; in other words, that it is a Bill intended to provide a pension for the Commissioner of the Gárda, General O'Duffy, who was removed for reasons other than incapacity or misconduct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I take it that it would be extraordinary if such a thing should happen again. I should like to know from the Minister what pension will the late Commissioner actually receive under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum that he can receive would be £520.  The actual number of completed years' service in the case of the former Commissioner was ten.  The Bill authorises the addition of 12 more years as a maximum, making a total, if the maximum is given, of 22, and as the two years over 20 count double, as I have already explained, the result would be that the Commissioner would be entitled to twenty-four sixtieths of his salary by way of pension.  Therefore, on the salary he had, the maximum which can be granted to him under this Bill would be £520 per annum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister might let us know if there are any precedents for paragraph (b) of sub-section (3) of Section 1, where it says that, &ldquo;Where the said number of completed years amounts to or exceeds ten, the addition of such number of years not exceeding 12, as the Minister for Finance shall direct.&rdquo;  I cannot call to mind any precedent whereby a discretion of that kind is left in the hands of a Minister.  It would seem that if we are going to introduce pension proposals here we ought to make statutory provision for what the pensioned person would be entitled to and to withdraw from the hands of any Minister any discretion of this kind.  As it stands, it means that it devolves, by implication, on the Minister to express approval or disapproval of the person concerned, and we all know what that means.  We know that if the Government which may succeed Fianna Fáil deemed it expedient to remove a commissioner and that their followers had a strong bias against the commissioner who was about to be removed, heavy pressure would be brought to bear on the Minister for Finance to be as niggardly as possible with regard to the pension and to withhold as many years from his service as he possibly could.  The Minister can do that under that paragraph.  We all know of the case of General O'Duffy, who was removed by the Government for reasons other than misconduct or incapacity, <Col N="358" /> and we are all aware that certain persons, who sometimes say they are supporting the Government and at other times describe Mr. de Valera as an honest republican, and again as a trafficker in virtue and as a person who is seducing the republic, have made scurrilous attacks on General O'Duffy and have threatened the Government with dire results for doing what they are doing.  I think it is undesirable to leave the things provided in that paragraph in the hands of a Minister and I think it would be advisable, instead of that paragraph, that there should be an addition of such number of years as would bring the figure to 22 years for the purpose of calculating the figure.  I should be glad to hear that the Minister for Justice, on the Committee Stage, would be prepared to accept an amendment removing that matter from the discretion of any individual Minister and putting in a paragraph which would place a statutory duty on the Minister for Finance to pay a pension on the basis of 22 years' service when there were ten or more years actually served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I can get an exact precedent.  As far as I know, this was based by the Department of Finance on the terms under which the forces were disbanded in the year 1921-22 and where men resigned from the forces for political reasons during the Anglo-Irish trouble.  I understand that Finance has always exercised a discretion as to adding a certain number of years.  I know it had been added on from time to time in certain cases.  Where people retired a certain number of years had been added but I do not think there has been any hard and fast rule governing that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but in the ordinary way of a person retiring there is no hard and fast rule.  There is a certain discretion.  In this Bill, it is provided that where a commissioner has not had ten years' service there is a certain discretion.  Take a man who has eight years' service.  It is <Col N="359" /> open to give him a pension based on ten years' service or 16 years' service. I could not accept the amendment Deputy Dillon has in mind to move on the Committee Stage.  The terms offered in this Bill are reasonable. They are generous and very equitable. I see Deputy Dillon's point.  He wants something fixed and definite but I cannot give any undertaking in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I put it to the Minister that this is not a Bill which provides a pension for commissioners of the Gárda Síochána? It is a Bill really that provides a pension for a commissioner of the Gárda only when he has been removed from office for purposes other than incapacity or misconduct.  This is only dealing with one case.  Therefore this Bill is standing on a special footing. It is not a Bill dealing generally with a commissioner retiring from the Gárda and retiring for ill-health or length of service or anything of that kind.  This only applies to a case where the commissioner is retiring without being incapacitated, where the commissioner has done his duty well and has conducted himself well in his office. It is only providing a pension for a case of that kind&mdash;where a man is removed not through any fault and where he has done his work well.  I think quite a new principle does come in here and you should not be tied down by any precedent.  This is not a case where a man is retiring because of anything personal to himself or through the expiration of time or owing to ill-health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that this is a Bill which is brought in to deal with a special case.  It is a Bill the provisions of which may never again in the history of this State be called into use. There may never again be a case in the history of this State where the circumstances will be similar to this. I suggest to the Minister to let it not be said that at any rate a commissioner with a salary of £1,300 a year after 12 years service should be cut down to £520 a year through no fault of the particular individual.  We are <Col N="360" /> told now that the Minister is not in a position to state what the salary will be.  I admit that is carrying out the letter of the promise made to the House but it is hardly carrying out the spirit of that promise. If the Minister is in a position to tell us what is actually to be done in this particular case the House would be in a better position to judge.  The Minister has said he is not in a position to tell us.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that unless the officer had been 50 years of age or had 25 years' service he would not be entitled to any pension on removal or dismissal, that is removal for incapacity or ill-health or anything else.  That was the position up to now.  What I feel in regard to this Bill is this: there will be a drop from £1,300 to £520, but if we do refer to that case we have to bear in mind that the party concerned was offered two positions in either of which he would be in possession of equal emoluments to those he had in the position from which he was removed.  Let us bear that fact in mind.  Let us also bear in mind that he is a comparatively young man and you are giving him this pension for doing nothing.  He is a young man who is not retiring through incapacity.  He is in good health and I might say really he is in the best part of his life.  When you take into consideration that that particular party was offered two positions in the Government service at a salary equal to what he had and that he refused these two offers, I do not know what attitude he would take up in regard to it.</P>

      <P>I am also looking at it from the point of view of principle and I think, in all the circumstances, the provisions made there are very reasonable.  As the Deputy knows, amongst public bodies there is a rather loose method of adding years.  There has not been anything tied or definite in the matter.  Public bodies in dealing <Col N="361" /> with servants whom they retire have a certain discretion in adding on a certain number of years, for the purpose of calculating the pension&mdash; subject to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  That has been the practice and there has been nothing very strict about it.  It has been the usual practice.  In cases similar to this case where officials retire in similar circumstances there is this discretion.  There is nothing tied down about it or definite.  I would not undertake to accept the amendment referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But this case is different. Wherever you have compulsory retirement as a result of policy such as in the case of the National Health Insurance Act or in the Electricity Supply Act which provided compensation, you have a certain number of years to be added.  And there was a proviso that where persons felt aggrieved they might go before a tribunal in order to establish that they were entitled to so many years to be added to their terms of service.  I want to put it to the Minister that we might as well be frank.  I will ask him a question now. Will he not agree with me that in this particular case there has been a certain warmth of feeling displayed by certain elements in the country?  It is eminently desirable from the point of view of everybody to remove this whole question from that atmosphere of heat and dispose of it in a calm and just way, and the only way in which that can be done effectively is to compel the Minister responsible for the payment to make a payment in regard to the terms of the statute, and not leave him in a position where he would stand alone against a whole barrage of criticism and where a whole band of people may get at him.  That is the only reason why I want to make it mandatory on the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendments Nos. 1 and 2 on behalf of the Minister for Finance:</P>
      <P>1.  In page 3, Section 2 (1) (d) to delete in line 13 the word &ldquo;both&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;more.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>2.  In page 3, Section 2 (1) (d) to insert in line 17 after the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or because it was not proved that the chattels were taken away by any such persons as are mentioned in paragraph (d) of sub-section (9) of Section 15 of the Principal Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Those amendments are designed to deal with persons who had applications for compensation under the preceding Compensation Act rejected by reason of the fact that evidence was not produced to show that the chattels were taken away by a person or persons named in sub-section (9) (d), namely, a person or persons:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  engaged in or purporting to act or who might reasonably be presumed to have been acting in the name or on behalf of any combination or conspiracy for the overthrow of the late Provisional Government of Ireland or of the Government of Saorstát Eireann, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  belonging to or acting or purporting to act on behalf of any unlawful or seditious association, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  requisitioning or purporting to requisition the chattels for the use of or for consumption by any organisation engaged in armed resistance to the Provisional Government of Ireland or to the Government of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If persons were unable to produce evidence that their chattels, in respect of which they made applications for compensation, were taken away by persons coming under those definitions, the claim failed.  It has been represented to the Minister for Finance that, in certain cases where the claims failed for want of the necessary evidence, witnesses&mdash;the parties, in <Col N="363" /> fact, who took away the goods&mdash;may now be available.  In the circumstances, the Minister recommends the Dáil to accept an amendment which would place it within the power of those former applicants to renew their claims.  They will, of course, have to substantiate those claims before the court.  The purpose of amendment No. 2 on the Order Paper is to enable those persons to bring forward those claims.  No. 1 is consequential on No. 2.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2a&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 2 (1), before paragraph (f) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(f)  all injurious acts which occurred in Saorstát Éireann on or after the 1st day of February, 1922, and on or before the 12th day of May, 1923, and were committed by a member or members of the armed forces under the control of the Minister for Defence or maintained by the Provisional Government or the Government of Saorstát Eireann, and consisted of the unlawful taking away of chattels from premises or land in the lawful occupation of the owner of such chattels; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is directed to cases in which cattle for example, or other property, were unlawfully seized from persons by a member or members of the Army during the civil war period. Where those were taken lawfully, provision has already been made to deal with them under Section 6 of the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) (No. 2) Act, 1923, but there have been certain cases in which State forces took away cattle from a man's land quite unlawfully, by way of reprisals for the owner's sympathy or alleged sympathy with the forces in active opposition to the Treaty.  The Minister for Finance, in suggesting that this amendment might be accepted to cover those cases, offers no opinion one way or the other as to the truth or otherwise of those allegations.  He is simply <Col N="364" /> proposing that, as in amendments Nos. 1 and 2 which have been agreed to, those persons should have an opportunity of bringing their cases before the court.  If they satisfy the court that the cattle were taken unlawfully in such circumstances they can be paid the appropriate compensation.  As there are only a few genuine cases of this kind which have come under notice I would ask the House to accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Those amendments are designed to give further time to enable formalities in connection with the forms of application to be completed by applicants to be carried through.  Rules of court have to be framed, and in view of the near approach of the long vacation, and the summer adjournment of both Houses of the Oireachtas, whose approval of the rules will be necessary, there is real danger that the rules of <Col N="365" /> court might not come into operation for some time, and as a consequence the making of claims within the time limit specified in Section 3 might be jeopardised.  Those amendments have accordingly been introduced to provide that instead of &ldquo;within three months after the passing of this Bill&rdquo; it will be &ldquo;within three months after the day on which rules of court come into operation.&rdquo;</P>

I do not believe such a provision as this has ever been inserted in any statute before.  It seems a very strange provision. Those rules may come into force and may be amended many months afterwards.  As far as I can gather from the statement which the Minister has made those claims can be carried on for ever by the drafting of further rules.</P>

    <P>(i)  the person to whom such compensation is awarded dies after the 30th day of June, 1936, and</P>

    <P>(iii)  such son or daughter becomes so entitled, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say, notwithstanding anything contained in any other Act, no payment shall be made after the expiration of such period in respect of such compensation, and any such compensation or part of such compensation not claimed and paid before such expiration shall be irrecoverable;</P>
    <P>(c)  in any other case, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say, notwithstanding anything contained in any other Act, no payment shall be made after the 30th day of June, 1936, in respect of such compensation and any such compensation or part of such compensation not claimed and paid before that date shall be irrecoverable.</P>

      <Col N="368" /> (3)  No payment, except where there is attached to the award or report (as the case may be) a reinstatement condition and no part of such reinstatement condition was complied with before the passing of this Act, shall be made by the Minister for Finance after the 30th day of September, 1934, in respect of any compensation awarded by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission or in respect of any loss or damage which was the subject of a report made before the passing of this Act under Section 15 of the Principal Act.</P>

    <P>(i)  the person in whose favour such award or report (as the case may be) was made dies after the 30th day of June, 1936, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  any son or daughter of such person has before the said 1st day of July, 1936, agreed in writing with the Minister that, in the event of his or her becoming entitled on the death of such person to the land on which was situate the premises to which such award or report (as the case may be) relates, he or she will, within a period of three years after the death of such person, <Col N="369" /> completely comply with such reinstatement condition, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  such son or daughter becomes so entitled, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say, no payment shall be made by the said Minister after the expiration of such period in respect of (as the case may be) such compensation or any loss or damage which was the subject of such report;</P>
    <P>(c)  in any other case, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say, no payment shall be made by the said Minister after the 30th day of June, 1936, in respect of (as the case may be) such compensation or any loss or damage which was the subject of such report.</P>
    <P>(5)  No payment shall be made by the Minister for Finance after the 30th day of September, 1934, in respect of any loss or damage which was the subject of a report made before the passing of this Act under Section 5 of the Indemnity Act, 1924 (No. 40 of 1924).</P>
    <P>This amendment has been tabled in fulfilment of the promise which was made to Deputy Cosgrave on the Committee Stage of the Bill, to deal with the question of reinstatement.  Section 11, as originally drafted, provided that no payment of compensation could be made after 30th September, 1934, in any case, and the Deputy suggested that the fixing of so near a time limit would be unfair to holders of reinstatement awards who had not yet begun reinstatement.  The new section which I am now proposing, in lieu of the original Section 11, is unavoidably a lengthy one.  Stripped of its legal phraseology the following will be the position under it: As regards sub-section (1), in the case of all outstanding decrees to which no reinstatement condition was attached or in which reinstatement has already been begun, the 30th September, 1934, will remain the final date for payment.  There is no good reason for giving any extension in the case of unconditional awards.  As regards reinstatement awards where operations have already <Col N="370" /> begun, the 30th September, 1934, should allow ample time for completion.</P>
    <P>Under sub-section (2), in the case of reinstatement decrees where work has not begun by the date of the passing of the Bill; where the original applicant dies after the passing of the Bill, and before the 1st July, 1936, his successor in title will have three years after the date of the death of the original applicant within which to complete reinstatement.  The latest date for completion in cases of this nature will accordingly be the 30th June, 1939. Where the original applicant dies after the 30th June, 1936, and a son (or daughter) has, before the 1st July, 1936, agreed in writing with the Minister for Finance to complete reinstatement within three years after the date of the original applicant's death, the son (or daughter) on succession to the property has three years after the date of the death within which to comply with that condition.  In every other case, the applicant will have until the 30th of June, 1936, that is a further period of almost three years from now, within which to complete reinstatement.</P>
    <P>The other sub-sections, (3), (4) and (5), are consequential, and distinguish between post-Truce decrees made under the 1923 Act, and awards of the Compensation (Ireland) Commission, Reports under Section 15 of the 1923 Act, and Reports under the Indemnity Act, 1924.  Some of those payments are mandatory on the Minister for Finance, and others are purely discretionary. Provision has to be made to deal with them accordingly under those sub-sections.</P>
