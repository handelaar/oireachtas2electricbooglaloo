    <P>The staff of the unified society will be appointed by the provisional committee of the unified society, who will doubtless employ as many of the existing staffs as possible.  As the office of the unified society will be in Dublin, it may be difficult to provide employment for provincial staffs and it is not possible at this stage to state the number of persons whose services will consequently be dispensed with and paid compensation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> For the same reason, it is not possible to give a reliable estimate of the cost of compensation under the Bill, but it will probably amount to £90,000.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is prepared to extend the period during which a subsidy of £70 is paid to private builders, in view of the fact that great numbers of them were prevented from proceeding with their houses, owing to the scarcity of Irish building materials.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that owing to the inability of many people to secure slates and other materials of Irish manufacture certain delays did take place, delays for which the people concerned were in no way responsible, and in consequence they are liable to lose the subsidy?</P>

The delay occasioned in the making of these inquiries has probably put him beyond the period when he would ordinarily get the subsidy of £70.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the commencement of the current financial year deductions have been made from the salaries of District Court clerks, as in the case of all other officers, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill, 1933.  The deductions in the case of District Court clerks who have been established as whole-time officers are calculated in accordance with the scale set out in paragraph (a) of Part IV of the Schedule to the Bill: in all other cases a deduction at the rate of 5 per cent. has been made in accordance with paragraph (b) of the said Part IV of the Schedule which relates to part-time officers.</P>
      <P>I am aware that difficulties have arisen in determining whether, for the purposes of the Bill, some of these clerks are whole-time or merely part-time and the question of the expenses to be allowed when ascertaining the net salary has also arisen.  These questions will be settled as soon as possible and the total deduction to be made over the entire financial year will be adjusted accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to the question which he addressed to me on the 8th March last, it will not be possible to undertake a revision of the interest rates on advances from the Local Loans Fund until such time as the terms on which the Government itself can obtain long-term loans have been ascertained.  I have already indicated in my Budget speech that it is anticipated that a new loan will be floated this year.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should add, as regards loans for housing purposes, that the amount of the State contributions under the Act of last year, which enables houses to be let at half their economic rent, was fixed having regard to an interest rate of 5¾ per cent.  In the event of it being found possible to reduce the interest rate below that figure, it would, of course, be necessary to consider the question of making an adjustment in the State contribution to the loan charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the fact of 5¾ per cent. being charged for loans for such things as the relaying of water mains and sewerage works has the effect of preventing people from carrying out very useful and necessary works?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he can state the number of pupils on the rolls in the infants' classes in the Central Model Schools, Dublin, whether the regulation forbidding the use of English in these classes has been in operation for a number of years, and, if so why is it that the pupils so taught are not eligible for admission to the all-Irish schools conducted under the direction of the Education Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of children on the rolls in the Central Model Infants' School is 444 (215 boys and 229 girls).  The school has been conducted in accordance with the requirements of the programme for infants' classes. There is no ground for the suggestion that pupils of this school are not eligible for admission to the all-Irish schools.  The fact is that many of them have actually gone direct from it to the all-Irish schools in Marlborough Street.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply may I not inquire why it is that these children, who have been taught in the infants' schools exclusively through the medium of Irish, are not eligible to go to a school where all the subjects are taught through the medium of Irish, or would it be true to say that after they have been taught through the medium of Irish that they are not fitted to be taught in the higher standards in these schools and if that is so, is not that a confirmation of the case I made to the Minister on the Education Estimates that the present methods of imparting the Irish language in the schools is not the most effective method.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister whether it would not be right to say that in the City of Dublin there <Col N="1038" /> are parents who are bringing up their children with the Irish language as the home language and whether that does not make a very strong case for a certain amount of differentiation as between primary schools intended for the use of those children and schools primarily intended for the use of people who bring up their children with English as the home language?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that owing to the prohibition of the use of English in the infants' schools in the English-speaking districts children in many schools are kept in after school hours to receive instruction in English, and whether he has received any representations from managers or teachers as to the injurious effects on the Irish language and on the education of the children of the system which has been in operation for the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that children are kept in after school hours to receive instruction in English. Sometimes infant children receive instruction in English after the hours which for them constitute an &ldquo;attendance,&rdquo; viz.: from 10.30 a.m. to 2 p.m., a period not necessarily coinciding with the &ldquo;school hours&rdquo; which comprise the entire time in each day from the opening of the school to its closing for the dismissal of the pupils.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence to show and I have no reason to believe that there have been any injurious effects on the Irish language and on the education of the children as a result of the programmes of instruction which have been in operation for the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply would I be right in thinking from his reply that infant children are, in fact, kept on after the <Col N="1039" /> hour at which attendance for the infants terminates, and secondly, would I be right in assuming that no representations have been made to him on this score from the managers or teachers or the parents of the children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally I am not in a position to inform the Deputy as to what representations may have been made with regard to the programme since 1922.  I can only say so far as I am aware no representations have been made during the period while I have been acting as Minister.  As regards the other point it is true that in certain instances children are taught English in the infant schools after the hour at which attendance for the infants terminates, that is after two o'clock.  But I am informed that that means that in the case of children who would ordinarily remain on until their elder brothers or sisters bring them home when these are released from school at three o'clock, that sometimes&mdash;I cannot give particulars of the cases&mdash;the teachers do instruct the infants in English during portion or the whole of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that it is a satisfactory thing that the hours that have been appointed as the limit of the children's capacity to acquire knowledge should be exceeded by the teacher, or does he not consider that the educational authorities having prescribed a certain time for the children's instruction, that that time should not be exceeded for any purpose?</P>

      <P>This is the fifth successive occasion when it is proposed to take <Col N="1042" /> Private Members' time.  When I made inquiries yesterday evening as to the order of business to-day.  I was informed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the President that Deputy O'Donovan did not desire to proceed with the discussion on or to conclude the motion standing in his name.  I could quite understand such a request being acceded to on one occasion, but, as far as I know Deputy O'Donovan and all his colleagues in the Centre Party were here on this day week when public business concluded at 4.40 p.m. and when, if he so desired, he had plenty of opportunity of answering the debate which had previously taken place, if the debate was due to conclude. We are not going to be consenting parties to the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy O'Donovan coming to some arrangement or agreement, if you like, which prevents other motions of ours, which are on the Order Paper for a long time, from being taken at the proper time.  If Deputy O'Donovan cannot see fit, or is unable or unwilling to come to the House to conclude the discussion on his motion, surely some other member of his Party could take his place and enable the motion to be concluded and, if necessary, a division taken, and allow our motion, and other motions coming after it, to be discussed in the time allotted for the discussion of such motions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In my experience of this House a more indecent performance has never taken place in my presence. I shall go further and say that I deny categorically every word Deputy Davin has said.  We have consistently held ourselves ready here to accommodate the Government in the discharge of essential business when we have been approached by the Government Whip. When told that the Government would be seriously embarrassed and would be held up in the discharge of urgent public business if we pressed for certain rights, we have tried to accommodate them.  To suggest, as Deputy Davin has suggested to-day, that we have entered into a conspiracy with the Government Whip for the purpose of taking away that right is a monstrous and disgusting charge. That private conversations with the <Col N="1043" /> Parliamentary Secretary to the President can be repeated in this House and twisted is a monstrous and disgusting situation.  I can only say that, so far as we are concerned, we shall not hold ourselves at the disposal of the Government for anything in future; we shall do nothing to accommodate them; nothing to meet them in any way.  We shall press for our rights in respect of business and the time and place for it.  We bitterly resent the misrepresentation of our attitude which has been made to-day. We did not consent to the removal of Private Members' time except on the urgent representation of the Government that they had urgent public business to get through, and it was for their convenience, and only most reluctantly, that we consented to postpone it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The special commercial franchise and separate representation of commercial electors on the Dublin Corporation which this Bill proposes to discontinue was introduced as part of the Local Government (Dublin) Bill, 1930.  The attitude of Fianna Fáil was clearly disclosed on the Second Reading of that Bill.  It was then said that the Bill was evidence of the fear of the common people by those who said they only wanted the will of the people to be put into execution; that it was a vicious effort to restore the old ascendancy on the necks of the Dublin citizens, and was a return to the autocracy that was fought for centuries.  It was pointed out that the principle of giving a man votes according to the size of his bank balance&mdash;for that is what it amounted to&mdash;was bad, and one that no democratic institution ought to stand over, and that the proposed new franchise was an insult to the common people because it was an effort to render their representatives on the council impotent.  Introducing the Bill, the then Ministers asked to have it explained whether there were wanted on the Council of our municipalities men who are highly skilled but who are so very much immersed in commerce and business that they will not turn to the task of facing the ordinary electorate for local government election <Col N="1048" /> purposes.  The answer is in two parts, the first is we want competent representatives, and the second we do not want men who will not do what are the ordinary duties of every citizen unless they have a special franchise and rights.</P>
      <P>One might infer that but for the commercial franchise, business interests would have been unrepresented on the City Council, but that did not prove to be the case.  The ordinary members of the Dublin Corporation are drawn from a wide variety of businesses, professions and classes.</P>
      <P>Assuming this commercial franchise had all the merits ascribed to it, the electors enfranchised thereby might reasonably be expected to make some use of it.  During the period between the passing of the Act of 1930 and the Corporation elections there was not sufficient time available to permit the making of a house to house inquiry to find out particulars of all electors entitled to the commercial franchise. Instead, wide publicity was given and electors were invited to send in claims &mdash;and that involved a minimum of trouble in return for the right of entry into this privileged coterie.  Notwithstanding the drive made, only 1,048 entries appeared on the commercial register whereas a complete register would have contained over 2,500 entries. It may be truly said that the best comment on the franchise was supplied by the people the Bill sought to enfranchise, for more than half either did not want it, or were too indifferent or apathetic to claim it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From any survey of the growth of democratic institutions there emerges one salient feature and that is the gradual widening of the basis of popular franchise.  The historical gradation seems to be: (1) Aristocracy, (2) Plutocracy, and (3) Democracy.  The provisions contained in the Commercial Franchise Act was a futile attempt to revert in time to a system of Government that is now outworn.  I am aware that it was contended that the objects of the legislative provisions embodied in that Bill was to give representation to business people possessing offices or commercial concerns in the city, but disqualified on the grounds of residence <Col N="1049" /> outside the municipal area.  But the Bill itself, as it came before the Dáil and passed into law, effected far more than this trivial modification of the law.  It created within a democratically elected assembly a reservation based entirely on wealth, access to which was restricted to a particular class and it set up a most dangerous precedent for the perpetuation of class conflict.  It provided emphatic and unanswerable argument for those who would contend that there was one law for the rich and another for the poor. In short, it was the nucleus of a scheme which, if generally adopted, would necessitate a fresh agitation for franchise reform such as most people thought was settled a century ago.  It will, however, be observed that this daring and reactionary experiment was not attempted outside Dublin; seemingly some slight political insight remained and the municipal constitution of Dublin was the only one to be stigmatised with this inexcusable reversion to the discredited principles of plutocracy.  The object of the Bill now before the House is to remove that stigma and to restore to the ordinary local government electors of Dublin County Borough the complete control of their municipal franchise.</P>
    <P>So far as any claim may be preferred by non-resident business people, it may be noted that the wide periphery of the new city area has included most suburban claimants to municipal franchise. Accordingly, I move the Second Reading of the Bill to discontinue this system.  The total membership of the Corporation is not proposed to be reduced on the passing of this Bill and the Borough Electoral Area Order of 1930 will be amended so as to distribute over the existing borough electoral areas the five seats at present reserved to commercial members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement just read by the Minister indicates a certain amount of hesitation in its preparation, and a certain lack of appreciation of the historical events of the last few years.  In the first place, when this commercial register was instituted it was opposed by two Parties in the Dáil&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Party and the <Col N="1050" /> Labour Party.  The Fianna Fáil Party, with all the lustre it had achieved by its criticism of the measure in the Dáil, went before the electorate, as far as my recollection serves me, with 19 candidates for membership of the Council.  Many of them were prominent representatives.  Some of them were already aldermen.  No less a person than the Minister who has introduced this Bill had been an alderman of the Dublin Corporation when he went before the electorate on that occasion, and he came back a councillor. Another member of the Party who was a T.D. was not elected at all. That would be irrelevant but for the references in the speech of the Minister to people who did not approve of this proposal.  At that municipal election, out of the 19 candidates put forward by the representatives of the Party opposite, only six or seven were returned.  And the electorate returned a much larger number of persons who stood as representing what was called the commercial interests or the business interests.  There were 30 vacancies and out of that 30 only six or seven candidates representing the Party opposite secured seats.  That shows the people's appreciation of the criticism to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the underlying principle with regard to the commercial register?  The electorate, at the present moment, is so arranged that there are very large constituencies. This is not the moment when persons who have huge business, considerable industry or manufacture, have at their disposal very much time to woo the electorate.  They, as a rule, do not take part in politics with the same vim as the ordinary public representative does.  They are engaged in doing their ordinary business, and one can quite understand in that way the reluctance on the part of men with very big businesses to enter into municipal politics or even to come into politics at all.  The consequence is that that particular order of the community is practically unrepresented. Is it good business or good administration, is it good for the management of the city, that trade, and persons engaged in trade, such as <Col N="1051" /> industrialists, manufacturers and people having large commercial interests in the city, should be almost divorced from representation in the municipality?  I do not think it is. I think the more one can associate the representatives of those big industrial corporations, commercial undertakings or manufacturing concerns, with the business of the city the better it would be for the welfare and for the management of the city.</P>
    <P>In so far as the management of the city is concerned it might be said to be divided now into two classes. There is the administrative portion of the management, which is concerned with the city manager; and there is the question of policy which comes before the municipality itself and upon which the Council can pronounce and decide.  Now this commercial register was welcomed by the business interests in the city.  It was welcomed by more than the business people in the city.  The ordinary man in the street seems to appreciate the advisability of having representatives of those who are largely responsible for the business of the city in the municipality. It enables the ratepayers who had very considerable business interests in the city to get direct representation.  It gives the Council an opportunity of keeping closely in touch with industry, with manufacture and with commerce.</P>
    <P>To a person weighing up whether or not he would engage in industrial enterprise, it would be an inducement to know that his colleagues in business would have a voice in the representation of his interests and in the management of the city.  The register brought industrialists, commercial men and the ordinary elected representatives of the people into close touch.  Each gained more knowledge of the difficulties of the other, and they saw how much they had in common rather than how much there was in dispute between them.  We had an example in this House within the last few years of the usefulness of that community of interest which is inseparable from any assembly in which there is goodwill.  There was a <Col N="1052" /> trade dispute in Dublin which lasted two or three months.  The predecessor of the present Ceann Comhairle was well known to what one might call the spokesmen of the two parties.  He had earned the good opinion of both these parties in so far as they were represented in this House.  It looked as if they came to the view almost at the same time that he would be an admirable person for settling that trade dispute.  They arrived at that conclusion by reason of their association in this House, their knowledge of one another, and their opinion regarding the capability and character of the person concerned.  No sooner had the request been made to the ex-Ceann Comhairle than he got to business and composed that dispute. These are some of the advantages which come from close contact between different interests in a matter of common interest.  The common interest of the people of the city is its development and its good management.  A register such as this gives an opportunity to people accustomed to the running of big concerns, people having wider and greater opportunties than those engaged in smaller businesses, to see how developments can be carried out.  They are, perhaps, brought into contact with some of their own employees and that leads to community of interest.  I think that the commercial register has given satisfaction not alone to commercial interests in the city but to the people of the city and that there is no real case for repealing what has been in existence for only three or four short years. As usual, we get a red herring drawn across this matter as across other matters which come before the House. The institution of this commercial register, we are told, was a sop to the old ascendancy.  There are as many persons with Gaelic names returned as commercial representatives of the City of Dublin in proportion to the whole number as there are persons with Gaelic names in the Ministry.</P>

      <P>Nobody can draw the line in this country as regards people who are not of Gaelic extraction becoming more Irish than the Irish themselves.  Attempts have been made now and again to do it.  So far as politicians are concerned, it depends very largely on what side these people are.  If they are on a certain side, absolution is given at once in respect of any infirmities there may be in their genealogy or, in fact, in any other respect.  If they are not on that side, then they are open to every possible suspicion.  If people are really interested in the advance of public administration, if we want to attract to the public service of the State people who will be of advantage to it, let us not be diverted from that task by talk about ascendancy.  Most of those who speak about it know little about it.  In connection with the running of the city, one could imagine a sensible, level-headed proposition coming from the ascendancy and the microscopes of the Gaels being directed towards it while they say: &ldquo;It must be wrong because it comes from that source.&rdquo;  How many of the Wide Streets Commissioners were of Gaelic extraction?  In the building up of the country we want the assistance of all the people.  We want that community of interest of which I have spoken.  It is necessary not alone in the management of the city but in the development of its business, trade and commerce.  We want to assure people who put their money into manufactures or industry in the city that they will get fair treatment and a voice in the management.  The voice they are allowed is a light voice having regard to the general principle embodied in the Bill of 1930 which in essence, took administration from the municipal council and gave them policy.  Has there been anything materially wrong in the policy advocated by those who were elected on the commercial register? Did they abuse the powers or privileges&mdash;if they are to be regarded as privileges&mdash;they got under that Act?  I knew, at least, one of those representatives who would have been elected in the ordinary course by the citizens but at that time the electorate was not so large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> This Bill is not a good Bill; it is not a good amendment of legislation.  If we go on at the present pace, in respect of practically every measure that has passed the Oireachtas we shall have to look up subsequent statutes to see how much it has been altered and made worse.  If there were no other advantage in the commercial register, the fact that it offers an inducement to industrialists and manufactures to start operations in the city is a good recommendation for it.  That is a recommendation that this Ministry above all should not object to.  I oppose the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to say in very few words that I am opposed to this Bill.  The statement made by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that the principle involved here is a choice between autocracy and plutocracy, on the one side, and democracy, on the other side, is a ridiculous piece of clap-trap of which, I think, he ought to feel thoroughly ashamed.  Looking around the world at the present day, it would be hard not to consider that there is almost as much reason for describing democracy as an outworn system as for so describing either of the other systems.  As a matter of fact, this Bill does not involve any such choice as the Minister suggests at all.  This Bill, as we all know perfectly well, is merely part of the general plan for having all the affairs of this country, including the most minute affairs, governed by a political caucus.  What the Government is attempting to do is to establish not a democracy but a &ldquo;caucocracy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks on the commercial register, which the Minister has assailed.  The Minister says there was no demand from business firms to get on that register.  I am not in a position to check the figures which he has mentioned, but I do know that there was a considerable amount of discontent amongst the commercial community because of the omission of a large number of names from this register.  I know that a number of firms did make efforts to get their names put back on the register.  I say that <Col N="1055" /> there was an omission of names in the case of the commercial register, and it has occurred in other registers as well, but perhaps there is no connection between them.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned something about giving votes according to the size of a person's bank balance.  I do not know whether the Minister was listening to the President's speech a short time ago, but in it he stated he would have given full de-rating to the farmers only that he could not afford to see the farming community having no interest in the spending of the rates.  There is an old maxim: &ldquo;No taxation without representation,&rdquo; and I assumed that the President wished to give an interest to the people whose money was being spent&mdash;to give them a direct interest in controlling expenditure.</P>
      <P>I think it is ludicrous to suggest that the presence of five commercial representatives will have an adverse effect on the decisions of the Dublin Corporation.  I do not know if the Minister has made any census in relation to the business representatives of the Council.  Speaking as a commercial representative, I say that the Dublin Corporation could do with even more commercial representatives than they have at present.  I say that without casting any aspersions on the people who have other qualifications to be elected to the Corporation.  The Minister referred to the disparity that this will cause and said that this is only taking place in Dublin.  I think it is quite a common thing for people who know the city to find that there are firms with valuations running into four figures who have not a solitary vote out of the whole of their business premises. Of course there are caretakers and people with other qualifications who have a vote for those particular premises.  If that is not taxation without representation I do not know what to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not, apparently, looked to other countries to see how far this precedent has been followed. To go no further than across the Border, there is an Act there setting out that &ldquo;where any company on any <Col N="1056" /> qualifying date has occupied as owner or tenant any land or premises in a local governing electoral area and is separately rated for the relief of the poor in respect of such land or premises, such company shall be entitled to have a person specified to be registered as a local governing elector in respect of the said lands or premises.&rdquo;  I do not know how far such a proposition would be considered by the Minister as undemocratic, but it certainly gives the business community an interest and a representation by reason of the representatives that they elect to the Council.  I do not know whether the Minister will agree with me or not, but I say that the Dublin Corporation would be improved if they had a very much larger membership of people who would understand commercial problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know who wrote the statement that the Vice-President read, but it seems to me that whoever wrote it was writing out of his hat.  The Vice-President has stated that progress has been from autocracy or plutocracy to democracy. In relation to democracy he proceeds to assume that it is of its nature essentially good and presumably that applies to the matter we have under discussion. I think the movement has been from democracy to plutocracy and, anyway, I do not know what all that has got to do with local government. The historic case made out for democracy was that a government, being sovereign, has power to legislate, to make laws intimately affecting and regulating the lives of the people.  An element of justice enters into the arrangement whereby all people whose lives may be regulated by the sovereign power of the government, functioning through legislation, may have some control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These local governing bodies have no such legislative power at all.  They have not the power to make laws intimately regulating the lives of every section of the community.  The local governing bodies have the function of assessing and collecting rates and then distributing that money.  There are numbers of people in any district who are not affected by that power of the <Col N="1057" /> local governing body at all.  The original idea of democracy as I knew it was that as far as possible the arrangement should be that every section of the community should be represented.  I deny that democracy has anything to do with local government; it has only to do with a government with power to legislate, a government with sovereign power.  What was the original purpose?  The original purpose was that every section of the community should be represented and should have some say.</P>
    <P>The Vice-President used the word &ldquo;ascendancy.&rdquo;  He thereby is assuming that there is one section of the community which he designates under the term &ldquo;ascendancy.&rdquo;  If there is such a section that section, by all ideas of justice and by whatever is good in the principle known as democracy, has the right to be represented.  The Vice-President is proposing a sort of majority rule whereby the majority will be in the position completely and for all time to tyrannise over the minority.  The Dublin Corporation collects money from ratepayers.  The Vice-President calls this a form of plutocracy.  As Deputy Dockrell pointed out, there are ratepayers in the City of Dublin who have no vote whatever.</P>
    <P>When we were protesting about outside Governments, if anybody suggested that people should have a say in the making of laws in this country though they would not be affected by them, we would denounce it as tyranny.  The Vice-President, in the high name of democracy, which he completely misrepresents, proposes that the Bill should be altered in such a way that it will actually create a situation whereby the people affected, the ratepayers, are going to be disfranchised. So far as I know there is another Bill on hand which is going to propose that people who are not ratepayers are going to control and decide what rates are to be paid.</P>
    <P>I only got up because it seemed to me to be perfectly ridiculous for the Vice-President to stand here and misrepresent this Bill and misrepresent the true meaning of democracy as this Bill actually does misrepresent it. <Col N="1058" /> This Bill is arranged for this reason that the Government Party know very well that they have greater support amongst the irresponsible members of the community than they have amongst the responsible members of the community. The Minister can look down his nose upon this question of valuation.  There are numbers of people in every city who have a great deal of money in the bank but whose actual rateable premises are very little.  On the other hand, you have quite big firms in the City of Dublin on the border of bankruptcy, and as far as their balances in the bank are concerned they consist of overdrafts.</P>
    <P>This commercial register is not correlated to bank balances at all.  It is correlated to one of the interests of the parties in the matter which is under discussion, namely, in the election of a body that has the power to assess and levy rates upon the people.  It seems to me a perfect, just and proper arrangement, and I would wish that the same arrangement would be extended more generally so that we would have a system of representation in the Dáil which would ensure that the interests likely to be affected by the work of these bodies should be represented in them instead of, as the Vice-President seems to think, having some slave party here described, as he describes it, as the ascendancy party, and that it should be for all time completely dictated to by what he would call the majority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see the necessity for this Bill at all.  It is true, as the Vice-President said, that when the Greater Dublin Bill was going through and when the commercial register was compiled and representations given on that register to the commercial people in the city the Fianna Fáil Party voted against it.  But Fianna Fáil fought the municipal elections a little less than three years ago, and out of an elected representation of 30 members they <Col N="1059" /> secured only five seats.  That is what the local government electors thought of the Fianna Fáil opposition to the commercial register.  That commercial register returned five members to the City Council.  But the register is not composed of nor were the candidates in that election confined to the section of the community styled by the Vice-President as the ascendancy.  As a matter of fact, three of the returned five members were well-known nationalists in the City of Dublin. One has since died, and he was succeeded by a man who, for the last 50 years has been actively occupied in the national and public life of this country.</P>
      <P>Any experiment in trying to help local government should at least get a fair chance.  This register is in existence only since October, 1930.  If there was any justification for the amending or ending of that Bill the Vice-President should have made that justification instead of talking wild platitudes and appealing to the proletariat and so on.  If the Vice-President went over any business of those five representatives elected on the commercial register to the Dublin Corporation and saw how they acquitted themselves in the last three years, he would see the position for himself.  As a member of the Corporation, I can say that they have acquitted themselves at least as well as any other group of representatives there.  Why the commercial register should be abolished now I fail to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all the Dublin City Council is charged with receiving roughly £2,000,000 a year in rates and spending that £2,000,000.  I was not here when the Bill was passed.  But I know what prompted this commercial register.  I know what the idea of having this register was.  It was, as Deputy Cosgrave said, bringing the commercial community into closer touch with other sections of the community.  It was also prompted by good business reasons and I think it was justified.  Why should that register be ended now?  I am sure the Vice-President, who fills a responsible position as Vice-President of the <Col N="1060" /> Executive Council and head of a Ministry would, if he were asked to sanction promotion in his Department, sanction promotion for the very best man. Surely he is not going to come to this House and say: &ldquo;I will promote the most popular official regardless of merit.&rdquo;  If you want merit in administering a business which consists of the collection and spending of £2,000,000 annually you surely must pay some regard to the merits of those charged with that responsibility.</P>
    <P>If the Vice-President wants Dublin to be deprived of the business trained minds we are likely to get from the commercial register and substitute these or have the risk of having them substituted by people of the mentality of those who shout &ldquo;Up de Valera&rdquo; and &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo; then we will find a very serious situation in the City of Dublin.  Not only will that be serious to the commercial community but to the working people of Dublin whose work and whose employment are dependent on the ability with which the commercial life of the city is carried on and on the ability with which its municipal life is administered.  It is a business proposition in my opinion to retain this register as one way of getting business talent into the Corporation. If the Minister stands for the opposite proposition&mdash;and that is really what he is standing for&mdash;that the man who has never run a business or the woman who has never run a business is a better man or woman to run the business side of the Corporation than are people who have made a success of their own business, then in that case I certainly will not agree with him.  In support of this measure the statement has been made, in criticism of the commercial register, that bank balances should not speak.  If the Vice-President had much knowledge of commercial or business life he would know that the business community do not speak from bank balances but very often, unfortunately, they have to speak from bank overdrafts.  It is the men of enterprise with bank overdrafts who are running the business and industrial life of the City of Dublin at present. The people with the bank balances are <Col N="1061" /> those who live in sweet suburbia drawing dividends and not concerned with the business or commercial life in the city.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell has appropriately put it that the inherent principle in this Bill, and what the Minister is advocating is taxation without representation. It was to abolish that principle that some hundreds of thousands of American citizens gave their lives in the Civil War.  I am sure the Minister does not want to reintroduce a principle here that has been annihilated the world over.  To reintroduce that principle in the name of democracy is only of a piece with other things introduced by the Government in the name of democracy.  As a member of the Dublin Corporation, I consider that the commercial register has helped in the efficient running of that body.  To the country Deputies who could not have experience of the magnitude of the matters dealt with by the Dublin Corporation.  I can say that that register has helped in the efficient running of the city.  I hope it will continue, and that these false and irresponsible appeals to the proletariat will get from this House the same response that the electors gave to a similar appeal two years ago when it was made to them and beaten by six to one.</P>

      <P>I say with some regret that I was disappointed with the Minister's statement.  I had learned to look upon the Minister as one of the most reasonable and most broadminded members of the Government.  I am afraid the statement which he made this afternoon, and which I am sure, knowing parliamentary procedure as I do, he had no part in the preparation of, will not improve his reputation, at all events from the point of view from which I have judged it.  The Minister stated that the Act which gave representation to commercial classes was a class proposal, and for that reason objectionable.  The Minister is one of those useful citizens who has given of his abilities to the government of the city.  I only wish there were more like him, because one finds amongst a large number of people a disposition to leave such matters as the government of <Col N="1062" /> their city to others.  I hold that there is cast upon them an individual responsibility to do their part in sharing the government of our city.  The Minister, however, has classified the Act which was passed as class legislation.  I look upon it from quite the opposite standpoint. If this Bill passes through this and the other House, what will be the position of those to whom the former Act gave representation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will agree that one of the modern problems in local government is to get representation for those who pay taxes.  The Minister heard in 1930, when the former Local Government Bill was going through, that more than a moiety of the ratepayers of Dublin had no representation on the Corporation.  He did not challenge that statement; in fact, that statement was supported by a member of his Party.  It was to do away with that class legislation that the proposal was carried.  The difficulty arises in modern times owing to the changed condition of business.  In old times in our city and other cities it was the custom of those who ran a business to live over the business.  It is not necessary to look up the history of the City of Dublin to prove the accuracy of that statement.  Owing to the changed conditions not alone have the people who pay the rates and who run businesses moved to other districts, but business itself changed and made another difficulty. Most of the businesses started in this and other cities now are run by companies, many of them joint stock companies, and many of them public companies.  The difficulty that confronts legislatures like this is how best to give representation to the taxation paid by these companies.  That is the problem and the reason why the Bill was brought in in 1930; because a large moiety of the taxation paid in Dublin was without representation.  It was not the method suggested by business men on that occasion.  If the Minister proposes to do away with that method of giving these bodies representation, what method is he going to propose instead?  I do not say that this is the best method, but I will say for it that it has only had three years' trial and, in my humble opinion, knowing something <Col N="1063" /> of corporate matters, it has given excellent results.  I do not say for that reason that it is ideal.  If the Minister has any other proposal to put forward, let us have it and debate it, but to take away this and to give no representation to more than a moiety of the ratepayers of Dublin is doing something that is grossly unfair and unworthy of the Minister.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties we have had for years past, and in this I think Deputy T. Kelly will bear me out, is to get businessmen to come forward for the Dublin Corporation and other bodies like it.  I have had something to do with trying to get businessmen to come forward, and they have told me over and over again that if they were to face an ordinary election as we know it in the City of Dublin for the Corporation they would not be returned.  That statement was challenged.  I remember going on a deputation to the City Hall many years ago to urge a reduction in taxation. After we had discussed the business for which we had gone there, and for which the Corporation had received us, some of the members of the Corporation said: &ldquo;Why do not some of you businessmen come forward and give us the advantage of your experience on the Council?&rdquo; I remember on that occasion we had a very enterprising businessman leading that deputation, and he said he would go forward at the next election.  He went forward at the next election and he was not returned.  That shows that you cannot get representation for this particular class of taxpayer under the ordinary methods.  Special methods are necessary, and all countries are trying to devise methods which will meet the difficulties.  All countries are agreed, as far as I know, that this particular section of the community should get representation.  I do not think there is a person in this House who will challenge the fact that they are entitled to representation.  The only question that can arise is as to how that representation can best be given.  That is the problem that is before us at the moment.  In this discussion I would urge that the <Col N="1064" /> members should devote their particular proposals to that end.  As I said, I am not in any way wedded to this particular proposal.  It has achieved good results.  I do not think anybody would challenge that, but if it is possible to get a better proposal I certainly for one would not oppose it. It is necessary and essential and only fair that these taxpayers should get representation.</P>
    <P>Those who were in the House when this Bill was going through will remember that it was pointed out that in important thoroughfares like Grafton Street, Dame Street, College Green and other areas, there was scarcely a vote giving representation to the larger commercial houses in those areas&mdash;amongst the largest ratepayers in the City of Dublin.  There was scarcely a vote in one of those business houses, while the caretakers employed by those people, and their families, had votes; the people themselves who pay the taxes for the caretakers had no votes.  That is not a principle that any person who looks into this problem will stand up for. I really would urge on the Minister, if he does not think this is a desirable proposal for giving representation, that if he has a better proposal he should let us have it, and let us discuss this matter on its merits and see if we can do something better. If he puts forward anything better I can assure him of my support, but I cannot support the proposal to take away this representation under the circumstances, until I see something better put forward in its place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BartOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am definitely opposed to this Bill.  I think it is ill-conceived, and I am greatly surprised at the Minister for introducing it.  For 18 years I have been a member of public boards.  For four years I was chairman of one board, and I want to say that the business men on that board were my greatest helpers whilst I was chairman.  They had the business training, and they looked at the spending of the ratepayers' money from a purely business point of view.  Many occasions arose on which we had to approach banks and make deals for overdrafts and so <Col N="1065" /> on, and in every case we had to fall back on the businessmen, as they had the training and knew how to approach the subject.  To the Dublin Corporation, of which I am now a member, we have businessmen elected. The Minister himself has been a colleague of mine on that Board for some time.  He resigned to take the position he now holds.  I would think the Minister, in justice to those men, would say that they have been most useful in performing the duties required in the Council chamber and outside it.  He might ask me: &ldquo;Why cannot those men go forward and get elected as you are yourself?&rdquo; I am a businessman too, and a substantial ratepayer.  He might say: &ldquo;Why do they not go forward and get elected by the plain people as you do yourself?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Good has said, it is almost impossible to get busy businessmen to go forward for the Corporation.  We find the greatest difficulty in getting busy men who are running huge businesses to spare time to come in and look after the interests of the city. Therefore, it should be made easy for those men to get representation on the Council.  The Minister might say: &ldquo;Why cannot they go forward and get elected as you do yourself?&rdquo; I certainly should not like to be the person to propose to a busy businessman to get up on a public platform in Dublin and appeal for votes to elect him to the Corporation, to give his valuable time to looking after the interests of the ratepayers.  He would be met with a shout of &ldquo;Capitalist,&rdquo; and other insulting epithets.  I do not blame any businessman for not coming forward and allowing himself to be the cockshot for the meanest man on the street who wants to insult him.  The introduction of that commercial register was a safeguard against things like that.  This cry of ascendancy is certainly a catch-cry for the mob.  The Government Party is very good at catch-cries.  When it is not ascendancy it is freemasonry, and so on; unfortunately, our people sometimes believe them, with the result that they are where they are today, with their catch-cries and false representations.  I am definitely <Col N="1066" /> opposed to the introduction of this Bill, and I say it would be a sad day for the Dublin Corporation when it has not a businessman elected on its Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made it very difficult for Deputies to discuss the proposal on its merits. Deputy Good has attempted to do so in a reasonable kind of way, and I would ask the Minister in replying to try and deal with the merits of the proposal and the Bill he is proposing to repeal.  It is true, as Deputy Good said, that at the time the measure was originally introduced the estimate of the valuation of the then City of Dublin was about £1,200,000, and that the estimate made of the valuation of the premises that were uncovered by direct voting power until the commercial franchise was set up was approximately £600,000.  Now the valuation of the city has been increased, by the extension of the city, to about £1,900,000.  I think it would be desirable if we could have an estimate from the Minister as to what exactly is the valuation on which the commercial register in the new city is based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commercial register originally prepared was a register in respect of, I think, about 2,400 premises.  The total local government vote, I think, at the present moment is about 140,000.  If the position is that it can be verified that the commercial register in the City of Dublin at the present moment is over £600,000, we then have the position that one-third of the rates in the city will come from people who will have no direct representation in the administration of the city if the commercial register is wiped out.  I should like the Minister to defend the position he proposes to create by which taxation will be raised to the extent of perhaps one-third of the total taxation of the city from members for whom there is no representation in the Council.  The second merit in the proposal was, as Deputies said, that it did enable persons engaged in business in the city, as distinct entirely from administrative bodies, in which public business plays a very important part in maintaining the lives of the people, and particularly <Col N="1067" /> the lives of the people whom the public administration of the city is intended, to some extent, to look after, to take part in that business; and the integration by direct representation of the commercial community of the city on the City Council, with work every day carried on by the people of the city, and every day administered in the city, is a most important matter.</P>
    <P>The commercial register did find an arrangement by which persons representing the commercial life of the city, who would not have to run the gamut of ordinary public election except in so far as they were elections amongst their own fraternities, could be elected to the City Council&mdash; men who would bring their business experience and their wide range of understanding to bear upon the affairs of the city.  Such people are used to handling very large numbers of employed people in their business.</P>
    <P>One of the things that is most pressed, at the present day, upon the representatives of the City of Dublin, from the Dublin Union Committee, is the case of maintaining a large number of additional unemployed men in the city.  It is important, with that responsibility upon them, that they should have closely associated with them people without any political tinge, men ordinarily carrying on their business in the city, men giving employment who would be prejudiced in the giving of that employment if, as a result of non-representation on their part in city affairs, city affairs are either badly managed, of if sufficient attention is not paid to the fact that a considerable increase in the rates will prejudice their power of giving employment.</P>
    <P>That representation is being swept away, and, it is a strange fact, in reference to the proposal to sweep it away, that we have had no criticism good, bad or indifferent as to the work of this representation upon the City Council. Deputies have spoken of the excellence of the work of such people on the City Council.  I should like the Minister to say if in any way the work <Col N="1068" /> of the Council had ever been made difficult, or its excellence reduced in any way by the representation on the Council of the commercial community in this direct way.  The Minister has not discussed the merits either of this representation or the services that this particular representation has given to the city.  Deputy Good asked was there any other better way of giving it.  If the principle is admitted that with a big valuation, or the consideration of the big amount of taxation that is raised from those people, should bring representatives into the City Council, I do not think that a better or more simple way could be devised than the commercial register.  And that is so if only for this reason that it takes a number&mdash;an important section of persons carrying on their life in the city&mdash;a definite group in themselves, completely detached from anything like politics and entirely representing the commercial community and enables them in that way to express their views.  The Minister has not examined the merits of any of these things.  His proposal is, in fact, a kind of political sandbagging of administrative capacity and administrative capacity linked up with commercial experience of the objects from which these representatives are drawn.  The Minister's aim is entirely, and I think he would admit it frankly, political in its objective.</P>
    <P>I would not mind the Minister starting out to get wild animals if the Minister were a wild animal tamer, but I think he is setting out to create a force that he will not be able to direct.  He introduces here the cry of class; he stigmatises the proposals embodied in the commercial register as class proposals.  I want to stigmatise the Minister's proposal as a class measure and intended to start all sorts of class feeling.  He is throwing to a certain section of the electorate a bit of imaginary meat. He is throwing them the commercial representatives on the Corporation, the representatives of the commercial community in Dublin, men who are there simply because they have money in their pockets.  The electorate are going to be fed upon that particular <Col N="1069" /> type, and are not going to have anything that will enable them to work out their own political salvation, or to attend to their own administrative interests in a way that will give the community the best results of satisfactory administration with whatever resources they have.</P>
    <P>The commercial register was not based upon wealthy representation. Many of the people on it, as Deputy Belton said, carried on business in the city and helped to give employment and helped to take people off the hands of the Dublin Board of Public Assistance, but were not necessarily wealthy in terms of the valuation of their premises, in which they gave employment.  The representation given in this franchise is representation based upon the value of the fabric these people are maintaining, and the maintenance of which is giving ordinary employment in the city and maintaining the real life of the city. I say the citizen who thinks he is hammering down class barriers, and taking something from the hands of the wealthy and distributing it amongst the poor, when the Minister destroys that particular type of representation, is simply being fooled as to what he may expect in the future. Representatives of this particular kind are closely integrated to our commercial life, and the general carrying on of business in the city would be a greater guarantee for employment than the wiping out of this register, or the taking off the register of every single one of those people or of every single person who had a bigger income than £25 a year.  The Minister is thinking and working upon entirely wrong lines in moving for the removal of this representation from the government of the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot make head or tail of the speeches made in opposition to this measure.  But for the fact that I did not want to have it stated that there was not a single Fianna Fáil representative, in addition to the Minister, to stand up for the Corporation of Dublin, I should not now intervene. What is the nature of the opposition to the Bill?  Deputies <Col N="1070" /> should know that the Corporation system of election is the same as that for the Dáil&mdash;proportional representation. Are we not told that that ensures, with mathematical accuracy, that minorities will be represented? Why, then, this business register, unless something else is to be secured? Cleverly enough, the Cumann na nGaedheal crowd, prior to the last municipal election, selected a number of men as their representatives and dubbed them &ldquo;business candidates.&rdquo; They turned out to be wolves in sheep's clothing.  As soon as they got entrenched in the City Hall, they became out-and-out Cumann na nGaedheal supporters.  Even the five business representatives always went with them.  On every occasion on which an attempt was made by resolution or motion to represent the popular view, the whole crowd were entirely against it.  There were about five Fianna Fáil members, four or five Labour members and a couple of Independents on the Council.  I was one of the last class.  I have since been converted. I say without the slightest hesitation that the men sent in on the business register were excellent men and splendid representatives.  I have not the smallest doubt that, under a system of proportional representation, they would be returned should they offer themselves as candidates.  But why should I&mdash;men like me have to do the same&mdash;have to go round every evening to the street corners of Dublin and render myself hoarse making speeches and trying to instruct the electorate as to the reason they should vote for me and others, while the business register candidates have to do nothing but sit in their offices and get letters sent out asking the people to vote for them.  There is talk about ratepayers and the amount of valuations. Who are the ratepayers of Dublin?  The population of Dublin is about 450,000.  The real ratepayers are the working classes and they are the people who should have ample representation on the City Council and on every other council.  Do Deputies understand that people of the working class have to pay for a tenement room &mdash;very often a basement room&mdash;from <Col N="1071" /> 10/- to 14/- a week?  The landlords of these premises state that the reason they have to charge these rents is that the rates in Dublin are so high.  In whose interest should there be strong representation on the Council except in the interest of the people who have indirectly to pay these rates and who have to pay these heavy rents?</P>

      <P>I know houses where there is a flat rate of 10/- a room charged.  Statements were made here some time ago about the awful crime of personation which Fianna Fáil are supposed to have indulged in.  Why not give these five business representatives a chance of having personation too?  They will get elected hands down, if we are to believe all the statements made here regarding the way Fianna Fáil members were elected.  At any rate, personation would be no harm.  It is a good turn.  If a man is dead and you knew the opinions he held while alive, what harm would it be to vote for him?  If a poor man is sick in hospital and not able to get out, surely it is a good turn to see that his vote is registered.  If he has gone away and his neighbours know his opinions, I do not see any harm in personation. I think I encouraged a lot of that class of thing in my day.  At one time, I saw <Col N="1072" /> that the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland voted right&mdash;the first time in his life that he voted right.  He did not get up early enough and he waited for his breakfast before he came to the polling station.  When he went into the booth, he found that he had been voted for.  He was very indignant but he should have got up early and not minded his breakfast.  He should have done his duty to his country first.</P>

      <P>I should like to explain to representatives of other constituencies that the powers of the Corporation are extremely restricted.  Three-fourths of the original powers we possessed are now in the hands of an official known as the City Manager.  That he is a very excellent official I admit, and that he does his duty remarkably well I also admit.  He has developed the habit of bringing in members of the Council as a consultative body.  He might not have done that if he did not like.  He might not have consulted any of us, according to the letter of the law, but he does that on most matters arising in connection with the government of the city.  The system is undemocratic at its best, and we have it at its best here.  It is not right.  The control of the staff is in his hands.  All contracts are sanctioned by him.  We know nothing about contracts until he reports that he has accepted the tender of this or that firm.</P>

      <P>That is your opinion, but it is not mine.  I am prepared to do my level best to alter the situation as quickly as possible.  I ask Deputies not to accept the position suggested by those who have opposed the Bill. This Bill is a step towards the democratic government of the city and I do not think that Deputies should oppose that in principle.  If they do, I fail to understand them; but, of course, there are many things happening here that I do not understand, and I dare say during the next five years there will be many things that I will not understand, if I remain here &mdash;I hope I will not.  I am making my protest now against the spirit of the speeches that were made by opponents of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill should be accepted on its merits, but apparently that is not to be.  Political prejudice is sticking out a mile, and that has been the case since the first speaker stood up.  He talked about the number of representatives, and said that Fianna Fáil, out of 19 candidates, got only six in.  He ought to be perfectly satisfied and he ought to let it go at that.  This Bill is, in my opinion, a further advance towards the control by the people of the municipality of Dublin.  We expect a much bigger advance, and we will get it very soon.  This is our first advance towards the democratic control of the city, control by those who have to pay the rates.  I hope the Bill will pass with a very big majority.</P>

In the first place, I am glad to see that he had the courage, as he said, to be one other person than the Minister who was prepared to stand up to defend the Bill.  I am glad for the further reason that he has explained some of the tactics by which elections have been and can be won, not that we intend to adopt them.  Anyhow, his remarks throw a somewhat lurid light on the way in which elections have been won. Those of us who stood as candidates in the City of Dublin during the last election had some experience in that respect.  We saw motor cars touring through the north and south constituencies in the city and also through the county with active young supporters of Fianna Fáil, usually two young men and two girls.  They drove from polling station to polling station and, in the words of Deputy Kelly, they voted early and they voted often.  It was refreshing and pleasing to hear Deputy Kelly saying, in reply to Deputy Mulcahy, that these were the tactics and the instructions for the winning of elections, and presumably they also will be during the next election that will be held in the city.</P>

      <P>We have the admission now from their own benches.  I can only regard this Bill as a political manæuvre.  Deputy Mulcahy gave the figures as to the representation of the business community in Dublin.  One third of the total rates of the new city area, £600,000, is paid by the people represented by the members on the commercial register.  They have one-sixth or one-seventh of the representation of the city, but they pay one-third of the rates.  We are told it is an advance towards democratic Government when the proposal is that they are to have no representation at all. They will, in fact, have no representation if this Bill is passed.  Governments before have got into trouble over standing for the principle of taxation without representation.  You have taxation, although you may call it rating, without representation here.  It is proposed to abolish representation as regards the people who pay one-third of the rates of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand what is the object underlying the Bill, except that it is a political manæuvre.  It is a gesture to the people outside who hold that people who have any property or who pay heavy rates should have no representation.  What influence can five members have on a council of this size?  If they are put in there to represent the business people, what influence can they have on the determinations of that body?  Deputy Kelly talks about giving representation to the working people.  Deputies on this side of the House stand as much for the workingman getting representation as do Fianna Fáil Deputies, just as much.  The working people of Dublin, if they wish, can return every member of the Corporation other than the business members.  What representation is there to be for the people who pay this heavy taxation if they are not allowed to retain the five members they have?  Under this Bill you <Col N="1076" /> will have a Corporation elected on a popular franchise and there will be no representation of business interests at all.  Members popularly elected will have no advice from people with business experience as to how they are to carry on the business of the Corporation. Is that a desirable state of affairs in a city like Dublin?</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly referred to the way the Corporation has been managed within recent years.  I think it has been very well managed and the business has been well carried out.  No finger can be pointed at the way in which the work has been conducted by the five business representatives.  Deputy Kelly is sore because Fianna Fáil got such a small representation in the present Corporation.  I think the small representation was due to the fact that a healthy public opinion had been created by Cumann na nGaedheal. They advocated the principle that the representatives on local bodies should not be chosen on political grounds. Fianna Fáil decided to send forward nearly 20 candidates.  They labelled them Fianna Fáil and they stood as politicians and they got only six returned.  It was a good thing, in my opinion, on the part of this Party, to encourage the feeling in the country that politics should only be for the Dáil and that as regards local bodies politics should be left out.  We advocated the idea that people with Fianna Fáil or Cumann na nGaedheal leanings, if elected on local bodies, should administer the local work and carry on business in the very best way they could, forgetting their politics while they were there.</P>
    <P>Let them be members of the Dáil and put forward their political views here but when on a local body let them deal only with the question of local administration and give of their best in that, regardless of what their political feelings may be.  This is a reversal to a bad system of having on local boards people labelled as belonging to one political party.  The best interests of the people of this country will not be served as long as that system is carried on and as it is proposed to carry it out in relation to the wider needs of this country in general.  It is a bad step <Col N="1077" /> for every section of the people and bad especially for the poorer sections of the people of this country.  For that reason I say this Bill should be opposed by every one who wishes for the prosperity of the country.</P>

      <P>As one who strongly in the first instance opposed this type of Bill when introduced here I have very great pleasure in voting for the abolition of this special type of representation for election of representatives of the people of Dublin Corporation. Deputy Rice has repeatedly stated that this Bill is a political manoeuvre on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I could equally say that the introduction of this principle of a commercial register was a political manæuvre on the part of the people who introduced it in the House.  If the same principle and the same type of voter had been set up in order to elect local representatives in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and other places throughout the Free State one would have to say that the people who introduced the principle were at least consistent even though they were wrong.  I do not see how any particular body of people no matter how or where or when they were born should have any privileged position in selecting the representatives of the people in the Corporation.</P>

Unless the Minister explains it one finds it difficult to understand why the election is to be held in other parts later on, and different treatment meted out in the case of the Dublin Corporation.  I do not know if there is any reason for this differentiation or special treatment for the City of Dublin while leaving Cork, Limerick and Waterford to come on in November next.</P>

      <P>That question seems a very negative way of supporting his case against the Bill.  It seems to me it is up to Deputies Mulcahy and Belton to say that the men elected under this register are men very superior in intelligence and knowledge to the men elected in the ordinary way. As Deputy Kelly asked, is it not an extraordinary thing that men who have much more leisure than the average man, men who should, because of their superior position, be much more capable in putting their case before the public, should be saved all that trouble that other people are put to?  Is it not the case that the whole system of democratic government is founded on the theory that reason will ultimately prevail if people are given responsibility? Yet in face of that we have been telling those on the commercial register: &ldquo;We do not expect you to go and suffer the agony of an election; we do not expect you to go out and argue with the working people; we do not expect you to try to convince them that if you are elected, rates will not be so much of a burden, or that there will be more money for the improvement of their city.&rdquo;  I suggest also it is a curious thing that the Opposition generally are prepared to sacrifice that education of the populace that ought to be implied in any election so important as the election of a new government for the city.</P>

      <P>That is a very cheap remark indeed.  Does the Deputy not admit that there is a big educational advantage in an election where in people are asked to consider different policies, when they are asked to consider particular problems, and for two, three, four or five weeks these problems are put before them by the best minds that are available?  But Deputy Mulcahy and his friends say not at all, it is useless; the best way to elect representatives is to judge them by their property.</P>

      <P>Even the argument that the people affected by this Bill are the biggest ratepayers in the city was controverted in the discussions that took place here upon the extension of the Poor Relief (Dublin) Bill.  On that occasion Deputy Good said that as far as the ordinary business people are concerned increases in rates are invariably transferred or passed on by the business people to those with whom they do business.</P>
      <P>In face of the poor case that has been made for the retention of this principle I can see no reason why this Bill should not go through.  People of every class should be encouraged to face the responsibility of government. I should like to make this further point that if the general population have not developed the responsibility that the Deputies opposite feel they should have with regard to the government of their city&mdash;if the masses have not developed that responsibility during the period when they had not a majority of representatives&mdash;then I think that is an argument for extending the responsibility so that it may be seen whether, when they have complete responsibility, they will be more capable and more efficient in regard to the government of their city than they have been under the tutelage of those who are supposed to have superior gifts and superior minds for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the case that has been made for the retention of this type of what I still maintain is class legislation on our Statute Book here is a very poor one.  The commercial register was introduced for the first time in connection with the Local Government (Dublin) Bill, 1930.  If ever there was class or political legislation it was exemplified in that measure.  The Minister and his colleagues and those who voted for it I believe voted for that measure and for the inclusion of that provision in the Local Government (Dublin) Bill for purely political purposes and no other.  That is my honest belief.  They <Col N="1081" /> saw that their power was dwindling, and dwindling, too, in the capital of the country.  They saw that some supports must be got and some efforts should be made to sustain the hold that they had for a number of years on the political life of the city and they introduced special legislation, class legislation, political legislation of this kind into a local government measure of that type.  It is to get back to what I regard as the fair system, the democratic system, of leaving to every citizen, including the special class Deputy Good has in mind, the right to stand for election and be elected&mdash;every taxpayer and every citizen and, to my mind, every citizen is a taxpayer who lives in the city and pays rent in the city.</P>

There is a lack of civic spirit not alone in the business community, but in too many other communities in Dublin.  There is not the same interest in the city and in the wants and needs of the city exhibited in Dublin as in cities in many other places.  I wish we could develop and encourage the growth of citizenship amongst our people, particularly amongst the better off classes.  I do not think it would be a help to spoon-feed them and <Col N="1083" /> encourage them by legislation such as was included in this Local Government Act.  Deputy Cosgrave, who spoke first against this Bill, referred to the commercial party, the party that Cumann na nGaedheal formed specially to run not as a Cumann na nGaedheal Party, but as a commercial party.  They held meetings in certain clubs in the city, of which we got full accounts later, to encourage people to set up a commercial party for Cumann na nGaedheal to run as commercial men.  They got their party together and ran them as commercial men and got a considerable amount of success. Having got that success, where is the necessity for running a second party as business men with a specially privileged franchise?  The Cumann na nGaedheal Party got their men in under the name of a commercial party. Deputy Cosgrave spoke of the success of the commercial party.  As they were so successful and, as he said, they got so many eminent commercial men elected, where is the necessity for a special privilege to get these special commercial men elected?</P>

There is no reason in the world, as Deputy Moore suggested, why these people should not be elected in the future as they have been in the past. There were men put in on this commercial register, I think, who were formerly in the habit of standing for election in Dublin.  They got elected. Why should they not stand again irrespective of the commercial register, and why should they not be elected if the people are satisfied with the ideas they propound on the public platforms?</P>
      <P>As to the question of politics in these elections, I think it is more honest to declare what your politics are.  That is the view I took three years ago when an election was held for the Dublin Corporation.  I took the view that it was honest to stand up and say you belonged to such a party; that you had such politics; that you were not unnecessarily going to bring politics into discussions on local affairs, but that at any rate your politics were such; you did not deny them, and you went forward associated with those politics, and asked for their votes.  If they did not want you, well and good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>While speaking on this Bill on 5th May I was explaining the claims which were ruled out, and detailing the reasons why it was not deemed possible to include them in the Bill.  I had intended to show how the claims which would properly be made under the Bill would be disposed of.  It will be appreciated that the difficulties that existed under previous legislation, dealing with such claims as were made then, have been greatly accentuated by the passage of years.  Whereas formerly it might have been easy to secure reliable evidence which would enable claims to be sifted and investigated, now, ten, and in some cases, 14 years later, it would be very difficult to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of claims, under previous Acts, were dealt with departmentally, and, notably, those in regard to <Col N="1089" /> damage done by the National Army, and also claims which were made under the Indemnity Act.  We have come to the conclusion, however, with the possibility now of having exaggerated and bogus claims made that really, from the point of view of the State and, also, as I shall explain later, from the point of view of the applicant, the only satisfactory method of having these claims examined is to have them investigated and proved in open court.  Accordingly, in this Bill, it is provided that the application shall be heard by the Circuit Court.  This court hearing will inevitably and in general take place in the area where loss in respect of the claims made was sustained.  That will have, from the point of view of the State, this advantage: that being made in open court the Press will be present and the evidence will be taken only upon oath which will tend to eliminate fraudulent claims and to reduce exaggerated ones.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, from the point of view of the applicant, a legal hearing will have this advantage that such I.R.A. officers, as may be available, can come to court to support just claims and, we hope, to refute unjust ones.  The cost of the proceedings, both to the State and to the applicants will, we believe, also by this means, be reduced to a minimum.  We have very carefully considered the matter and we cannot see any alternative to this proposal.  If a commission were set up to deal specifically with the claims that arise under this Bill, there would be considerable delay in dealing with them.  The commission would have to go from county to county and from place to place if it were to meet the convenience of the applicants. That would involve the State in undue expense and it would not relieve the applicants of expense to any greater extent than will the machinery proposed in the Bill.  The mere fact that one commission would have to investigate all the claims would mean that some applicants in favoured districts would get a great priority over applicants in more remote districts.  Before the whole procedure would be wound up and all the claims made under the Act disposed of, a very considerable <Col N="1090" /> period would have elapsed.  On the other hand, if we avail of the Circuit Courts, we can have what will be the equivalent of a number of commissions sitting simultaneously.  In every court district, applications will be examined at the same time and claims will be heard and disposed of.  Under that procedure, one great advantage to the State and to the applicant will be that a great deal of very valuable time&mdash; valuable to the State and to the applicant&mdash;will be saved.  Perhaps that time is more valuable to the applicant than to the State, because the applicants complain that justice has so long been deferred.</P>
    <P>As to the manner of payment, it is proposed that decrees up to £300 and awards in consequence of reports of less than £50 shall be paid in cash. Decrees exceeding £300 and awards on reports of £50 and over will be paid in 3½ per cent. stock, save for odd balances of less than £50.  As under the preceding Acts recovery may be effected from decrees or awards on reports of debts due to State Departments and local authorities in respect of income-tax and rates.  This was the procedure followed under the 1923 Act and, in justice to the State and to the local authorities, we could not depart from it now.</P>
    <P>A minor matter dealt with in the Bill, which does not properly arise out of the disqualifications imposed upon certain applicants under preceding legislation, is that advantage will be taken of this measure to terminate on 30th September, 1934, the liabilities of the Exchequer in respect of outstanding awards made under previous legislation.  The main object of this provision is to dispose of a number of awards made subject to a reinstatement condition.  The most recent of these awards was made over six years ago and the beneficiaries have had time in the interval to make up their minds as to rebuilding.  We cannot allow the present position to continue indefinitely and, accordingly, we are now going to compel the beneficiaries definitely to make up their minds as to whether they will reinstate or not.  If they are not going to reinstate, then we hold that they should forfeit their awards.  The last provision <Col N="1091" /> in the Bill is one whereby if a person has received compensation in respect of property lost and such property is subsequently recovered, it shall, on recovery, become the property of the Minister for Finance and shall be used for the benefit of the Exchequer unless the original owner desires to buy it back.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sections of the Bill, Section 1 is the definition section. Section 2 defines the classes of cases that come within the Bill.  As I have already indicated, these are claims for injury to property where no claim was made to the Compensation (Ireland) Commission in pre-Truce cases or to the court in post-Truce cases or, if made to the court, were dismissed on political grounds.  Claims may also be made under this section for goods taken by Volunteers or Republican forces where no claim was made to the Indemnity Act Committee or to the court or, if made to the latter, was dismissed on political grounds.  Section 3 indicates the procedure to be followed by applicants in lodging claims, and limits the time for lodgment to three months after the passing of the Act.  Section 4 applies the provisions of the 1923 Act, modified or amended where necessary, including the deletion of the penal provisions of Sections 9 and 15 or that Act.  It also provides for the hearing of claims by the Circuit Court, and in cases of injury to buildings it provides that compensation shall be assessed on the market value and not on the full restoration basis of the building. Section 5 specifies the items in respect of which compensation will not be granted.  As I have already pointed out, the principal of these is consequential loss.  No claims will be entertained for consequential loss, for billeting or for cash taken or expended.  Section 6 empowers the Minister for Finance to pay compensation on foot of reports made under the 1923 Act, which were refused by the former Minister on political grounds. Section 7 prescribes the method of payment and re-enacts the provisions of the Act of 1923 enabling recovery to be made from a decree or report for any <Col N="1092" /> debt due to a Government department or local authority in respect of arrears of rates or taxes.  Section 8 provides that the 10 per cent. addition which, under the amending Act of 1926, was made to awards under the 1923 Act shall not apply to awards made under this Bill.  Section 9 embodies the provision I have already referred to&mdash; that after 30th September, 1934, no payment shall be made out of public funds on foot of any awards made under existing legislation in respect of property losses during the pre-Truce or post-Truce period.  Section 10 provides that chattels in respect of which compensation has been paid from public funds shall become the property of the Minister for Finance and, where recovered, that the Minister may sell them or otherwise dispose of them for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to estimate at this stage, with any great degree of accuracy, what the total cost of this Bill will be to the Exchequer.  Claims received between the 1st March, 1932, and 28th February, 1933, number 1,280 and amount to £118,000.  In addition, there are report cases under the Act of 1923 aggregating £52,000, payment of which has been withheld.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt many new claims will be made as a result of this measure.  I am certain that not all of them will be valid and that not all of them will be sustained.  I should say that the total cost of this measure, when it becomes law, will probably be in the neighbourhood of £350,000.  It is a very large sum.  I do not wish to disguise that fact, or withhold it from the House; but it is a sum which, I think, in justice must be paid.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the necessity for introducing this Bill arose entirely out of the discriminatory provision included in the original Act.  It is only just that there should be no discrimination between one section of the community and another in regard to matters of this kind.  I think it would have been a graceful act if our predecessors, when they had the power and when they felt themselves secure in office, had done what <Col N="1093" /> we are doing now.  They could not see their way to do it.  I hope the fact that they could not see their way to make that gesture at that time will not impel them now to oppose what is merely an act of justice long deferred.</P>
    <P>I am sure all of us want, as soon as we can, to heal wounds that were left by the civil war.  None of us wants the bitterness which that civil war engendered to remain.  One of the things that would keep the old wounds rankling and festering would be an indication on the part of those who took part in that war an either side not to give justice and compensation where justice and compensation have been long withheld.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was speaking on the introduction of this measure on the 5th May he said that the 1923 Act contained &ldquo;penal provisions&rdquo; (column 717, Parliamentary Debates, 5th May) that were &ldquo;a manifest injustice&rdquo; (column 716) &ldquo;on good citizens merely because of their political opinions&rdquo; (column 715).  In Section 9 the Act describes the type of persons who were, according to the Minister, prejudiced.  They were persons who connived at or assisted in or actively facilitated the committal of the injury.  That meant that persons could not apply for compensation in respect of property which had been destroyed if they connived at or assisted in or actively facilitated the committal of the injury.  The Minister proposes, under the present Bill, to make this class eligible for compensation.  The second class of persons prejudiced under the 1923 Act were persons who were associated with or combined or were in league with the person or persons by whom the injury was committed for the committal of the injury or for the committal of similar injuries to property. The Minister's Bill provides that that particular class shall now be eligible to receive compensation for the damage said to have been committed in respect of their property.  The third class prejudiced, as the Minister would complain, under the 1923 Act, was any person who was a member or a helper of or an active sympathiser with any organisation engaged in armed opposition <Col N="1094" /> to the Provisional Government of Ireland or the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  The Minister's Bill proposes to make persons of that class eligible to receive compensation for injuries to their property during the time when they were active against the Provisional Government or the Government of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>When we were dealing with the Army Pensions Bill I put an historical background, by way of documents, to the relationship between this House and the people in respect of whom Army pensions were being provided.  The same background refers in the same way to the proposals in the Minister's measure for giving compensation in respect of property to persons who either carried out that destruction themselves or were responsible indirectly for that destruction. The Minister told us the other day that £52,000 is already claimed by persons of that class on reported cases. In reply to a question by Deputy McGilligan, the Minister told us the other day that the amount of money he was proposing to take this year from civil servants by way of cuts was £57,000.  The civil servants are to be cut this year to the extent of £57,000 to give compensation to the extent of £52,000 to the class of person I have mentioned.  The remainder of the £350,000 will be got in some other way&mdash;from the Guards, national school teachers and other people like that.</P>
      <P>When winding up my statement on the Army Pensions Bill I drew attention to certain important facts. Incidentally, it is worth recalling, particularly when we consider that civil servants are to contribute £57,000 in order to provide £52,000 in respect of the reported cases, some remarks I made on the 20th October, 1932.  I drew attention there to the people who were to be shot at sight, and these included officials employed at the headquarters of Ministries. They were to be shot at sight by the persons for whom they are now providing £52,000.  Their residences were to be destroyed too, but I am sure that was a minor matter.  Winding up my remarks on the Army Pensions Bill in October, 1932, I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> Now we are asked in days when the tail of that military organisation, when the present President and the present Minister for Defence and the present Minister for Lands and Fisheries and the present Minister for Education, threw a cloak of authority around the attack, in days when the tail of that military organisation still exists in the country, still holds arms, still organises, still trains, still declares that this institution has to be wiped out, this House is asked to provide pensions for the persons who have made that attack on this as a State institution and who are continuing that attack.</P>
    <P>I say again that this House is being asked to provide from moneys collected from civil servants, national school teachers, members of the Guards and the Army £280,000, and someone else is going to be asked to provide £70,000 for persons, some of whom are still active in the very way I say.</P>
    <P>Advertisements are in the Press to-day recruiting for the I.R.A.  They are going to go into camp for the summer, apparently.  Turning to the economic side, some of them with their rifles to-day had a cattle drive in Tipperary, some of them surrounded and knocked men on the heads in Tipperary.  The Ministry is asking this House to vote these moneys.  It is asking this House for authority to collect these moneys off the servants of the State, and it has not yet made up its mind whether it is going to let the tail continue that work or not.  I asked on the Pensions Bill whether the people who are still carrying on in that particular way are to receive pensions.  I ask the Minister whether the Bill is intended to provide moneys for persons who are still carrying on that class of organisation and that class of training.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin asked to-day in connection with local government elections in rural areas whether they were being postponed until November, and said that in the City of Dublin they were being held in June.  The period between June and November does not make so much difference. <Col N="1096" /> But in the City of Dublin we have the Shannon scheme fairly well organised.  It does make a difference in the country, and I would like to ask the Minister whether he can assure us that none of this money which is being here provided as compensation is going to be used for keeping these camps running with a view to assisting in the local government elections in the dark nights?</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy has alluded to people concerned in this Bill and what their actions were.  He has read out to us penal clauses of an Act of which he took advantage to prevent his political opponents from getting what the judges' decrees gave them. He has read out these clauses.  I would ask the Deputy to say what was the exact amount paid in pensions to those highly placed officers in the National Army who were tried by court-martial and found guilty of pulling two young girls out of their beds and beating them with Sam Browne belts, which they were wearing in the guise of officers and gentlemen.  I would like to know exactly the amounts paid to those officers for the last ten years out of public funds.</P>

      <P>This Bill wipes out a very grave injustice.  I know people down in my constituency and I am sure every Deputy here knows people to whom these moneys are due and who had no connection with the Army.  I know that Deputies here will admit this much that it will be very hard to decide where the responsibility on the part of <Col N="1098" /> the Provisional Government ceased and where the responsibility on our side commenced.  I have personal reasons for knowing it.  The Provisional Government paid me for milk supplied to the army in occupation in Cobh.  I have very good reason to know when they stopped and when the payment ceased.  These are matters which the ordinary shopkeeper of a country town could not know.  He could not know the particular period at which Deputy Mulcahy and those associated with him changed over from the I.R.A. to be soldiers of the Provisional Government.  Ordinary shopkeepers did not know that.  These people went before the courts and they got these decrees from the courts but they were never paid since because the Secret Service paid by Deputy Mulcahy's Government pointed out that those people were supporters of the I.R.A.  But they had given their goods in all good faith.  They were never paid and they suffered for the last ten years.  I know men who got these reports from the judges.  One of them is at present in receipt of home assistance.  He has a wife and five children to support.  That man has a decree for £115 due to him for the last ten years and he has never been able to get it.  That was just because Deputy Mulcahy's Executive decided at that time that that man happened to be a supporter not of the Free State Army but of the Republican Army. Just because he happened to be a supporter of the wrong army in Deputy Mulcahy's view, he should not be paid for goods he delivered in good faith. We have several cases of that description all over the country of shopkeepers who supplied goods and, although they got their decrees, of payment being refused.  The same thing occurred even in Shaw Commission cases.  I have carefully preserved a letter received from the Deputy's Department when he was Minister by a solicitor in Cork in one case asking the solicitor was he aware that the individual concerned was a notorious Irregular.  Although the &ldquo;Black and Tans&rdquo; destroyed his property, yet because he was a notorious Irregular the State could keep the money they <Col N="1099" /> received from the British Government for his compensation and he should not get it.  These letters are still in existence and will probably be produced in evidence as proof of the shameful and spiteful attitude adopted by the late Executive Council towards those who were previously their comrades in arms.</P>
      <P>I should like to see this Bill amended so as to give compensation to those whose property was destroyed in 1916. There are not very many cases of that kind.  There is one outstanding case in Cork County which the Bill should be amended to deal with.  Members of that family suffered and died for Ireland when very few were prepared to do it and the fact that they got no compensation for their property which was destroyed at that time is a lasting blot on any national government.  In my opinion, the Bill should be amended in order to cover the cases of those whose property was destroyed in 1916. Deputy Mulcahy dealt with the cuts in civil servants' salaries.  I do not want to go into that matter at present as we shall have an opportunity of debating it fully later on.  But the fact that certain individuals, on account of their political opinions, had positions made for them and that the question was not what a particular man's services were worth in a job but what salary would be adequate compensation for him for turning his coat, places a very heavy burden on this State, a burden that is too heavy for the people to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that this Bill is long overdue, as it remedies a crying injustice. I personally regret, for the sake of good feeling amongst all classes of the community, that such a Bill was not introduced in 1927 or 1928.  It would have been a gracious act on the part of those who then formed the Government, and an act which would have healed sores that were too long running.  I regret the attitude that Deputy Mulcahy has taken up to-day. It is an attitude that is unworthy of any man who at any period soldiered with those whom he has victimised for the past ten years, and whom he is still apparently anxious to victimise.  There are unfortunate people who found themselves more or less obliged when <Col N="1100" /> we were in occupation of different towns, to give food, clothing or anything else that was requisitioned. There was practically no way out for them.  It is about time that they should be paid.  I do not want to go into the question of who was right or who was wrong at that period.  We think we were right, and I suppose those on the opposite benches think they were right.  I say this much, however, that the action of the late Executive Council in refusing to pay those cases in which reports were given was unworthy of any national government. There are not so many of them.  I know several shopkeepers in different towns, and the fact that they were not paid for goods which they had delivered in good faith, and that the payment of decrees was refused by the Minister for Finance at the time, actually brought about their bankruptcy.  No payment would compensate these people now for what they lost at that period.  I think the statement made by Deputy Mulcahy to-day was one which we might very well have been spared.  I do not want to go into the other moneys that were paid during the last ten years for which there was no justification such as there is in these cases. There were, for instance, the particular cases I alluded to to-day of officers being paid pensions for the last nine or ten years, because they&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I consider with the Minister for Finance that these open sores tend to keep the bitterness of the Civil War too long alive amongst us.  In conclusion, I hope that the Minister will amend the Bill so as to include those whose <Col N="1101" /> property was destroyed in 1916 or immediately afterwards.</P>

      <P>There is a very large section of citizens who, as Deputy Corry said in his closing remarks, are anxious that the leaders of the two principal Parties in the House should forget the history surrounding the Civil War period, and I should like to suggest that it would be a good thing for the leaders, who sometimes are calling for national unity or the closing of the ranks of our nationalist population, to give a good example in that direction.  Many people in the country would regard it as a generous gesture from Deputy Mulcahy if he would endeavour to blot out of his memory the history of that unfortunate period. One of the ways in which that can be done is to accept the contents of a measure such as this, and by doing so make provision for the payment of compensation to people who, to my own knowledge in some cases, submitted their claims and whose claims were, in my opinion, turned down owing to political prejudice.  It may be possible that, as a result of the passage of a measure of this kind, some few individuals who did things with which I disagreed very much at a particular period may get compensation.  It would pay the State as a whole to close the history of that period by making proper provision for the innocent sufferers in that period at any rate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to bring to the notice of the Minister one or two cases&mdash;I am not going to go into the cases&mdash;which cannot, I think, be dealt with under the Bill as now drafted, but which should be carefully considered by the Minister and the necessary amendments made in Committee, so as to make provision for payment of compensation to people of this kind.  There are a few&mdash;and only a few&mdash;cases of citizens of Saorstát Eireann who, as a result of action taken by the Craigavon Government, suffered serious loss during the period referred to in this Bill.  I am not suggesting that it is the responsibility of the taxpayers of this State to make provision for the payment of compensation <Col N="1103" /> to citizens of the Six Counties, but I think there is a genuine obligation upon those of us who are acquainted with certain facts to see that citizens of this State who suffered loss or injury to property as a result of their activities during a particular period are compensated, if at all possible, under the terms of this measure.  Section 2 of the Bill makes it quite clear that the loss or damage should have occurred in Saorstát Eireann.  I suggest to the Minister&mdash;and he has, I think, some details of a few cases; the cases I have in mind are very few&mdash; that it should be made possible, by alternation in the wording of Section 2, to cover cases where a few citizens of this State, as a result of what are called by the Northern Government their illegal activities, suffered loss&mdash; not to a very large amount&mdash;and that the Bill should be amended, so as to make provision for the payment of compensation in the very few cases, not exceeding six, which I have in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister, if he can see his way, to deal with the point raised by Deputy Davin.  I myself am aware of certain cases.  Of course, it might leave the door too wide open if there were an amendment introduced into the Bill.  With regard to the drafting of the Bill, I think the Minister will have to make a drastic amendment in Section 2, because it is in contradiction of Section 10.  Section 2 states that &ldquo;this Act does not apply to any injury to property or any injurious act or any loss or damage in respect of which any payment of compensation has been made by any Department of State or the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland.&rdquo; Section 10 says just the opposite.  It is only a question of drafting, but I know it is a matter which lawyers would be very anxious to make play with, and it could be held that Section 2 overrides Section 10 in the matters to which the Act applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 10 I do not know if the Minister can state whether there are many cases in mind for the introduction of this section.  There is only one case to my knowledge, and it <Col N="1104" /> somewhat affects me personally.  It is a case which is still before the courts. I imagine this section is introduced in order to forestall the decision of the court in the matter.  There are certain provisions in connection with Section 10 which might be open to question. For instance, when valuables or property have been recovered from the ruin the Minister can offer them for sale at a prohibitive price and so retain them in his possession, because it says that a price will be fixed which in the opinion of the Minister is equal to the amount of compensation which was not specified in the original grant. Furthermore, it states in the fifth sub-section of Section 10 that this property may be disposed of by the Minister, by sale or otherwise, for the benefit of the Exchequer.  There is certain property which might be of historical interest and which the Minister might retain for national collections or otherwise instead of putting it up for sale. He would, I think, be prohibited from achieving this object by the terms of the Act as it stands, because he must dispose of it for the benefit of the Exchequer.  Those are a few items which, perhaps, on the Report Stage the Minister might consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were in the frame of mind in which I was when Deputy General Mulcahy was speaking I should probably be saying now many things which I think would be better left unsaid.  I am not going to traverse the ground over which Deputy Mulcahy has travelled with such futility, because I, and most people listening to him on many occasions in this House when events that had but a remote connection with the unhappy periods of 1922 and 1923 have been before us, have come to this conclusion, that the Deputy is possessed of an obsession to justify to his own conscience, and to himself, the part he has taken in the unhappy civil war.  I do not think we should pander to that obsession.  I do not think that I, or any other Minister speaking from the Government Bench, should again take the trouble even to endeavour to disabuse the country of the false impressions which Deputy Mulcahy endeavours to convey as to what happened then, and as to the <Col N="1105" /> reasons which motived the Government of which he was a member during that period.  I hope that this Bill, and possibly another measure hereafter which may have to come before the House, dealing with personal injuries, may help us to forget the past and may help to heal the wounds inflicted upon the common body of the Irish nation.  I have only to say, as I said at the outset, this is a measure of justice long deferred.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the £52,000 to which the citizens of the State were justly entitled ten years ago which was impounded by my predecessor and withheld. We propose to pay and not to cut civil servants one penny for this money, for it will be found, in the same way as it was found under the Acts for which my predecessor was responsible, by borrowing.  That will not inflict any hardship upon any officials of the State, and if we did I am sure those officials and the taxpayers would endure it in order to ensure, at least, that justice should be done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry referred to property destroyed in 1916.  I am afraid it will not be possible for us to go back over that period.  Preceding legislation did not deal with it.  The Deputy, I think, said there was only one case, but I am afraid it is only one of many, because property was destroyed elsewhere than in Cork during that period.  Many people think that they have claims arising out of destruction of their property that have gone unsatisfied.  I am afraid if we were to go back to 1916 we would have to deal with 1918 and other periods prior to 1919.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guiding principle in this Bill is that we can only accept responsibility from the day that the Dáil began to function as the <i>de jure</i> Government in this country.  It is the principle upon which this Bill is based.  We had to take some definite starting point and there is no one more suitable than that.  Apart from the consideration that arises, at any rate as to the date in respect to which compensation might be properly paid, I fear the burden that would be imposed upon the Exchequer would <Col N="1106" /> be very much greater than Deputy Corry thinks, and that the difficulty of investigating such claims would be very much greater than he visualises; and while I am prepared to listen to any representation he might make to me I am afraid there is very little prospect that I would be able to do anything.  The same, I think, applies to the cases to which Deputy Davin has referred.  So far as I have any knowledge of them, the greater part of those claims would be for consequential damage arising out of the fact that Irishmen and Irishwomen were driven out of part of Ireland, and for that reason were not able to attend to their ordinary business concerns there.  If we were to concede the right of any particular citizen to secure compensation merely because he was compelled to leave one part of Ireland and reside in another, we should have to concede the right to every such man or woman to claim for consequential damage.  Any of us familiar with the circumstances that existed from 1916 to 1925 would see that if we were to concede that we would have to consider all the circumstances that existed over that period, and the multitudinous claims that might be made in regard to consequential damages.  We would have to concede the claim of every man arrested at his work by my predecessor in office.  We should have to concede the claim of any man who, during the Black and Tan war, was on the run, not because he might be in actual danger, but because his fears were so great that he thought to preserve his person by not sleeping in his own house.</P>
    <P>The range of claims that could be made would be so great, once we conceded the principle of consequential damage, and would be so wide that I cannot concede even in the most limited way, the right of any person to make a claim of that sort.  Accordingly, although in the case of Deputy Corry I am prepared to consider any representation made to me, I should make it clear, at the outset, that if claims are for damages of a consequential kind I shall not be able to meet them, any more than my predecessors were able <Col N="1107" /> to meet them, or any Government responsible to the people would be able to meet them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The case I have in mind is one of actual damage done to property&mdash;not consequential damage&mdash;but actual damage done to property in 1916 by British Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate the difference between the class of case Deputy Corry has in mind and the class of case to which Deputy Davin referred.  As I said, I am prepared to consider it, but we have to bear in mind when considering this matter&mdash;it is an old maxim that hard cases make bad laws&mdash;the consequences that would flow from the acceptance of that principle and that the Government have responsibility to the taxpayers, not merely the present taxpayers, but in view of the fact that we are borrowing for this purpose, we have to bear the taxpayers of the future in mind as well. It was of the consequences that would flow from them that prevented us from doing everything our hearts would dictate, and I would like it to be understood that it was a harder struggle for the Government to exclude these cases than to include them in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the reference made by Deputy Esmonde to Section 10, I think the Deputy has not quite correctly apprehended the purport of the section. First of all, I think no one would controvert the justice of this, that where <Col N="1108" /> compensation has been paid for property lost, if that property is recovered subsequently it should be the property, not of the original owner, but of the Minister for Finance who compensated the original owner for the loss.  That is the basis of the section.  Arising out of that the right of the Minister for Finance to retain the property and dispose of it is qualified.  It is subject to the reservation that where the property is recovered the Minister must offer it to the original owner for purchase at the amount of the compensation the original owner received for it.  There could not be anything more just than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister so far proceeds in accordance with the principle of strict justice you must assume he will continue to tread the path of virtue, and that where an agreed amount of compensation had not been definitely allocated to each particular item of property, in determining what is the fair price the Minister will have some consideration (1) for the total amount of compensation paid, and (2) the proportion which the recovered property bears to the property originally lost.  I am perfectly certain that if Deputy Esmonde thinks over the section he will see that there is no intention on the part of the Ministry of Finance in any Government to do any injustice to private citizens in matters like this.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) lines 34-35 to delete the words &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann Unified Health Insurance Society&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;Cumann Aontuithe an Arachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment so that the Unified Health Insurance Society may be known by its Gaelic title and by none other.  I do not anticipate any opposition from the Minister.  We are all aware of the fact that he has on all possible occasions urged and encouraged the use of our language. I assume that in developing the Bill and in devoting time to the details the Minister has overlooked the possibility of adorning the society with a Gaelic title.  I do not anticipate opposition from any section of the House.  No objection has been raised to the first two words of the title being in Irish. The two words I refer to are Saorstát <Col N="1111" /> Eireann.  Consequently, I cannot presume that there will be any objection if the remaining two-thirds of the title of the society are in the native language.</P>
    <P>It is but fitting that the title of a national institution should be in our native tongue.  It may be argued that people will not be able to understand the title if it appears in Irish.  Already they have learned to read and speak fluently one-third of the words of the title, and I think we can safely rely on the intelligence of our people, and we can rest assured that they will be able to pick out the remaining portions of the title without much difficulty.  We must remember that there are numbers of people in the Gaeltacht who would be unable to read the title of the society if it were in the language of the foreigner.  As it now stands, the title appears partly in one language and partly in another. I am sure Deputies will agree that there is no reason why that should be the case.  I trust that if the Minister does not accept my amendment as it stands, he will accept the principle of it.</P>

In that case the name of this society will be recorded officially in the Irish language, and every provision of the measure when it is passed will be published both in the Irish and in the English languages.  To my mind this amendment simply proposes to insert in the Bill words that are, in fact, already there.  The Bill ought to be circulated in the Irish language.  Is it not in accordance with the Standing Orders that Bills should be circulated in both languages?</P>

If, however, the Deputy thinks that by taking that course it adds anything to the lustre of the national language, I would not object.  I would prefer that the whole Act and the title of the society should appear in Irish. As the law stands it will appear in Irish and also in English.  I should imagine that is the more dignified course.</P>

      <P>I think this amendment is a rather important amendment.  The committee is usually entitled to appoint its own chairman, but in a case such as is suggested in the section it might not be possible to secure unanimity in the choice of a chairman, seeing that the committee would be composed of only three members.  If the Minister would retain the right of the appointment of the chairman when installing the committee, I believe matters would be considerably simplified by such action. Most of the responsibility will rest upon the shoulders of the chairman, and therefore his appointment by the Minister is, to my mind, of considerable importance.  I therefore move the amendment standing in my name.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6)  The first secretary and first treasurer of the unified society shall be persons who were on the 30th day of June, 1932, holders of qualifying posts under an approved society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> I think this is a reasonable amendment. It is just and proper that these positions should be reserved for the existing officers of approved societies. There are in the various approved societies throughout the country experienced officers who know their work, and who have been engaged in the work of approved societies for many years.  It would be unfair and unjust that they should be passed over for outsiders.  In addition to that there is the other consideration that it will save compensation.  If outsiders are brought in, it will mean that some officials of an approved society must ultimately be displaced.  Consequently from both points of view&mdash;that is from the point of view of the existing staffs and from the point of view of economy &mdash;it is proper that this amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a good deal in what Deputy Costello says about taking over men who would have had probably long experience of approved societies.  While I do not think that I ought to be bound in that matter, I think that the persons to be appointed will in all probability be persons who have acted in such capacity for one or other approved society. However, I would like to feel completely free to get the best persons I can in any way.  I say that, while I do believe there is a good deal in the argument that Deputy Costello has used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Costello's amendment.  The Minister has no case against the amendment, and admitted that a good deal was to be said for it.  If there is a good deal to be said for it, there can be no objection on the part of the Minister to accepting it.  In answer to a question asked here, the Minister stated that there were 360 whole time officers in the approved societies.  Now, that being the case, the Minister has 360 whole time officers to select from in the filling of these posts.  These people have experience, and I doubt if there is any person outside the existing societies who has such experience. Unless the Minister is contemplating importing some officials to fill these <Col N="1115" /> posts there is a large number to choose from.  He has 360 full time officers.  It is because I believe it is desirable to have officers of experience and officers who have justified their previous employment by their knowledge of the Insurance Acts and the various regulations issued under them that I urge the Minister to accept this amendment, which should commend itself to him.  I hope on reconsideration he will accept it.  It does not bind him except that it makes him choose from these 360 people.  And that is a very wide choice.  The Minister is bound by this amendment to do the right thing, and he ought to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister to accept this amendment. For the reasons mentioned by Deputies Norton and Costello, I think the Minister will agree that in making appointments of this kind it would sometimes be of material advantage to him to have certain statutory limitations on his discretion.  It does give him a means of readily disposing of wholly unsuitable candidates by simply pointing to the Statute and saying: &ldquo;If I had the will I have not the power.&rdquo;  Furthermore, it would make it obligatory on him to appoint somebody whose appointment would effect a small saving in the fund that is at his disposal for compensation. As the Minister has been good enough to say at an early stage of this Bill that the limit of his generosity in compensation will be only the limit of his capacity to pay, I am anxious to see every economy of this character made obligatory in order to make the compensation more liberal for those who will be compelled to retire.  I suggest to the Minister for those two pretty cogent reasons he might consider this limitation on his discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to put one or two points, as I feel that the Minister if he is pressed a little further, in view of the fact that he recognises the equity of the case, may give way and accept this reasonable amendment which is put forward in the interest of those officials of <Col N="1116" /> approved societies who are really anxious to make the new unified society, no matter how they may dislike its formation, a success.  I suggest to the Minister that one of the facts that he should take into consideration is that if an outsider is appointed it will cause very severe heart-burnings amongst the officials who are retained and a certain amount of natural discontent.  I think the Minister might further take this matter into consideration having regard to the fact, as I am informed, that the Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance in 1925 reported that the first officials of the new unified society should be chosen from the existing officers, so that he has valid and cogent reasons for accepting it, and apparently his own inclinations lie that way.  In addition, there is very strong approval for this course in the Interim Report of the Committee in 1925.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other reason that could be advanced, but that has not been advanced so far, in favour of the amendment. When the measure was originally introduced we were not in favour of it. and we have not altogether changed our opinions yet.  We view it with some misgiving, because centralisation in one society here in Dublin would make for less sympathetic administration. The Minister knows, as some of us do, that occasionally cases come up for consideration which are borderline cases that can be decided favourably to the insured member when there is a proper appreciation of the position all round.  In order to ensure the sympathetic administration of the Act that I am sure the Minister desires, it would be desirable that an experienced official of some society should be appointed to the position. The Minister has shown that he is not unfavourably disposed to the amendment, and with the point I have in mind, as well as other reasons that have been advanced, I ask him to give it favourable consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, my own view is that the Minister ought not to be tied in the matter.  I quite agree that <Col N="1117" /> there is quite a considerable amount of force in the arguments used by Deputies recommending the acceptance of the amendment.  No doubt there is a considerable choice, but there might be a much wider choice.  I am not saying that one would get persons better fitted and more efficient and knowing more about health insurance outside people who have acted as secretary or assistant secretary or treasurer of one of those societies.  The view that has been expressed here has been already suggested to me, but my own feeling was that I ought, as Minister, to be absolutely free to get anywhere I could the very best persons for these very important posts. However, if the Deputy will withdraw the amendment and put it down on Report Stage I will agree to reconsider it.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: That Section 7 stand part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In Section 7 (2) it is provided that the treasurer of the unified society shall also be the assistant-secretary of the unified society.  It is quite possible that one officer could combine the two positions, but is there any need to enshrine this in legislation, specifying that in the unified society the assistant-secretary may be required to discharge duties which would make it impossible for him effectively to supervise the financial side of the society?  Yet, we are providing in legislation that the two offices shall be one and taking no cognisance of possible changes in the assistant-secretary's duty which may make it impossible for him effectively to supervise the financial side.  I suggest that while, in fact, this combination might be possible as a matter of ordinary efficient office routine, it is undesirable to put it into legislation, because if you do you will always have an assistant-secretary who, no matter how burdensome his duties, will be required to look after the financial side.  I think it would be well rather to leave it to the administrators of the society to combine the offices if possible, but I think it is wrong to do it in legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 2, to insert after the word &ldquo;company&rdquo; the words &ldquo;except with the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to add to the section a discretionary clause.  I might describe this as the obverse of the medal of the last amendment moved by Deputy Costello, because while it is a useful thing to restrict the Minister's discretion and his range of choice and say that he shall not go outside a certain class of highly-qualified men, it is quite another thing to say he may not enter another class of very highly-qualified men.  The general principle that the Minister has in mind here is to prevent the appointment of agents or employees of insurance companies as a member of the committee of management in the unified society and I think the principle underlying that is fairly manifest. I would suggest, however, to the Minister that circumstances might arise where it would be greatly to the advantage of the committee of management to have amongst its members some person who was connected with the insurance business in this country. The case might not arise, but, on the other hand, it might.  The Minister is quite free to refer to the principle underlying this section in the event of any pressure being brought to bear upon him to nominate any particular person to the committee of management. At the same time, if it were <Col N="1119" /> generally felt that it would be to the advantage of the parties concerned that such a person should be appointed, he would have the right to make an exception in that person's case and it would admittedly be an exception.  This is one of those cases in which, I think, the Minister ought to have discretion to make an exception if the advice of one particular person is very necessary for the proper conduct of the unified society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>My feeling is that I would rather not have the freedom in this case; that I would rather have it definitely fixed that persons interested in other forms of insurance work should not be eligible.  I know from experience since the Bill was introduced that considerable pressure from many sources would be exercised to get people appointed who may be enthusiasts in the matter, but it might be a type of enthusiasm which might be very embarrassing.  I think it would be better for the Minister not to have the discretion the Deputy wishes to give.</P>

I think it would be better for him to have this discretion, but I do not propose to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e) to submit before the appointed day for the consent of the Minister, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, a suitable superannuation <Col N="1120" /> scheme for the permanent officers and employees of the unified society.</P>
    <P>This amendment is moved for the purpose of securing the establishment of a superannuation fund for the future employees of the unified society.  So far as I am concerned, the fund suggested should be on a contributory basis, with the right, of course, of the employing side and the employees to have an equal share or voice in the management of the suggested fund. I understand that the average age of the 360 full-time employees is fairly low, and that would make it much easier for the fund to be established on a solvent basis.  Personally, I do not believe it would be right to allow any very old employee of the unified society to go into such a superannuation fund without having to pay some surcharge as from a particular date or age.  I have some knowledge of the existence of superannuation funds.  I am myself a member of a fund which is supposed to be the biggest fund in the world for clerical employees, and I know that under no circumstances would the committee of management of that fund allow any person to come in late in age on the same conditions as those who came in after passing an examination at 18 or 20 years of age for service in the company concerned. I understand that a few men who are old and who might be given the option of coming over to the unified society as employees are likely to retire at whatever compensation the Minister would deem fit to give them. I understand that four years ago the association representing employees of the existing societies submitted a scheme for the superannuation of the then servants of the societies concerned. If I am correctly informed, I understand that the claim was sympathetically looked into, but that it was deferred until such time as the societies then in existence would agree to unify on a provincial or a national basis.  However, that does not get away from the fact that any national organisation of this kind should have some kind of fund created which would enable provision to be made for <Col N="1121" /> them to retire at an age to be fixed, and to get a reasonable scale of pension. I hope it is possible, now that the unified society has been formed, that by the time the society comes into actual operation a fund such as that now contemplated in this amendment will be established with the consent and approval of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment of Deputy Davin, although I think the idea of the superannuation fund a good one, especially a contributory fund.  I think any large institution such as the one we are going to set up should have something of the kind.  If we were to set up such a fund now there would be not a small number of men of 40 or 50 years of age who might have to be provided for, and in order to provide for them a large capital sum would be necessary.  I am afraid our funds at present would not enable us to make that provision, and besides that the individuals concerned would be called upon to put up a considerable sum if there were&mdash;as I am told there are&mdash; a number who are of an age to have served in the national health insurance, and who are 40 to 50 or over 50 years of age.  If the Deputy would be satisfied I would agree with an amendment of this kind: &ldquo;To examine and report to the Minister as to the possibility of establishing a suitable superannuation scheme for the officers and employees of the unified society, having regard to the moneys available for the purpose under the financial provisions of the Act.&rdquo;  I am quite sympathetic with the idea of a superannuation fund, but our funds at present would not enable us to provide the capital sum necessary, so far as I understand at the moment, to provide for the people whose service with the approved societies would have to be taken into account.  If we were to take their service into account a large capital sum would have to be provided.  If it were merely a question of starting a superannuation fund from now on, it would be a different proposition, but a lot of those men who have already served would not come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say to the Minister that any such fund which I would have <Col N="1122" /> in mind would be based upon actuarial considerations and recommendations.  I would not admit, except that I have just casually referred to the conditions which should attach to it, that it should be on a contributory basis.  Aged entrants, if they were allowed to come into the superannuation fund formed as a result of the acceptance of an amendment of this kind, should pay as say from 20 or 28 years of age.  That surcharge, whatever it might be, may be enabled to be paid over three or four instalments.  I would not suggest the formation of any fund except one that would be suggested after actuarial investigation and recommendation, and if there were employees of the unified society who, in the opinion of the management committee, and after the consideration that should be given to a matter of this kind by the actuary, should not be allowed to come into the society for some good reason, I would not endeavour to place any obligation upon the management committee of the unified society that would force them to take over a bad business proposition.</P>
      <P>The whole idea is that the future employees of the society should have some such superannuation scheme.  If it is possible on the basis of the actuary's report to bring in those who would be taken over from the other societies, and whose average age I am informed would not exceed 35 to 40 years of age, I do not think it would be a bad proposition to bring those in on certain defined conditions so far as surcharge is concerned.  If the Minister cannot see his way to accept the amendment as now worded, and I admit it is not worded in a model manner, I should be glad if he would between now and the Report Stage give this matter further consideration.  I would reserve the right to move the amendment on the Report Stage, and then see whether or not, after having heard the Minister on the matter and after the Minister had reconsidered the whole matter from the point of view I have just put forward, I would withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Of course any superannuation scheme anywhere would have to be actuarially examined before <Col N="1123" /> being set up.  Since the amendment was put in we have not had an opportunity of having an actuarial examination. You would have to have a full investigation into the age and health of all the people concerned before any scheme could be set up.

He will have to have his list before him before he can float his scheme.  At the present time he does not know who is to be taken over into the unified society.  Let us suppose he takes over 350, and they form the nucleus of a new society.  It is upon that he will have to lay the foundation of the new compensation scheme, and it is upon that he will have <Col N="1125" /> to rest his calculations, and he cannot start his calculations until he has his roster, so I suggest to the Minister that to make a promise to set a scheme on foot in the next 12 months is not safe.</P>

      <P>The position is this.  If you make an actuarial calculation on the basis of 350 employees of the societies, you are taking into consideration the elderly men as well as the younger ones.  The tendency of the Minister will be to pick a lot of the elderly men type and compensate them.  You might get an actuarial compensation basis upon the number of 350 but that would be out of all proportion to the actual facts if the Minister sets up his society.  If the Minister waited until he gets his roster in the unified society the possibility might be better.  I would prefer that the Minister, before he proceeded actuarially to examine the scheme, would have the actual employees he is going to retain and on that basis make his calculation as to what the risk would be.</P>

Supposing the Minister started and took five of the men over 50 and five over 40 and 150 under 40.  I put both sides to the Minister.  If he submitted five over 50, five over 40 and 160 under 40 it would make a more unified calculation for him in the setting up of the superannuation scheme than if he submitted to an actuary an average of 350 from whom he is going to make his decision.</P>

      <P>(1)  It shall not be lawful for any approved society without the consent of the Minister to pay to any person, who, on the 5th day of April, 1933, was rendering service to such society in any capacity (whether as officer, member of the committee of management, employee or otherwise), remuneration in respect of any period subsequent to the passing of this Act at a rate greater than the rate of remuneration of such person on the 5th day of April, 1933.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 8 which stands in the name of Deputy Davin and myself.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>The following amendment is hereby made in the Act of 1911, that is to say:&mdash;In Section 8, sub-section (1) there shall be inserted a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;In the case of an insured person requiring dental treatment on and after the 5th day of July, 1936, payment in whole or in part of the cost of providing such treatment (including dentures) in accordance with regulations to be prescribed by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, many of the societies, especially those in a financially sound position, provide dental treatment for their members.  Indeed, dental treatment is now extensively provided by all societies, but specially generous provision is made in the case of those societies in a good financial position.  In practice, dental treatment has become one of the statutory provisions so far as insured persons are concerned.  Most of the societies provide such treatment.  Under the unifying provisions of this Bill, all the societies will be thrown into one common pool.  This amendment seeks to give the insured person a definite right to dental benefits in the same way as if they were provided in the Act of 1911.  The amendment seeks to ensure that a provision now made available to insured contributors by practically all the societies will be made available to them as a matter <Col N="1130" /> of right in this Bill in the same way as if that provision were included in the Act of 1911.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I cannot accept this amendment.  The contributions at present paid are all required to finance the present statutory benefits.  There is no money and, so far as we can anticipate, there will be no money available for this purpose. It may be that the actuarial report at the end of this quinquennial period will be better than forecasted. If so, the money will be there for such additional benefits as may be thought advisable.  At this stage, we do not see any likelihood of money being available for this admirable object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister declares this proposal to be actuarially impossible, that finishes it, but the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister might have drawn his attention to this aspect of the case&mdash;that probably one of the most prolific causes of permanent disablement in the later years is one or other form of rheumatism.  The Parliamentary Secretary will, from his expert knowledge, tell the Minister that what is popularly styled &ldquo;rheumatism&rdquo; is, very often, some form of arthritis and that that largely results from dental infection of one kind or another.  A large number of the cases which we call &ldquo;chronic cases,&rdquo; which come on the funds for six or sometimes seven years towards the end of the insurable period by reason of permanent incapacity, could and would have been kept off the funds had the persons concerned received adequate dental treatment in middle age or when about 30 years of age. One of the great objections to this whole unification system is that certain people who are members of solvent societies are going to be deprived of benefits they used to have.  We know from the Minister's speeches on the Second Stage that that is unavoidable under the circumstances, but when a proposal is made that may at first place an additional burden on the funds, but may reasonably be expected substantially to relieve the funds later on&mdash;I think the Parliamentary <Col N="1131" /> Secretary will bear me out in my contention that we could reasonably expect to relieve insurance funds when persons reach the ages of 60 and 70 if dental benefits were provided &mdash;the Minister might take a risk. I do not think that he has had advice that this proposal is actuarially out of the question.  The actuary has said no more, I imagine, than that it would be dangerous to do this until they had found their feet.  I suggest that there is as good argument for maintaining that this is an economy to the fund as there is for maintaining that it is an excessive burden.  I suggest that on this occasion the Parliamentary Secretary might break loose and join with us in bringing judicious pressure to bear on the Minister to make a concession in respect of this important matter.</P>

      <P>I did not know that Deputy Dillon had a knowledge of dentistry in addition to all the other knowledge he seems to possess.  This treatment that is spoken about here&mdash; putting a man in a chair, hauling the teeth out of his head and leaving him, to use a vulgar word, &ldquo;gummy&rdquo; for the rest of his life&mdash;is not dental treatment, in my opinion.  Some method should be taken to preserve the teeth rather than pull them out.  As regards the dental treatment suggested by Deputies here, I would like to know what they mean by it.  Preserve teeth by all means with dental or other treatment, but do not make poor people, men and women, victims of indigestion for the rest of their natural lives after a visit to a dentist's chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment attempts to make certain that at the end of a particular period insured members who are to-day in a position to get this benefit will have it continued.  It also makes provision for people not now in receipt of this benefit to receive such benefit as from the date set out.  I am afraid that the Minister, when approaching the consideration of sections of the Bill dealing with the future financial position of the unified society, was altogether too nervous and <Col N="1132" /> moderate.  So far as I know, the Minister, has not made the House fully aware of the resources that will be available for the unified society, when it comes into operation.  I understand the contingency fund is in surplus to the extent of £65,000 and that there are reserves amounting to very large figures.  I would like the Minister to indicate what the reserves amount to, so far as available information goes.  The House will be interested to know what amount of reserves will be at the disposal of the unified society.  I am now speaking of reserves as distinct from surpluses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If my information is correct, I understand that the majority of societies in existence, although they are small, provide this benefit for their insured members, in addition to other valuable benefits; but only one-third of the members of national health insurance societies get that benefit.  In other words, the insolvent societies, which appear to be the large societies, do not provide this benefit.  I have sufficient knowledge of the administration of national health insurance on a nationwide scale to be able to prophesy that a great deal of the malingering which has been going on all over the country will be cut out by the unified society by reason of its stricter administration. By cutting out that malingering, you are going to bring the unified society to a solvent state much earlier than if it were to be committed to a continuance of payments on the present scale. I am sure there is no Deputy here who will not agree that malingering has been practised.  Most Deputies know why and for what reason, and perhaps they could tell the House what all that has cost the large societies whose members have not, for a variety of reasons, been in a position to get this very valuable benefit.  In any effort we make to secure that members of the unified society will obtain this benefit in the future, we should not interfere with the people who have been getting such benefit in the case of societies that are solvent.  I believe we can look forward to the time when the unified society will be in a position, not alone to provide for the continuance of this benefit to those now in <Col N="1133" /> receipt of it, but also to make provision, because of its financially sound position, for this necessary benefit in the case of all its members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see dental benefits extended to every member of the unified society.  I hope when the society is put on the new basis its work will be so efficient and its financial security will be such that dental benefits will be added to the other statutory benefits.  I hope the society will be in such a position that that benefit will be continued for those who have been lucky enough to have got it so far and will be extended to others.  I am informed, however, that the finances are not in such a position that we could accept this amendment and insert it in the Bill, thus binding ourselves to grant these dental benefits. I am advised the money is not there and we are by no means sure that the money will be there by the date the Deputy suggests.  If it is there, there is no reason why the committee of management that will be in existence should not do the same as other approved societies have done. When they had a surplus, they spent it on their members and I hope the unified society will be in a position to do the same.  I hope they will be able to distribute the surplus amongst members in the way of increased dental, hospital and other benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister might well take a risk in this matter. The passage of this Bill will ensure to the contributor certain statutory benefits which were set out in the Act of 1911.  How is it we can still pay these statutory benefits and yet not be in a position to give an extra statutory benefit in the way of dental treatment?  If the Minister's speech is based on an actuarial examination of the position then, of course, we cannot argue, but I am not sure that it is.  Has it been determined, for instance, that we can pay benefit for the full period of 26 weeks or, say, for 24 weeks?  I am rather sceptical that there has been an actuarial examination of the position. I think it is desirable to have dental benefit provided as a statutory right.</P>
      <P>We are building houses to-day on a very large scale.  More and better houses ought to mean improved health. By reason of the huge allocations to hospitals from the proceeds of the sweepstakes we ought to have better methods of fighting disease.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce talks of growing industrial development which will mean less unemployment. If we are going to have more and better houses, better methods of fighting disease and the industrial development that the Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us of, surely there is a good case for taking a risk in this matter.  The provision of dental benefit would be a great boon to insured contributors.  I implore the Minister to take a risk in this matter. The Bill ought to be amended so as to make it capable of providing the dental benefit which we all agree is so necessary.  As it is contributors cannot make any financial provision for that treatment on their own.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister examined this question with expert advisers, such as his Parliamentary Secretary or other physicians?  Quite apart from conferring benefit on insured persons, I think it might be very good business to take the long view.  What is the experience of the types of disease I have mentioned between the period from 60 to 70 years?  I think the percentage would be remarkably high.  I think the persons suffering from permanent incapacity between 60 and 70 years would represent at least 50 per cent.  They would be suffering from some form of trouble that the Parliamentary Secretary might be inclined to trace to dental defects in their earlier years.  When we are passing legislation which is going to deprive a large number of people of benefits they have been accustomed to receive, we ought to be careful that any economy we are making now will not prove to be an extravagance in the general administration of the scheme 20 years later.  I would like the Minister to look into it.  Apart from the benevolent aspect of the question, I would ask him to look at it from the point of view of good business and to see if it might not be to the advantage of the whole fund to take the precaution of giving dental benefit forthwith.</P>

      <P>I cannot press the Minister on this point if he says he has not got the money to do it, but I think it is a most disastrous and backward step that we should deprive people who previously had these benefits from having them in the future.  On this benefit of seeing to their teeth and to the teeth of the children I am not going into any medical matters.  I will say nothing more than this, that I do not know of anything of more importance as far as the people are concerned than this particular benefit of keeping their teeth in order.  I think it is a most disastrous thing that we should be faced to-day with the proposition that we cannot afford this treatment to people who had dental treatment before.  I look upon this matter as of far greater <Col N="1136" /> importance even than hospital treatment. I do not consider the benefit of any other treatment equal at all to the benefit that can be derived from dental treatment.  That is all I have to say, but I ask the Minister if it is at all possible for him to do so to make provision in the Bill for this dental treatment.</P>

I have had the figures on this matter from time to time but I would not make any statement from these figures from memory.  I would not fall back on my memory for that.

Certainly that is what I would consider a most desirable treatment, but some might argue in favour of dental treatment and some might argue in favour of optical benefit.  Nobody will argue against it; everybody will want it.  But the question is that the present contributions will not provide the funds to meet it.</P>

      <P>I do not see the strength of the Minister's argument that people who do not require optical treatment would have some right to have a clause inserted that would guarantee benefits to them, but I do know this, that a number of people during the last five or ten years secured advantages and additional benefits from the approved societies. Some of them have had dental treatment. They have had their teeth extracted and new dentures have been given them.  In some few cases they required optical or hospital treatment and got it.  Therefore, I submit that they will have an equally good chance of getting the statutory benefit if the Minister is not assured that the actuarial figures will guarantee such benefits.  Perhaps he would leave it to the discretion of the new Committee to formulate a scheme which would be suitable to cover all cases.  This scheme would, perhaps, receive the sanction of the Minister.</P>

There is a strong feeling on that matter.

If the Minister further examines the question in the light of what has taken place during this discussion, perhaps he may be able to meet the suggestion made by Deputy Davin and also by Deputy Dillon.  I ask the Minister if he does not consider that this is a case of plundering the well-managed and efficiently-run national health insurance societies?  In view of the fact that many of these people, who have been <Col N="1142" /> insured in these societies for a considerable number of years, and have been receiving dental, optical and many other benefits which, according to the Minister, they will not continue to receive, does not the Minister consider that it is simply a raid on the funds of these efficiently-managed organisations?  Will he not consult with the Parliamentary Secretary, who must have technical and professional knowledge of these matters, in view of what he has heard to-day and the fact that we take it for granted that he is sympathetic and that we all believe he is, which is a tribute rarely paid to any Minister?

    <P>(1)  On the day of transfer in respect of each approved society, the beneficial interest in all property, whether real or personal (including choses-in-action) which is immediately before such date vested in or held in trust (other than by the Minister) for such society in relation to health insurance business shall, without any conveyance or assignment, but subject where necessary to transfer in the books of any bank, corporation or company become vested in the unified society.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where any property vested in the unified society by virtue of this section is land, such land shall on the day on which it is so vested, be deemed without any conveyance or assignment to have been conveyed or assigned to the persons who are for the time being trustees of the unified society, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns (according to the nature and tenure of such land) as joint tenants.</P>
    <P>(3)  All moneys, stocks, shares and securities vested in the unified society by this section which at the date on which they are so vested are standing in the books of any bank, company or corporation in the name of an approved society or the trustees of such society shall, upon the request of the trustees of the unified society, be transferred into the names of such last mentioned trustees.</P>
    <P>(4)  From and after the day of transfer in respect of each approved society, every bond, obligation, security or other chose-in-action made with or to such approved society and the benefit of which is by this section vested in the unified society may be sued upon by the trustees of the unified society in their own names and it shall not be necessary for the said trustees to give notice to the person bound by such bond, obligation, security or chose-in-action <Col N="1145" /> of the vesting effected by this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (d), line 52, after the word &ldquo;society&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;on terms and conditions not less favourable on the whole than the terms and conditions on and under which such person was previously employed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section provides compensation, in the form of gratuities, to certain officers who lose their employment and are not offered employment in the unified society.  Apparently the offer of employment in the unified society, under the Bill as it now stands, would preclude an officer seeking any compensation. Cases will occur, in connection with the transfer of staff from existing societies to the unified society, where a person who occupied the responsible position say of secretary of an existing society, with a certain scale of remuneration, might be transferred to a subordinate position in the unified society at a salary much less than in the existing society.  But no matter what the conditions of transfer, under the Bill as it stands, he would be debarred from seeking compensation. My amendment seeks to preserve his right to compensation if transferred under conditions and terms that are less favourable than those that he now enjoys.  I am sure the Minister does not intend that a person to be transferred should lose his right to compensation if he gets a subordinate position in the new society, not in any way comparable to that which he occupies in the existing society.  I hope the Minister in the circumstances will accept my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept the amendment at all.  I think the Deputy puts an exaggerated case when he suggests that a person holding a responsible position would be offered a subordinate post.  If he is offered any post it will be a reasonable one in comparison with the post he held in the approved society in which he worked.  I am satisfied that the offer of a reasonable post, taking into account the position occupied by the officials in the approved society, means that reasonable employment is offered to that person at remuneration as near <Col N="1149" /> as can be to his former position.  I am not going to say, and we cannot bind ourselves, that the salary offered to any individual will be the same as he got in his approved society.  I am told there are some approved societies that paid very generous salaries.  I cannot hold out any hope that persons offered employment in the unified society will be paid the same salaries as they are now getting in their approved society. But I say that reasonable offers will be made to anyone selected for employment in comparison with the employment he previously held.  That being so I think that if an individual turns down the offer made to him of permanent employment, in a unified society, he should abide the consequences. If there is no employment offered to such a person or if the managing committee were to offer him an unreasonable post that would bear no comparison to the post or the salary held in the approved society there would be some reason in turning it down, but so long as there is a reasonable offer made I think there is no cause for this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to advert to amendment No. 25, which enshrines a similar principle.  The Minister should bear this in mind, that for the purpose of effecting savings we are going to vitally affect the livelihood of a number of people, many of whom have reached middle age, and some of them advanced middle age, in the public service.  It should be borne in mind, when dealing with this problem, that these men did great service. They built up a great system for protecting the interests of defenceless people, and they built up machinery so effective that the Minister can now take over the whole thing in the certainty that it will go.  I suggest to the Minister it is a hardship that departmental officials should have the right to transfer men from positions they at present occupy to others of inferior status.  My knowledge of the Minister and his Department leads me to believe that the transfer would be done with every consideration, and that every endeavour would be made to do as ample justice as the circumstances <Col N="1150" /> would permit.  But at the same time cases almost certainly will arise in which it is necessary to offer a man who held a position of high standing in his own society a position which is materially of lower status in the unified society.  In such cases I press the Minister that some proviso should be made whereby those people would be consulted as to whether they wished to be taken over or not.  I quite agree if a man is offered a position of equal status or advantage it is up to him to take it, or sacrifice his right to compensation; but where a person is offered a materially inferior position, I think the Minister should signify his readiness to accept Deputy Norton's amendment, or my amendment, No. 25, to protect these men.  There will be very few such cases but, nevertheless, in individual cases it might mean real hardship.  There is not a big sum involved.  There is no possibility of embarrassing the fund or the Minister and I think he should signify his intention of accepting the one amendment or the other.  I think mine is probably more moderate than that of Deputy Norton.  If the Minister cannot accept Deputy Norton's, which I think is reasonable, he should make a promise that he will accept mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>In refusing to accept the amendment moved by Deputy Norton the Minister has expressed his intention of doing something that will cause great alarm among the employees of approved societies.  He has indicated that, in his opinion, they are generously treated in the way of remuneration and that we may visualise the slender staff that will be retained in the unified society to do the work of national health insurance being remunerated on a less generous scale than that which obtains in the case of the 65 societies throughout the country.  That suggests that the policy of parsimony is going to be carried a little too far.  The Minister has refused to accept what I believe is an eminently reasonable suggestion&mdash; that men who have given loyal service to national health insurance and who are to be transferred under this Bill to other positions ought to have a right <Col N="1151" /> to refuse such positions if they are not of a standard or status approximately equal or analogous to that of the positions that they have occupied in the local societies.  Their refusal to accept the offer of such positions should not debar them from compensation if they are not satisfied that they are getting a fair crack of the whip from the unified society.  The number of well-paid posts will be fewer and less generous remuneration is to be paid.  These officials gave very valuable service in building up the local societies and they handed them over to the Minister in apple-pie order.  The number of failures amongst the societies is a high tribute to the manner in which these men applied themselves to the interpretation of an intricate and complex Act.  Notwithstanding the talk we hear of deficits, the societies have been very successful and it is due to these officials that they should be treated with the greatest possible generosity by the unified society.  It is regrettable that the view should be expressed that these men will get less generous remuneration than, as officers in the local societies, they are getting.  I think that the proposal in the amendment is the minimum that these employees can expect. They should have the right to decide for themselves whether or not they will accept the position offered.  If a reasonable offer is made to them, they are not going to throw it away.  But if the offer is such that they cannot accept it, they should be entitled to the compensation set out in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that there is considerable danger of hardship, such as is anticipated by the mover of the amendment, arising from the interpretation of the clause as it stands.  While the Minister may say that it is not proper that a person who is offered a reasonable alternative post in the unified society should be entitled to insist that he get a better post, what really is desired by the amendment is that a person who is offered any sort of post should not be debarred from compensation because he refuses the offer.  The effect of the section, as it stands, is that if one of these <Col N="1152" /> employees of an approved society refuses the offer of any sort of post he loses all possibility of getting compensation. In effect, the question of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the offer of employment rests entirely with the provisional committee to be appointed pending the appointed day.  There is no possibility of having that questioned in any way.  The net effect of the section is that any offer of employment whatever will, if refused, debar the employee of the approved society entirely from compensation.  He cannot question whether or not the offer was reasonable in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Minister, before he speaks, that in previous legislation aiming at unification of essential public services and creating redundancy in these services the wording is on the same lines as the amendment moved by Deputy Norton.  If the Minister looks up the Electricity Supply Act or the various Railways Acts passed by this House with the approval, in some cases, of some of the Minister's own Ministerial colleagues, he will find that we are merely asking to have a provision similar to that in those Acts inserted in this Bill.  If the Minister believes that there was nothing unfair in the wording of these Acts, then there is nothing unfair in the working of this amendment.  The man who occupies a position in an insurance society is entitled, at least, to the small amount of protection afforded by Deputy Norton's amendment. I am sure the Minister realises that this Act is not going to be interpreted, in respect of every section, in consultation with himself or with whomsoever occupies the position that he now holds.  The Minister may have a fairly decent outlook on matters of this kind but he should make certain that what he looks upon as right, or what his Ministerial colleagues supported in this House, should not be watered down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to get a near shot at what I think would be reasonable.  I do not want to bind myself to offer exactly the same salary, because there are 65 secretaries of local societies and their salaries vary. There will be only one secretary and assistant secretary for the new society. There might be a dozen secretaries of approved societies getting to-day the same salary as will be offered to the secretary of the unified society, or they may be getting more.  Only one <Col N="1154" /> of these secretaries can be made secretary of the new society.  Only one can be appointed assistant secretary and we cannot give all the secretaries of approved societies the same salary as the secretary and assistant secretary of the unified society.  If they accept employment, the salaries will have to be scaled down because there will be only one secretary and assistant secretary.</P>
      <P>I do not know how many secretaries of approved societies are at present getting salaries, probably as high as, and maybe higher than will be offered to the new secretary.  We cannot bind ourselves to give the same salaries.  If a form of words could be found to cover this I would be willing to accept it.  I cannot accept &ldquo;on terms and conditions not less favourable&rdquo; because that would be binding us to the salaries they are drawing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is.  The Minister has stated that if he offered a man £250 instead of £300, that that, in his opinion, would be a reasonable offer.  The employee might think it a reasonable offer also.  It would relieve his mind if he could go into the unified society and try to get along, with the security that if he found it would reduce his standard of living, or that the economies it entailed were too severe, he would be able to take his compensation and get out.  The Minister might find that the vast majority of people would settle down in a good job, with perhaps a superannuation scheme and security ahead. Once they got going there would be no more trouble.  Some people might think that a bird in the hand was worth two in the bush.  They might take compensation plus a chance of getting outside employment, whereas <Col N="1155" /> if they had an assurance that within two years of going in, if they could make a reasonable case that the conditions they were employed under were not analogous to those they enjoyed before the transfer, they could withdraw. As many people might come in that difficulty would not arise.  At the same time, it would secure them against the possibility of a severe degradation, without the option of retiring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we have a Bill going through the Dáil without consulting the insured contributors, without consulting the employers or without consulting the committees of management of the societies.  This House is definitely deciding that unification is necessary in the interests of the people and of the State.  These people have no grievances whatever.  They are quite satisfied to carry on, but the State steps in and says: &ldquo;No, the whole course must be changed; you must have a unified society.&rdquo;  If that is the position, surely the State ought to recognise that people whose whole mode of livelihood will be changed, whose economic conditions will probably be imperilled, should have a right to reasonable treatment as a result of the State deciding to embark on a unification scheme.  The amendment, as Deputy Davin stated, is an eminently reasonable one.  Similar provision has been made in the Railways Act, in the Shannon Power Acts, in the Civil Servants (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act and in the Greater Dublin Act.  This House has already accepted the principle that if a man is transferred from one position to another he ought to be transferred on conditions not less favourable than he formerly enjoyed.  That is all the amendment seeks to do, that a person who is not desirous of being transferred but that the State compels to transfer should be treated reasonably in the new conditions.  The Minister said these persons will be offered reasonable employment but there is no obligation to offer reasonable employment.  All the Minister has to do is to offer permanent employment.  The Minister <Col N="1156" /> wants to import reasonable conditions into the agreement, but when we come to the Minister's definition of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; it means £300 less £50.  He thinks that taking £1 off a person with £6 a week is a reasonable offer.  I hope Deputy Cormae Breathnach will take a note of that and that he will be glad the teachers were not treated in a similar fashion.  It is a most unreasonable attitude for the Minister to adopt. These people are entitled to expect that the State which is going to direct the course of their future will treat them fairly and reasonably.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to ensure that they will not get less favourable terms than they enjoyed.  The Minister says &ldquo;we cannot do that.&rdquo;  I began to wonder who &ldquo;we&rdquo; were.  In this case, the compensation is provided by the unified society from the National Health Insurance Fund and is repayable to the fund.  It is expected that amalgamation of societies will result in administration costs not being as high in the future as in the past.  The compensation will be provided out of the administration funds.  Seeing that it will be provided in that way, what is the difficulty in treating these people in the reasonable way&mdash;not in a generous way&mdash;that we seek to provide under this amendment?  The State will not be asked to pay a halfpenny compensation, or to make any contribution whatever in respect of any compensation that they may be entitled to. The compensation will be provided by economies effected by unification.   I think this amendment would be desirable in any circumstances, but is doubly desirable in view of the statement made by the Minister.</P>

Apparently Deputy Norton thinks that he would not be satisfied.  I find myself in agreement with Deputy Norton.  Could the Minister pursue that illustration a little further, and tell the House at what point would a person with £6 a week have a right to make a case <Col N="1157" /> objecting to the reduction?

      <P>Before the Minister replies I would like if he would give us his interpretation of the words in the section &ldquo;the holder of a qualifying post under an approved society.&rdquo; Has he clearly defined what he means by persons holding a qualifying post? I want to ask the Minister if a person holding the position of a city parish secretary would be considered a person holding a qualifying post under the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that a number of very deserving persons have been engaged in building up the societies of the national health organisation for a considerable time.  I think somebody in the House to-day referred to another class of men who have given their best years of service to the building up of these societies. The class of person to whom I refer is the parish secretary.  His duties are multifarious.  Amongst the number of things which he has to do are the collection and distribution of contribution cards, the issue of cards, the compilation of application forms for sickness and maternity benefits, the issue of forms of application for dental, surgical and hospital treatment, the completion of application forms in the case of new members, and so on.  There is a number of other duties, but I do not want to take up the time of the House reading them out.  These employees of the national health insurance societies have duties to perform from ten o'clock in the morning until six o'clock in the evening.  The one with which I am best acquainted is the Diocesan Society of St. Finbarr in the City of Cork.  They go on there in relays&mdash;one goes on from 10 a.m. to 12, another from 12 to 2 p.m. and so on, four of them operating from ten <Col N="1158" /> in the morning until six in the evening. That does not represent the full extent of their duties.  When they have put in two hours in the office they have a good deal of other business to attend to.  As indicating the importance of their duties, there is a case on record in the Diocesan Society of St. Finbarr in which one of these parish secretaries to whom I refer had to give up his position as it was considered so important and so onerous and he had to devote so much time to it that he had either to resign his position on the national health insurance society or resign his position in commercial employment which he held in the city.  These positions, whilst looked upon as part-time positions, in reality are whole-time jobs.  What I should like to know from the Minister is, does he consider these persons as coming within the terms of Section 21 of the Act and embraced in the words &ldquo;the holder of a qualifying post?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony will find a definition of the persons holding qualifying posts in sub-section (3) of that section which he quoted&mdash;Section 21.  Deputy Norton talks about the administration fund providing the money that is necessary.  As a matter of fact, societies are exceeding at present the administration allowance, and I doubt if there are at present, without dipping further into the administration allowance to an extent which may be endangering the administration fund, money enough, without cheeseparing, to pay the compensation on the basis on which we propose to pay as things stand at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not say, and I do not say now, that it is reasonable to say to any individual: &ldquo;We will take your post of £300 a year away from you and give you one back at £250 a year.&rdquo;  What I did say, and what I say now, is that in the present circumstances, when we have to unify&mdash;even though, as Deputy Norton says, it was not asked for by the approved societies or by the committees&mdash;when we have to unify them, when circumstances force us to unify them and when it is certain that a <Col N="1159" /> number of people may be thrown out of employment, we have to offer them the alternative of an amount of £900, which is three years' salary at £300 a year, as compensation for the abolition of the post, or to accept a post at £250 a year for permanency.  I think that it is a reasonable alternative.  It would not be reasonable to say to the official: &ldquo;We are going to dock you one-sixth of your pay&rdquo; unless he was going to be thrown out of employment. But when the alternative is between £900 compensation or offering him a permanent post of £250 a year I regard the £250 a year as reasonable.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with the Minister that as between an official offered a sum of £900, or three years' salary at £300 a year and, alternatively, a permanent salary of £250 a year, there would be very little hardship. At the same time, it is as well to point out to the Minister that one could also put forward a case as regards an officer who was in receipt of a salary of £300 and who would be offered alternative employment at a rate of, say £150 a year.  I do not think the Minister would regard that as equitable or fair.</P>

      <P>Whilst that might be the viewpoint of the Minister, as far as I personally am concerned I more or less agree with him and trust that the Minister would act fairly and justify to the officials.  Nevertheless, the Minister might not be in the position at all. There might be some other man in his place who would be less sympathetic to these officials and who would offer permanent employment at a very much lower figure.  It is in order to have some safeguard in the Act that this amendment was suggested by Deputy Norton in order that it, or something of the kind that would put a proper interpretation on what was in the mind of the Minister in regard to the words &ldquo;permanent employment,&rdquo; should be enshrined in the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2) and substitute three new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) (a) Every person entitled to compensation under this section who had less than five completed years of qualifying service shall be entitled to a gratuity calculated on the basis of one-sixth of his remuneration and emoluments for the year ended on the 30th day of June, 1932, for every completed year of his employment.</P>
      <P>(b) Every person entitled to compensation under this section who had not less than five completed years of qualifying service and who by reason of the establishment of the unified society:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) has suffered loss of employment; or</P>
      <P>(b) has relinquished his employment in consequence of being required to perform duties such as were not similar or were an unreasonable addition to the duties which he was required to perform by such approved society at the date of transfer; or</P>
      <P>(c) has suffered diminution of salary, wages or emoluments; or</P>
      <P>(d) has been placed in any worse position in respect of the conditions of his employment than he was in that respect on the date of transfer; or</P>
      <P>(e) has suffered any direct pecuniary loss in consequence of the establishment of the unified society including any loss of prospective superannuation or other retiring or death allowances and allowances to his widow or orphan children,</P>
      <P>shall be entitled to receive compensation in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this section hereinafter contained.</P>
      <P>(3) The compensation to be paid under paragraph (b) of sub-section 2 of this section to a person who either:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) has suffered loss of employment; or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> (b) has relinquished his employment in consequence of being required to perform duties such as were not similar or were an unreasonable addition to the duties which he was required to perform on the date of transfer;</P>
    <P>shall be an annual sum not exceeding in any case two-thirds of the remuneration and emoluments payable to him for the year ended on the 30th day of June, 1932, and subject to that limitation to be calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth of the said remuneration and emoluments for every completed year of his service with the approved society with an addition thereto based on the number of completed years of his service and calculated according to the following scale:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If he has twenty or more completed years of service an addition of ten-sixtieths of his remuneration and emoluments;</P>
    <P>If he has less than twenty completed years of service then such addition shall abate proportionately and so that no person shall receive an addition of less than one-sixtieth of his remuneration and emoluments for every completed two years of his service.</P>
    <P>(4) The compensation to be paid under paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) of this section to a person who either:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) has suffered loss or diminution of salary, wages, emoluments; or</P>
    <P>(b) has been placed in any worse position in respect of the conditions of his employment than he was in at the date of transfer; or</P>
    <P>(c) has suffered any direct pecuniary loss in consequence of the establishment of the unified society, including any loss of prospective superannuation or other retiring or death allowances and allowances to his widow or orphan children;</P>
    <P>shall be an annual sum not exceeding in any case two-thirds of the remuneration and emoluments payable to him for the year ended on the 30th day of June, 1932, and subject to that limitation as nearly as possible the equivalent in money of the annual <Col N="1165" /> diminution in remuneration and emoluments or of the worsening of the conditions of his employment (as the case may be) including any direct pecuniary loss suffered by him and shall be payable during the continuance of the employment in which such annual diminution in remuneration and emoluments or such worsening of the conditions of his employment (as the case may be) is so suffered by him as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>In moving this amendment, my object is to provide for the persons affected some more reasonable measure of compensation than that provided by the Minister in the Bill.  Under the Bill, the Minister provides compensation in certain circumstances, assessed at one-eight of the annual remuneration where the person has less than ten years' service, and one-sixth of the annual remuneration where he has ten or more completed years of service, but subject to an overriding maximum of three years' salary.  Many of the arguments that could have been used on this section have been already used on the previous amendment.  Here again, it is hardly necessary to point out in any detailed way, the State comes in, and creates a situation by this unification Bill, the effect of which is to prevent these people following the occupations which they formerly followed.  The State in that way interferes with their livelihood and yet the compensation provided by the Minister under this section is a maximum of three years' salary. Many of these people will have given 22 years' service to the business of administering the national health insurance.  Many of them are people highly skilled in the knowledge not merely of the Act but of the thousand and one regulations made under the Act.  Many of them have reached an advanced age at the moment.  Here the State steps in and interferes with their employment, jeopardises their livelihood and then offers to pay them three years' salary.  We must add to that the fact that they are not likely to get any further employment having regard to their past avocations.  That is, to say the least of it, treating these people in a most unreasonable way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> The amendment which I propose provides that these persons shall be paid as a gratuity one-sixth of the salary for each completed year's service. That is for persons having under five years' service.  For those with a service of over five years, my amendment seeks to provide compensation in the form of an annual allowance calculated at one-sixteenth of the salary for each year's service, subject to an overriding maximum of two-thirds of the remuneration and emoluments in the year ending 30th June, 1932, with the addition, as already recognised in legislation, of certain added years in compensation for the abolition of the person's office.  Under this amendment of mine, it would be possible for a person to get compensation if he is dismissed, or if he is compelled to relinquish his employment because the conditions are not similar, or are an unreasonable addition to the duties which he was formerly required to perform. The amendment provides also for the payment of compensation if a person suffers loss or diminution of salary, wages or emoluments, or if he is put in any worse position as a result of his transfer, or if he suffers any other kind of loss set out in sub-section 4 (c) of the amendment.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree that a person who suffers loss of employment is entitled to compensation and that a person whose salary or wages is reduced is likewise entitled to compensation. If the State seeks to transfer a person from a reasonably remunerated post to a post which is not remunerated so well it worsens that person's position. If he is put in a worse position than he occupied previously he is entitled to compensation.  In assessing compensation the Minister is confining himself to a gratuity basis, giving people with 22 years' service in national health insurance work a gratuity of three years' salary.  That method of remuneration or compensation is not the normal method or the method that the legislation passed through the House for the past ten years has recognised. In all cases it is recognised that persons with a certain service are entitled to an annual pension.  That particular point has been already conceded in the case of the Electricity <Col N="1167" /> Supply Board, in the case of the Railways Act, in the case of the Greater Dublin Act, and in the case of the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act.  Seeing that the State has adopted this principle of compensation in cases somewhat analogous to the cases with which we are now dealing I do not see any reason why the State should depart from that method of compensation now.</P>
    <P>That is a reasonable piece of legislation which has been endorsed by this House, supported by all Parties in the House, and it seems utterly unreasonable to come along now and give to people who have 22 years' service in national health insurance, who were responsible for the smooth and satisfactory running of the National Health Insurance Acts for the past 20 years, such miserable compensation as is provided in the sections of the Bill introduced by the Minister.  I hope the House will show irrespective of Party that they stand for a square deal for these officers who are being transferred to the unified society.  These officers are quite willing to carry on with the unified society and give their services to that society, and if they lose their employment or if their conditions are in any way worsened they are entitled to compensation on not less generous terms than the State provides in the case of civil servants, in the case of railway employees under the Railways Act, and in the case of persons affected by the Greater Dublin Bill and the Electricity Supply Bill. There is a strong case for extending to these officers the same consideration as the legislature has already extended to other officers, and I hope that, irrespective of Party, the House will say definitely that it wants a square deal for these people whose interests and livelihood are jeopardised by the action the State is taking in the matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton suggests that we should deal with the officials in <Col N="1168" /> this case as generously as we would deal with civil servants.  What he proposes is that they should be dealt with on a much more generous basis that civil servants in the cases in which the offices of civil servants were abolished, but, in the case of the abolition of their office, civil servants would not get the terms that Deputy Norton is suggesting that these officials of approved societies should get.</P>

      <P>They were, but under special conditions.  They were being transferred from one country to another.  There was quite a different set of conditions and circumstances in that case from what we are dealing with in this Bill. The civil servant who is dealt with in respect of abolition of office is, to start with, a pensionable officer while these officers of approved societies are not.  The civil servant's salary scale is much lower because he is a pensionable officer, and, if his office is abolished, and if he has ten years' service, all he gets in the way of pension is based on one-eightieth for each year of service, plus a gratuity based on one-thirtieth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He could get one-sixtieth, too, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment that Deputy Norton proposes would give these non-pensionable employees of approved societies not only one-sixtieth calculated on service, but added years on the general scale.  Our position is that anything that is done in the way of compensation or gratuity has to be paid out of the administration fund. The administration fund is limited and, at present, the societies are exceeding the administration allowance.  At <Col N="1169" /> present, that allowance is about 4/9 instead of 4/5, and, in order to provide this compensation, we shall have to dip into the administration fund to a heavy extent and to take from the administration fund moneys which ordinarily should be required for administration. We will, of course, make some economies, because the various expenses of the approved societies, such as office expenses and salaries, are bound to be reduced.  We will thus be able to make economies.  Therefore, the whole of the sum now spent on administration will not be necessary.  We shall have to use these economies plus further economies that we shall have to make in order to be able to pay the compensation on the scale we propose to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is just as well that I should say, at this stage, that, while I cannot at all accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Norton&mdash;the fund will not allow it&mdash;I propose to accept, at any rate, in principle, amendments 12, 13, 14 and 15, in the name of Deputy Dillon.  It is with a certain amount of trepidation that I am accepting these amendments.  I will not say that it is against the advice of the Department, but the Department certainly has accepted them under pressure from me. I thought that the compensation ought to be increased even to the extent of taking a risk when we were putting these people out of employment and it was only under the very greatest pressure from me that the officials eventually decided that we might risk it. They do, however, impress upon me that it is taking a risk with the administration fund.  That risk I am prepared to take and, if the fund would allow it, I should like to go further, but there is no earthly hope of that. There is no earthly hope of basing the compensation on the scale that Deputy Norton has set out in his amendment. In the case of the pension scheme, he mentioned the Railways Act and the Electricity Act, but they were dealing with affairs that were business affairs and supposed to be making a profit. The moneys came from the shareholders' pockets while, in this case, the money will come out of the fund of the national health insurance societies <Col N="1170" /> and we will be robbing them of the benefits to which they are entitled.  It will be a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  It is the people who would be sick and infirm and entitled to the statutory benefits who would be losing and we cannot afford to take any more from these people in the way of benefits.</P>
    <P>Any further addition to my proposal would be taking money out of the fund provided for statutory benefits and that we cannot do.  The only other alternative would be to tax the contributions to national health insurance by both employers and employees and that, I do not think, would meet with the approval of this House either. Therefore, we propose to go to the furthest limit and to take some risk in going that far with the administration fund.  It will be going to the fund to an extent that some of my advisers say is not right, but, on the whole, we have decided to take the risk and to go as far as we can to meet these people because we are putting them out of employment.  I should like to go further&mdash;it is my own personal attitude&mdash;and I must say that the officials feel the same way about officers being put out of employment but they want to safeguard the funds of national health insurance and that is our first concern.  That being so, we cannot go any further and we cannot accept Deputy Norton's amendment.</P>

      <P>When I first examined these proposals, I was inclined to the view that superannuation was the most equitable arrangement.  I saw that there was a great deal to be said against superannuation, not the least being the difficulty of financing it, and I must say that I consider that the Minister has met this problem as generously and as fairly as his resources would permit.  I am not authorised to speak for anybody on the matter but I have watched the business as it went forward with considerable anxiety to see that these men who would prove redundant as a result of this scheme of unification would be fairly dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking into consideration the fact that the Minister proposes to accept <Col N="1171" /> in principle amendments 12 to 15 inclusive, in my opinion and in the opinion of my colleagues he has done what is fair by these people.  So far as we are concerned, we appreciate the spirit in which he has met the situation and the spirit in which he has provided compensation.  We recognise that had it been possible financially he would have gone further.  Having gone so far as he has is an indication of that. I am sure he feels with us that it would have been desirable to go further if such were possible without seriously embarrassing the administration. Taking everything into consideration, he has met the situation generously.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon speaks in a tone of voice which makes those who do not know him feel that he speaks with the authority of a person who is infallible on every subject.  He did not tell us, as he should have, the difference between the cost to the administration fund if the Minister accepts his amendments compared with the cost of £90,000 that would accrue as a result of the compensation clauses in the Bill as originally introduced. The Minister has assured us throughout this discussion that he has made a careful study of the consequences from the point of view of compensation and further concessions to insured members.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us a little more of the information at his disposal.  He told us the cost of compensation would be £90,000. Will he tell us&mdash;I am sure he can, after agreeing to accept Deputy Dillon's amendments&mdash;what would be the increased cost to the administration fund as a result of the acceptance of Deputy Dillon's suggestions?  Will he also tell us what would be the cost arising out of the acceptance of the amendment moved by Deputy Norton?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason whatsoever, from the Labour Party point of view, at any rate, why the members of this Party or the Cumann na nGaedheal Party should vote for the insertion in this Bill of certain clauses in the Electricity Supply Act and the Railways Act, watering down the measure of compensation. <Col N="1172" /> The Minister says that the compensation in these cases is being paid by business companies supposed to be making a profit.  I do not think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when putting the Electricity Supply Bill through the House or when pushing the Railways Bill through, could have at that time indicated what the cost was likely to be.  He first approached the consideration of the whole question from the point as to what was likely to be fair to those going to lose their livelihood as a result of legislation passed here.  If I wanted to, I could quote several passages from speeches made by the Minister's colleagues supporting the same principle in the case of previous legislation concerning people who did lose their livelihood as a result of the passage of legislation.  What grounds can he give for reversing the policy adopted by himself and his colleagues when they were in Opposition, in relation to matters of the same kind?</P>
    <P>I have been told that three-fourths of the existing servants of approved societies are likely to be taken over by the unified society.  I do not know whether that figure is right or wrong. The Minister could give more figures than he has given in connection with this matter.  On the Second Reading the Minister indicated that he had reached the limit&mdash;that the compensation section of the Bill was the limit to which he could agree to go so far as paying compensation to redundant officials were concerned.  He said they were doing the best they could with the moneys available.  Deputy Dillon, who apparently knows more than the Minister about every aspect of the Bill, without having any official figures at his disposal, says that the Minister has acted as generously as his resources would permit.  Where did he get the information?  Has he more information than the Minister on this matter?  If he has, then it is due to the House that this person who recently posed as an expert should give us what information he has. Seeing that the Minister did not accept the water-tight amendment which Deputy Dillon proposed this evening in connection with <Col N="1173" /> those who will get the positions of secretary and treasurer, I suggest that the Minister might, in the light of the very valuable advice given him by Deputy Dillon on the question of national health insurance and in view of the financial limitations supposed to be involved in the acceptance of our amendment, seriously consider the absorption of Deputy Dillon as one of the principal officer of the unified society when it is established.</P>

      <P>I want to correct one or two statements made by the Minister. The Minister stated that I was claiming more for the insurance official than for a civil servant.  Either the Minister's brief is wrong, or the Minister has not had time to read it. If he looks at it again he will find that in the case of the civil servants there are two schemes of superannuation, one concerning one-sixtieth for each year of service and the other one-eightieth for each year of service, plus a lump sum.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides inadequate compensation.  The hair shirt is put right through this whole section.  The Minister thinks this is generous compensation and Deputy Dillon congratulates him upon the generous attitude he has adopted.  It would seem as if there were a new alliance between Deputy Dillon and the Centre Party and the Minister. <Col N="1174" /> Deputy Dillon is saying everything that is complimentary about the Minister so long as it is reactionary.  I must congratulate the Minister on his new convert.  I would go even further than Deputy Davin; I would suggest that Deputy Dillon might not merely be absorbed into the unified society but he should be absorbed into the Ministry.  Apparently he will be found to be a very accommodating gentleman judging by the things he is prepared to say and do in the House.  I again emphasise that this measure of compensation is thoroughly unsatisfactory. It is unfair for the Minister to tell Deputies that the measure of compensation we seek can only be provided either by increasing the rates of contribution or by taking benefits from sick people.  The Minister knows that is not true.  I do not accept that as the position and the Minister's advisers know perfectly well it is not the position. In any case, so far as we are concerned, we do not accept it as the position. It is true that the societies find a difficulty at the moment in carrying on under the administration grant but that is because there are 65 offices, 65 telephones, 65 separate secretaries and 65 separate sets of furniture.  One would expect that with unification a very considerable economy would be effected there.  The working of the Act will disclose what the economies will be.</P>

The difference between us and the Labour Party in relation to this Bill is this: That we have tried to amend the Bill to the best advantage and for the benefit of any person who might otherwise suffer under it.  But the Labour Party is concerned to-night to &ldquo;do its stuff&rdquo; here, to edify the railwaymen and the post office workers and all the diverse persons from whom Deputies Norton and Davin cherish the hope of getting a vote in the future.

      <P>I will discuss that with the Deputy on another occasion.  Once this Bill was introduced my Party here took it to be their duty to do everything in their power to assist the Government to make it a more equitable and, possibly, a more generous measure.  So far as we are concerned we are of opinion that the Government has made a genuine and generous attempt to meet the exigencies of the situation.  Our position is that when they do that we deem it our duty to support them in that course.  If they fail in that course we consider it our duty to vote against them.  The jibes from Deputy Davin and Deputy Norton and from others on the Labour Benches are interpreted by us rather as compliments coming from the quarter they come.  Praise or compliments from the Labour Benches would be received by us with very uneasy feelings and with heart searchings. The Labour Party only a short time ago pursued a very different course towards the Government.  But they are now trimming their sails.  We followed a different course all the time.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3) (a) (i), line 12, after the word &ldquo;secretary&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;treasurer or other salaried officer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" /> This is an amendment designed to bring in principally the treasurer of an approved society.  The Minister will note that there is mention specially of the secretary and whole-time employees and part-time employees who derive the greater part of their income from salaries as servants of an approved society.  But it would seem, however, that a part-time treasurer who was an officer held in a society a status similar to that of the secretary.  If he were only a part-time employee he would be entitled to no compensation at all.  It seems to me, as the Minister has accepted the principle that the secretary, being an officer of the society, and, therefore, an employee, is entitled to compensation, that principle should be extended to include the treasurer as well.  Very probably the sum involved here would be trivial.  Where the treasurer was a part-time employee his work was largely formal and his remuneration was proportionate.  There may, however, have been and, I think, there were certain cases where the treasurer's duties were more than formal and he occupied something in the nature of the position of general consultant to the secretary.  Officially, of course, that could not be recorded; for official purposes he was treasurer of the society.  But in these cases where he was acting in the nature of consultant to the secretary his remuneration was sometimes a material sum, perhaps £100 a year.  These cases would be very few and the amount that would fall upon the administration fund for compensation in respect of treasurers would be very small.  A real hardship, however, might accrue if they are not provided for and it is to provide for the possibility of such hardships that I have put down the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment.  I suppose amendments 16 and 17 cover the same thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment 17 is an alternative, because if you dealt with them under amendment 16 you gave them compensation whether they derive the major part of their income from employment or not.  Amendment <Col N="1179" /> 17 is merely to ensure that there should be no doubt that a treasurer was an employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is any case where a treasurer, who was not a whole-time official of an approved society, was anything but a consultant such as Deputy Dillon suggests. I do not think there is any case for compensating a consultant, no matter how frequently he may have been consulted.  If the treasurer occupied any position in the society, whole-time or mainly whole-time, and if he derived most of his income from that employment, of course he will be compensated. Otherwise I am afraid there is not any case for a treasurer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister perhaps throws undue emphasis on the case I described, where this individual might be employed in a consultative capacity. In these few cases these men would have received much larger salaries than treasurers normally receive.  Treasurers are usually rather figureheads, simply for the purpose of singing cheques, and got £10, £15 or £20 a year for filling that job, but there were a few cases in which they got a more material sum.  £100 a year, say, is a very material part of an income to a man, but we are proposing to wipe that out without any compensation.  What I am putting is this: that compensating the vast majority of treasurers will cost practically nothing, because they were only in receipt of £10 a year or so. There may not be more than 60 treasurers and a great many of these are banks.  Therefore, I doubt very much that there will be more than 30 or 40 men holding the position of treasurer. The burden it is going to place on the administration fund is trivial, but the burden that it might place on individuals, if a provision of this kind is not made, might be very severe indeed and might materially alter the whole standard of living.  I do not wish to press this at present.  If the Minister would look into the circumstances and ascertain if there were any such persons as I have described between this and the Report Stage, he might undertake to deal with it himself on <Col N="1180" /> the Report Stage, if it requires attention. I imagine that if he looks into it he will find there are going to be three or four hard cases if they get no compensation, whereas if he decides to compensate them, all individual treasurers, except the banks, who are corporate bodies, he will find that the burden will be the merest bagatelle and he will avoid doing serious harm.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3) (b), line 24, to delete the word &ldquo;continuously.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the sub-section is passed in its present form it might be found to operate unjustly in several cases.  It would provide that employment should be continuous and that all voluntary or enforced absence would not be allowed for.  The object I had in mind in putting down this amendment was to ensure that employees of approved societies who had their services broken by activities during the civil war, by strikes and so forth, would have that time allowed them, but I notice that Deputy Costello has put down amendment No. 20 which covers the point I have in mind.  It probably makes the position clearer, with the exception of the word &ldquo;strikes.&rdquo;  He makes no provision here in amendment 20 to provide for those people who went on strike. Such cases have come to my notice, that people in approved societies have been on strike in the past.  I would like to make provision for them.  Perhaps I ought to pay a compliment to Deputy Costello for the drafting of <Col N="1182" /> this amendment No. 20&mdash;although it may be premature until he is allowed to move it&mdash;seeing that he has accepted the principle that both parties in the civil strife are entitled to recognition.</P>

      <P>(Clare): Before it is withdrawn I would like to feel that the Minister would give some consideration to it.  There has been talk about armies.  I am not interested in any army.  I know cases where a man's service was broken; the son was asked by the father to carry on the position for a period so that the proceeds would be coming in to the family.  If you put in the word &ldquo;continuously&rdquo; there you knock this man, whose main source of livelihood is that position, out of getting any compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was the service broken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be various reasons why a man had to go away for a period of a year or two, and his son asked and got the approval of the society to carry on the position.  When the father came back he resumed his own position.  If he had let the position go to an outsider that source of income, which was very necessary to the family, would have gone out of the family altogether.  Possibly there would be a very grave danger that it would never come back.</P>

      <P>I think that in accepting Deputy Costello's amendment, which covers a wide variety of cases, and the principle of the one suggested by Deputy Kelly to include people who may have been on strike, if there are such cases, all that could be reasonably expected to be covered in the way of broken service will have been covered.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he can have included the word &ldquo;strikes&rdquo;?  From former experience in this House I found that where the Minister's intentions were expressed in debates but not definitely put into the Bill, which subsequently became an Act, the fact of it having been stated that that was the intention meant nothing because it was not in the Bill.  In that case I should like to know if the Minister would include the word.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3) (c), line 28, after the words &ldquo;taken to be,&rdquo; to delete the words down to the word &ldquo;remuneration,&rdquo; inclusive, in line 43 and to substitute the words &ldquo;his annual remuneration for the year ended on the 30th day of June, 1932, and in calculating his annual remuneration any amount or amounts paid to such person for the provision of clerical assistance or other expenses shall not be treated as part of his remuneration.</P>
      <P>This amendment has two objects.  In the first place, it aims at calculating the remuneration as on the 30th June, 1932, and not, as in the Bill, for the previous five years.  I can understand that there is a good case to be made for taking the average of five years; at the same time I do suggest to the Minister that people who have got say an increase of salary just before June, 1932, by reason of their special merits, ought to be entitled in the circumstances created by this Bill to have their compensation assessed on the basis of the actual salary they were in receipt of on the date in question. There can, I think, be no question that no approved society would have artificially increased the salary of any employee with a view to getting compensation, because I think that the provisions of this Bill were not generally expected.  In any event, the bad case should not prejudice the good one.  I would suggest that particular point for the consideration of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point in the amendment aims at allowing the question of bonus to be considered in assessing the compensation, for the reason that as I understand it the amount available for administrative expenses depends upon the number of effective members each year.  That cannot be ascertained until the end of the year; therefore, it was the practice in a number of approved societies to give a fixed salary to their officers, with the intention&mdash;when they knew what their proper financial position was at the end of the year&mdash;of increasing that salary by way of bonus. <Col N="1185" /> In effect then, the bonus was really part of the salary, but only ascertained when the facts were available for the society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  The question of unification has been before the country for a considerable time.  It has been discussed, I think, for years, and the fact that it would be necessary to unify was announced to the approved societies and to the public a considerable time ago.  In at least one case there has been an effort to forestall the provisions of this Bill by rushing increases of salaries to officials.  We think that it is necessary to average the period of salary over five years, and that is as fair a way as any of measuring the compensation.  At any rate, the compensation we propose to give has been <Col N="1186" /> calculated on the average over five years, and we have stretched that out in accordance with the demands that were made here in the House, and the feeling that there should be a more generous scale of compensation.  We have stretched it out and given out of the administration fund as much as we think that fund can afford.  We cannot contemplate increasing the draw on that fund to any extent beyond what we have done.</P>
