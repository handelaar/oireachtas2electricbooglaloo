      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether any conditions attached to the granting of licences permitting the importation free of duty of two thousand three hundred units of 280 lbs. of wheat flour into County Donegal during the month of February, 1933; and, if so, if he will state if it was stipulated that the flour so imported was to be used in making bread.</P>

      <P>No specific stipulation was made in the licence granted to two Donegal bakers authorising them to import certain quantities of flour, free of duty, to the effect that the flour in question should be used only in making bread.  They were recommended, however, by my Department on the understanding that such flour would be used only in the bakeries of the licensees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the licences were used for the purpose of importing household flour and that by at least one of these importers the flour was sold in ordinary commerce against his competitors at from 3/- to 4/- a sack less <Col N="2" /> than his competitors could buy flour from within the tariff barrier?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I enquire if the Minister has investigated the facts referring to this matter which I laid before him immediately after I put my question last session?  Is it possible, if he has made that investigation, that he has not found what is common knowledge in the County Donegal&mdash;that these permits were used for the purpose of bringing in flour in order to engage in cut-throat competition with persons in the same trade who would not be given a permit to bring in flour?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether a licence to mill flour has been granted to a new port mill to be erected in the City of Waterford; or whether it is intended to grant such licence; if he will state upon what grounds the case for the erection of this mill is based; what inquiries he has made in the area concerned, namely, in Counties Kilkenny, Carlow, Tipperary, Wexford, etc., among mill workers and mill owners in inland mills; whether representations have been made to him to the effect that the existing inland mills could, with certain comparatively small changes and expense, provide all the flour required for the area; and whether he will reconsider the whole question of the licensing of this new port mill in view of the fact that its operation will displace numbers of mill workers from their employment in the counties mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given a provisional promise of a milling licence when the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill, 1933, becomes law in respect of a new mill to be erected at Waterford, and it is my present intention to carry out that promise.  The grounds on which the application has been considered favourably are principally the needs of that district for flour.  My Department is aware of the exact position of the milling industry in the area of the Counties Kilkenny, Carlow, Tipperary and Wexford. Representations have been made in respect of one mill in the district which has been closed down for a considerable time.  These representations have received careful attention and I am satisfied that the reopening of that mill could not possibly cater for the area in the manner in which the new contemplated mill could.  My policy is to limit the number of flour mills so as to ensure that the output will not exceed the demand by a very considerable percentage, and under this policy I cannot see that the granting of a licence in respect of a mill at Waterford can possibly lead to the displacement of mill workers already employed in the counties named.</P>

Will the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that there are at present a large number of people in the Donegal Gaeltacht who are qualified for grants but are unable to go on with the reconstruction of their houses or the erection of new houses because the Government has not available the money for this purpose? Is the Parliamentary Secretary trying to sail off in that way?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil approves of the Trade Agreement between the Irish Free State and the Union of South Africa signed at Ottawa on the 20th day of August, 1932, the text of which is contained in the Report of the Imperial Economic Conference held at Ottawa, 1932 (Supplementary Volume), laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 28th day of November, 1932, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps to ratify the said Agreement.</P>
      <P>Deputies are, I am sure, already familiar with the terms of this treaty which it is proposed to ratify.  In accordance with its terms, the Union of South Africa contracts to give to the Government of the Irish Free State preferential treatment in respect of hosiery of all sorts, tractors and parts, and stout.  The Irish Free State contracts to give to the Union of South Africa preferences on currants, raisins, and other dried fruits, canned fruits, wine not exceeding 30 degrees proof spirit, wine exceeding 30 but not exceeding 40 degrees of proof spirit, sparkling wine in bottle, still wine in bottle and maize meal.  The position concerning the various duties set out in the schedule of the agreement is as follows: The duty in South Africa upon hosiery, including socks, stockings and underwear, is 15 per cent. There is a duty of 20 per cent. upon jerseys and pullovers.  There is a preference of five per cent. given to Great Britain and to Canada on socks and stockings.  That preference was not heretofore allowed in respect of goods of Irish Free State origin.  The result of the concession in that respect, therefore, is to give to hosiery of Free State origin a preference not heretofore enjoyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as tractors are concerned, there is at present no preferential duty applicable to tractors entering the Union of South Africa.  The effect of the treaty will be to establish a preferential rate of 10 per cent. in favour of such articles produced in the Saorstát.  As regards stout, the existing duty on stout entering the Union of South Africa exceeding 30 degrees of proof spirit is 2/3 per gallon, with no preferential rate.  The effect <Col N="16" /> of the treaty is to secure, for the first time, a preferential rate of 1/9 per gallon.</P>
    <P>The preferences which the Free State contracts under this agreement to give to South African produce involve no change in our tariff schedule.  These preferences have, in fact, been given heretofore and it is the intention to continue them.  In respect of maize meal, the duty at present imposed will cease to operate when the Cereals Bill, now before the Dáil in its final stage, becomes law.  That Bill imposes a prohibition upon maize meal imports except under licence.  It is intended, however, that the Bill will be operated in accordance with the spirit of this agreement.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to give any precise figures concerning the volume of trade with South Africa, either outwards or inwards.  The figures contained in our trade statistics relate only to goods consigned direct to South African ports or which reach here direct from South Africa.  It is reasonable to assume that there are considerable quantities of goods passing both ways which are consigned through Great Britain.  The figures available in the trade and shipping statistics can be taken as representing the minimum amount of trade.  The actual trade in each case is probably larger, although only estimated figures could be given. It is our opinion that any reliable estimate would show a substantial balance of trade in favour of South Africa and I think that that is generally agreed.  I recommend, accordingly, that this resolution be adopted and that the Executive Council be given authority to ratify this treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This agreement represents one of the two advantages derived from the Ottawa Pilgrimage, which, I suppose, is the proper term to apply to it.  The previous agreement was with Canada.  So far as this agreement is concerned, we are getting three concessions and, according to the Minister, we are giving nothing more that has been given up to date. We should like to have heard from the Minister what prospect there was of any trade in connection with the three items mentioned in Schedule No. 1. <Col N="17" /> The Minister said that the trade between South Africa and this State was substantially in favour of South Africa.  It would seem to be advisable, therefore, to secure some rectification of that balance against us.  South Africa is a rather useful country, having regard to some of the pronouncements we have heard from the opposite benches.  They are still&mdash;or they were up to a short time ago&mdash; dealing in gold ounces and they have considerable quantities of gold available out there.  Taking this as the other leg of the Ottawa concessions, very little advantage was derived in respect of that important conference. If it were possible to develop our trade with South Africa, much good would ensue.  I do not know whether they are importing at present any number of tractors.  I am not at all sure that the tractors they are importing are coming from here.  I did not gather from the Minister whether or not there had been a prohibition against the import of tractors.  He stated that this was the first preferential duty in respect of them.  As regards hosiery, I presume that, with the high quality of the manufactures of this country, we ought to be able to develop our trade there. From what the Minister has said, I take it that we have given to South Africa a continuance of the preferences in existence at the moment and that there is no advantage to them beyond that, while we have got something which we had not had before in respect of these three items.  When one looks through the report and sees the very big list of articles in respect of which advantages have been given and exchanged amongst the various countries engaged at the Ottawa Conference, one is not inclined to be very enthusiastic about what we are getting out of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to what Deputy Cosgrave has said, I merely wish to express the opinion that he is not likely to be enthusiastic about anything that this Government does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that all the advantages under this treaty have been secured by us.  The <Col N="18" /> continuance of these preferences in respect of South African goods is of advantage to South Africa.  The fact that these preferences were given voluntarily heretofore is no guarantee that they would be continued voluntarily in the future.  On the contrary, we must, in the present state of world trade, come definitely to the conclusion that we will only give advantages where we get advantages in return.  We think that the advantages in this case balance fairly well and that, in any event, the treaty serves as a basis on which additional arrangements can be built.  I think I can say that the Government of the Union of South Africa is quite willing to consider at any time proposals for facilitating trade between both countries, to their mutual advantage. I have no doubt whatever that if developments should necessitate it, representations made with a view to giving or receiving additional preferences will be very sympathetically received without confining consideration to the sole point of the advantage likely to be secured by one country as against the other.  On the general question of the Ottawa pilgrimage, I have merely to advise the Deputy that there may be advantages not as obvious as the two trade treaties and that the materialistic aspect from which he regards the whole business is one that should be persisted in with great caution.</P>

    <P>This amendment is also intended to clear up a difficulty which was commented upon by Deputy McGilligan on the Committee Stage in respect to Section 5.  It is intended that the Railway Tribunal shall review the standard revenue and, having regard to the reduction in capital effected by this Bill, to fix a new standard revenue which, in the opinion of the Railway Tribunal, will be fair and equitable in all the circumstances. The manner in which the section was drafted was criticised on the Committee Stage and on examination I came to the conclusion that an improvement in the drafting was possible.  The insertion of the amendment will make it clear that the Railway <Col N="21" /> Tribunal can take all relevant facts into account and fix a standard revenue which, in the circumstances, it considers to be equitable.</P>

The intention is that the Railway Tribunal shall have regard to the new capital of the Company and, taking into account the original standard revenue and all the factors which came into account when the old standard revenue was being fixed, then it will fix the new standard revenue which will have regard to the reduction in the amount of interest payable and dividends reasonably to be expected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole section appears to be rather a joke because, so far as one can see what is meant by this term at all, it refers to the ordinary stock.  Obviously the Railway Tribunal or anybody in making up what the standard revenue is to be will include, first, the debentures, secondly, the guaranteed preference, thirdly, the preference; and then there is the ordinary stock.  As the ordinary stock will amount in future to something like £700,000&mdash;I am speaking from memory &mdash;the dividend on that even at five per cent. is a negligible amount.  It will amount to a half per cent. on the old stock.  Five per cent. on the new stock refers only to £35,000.  It is a question simply of putting into the Bill some thing which satisfies a person's æsthetic taste.  The Bill itself will not give the means of providing either a reasonable or any other sort of dividend.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 18, Section 8 (2) (b), after the word &ldquo;company&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;notwithstanding any statutory, contractural, or other obligation to the contrary&rdquo; and to delete all from the word &ldquo;whether&rdquo; in line 21 to the word &ldquo;obligation&rdquo; in line 22.</P>
      <P>This amendment is also to clear up another point raised by Deputy McGilligan.  He queried the words in paragraph (b) which relates to the obligation, whether voluntarily undertaken or undertaken by virtue of a Statute or contract.  I agreed with him that the word &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; was ambiguous and we propose therefore to change the wording and to bring it into agreement with the wording of paragraph (a), that is, by inserting these words: &ldquo;notwithstanding any statutory, contractual, or other obligation to the contrary.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The question arose, I think, as to whether the Minister deemed it prudent to take&mdash;what was never taken before&mdash;power to release one party from its contract without regard to the other party's claim. I take it that the Minister, having carefully considered the representations made on the Committee Stage, has decided that he requires that power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  It is intended in all the circumstances envisaged by this section that the company should be allowed to reduce the services of trains, and that there should be no doubt of our ability to enable them to do so.  As the section cannot come <Col N="23" /> into operation at all except on the application of the railway company I do not think there is any danger of arbitrary action being taken which would interfere with the existing rights of individuals or companies. The change which is now proposed to be made removes a certain amount of ambiguity which the original sub-section contained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House by repeating the debate which took place on the Committee Stage.  It was pointed out to the Minister that the circumstances under which he could require this power were very few and far between &mdash;possibly non-existent&mdash;but that in taking the power he established a highly undesirable precedent.  In that connection, Deputy McGilligan intervened to say that he had taken analogous but not identical powers under the Shannon Electricity Supply Board Acts, and that when he went out of office he was actually in correspondence with the Electricity Supply Board to warn them that if they made use of those arbitrary powers he would have to introduce amending legislation to take them away from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe.  At any rate, even if those words were not used by Deputy McGilligan in connection with this matter, it was pointed out to the Minister that there is no precedent for the taking by a Minister of power to break contracts&mdash;no precedent in any legislation we have ever heard of.  I challenged the Attorney-General, who was sitting behind the Minister on that occasion, to get up and quote any precedent for what the Minister was going to do.  The Attorney-General smiled a sickly smile and remained sitting. There is no precedent whatever.  I invited the Minister on the Committee Stage to produce it on the Report Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to add at the end of Section 8 (4) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(e) such railway company may transfer to any road transport business or any other undertaking owned or controlled by such railway company any employee whose services are rendered redundant by steps taken by such railway company under the authority of such order, and unless such transfer is refused by such employee on reasonable grounds, or any such employee so transferred is dismissed for any cause other than inefficiency or misconduct within two years from the date on which he is so transferred, no employee so transferred shall be deemed to be dismissed for the purposes of the foregoing paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to secure that the railway companies will have an inducement to offer alternative employment instead of compensation to employees rendered redundant by the making of an order under this section. I think that is to the advantage of all parties concerned.  As the Bill originally stood, the railway company had no such power, and in fact it would probably be the practice that redundant employees would be dispensed with and compensated.  If this amendment is inserted the railway companies may, instead of dispensing with employees, give them alternative <Col N="25" /> employment in some other capacity.  I understand all parties are agreed that that is the better course.</P>

      <P>This question arose some years ago.  It is a case in which a railroad runs along the side of the bridge.  At the time that the bridge was actually constructed the railroad traffic was an economic proposition. Along with that railroad on the bridge there is also provision for vehicular traffic.  That is a very considerable advantage.  The suggestion that I made some years ago, and which I understand was acted on for some time, was that the charge was one properly attributable to the Road Fund.  I think it is out of the Road Fund that provision should be made for it.  The ordinary public use it to a greater extent than the railroad, and it is certainly unfair that&mdash;with the growth of traffic, and greater use on the part of other persons than the original constructors of the bridge&mdash;some way out in that form should not be found.  I think neither the Harbour Commissioners nor the Corporation ought to be charged, and that it is on the Road Fund the charge should be made.</P>

      <P>I want to raise one point.  When we were concluding the Committee Stage of this Bill, rather in a hurry before the Recess, I understood that certain amendments which we did not then touch were to be carried forward to the Report Stage, and brought in along with certain official amendments by the Minister.  Those amendments <Col N="26" /> have actually dropped out from the Paper, and I have been disappointed at not seeing them there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some misunderstanding. In fact, as the Deputy will remember, most of the amendments remaining over, with I think the exception of three, were covered by amendments that had been dealt with before we stopped the discussion.  In respect of those three I was asked whether I was inclined to accept them or not.  I intimated that I was not and the reason for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It applied to the three of them.  They all relate to the powers of the Railway Tribunal in regard to applications by the railway company in connection with rates and matters of that kind.  I indicated that I would be inclined to oppose them strongly, as in my opinion the Railway Tribunal should be the responsible authority in matters of that kind and not the Minister, and that the giving of the powers to the Minister would be undesirable and might possibly be unconstitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further point; the Minister, in connection with the Schedule, which is to my mind the only important thing left, gave what I understood was an undertaking that a certain part of the Schedule would be altered, as he was satisfied that it was not equitable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say in that connection, perhaps to satisfy the Deputy, that the information which would enable me to decide in what manner, if at all, the Schedule would be amended, affecting the minor stocks, had not been made available to me at that time.  A large part of the information came to me in the last couple of days, but there are still some essential parts missing, and I am not in a position to arrive at a decision on the point.  I intended to inform the House on the general question that the matter of the minor stocks was definitely under consideration at the moment, and that I am almost in the position to say that an amendment will certainly be introduced. I propose to have it introduced in the other House so that it will come back to this House again.</P>

      <P>The Minister did everything except actually to put it in words. I raised the question of the equity of the Schedule as a whole.  I referred to the debenture stock, about which there might be a debate, and I pointed out in respect of the 4 per cent.  City of Dublin Junction Railways Preference Stock, and the 4 per cent.  City of Dublin Junction Railways Guaranteed Stock, that it was manifest the Schedule was inequitable.  The Minister when replying admitted that in some of the junior stocks referred to there was an absence of equity and that it was his intention on the Report Stage to remove that, and to introduce an amendment which would bring these junior stocks into what would be an equitable position.  In face of that it did not seem worth while putting down amendments which were pretty certain to be rejected by the Minister in favour of his own.  It would make a very difficult position if, after a guarantee of that kind was given, the Minister did not introduce his amendment and refused to allow Deputies to do so.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister want me to read the whole oration?  Is the Minister defying me to find anything in the Official Reports to justify the assertion he makes: that he did not undertake to bring in any modifying proposals on Report?  The clear meaning of the <Col N="32" /> words the Minister used on that occasion is that he would make a modification of the Schedule before the Bill left this House.  He said: &ldquo;We have asked for information from the railway company to enable us to decide what modification should be made.&rdquo; Then the Minister went on to say that he did not understand those who did not agree with him.  It would be most extraordinary if anybody did.  The fact remains that these words were taken, and I think reasonably taken by most people on this side of the House, to mean that it was the Minister's intention to introduce modifying proposals, and that it was partly on that account that the Report Stage was postponed until after the Recess.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what the Minister said on my amendment, which has been ruled out of order, that the matter was obviously one for agreement between the parties, I would like to point this out to him: that there is no necessity for the parties to come together, and that the railway company cannot compel other people to come to a conference or an agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> If the Minister says: &ldquo;I will summon a conference,&rdquo; then I am satisfied; but I would like the Minister to indicate how the matter could be carried further.  The Minister is no doubt aware that all the parties have conceded the justice of the railway company's claim for consideration. I think that my friend here, Deputy Broderick, is burning to tell the House how much the county council is prepared to give.  I would like to know from the Minister if he thinks he can do anything to summon such a conference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>

      <P>I would have to consider the question of whether I could take the responsibility of bringing the parties together.  I think the principle that agreements cannot be broken except with the consent of both parties is one that all parties subscribe to. That certainly should apply in this case.  If there is any difficulty about getting the parties to come together for the purpose of discussing an agreement, then we might consider the question of inviting them to a meeting, but I would not like to give any definite promise to do that.</P>

      <P>The Minister challenged me to produce what he did say on that occasion.  This was the fourth time that the Minister dealt with the matter, and he said: &ldquo;I have mentioned the matter of the minor stocks.  The priority of the charge on the Great Southern Railways for the City of Dublin Junction Guaranteed Stock is one point on which we are seeking additional information which has not been supplied by the railway company. <Col N="35" /> In that connection, and in connection with the other stocks mentioned, I agree that a case could be made for an amendment of the Bill, but a decision on that will not be possible until we get the information which is required and which was asked for.&rdquo; What did the Minister mean by &ldquo;we&rdquo;?  Did he <Col N="36" /> mean the royal person of Mr. Lemass, Minister for Industry and Commerce, or did he mean the members of this House?  I quite recognise that we are approaching a state of royalty on the bench opposite, but that is not yet.</P>

      <P>I was present in the House and the Minister, I think, will recall that not merely were certain amendments not discussed on Committee Stage, but certain sections were not discussed, including the new Schedules, and I understood that we were to go into Committee on this Stage and discuss these particular sections that had not been discussed.  I understood that that was what the Minister was consenting to when it was agreed to give the full Committee Stage on that date.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that there were only two or three amendments left undealt with or that were not covered by amendments already dealt with and that were to be considered on Report.  Any misunderstanding that there has been was with regard to whether I was to bring them in on Report or the Deputies in whose names they appeared on the Paper.  I was leaving it to the Deputies for Report Stage but they have not appeared on the Paper.  In any event, the amendments were of such a nature that they could not have been accepted.  They raised constitutional points and could not have been accepted in any case.</P>

I distinctly mentioned these things and I understood that we were to have the opportunity of discussing those by going into Committee on this stage.  The Minister will admit that there was no tendency on that occasion on the part of those who opposed certain views of his to <Col N="39" /> obstruct him in any particular way but undoubtedly we were left under the impression that adequate opportunity would be given to discuss, not merely those amendments, but the portions of the Bill that simply were not discussed at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 10, Section 7 (1) (a), to delete the word &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;eight&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of this section in the Bill is, as has been previously stated from these benches, the most objectionable feature of this whole measure, and the amendments that are now moved are moved with the sole object of bringing the principle contained in this section into line with the Minister's previous political pronouncements concerning the transport policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I read for members of the House on Committee Stage a statement made here by the Minister in which he said that the transport policy of the Fianna Fáil Party at the <Col N="40" /> time was unification under public ownership and, in so far as the Fianna Fáil Government had any policy, their policy was to put transport services in municipal areas under municipal control.  The Minister, in my opinion. made no case whatever for exempting from the provisions of this Bill the areas where traffic is densest and greatest, and where regulation is most necessary.</P>
    <P>It is a peculiar state of affairs that the Minister claims that the Bill is one for the regulation and control and, presumably, the unification at some time or another, by voluntary or compulsory methods, of the transport services of the State.  If regulation and control are necessary anywhere, surely they are necessary in the areas where you have dense traffic like we have in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  Personally, I do not think that there is any case for bringing the other cities or towns named in this section within the ambit of the exempted areas.  By reducing the exempted areas in Dublin and Cork from 15 miles to eight miles, you are, so far as I can see from a map of the cities concerned, limiting the operation of the exemption clause to the municipal boundaries&mdash;in some cases, probably outside, but as closely as they can possibly be brought, within the municipal area&mdash;and thereby making it possible for this or some other Minister who may come after him and who may have more courage to carry out the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government than, apparently, this Minister has, to bring the transport services in municipal areas under municipal control.</P>
    <P>We are anxious that the Minister would accept this in order to bring the measure, in so far as it affects the working of this section, within the confines of his own policy, that is, in so far as policy pronouncements from the Minister and the Ministry are worth anything.  There is no case whatever for bringing Ballina or Westport within the ambit of the exempted areas.  I understand that the population of Westport is something in or about 3,400, whereas Kilkenny, which does not come within the range of the <Col N="41" /> exempted areas, has a population of about 10,000.  There is no sense or meaning of any kind in the policy aimed at in this particular section except to give full freedom to operate anywhere and under any conditions they like to certain privileged persons who may engage in transport services within the areas now laid down in the Bill.  That should be limited as far as it is possible to limit it.</P>
    <P>The Minister contended during the previous discussion on this section that it would be impossible to administer the measure without making provision for exemption in the cases of the cities and towns named.  I think that the administrative difficulties that will be created by the inclusion of the exempted areas clause is going to make it impossible to administer the measure as a whole.  I suggest that the amendment now moved in the name of Deputy Norton and myself would make it much easier, if accepted, to administer this section of the Bill and, also, would remove many of the administrative difficulties that the Minister spoke of in previous discussions.</P>

      <P>As the whole question of exempted areas arose and was debated at very great length on previous stages of the Bill it does not appear to me that any useful purpose can now be served by opening it up again.  It is clear that <Col N="42" /> Deputy Davin's position, in regard to this matter, is based upon a misunderstanding. He talks about those areas as being parts of the country where the traffic is densest, and criticised a Bill designed to regulate road transport which excluded from its scope those areas where the traffic is densest.  As I endeavoured to explain before, the density of the traffic in those areas has nothing to do with the matter.  The only traffic excluded from control is that which originates and terminates within any of those areas.  All important traffic undoubtedly either originates or terminates in those areas but it is traffic that extends all over the whole country, and, so far as the railway company is concerned, the important traffic for them is long-distance traffic.  I do not think, in these days, we should contemplate taking any action which would make the railways the ordinary means of carrying merchandise, for the very short distances included in any one of those exempted areas.  I mentioned also the fact that the exclusion of those areas would have very beneficial effects in other ways. I pointed to the fact that there are a number of haulers and carriers in the principal towns and cities, particularly in Dublin and Cork, the bulk of whose business is entirely within the radius of 15 miles of the principal post office in these cities.  If we abolish the exempted areas and require that everyone of those carriers should be licensed under the Bill then they will apply for licences not merely in respect of those areas, but of much wider areas, and, probably, in respect of the greater part of the country.  Consequently they would be in competition with the railway company and would have to be acquired by the railway company if it desired to achieve a monopoly position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we maintain these exempted areas, and impose certain obligations with those licensed under the Bill that will apply both inside and outside the exempted areas, there is a strong inducement to others not to apply for a licence at all, but to confine themselves to the areas.  And that will withdraw them entirely from competition with the railway, arouse no question of their <Col N="43" /> acquisition, and not only make the administration of the Bill very much simpler, but also very much cheaper for the railway companies to carry out. It is preposterous to argue that the loss of the short-distance traffic will affect the railway company.  If we abolished the exempted areas, and the railway companies sought to acquire control of that traffic, they would not carry it by rail, but would substitute a road service for the road services already existing.  But in view of the diversity of the service now provided and the size of the road traffic, I think the prospect of trying to bring them under the rigid control we are imposing upon other parts of the country would be appalling, and would only inflict great hardships, involving new difficulties, and the railway company would be involved in expense that they could not face.  That is why, in my opinion, the device to exempt the areas should be maintained in the Bill, and I would be greatly opposed to its deletion.</P>
    <P>On the question of size, difference of opinion can exist, but, in the long run, any figure fixed must be an arbitrary figure.  We have taken 15 miles round Dublin and Cork, and ten miles round other parts of the country. These figures have no relation to the importance of the ports within the areas.  The people of Waterford and Limerick seem to suggest that the importance of their ports is being lowered by the fact that the exempted area in regard to them is smaller than that of Dublin and Cork.  These sizes have relation to the size of the towns, and are intended to include residential areas and suburban districts from which the ordinary supplies of vegetables, milk and the like would be drawn.  Within that area in each town we want to maintain absence from the form of control that this Bill imposes elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The town of Ballina has been mentioned. Undoubtedly those who take the circumstances of Ballina for the purpose of criticising the Bill have taken the best example from their point of view.  Ballina is one of the smaller towns, and the circumstances of Ballina cannot be compared with <Col N="44" /> the circumstances of Dublin and Cork. At the same time we had to choose some standard by which to go, and we selected those towns from which there were regular steamer services.  It seemed to us a fairly good standard to accept because such towns have a trade of a particular kind.  Also it is desirable that the organisation of road transport, in regard to steamer services, should not be unduly interfered with.  Of course it is true we may give any shipping company a right to run a road service, but the shipping companies may not wish to undertake that responsibility, and there is no reason why other traders should not fulfil for the shipping company the service which it might fulfil for itself within that restricted area.  It is reasonable to assume that the railway company might operate a very definite policy in relation to goods for export or carried by a particular shipping company, and because of that it is desirable to have in relation to these port towns and large cities circumstances different to those in relation to other towns. The whole case for exempted areas is quite clear.  It does not interfere with the effectiveness of the Bill as a means of regulating road transport.  On the contrary, it makes it much simpler in its administration and in the achievement of the policy behind it.  From the point of view of engaging in road transport the railway company does much better to have those exempted areas than not.</P>

      <P>Upon what grounds does the Minister justify permission to allow certain carriers to operate within the exempted areas who have not paid proper wages and observed proper hours, while at the same time imposing obligations in regard to those matters upon the merchandise-carrying companies which will operate outside those areas?</P>

      <P>In connection with this amendment and with particular reference to the position of Ballina, I <Col N="45" /> should like to say that I am in thorough disagreement with it.  In the first instance, when the Bill was originally introduced the radius was 15 miles as far as Ballina was concerned. That distance has now been reduced to ten miles.  The position of Ballina is somewhat different from the position of other areas such as Dublin.  Dublin has ample railway facilities.  Ballina is a port with a regular shipping service, but from Ballina to Blacksod Bay is almost 50 miles and there is no railway there. There was a time when there were some shipping facilities.  A boat was subsidised from Sligo to Belmullet. That subsidy was paid by the old Congested Districts Board and it obtained until the recent past.  I think it obtained until the advent of the present Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be quite true, but the services continued until some time after the present Government took office.  The people in Ballina have been deprived of these services.  Needless to say, a locality such as Ballina, cut away from all facilities and having no railway service, is entitled to some consideration. When you have a port like Ballina, with a considerable quantity of goods distributed from it, the people there ought to be entitled to some consideration&mdash;to some exceptional consideration. It is all very well for Deputy Davin and other Deputies to talk lightly about the position of Dublin and similar areas where they have every facility that a railway can afford to give.  These areas have all these advantages, but when you come to view the position of a town like Ballina and to see how you are going to hamper the distribution of goods and to injure the people there, I think it will be admitted that they should be afforded reasonable opportunities <Col N="46" /> and their activities should not be restricted in such a way as to limit them to ten miles.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand the attitude of the Minister in this matter.  I cannot see what operated in his mind when he changed from 15 to ten miles.  What influenced him and what great advantage did he see that he was going to confer on some one particular area as compared with another, when for Ballina he has limited the freedom of action to ten miles instead of 15 as originally indicated in the Bill?  That has been brought about by his own action, and for what reason I am at a great loss to understand.  Deputy Davin of course is out for it.  I do not blame him.  He would restrict everything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I want is fair competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair competition! Well, fair competition in one particular locality might be very unfair competition in another locality.  Fair competition in a situation such as you have here in Dublin, where you have railway facilities would not be fair competition in an area like Ballina where you have not these facilities.  Will it be fair where you have a district cut away by 40 or 50 miles from a railway station? It might be fair for Dublin but would it be fair to Ballina where you are removed by 50 miles from the advantages of a railway service?  I want fair competition also, but I want fair consideration to be given to the position of Ballina.  I dare say it would not be the same in Westport, but I do not represent Westport.  They have railway facilities in Westport from the harbour to any other place.  Ballina, however, is a very important distribution area and you have very important considerations to take into account as far as Ballina is concerned.  The one particular place to which I point is Belmullet and the barony of Erris. They were served by the boat, the &ldquo;Tartar,&rdquo; formerly but now they have been deprived of that advantage.  They are 40 miles away from a railway station.  I ask that some consideration should be given to these people, isolated as they are.  They are deserving <Col N="47" /> of some consideration and I appeal to the Minister in such circumstances to take their isolation into account and, when they have not the railway and other facilities which other towns and places enjoy at the present time, that they should be given some advantage.</P>
      <P>For the life of me I cannot understand what operated in the Minister's mind when he changed the exempted area in Ballina from 15 to ten miles.  That is a thing that puzzles me and I should be very glad to have an explanation from the Minister.  In my opinion it is most unjust to that locality and to the harbour of Ballina, which is brought to a standstill as a result.  There were a large number of people there who enjoyed a big wage&mdash; a better wage even than Deputy Davin would consider reasonable to suggest. These people are now deprived of that as a result of the many things that have happened in the meantime, such as the stopping of the importation of flour and various other articles that were imported through the port of Ballina.  That is now brought to a standstill.  Some of these men have been paid as much as £1 6s. a day.  I myself have paid that wage.  They are idle now.  What is going to happen to them now?  Is everything going to be done that is best calculated to drive them out of employment?  They are unemployed now, and I feel that their position demands the consideration of the Minister.  I do not know that even Deputy Davin himself would feel justified in saying that it would be right to throw these people out of employment.</P>

      <P>The matter under consideration is five amendments in the name of Deputy Davin, proposing to cut down the radius of the exempted areas.  I believe that <Col N="48" /> Belmullet is more than ten miles from Ballina, and consequently the Deputy is out of order.  It is a question of eight, or ten or 15 miles, the figures set out in these amendments, and nothing but that question should be discussed.</P>

The conditions that obtain in certain localities will certainly not make this thing as objectionable as it will be in other localities, such as Belmullet.  If the Chair rules against me, then I am sure Deputy Davin will thoroughly agree.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin seems to forget the fact that he is contributing towards bringing about more unemployment, and he is going to inflict on many sections of the people greater hardships. They are enduring very much to-day very reluctantly.  The Minister has a big responsibility in this matter. It is a serious thing to throw a number of well-paid employees on the unemployed list, particularly in the locality I have in mind.  I dare say the people of Belmullet will make an appeal in due course.  The position now being created in the locality is very serious and I warn Deputy Davin that he is undertaking a very grave responsibility; he is trying to assist in throwing more people out of employment.</P>

      <P>I have read the amendment and I say that the object of it is very clear.  It is calculated to make a bad position infinitely worse.  It will tend to throw a great many employed people out of employment.  I believe that as a result of this we will have the evil of throwing out of employment people who occupy well-paid positions. In that district, there are people who were earning as much as £5 per week and they are not now getting as much as £1 a week.  If Deputy Davin is prepared to accept responsibility for creating a situation of that kind, I wish him luck.  I ask the Minister to give special consideration to the situation to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  I wonder if the Minister is at all impressed by the remarks of the Deputy who spoke just now.  If he is sufficiently impressed he might be inclined to withdraw the measure altogether. That possibly would be the attitude he would feel inclined to adopt if he were deeply impressed by the terrible situation to which Deputy Davis has drawn attention.  I do not believe that this measure will have the effect of throwing people out of employment. I believe it will have a beneficent effect on the transport industry and on the people engaged in that industry.  I cannot understand the fears expressed by Deputy Davis.  I was not impressed by the Minister's statement when he mentioned that the people inside the exempted areas would be brought into competition with the railway companies. In my opinion, all the carrying companies ought to be given a fair crack of the whip; they ought all to be brought into competition.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the traffic in certain areas was not of sufficient importance.  Does that mean that it will be allowed to be carried on in a chaotic fashion, everyone doing what he likes?  If conditions of that sort are to be allowed you will have the railway companies and other carrying companies carrying through the exempted area and outside it; you will have people carrying on under disordered conditions and the existing chaos will be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that the messages from Limerick do not represent the opinions of the people of Limerick.  They represent particular vested interests, such as the shipping interests.  They are anxious to be allowed to continue to go long distances into the country hauling traffic for their ships at uneconomic rates, making it impossible for the railway companies to compete with them.  They want to be allowed to continue hauling stuff at impossible rates and then taking it by sea passage, thus making it impossible for the railway companies or other transport companies to enter into competition. I cannot see that any hardship will be inflicted on any town in the <Col N="50" /> Saorstát by the putting into operation of this measure.  It is impossible, obviously, completely to wipe out all those exempted areas.  I desire to support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to disagree with Deputy Davis.  I do not think the Deputy has really examined the question fully in its application to the situation in Belmullet.  Far from interfering with the amenities enjoyed by Belmullet, I think this Bill will improve them.  On the Committee Stage I said that if these exempted areas were not done away with the Bill would be largely ineffective.  We impressed the Minister so far on the Committee Stage with that point of view that, towards the end of the debate, he said that if cogent reasons were laid before him he would be prepared to consider doing away with the exempted areas.  I do not know that any more cogent reasons could be laid before him than were submitted during the debate.  If he studies the arguments advanced he must realise that an absolutely cast-iron case was made for the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we are trying to do here is to secure that the railway company will not be operating under restrictions in any particular area while in competition with people who are operating under no restrictions at all.  Our purpose is to put the railway company on its feet and get back its traffic.  All sorts of limitations are placed on authorised undertakings, such as shipping companies and railway companies, and formidable liabilities are placed upon licensed carriers; but there are no responsibilities laid on the people inside the exempted areas.  If you are legislating with the object of rescuing the railway companies, the first thing you should see to is that you are not going to leave anyone in competition who will have a distinct advantage over them.  The railway company should be put on the same footing as its competitors, and it should be allowed to look for trade. Even if we abolish the exempted areas the railway company will be still at a disadvantage as compared with licensed undertakings, which need not <Col N="51" /> have any schedule of rates.  Deputy Keyes seems to forget that point when he says that if we abolish the exempted areas the shipping company in Limerick would not be able to compete with cut-throat rates.  Under this Bill there is nothing to prevent a licensed carrier quoting any cut-throat rates he likes.  A licensed carrier can quote as low as he likes.  I think it is a great pity, if this body of legislation is to be given any chance at all, that we do not get rid of the exempted areas. The principal argument, and indeed, the only one, about these exempted areas was that a number of people who would seek licences and go into the general carrying business, would now confine themselves to the exempted areas.  I submit that result would not follow at all.  The man who had a certain equipment would not be allowed to increase it, and without increasing his equipment he could not go further afield; and without getting regulated he would not be able to go further afield.  Any person who is in a position to go further afield before the appointed day will, under this Bill, apply for a licence, and will continue to go all over the country with that licence.  So that in order to avoid what, in my opinion, is a non-existent danger, the Minister has left in large areas around the principal ports in the country absolutely free competition, competition which the railway companies are not equipped to meet, and which they will not be able to meet. With great folly, I should say extraordinary folly, the railway companies expressed the opinion to the Minister that the volume of traffic in these areas was not of any great intrinsic value.</P>

      <P>The Minister said it was unfair; but the Great Southern Company, with extraordinary folly, went to the Minister and gave him <Col N="52" /> figures which entitled him to say that the traffic within these exempted areas was not much.  Somebody must have given the Minister information about these areas.  In going to the Minister with that information they dug their own graves.  While the monetary return may not be great the dislocation which it will cause them by having it snatched away from them is going to do them very great injury directly and indirectly, and mainly indirectly.  I think the Minister is very much mistaken in not having introduced an amendment doing away with the exempted areas altogether. Why not give the scheme without the exempted areas a 12 months' trial, and then if he found a difficulty the Minister could come back here to the Dáil with legislation applying to have exempted areas?  As it is, the Minister is going to make the condition of affairs such a danger that it will make the position of the railway companies very difficult, indeed, by depriving them of the advantages which this very faulty legislation would otherwise have conferred on them.  In default of that I strongly urge the House to accept Deputy Davin's amendment to reduce these from 15 miles to eight and from ten miles to five.  It would have been better if Deputy Davin had reduced them in regard to Dublin, Cork and Limerick to the municipal areas.</P>

      <P>What has been pointed out by Deputy Dillon is my real objection, that it creates a monopoly. I realise the position of the railway companies, and I sympathise with the Minister in his attitude.  But then there is the creation of the monopoly, and if you are going to inflict an injury on a very huge district such as that to which I refer it is a very serious thing. If you take the district around Ballina and Blacksod you will appreciate how <Col N="53" /> great the injury may be.  I think it will be a terrible hardship on such districts.  It will destroy the position of ports like Ballina.  We know what that would mean to a very large number of people in that locality.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin is quite right in his own way.  These people in ports like Ballina and elsewhere would lose the very great advantage that they possess. There is the regular service between Ballina and Liverpool for the shipping of their cattle.  That is not used for passenger traffic now because none of the people there are going to Liverpool but it is used for the shipping of live stock and farm produce.  They would not have these facilities when a monopoly is created for the railway company. If the railway company had a little more consideration for the public not so long since they might have found themselves in a much better position than they are in to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With the general idea, as dealt with by Deputy Dillon, I agree.  When we came up against this idea of exempted areas previously I felt that the making of exempted areas was hitting at the root of the problem that the Minister wanted to solve and hitting at one of the great transport companies that the Minister wished to set up.  By this idea of exempted areas I think he completely interfered with the prospect of helping the companies.  I still think, if there are to be exempted areas, that the big transport companies ought to be given a chance to take an opportunity inside the exempted areas and leave the rest of the country an exempted area.  Every person except the Minister was able to size up what was the problem in the rest of the country.  That problem is not realised at all in this Bill.  A Bill is being passed and the members of the House do not realise what is to be its outcome. I can perceive now that Deputy Dillon's idea and mine were conceived with a very considerable amount of simplicity because the Minister has now told us very gently and obliquely that the reason for having the exempted areas <Col N="54" /> at all was that if there were not exempted areas the policy of the railway company would be so directed that the ports in Ballina and Westport and those other places would be shut down; that the railway company would give such services around these ports as would operate against much traffic coming in through these ports.  The suggestion was that the railway company would give such service as would hardly make it worth while for anybody to set up in competition against them. In fact the Minister fears that the railway policy would be applied in such a way as to shut down these ports.</P>

Therefore, feeling that Dublin should be without an exempted area around it it would be the greatest possible folly to develop the Minister's idea.  I fail to see at all if, while having an exempted area, you should have an exempted area around Dublin in such a way that the present service could not make delivery to Bray.  I doubt if he could make a delivery to the point of Killiney if Deputy Davin's amendment were accepted.</P>

Despite the ideas which the Minister may have as regards railway policy, I see no case why the 15-mile exempted area of the City of Dublin should be replaced by an eight-mile one.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davis, presumably without having carefully read the Bill, and without having compared the previous amendments with this section of the Bill, endeavoured, but I am sure did not succeed, to persuade the House that my object was to help to secure a monopoly for the railway companies, and incidentally, as he said, to drive a large number of people out of employment. There was no such intention behind the previous amendment or any other amendment moved by any member of this Party.  I want to say emphatically again, so that nobody can misunderstand me or misrepresent our attitude on this or any other amendment, that our attitude on this question is, that if this House by legislation is going to license or allow people to come into or remain in the <Col N="59" /> transport industry, they should put the same restrictions and the same conditions upon every person allowed by law to operate in the industry.  Why should a majority of this House allow one set of carriers to operate under this Bill and be obliged to pay certain rates of wages and to limit the number of hours worked by their employees, and within the exempted areas allow a larger number of people to operate without any of these conditions? Surely that is not fair competition within the industry?  All I am looking for is, whether it applies to railways, roads, canals or the air, if you like, that if people are going to be compelled by legislation to do certain things in the interests of the public all those licensed should be compelled to carry out their work under the same restrictions and conditions.  I want Deputy Davis very definitely to understand that.  There is nothing more than that behind any of the amendments moved in connection with this particular section.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play during the Committee Stage, and to a certain extent in his speech on the previous amendment, with the impossibility of administering this measure unless there were certain areas exempted.  I presume he has in mind the number of people possibly who would engage in this kind of operation inside the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford. I wonder how many people would be operating even at present in the areas mentioned in this section from line 21 to line 45?  How many carriers are operating, for instance, at present from or in Dundalk, Ballina, Westport and the other small towns mentioned?  Surely it would not be impossible to administer the measure if it were applied in full to the towns mentioned in this particular section of the amendment.  I believe that the inclusion of the towns mentioned in this amendment makes it much more difficult to administer impartially this Bill than by bringing them within the ambit of the excepted area.  I do not know whether it is local pressure by shipping companies or by people personally operating or what actually <Col N="60" /> was the cause of compelling the Minister to include the towns mentioned in this amendment in this section of the Bill originally.  At any rate, there is only one object in our minds, and that has been stated fairly and fully.  Take the case of the City of Dublin.  Under the Bill as it now stands you will have one set of carriers operating, perhaps in the near future, under the central control of the railway management, compelled to pay their employees certain union rates of wages and compelled to conform to certain working hours.  Inside the very same area you will find ten times as many carriers operating without being obliged to work under any of those restrictions.  You may, and probably will, have in the City of Dublin one set of carriers operating inside and outside, compelled to pay the drivers of their lorries perhaps £3 or £3 10/- a week, and working their men eight hours a day; while other people will be allowed to operate inside the exempted area, and pay their men any rates of wages which the men are willing to accept.  The Minister's answer to that argument is that the trade union movement is weaker than he thought if that is going to be so.</P>
    <P>Fortunately or unfortunately&mdash;I suppose fortunately from the point of view of some of the members of this House&mdash; the workers in the road transport service are not very well or very highly organised.  With the present state of unemployment nobody knows better than the Minister that it would be impossible for a trade union, owing to the weakness of the existing organisation, to compel the people who will be allowed to operate inside the exempted area to pay the same rate of wages as he will compel the other companies to pay.  He gave us his views regarding the question of hours and wages on the Committee Stage of this Bill, in so far as it affected those who will come within the operation of the Bill.  The Minister in the previous section of the Bill talked&mdash;when he had less responsibility than he has now&mdash;about the municipalisation of the transport services within city areas.  That has no bearing whatever upon this amendment. The Minister knows quite well <Col N="61" /> what the object aimed at by the members of this Party is in bringing in this amendment.  I leave it to the members of the House to say whether they believe in fair competition within the transport industry.  If they do, let them take the only step which should be taken, and compel all those who are allowed to operate in any part of the country to comply with the same conditions, thereby insuring competition between those who are engaged in plying for profit-making purposes on the roads of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing further to say.  In my statement on amendment No. 1 I dealt with the whole question of exempted areas, and gave the reasons why they are considered necessary.  The only misstatement of Deputy Davin which I want to correct at this stage is that relating to the restrictions which are imposed on the railway companies and others.  Precisely the same restrictions are imposed upon everybody engaged in the business of carrying merchandise, except those who are engaged in the carriage of merchandise entirely within the exempted areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But to represent the Bill as placing obligations and restrictions on the railway company that are not being placed upon its competitors is completely erroneous.  The main competitors of the railway company are those who are engaged in the carrying of merchandise to and from the principal towns of the country, including the towns of the exempted areas.  Their chief competition is not from those who are engaged in the carrying of goods for the short distances that are entirely within the exempted areas.  The railway companies, therefore, in respect of the competitors that really matter, will be under no greater restrictions or subject to no other conditions than those imposed on their competitors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point Deputy Davis particularly raises in the light of the discussion that has taken place here shows what the difficulties are likely to be in the case of people in an area like Ballina or Westport.  We are practically told by the Minister that <Col N="62" /> except there is an exempted area around Ballina and Westport the shipping services of those ports may be injured by railway policy; therefore, we are given exempted areas around them.  When we step outside those exempted areas to the north-west we find ourselves up in the Belmullet peninsula, and we find that the people there are to be served by licensees who are going to have within the first ten miles of their journey absolute unrestricted competition, and unrestricted competition in the most populated part of the country.  The people in Belmullet, the people in Ballycastle, and the people up around Achill are certainly between the devil and the deep sea.  Deputy Davis, with his closer knowledge of the area there, may consider that the people in that area will be better served by having a restricted area around Ballina.  If we leave out any threat to the ports by the railway company I think they would be better served by having no exempted area around Ballina.  I certainly would like to hear the Minister on the case for an exempted area around Ballina and Westport other than railway policy, because it seems to me that&mdash;except whatever is in his point with regard to railway policy and its effect on the port&mdash;to have restricted areas around Ballina and Westport is simply to inflict fairly considerable hardship on the country that lies immediately outside those exempted areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Committee Stage the Minister opposed the abolition of exempted areas on three grounds: (1)  he said that the railway companies attached no importance to the revenue; (2)  that the persons who would normally operate within those exempted areas would not go outside them if they were given freedom of action in the exempted areas; and (3)  that it would add greatly to the administrative difficulties of the Act if there were no exempted areas.  So far as the people going out are concerned, I have dealt with that before.  A man is either equipped to go long distances through the country, or he is not.  If the equipment of his carrying enterprise is for metropolitan and suburban traffic he is restricted to that equipment by the <Col N="63" /> Bill.  He cannot add to his equipment when he is getting his licence under the Bill as a licensed carrier, and so his equipment will keep him normally within his own area of operation.  The man who claims a licence without going outside his rights, and without any compliment from the Minister, is going to get it, and to carry on business in exactly the same way as he always did, as a haulage contractor over long distances.  He is not going to be driven out of his normal avocation within these areas.  So far as the administrative difficulties are concerned, defining and protecting those areas, that seems to me to be absolutely insuperable without the creation of a vast number of officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not going into that question now.  The Minister is very apt for efficiency, and he saddled the country with £60,000 or £70,000 a few months ago for the salaries of officials.  If there was economy in the numbers of officials and not in salaries he would have an easier life.  I do not see how he is going to administer the exempted areas and to keep the lorry owners within these areas without creating another host of officials who will be quartered on the country and paid out of its attenuated resources, whereas if there were no exempted areas no difficulty of that kind would arise.</P>

      <P>The opportunity will have arrived if Fianna Fáil can quarter its supporters in the Guards when the Bill comes into operation, because the number of Guards will have to be increased very considerably if the administration of the exempted areas around these towns is to be effectively enforced.  To-day the Minister had another astonishing reason for the exempted areas, as he believes that the railway company have some Machiavellian intention of destroying certain of the ports.</P>

      <P>Unless these exempted areas were agreeable.  That reason for the exempted areas was never mentioned on the Committee Stage. The Minister advanced one reason after another.  I suggested that his worst reason was worth minus four, and that his best reason was worth nothing at all.  He has been driven from pillar to post.  Every argument he put up for the exempted areas was knocked down but he advanced and produced more.  The last was the most futile of them, because the Minister has ample powers in the Bill.  If the railway company attempted at any time to reduce services to any particular port the Minister has the right to interfere, saying that the service is inadequate, and that unless they were prepared to serve that port he would authorise someone else to do so.  I believe that, no matter what the money value of the traffic passing within these areas.  It might mean indirect injury to the railway company by the kind of competition they will have to face here.  I believe it will be disastrous and will jeopardise the whole purport of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it hard to believe that the railway company is not prepared to undertake the traffic in these exempted areas, and to give adequate services, because, as Deputy Mulcahy mentioned, we hope the railway company, in order <Col N="65" /> to derive the advantages that this legislation is supposed to confer on them, will give adequate services, not only in places like Dublin, where it is easy to do so, but in places like Donegal, where it will be comparatively difficult.  If the railway company is going to shirk, as the Minister suggested, the obligation to give adequate services within the exempted areas, and is indifferent whether they are exempted or not, it augurs ill for the remote areas where the transport problem will be more complicated.  I do not believe that responsible railway men, if they examine the question <Col N="66" /> fully, will consent to the proposition that these exempted areas should remain, and I am convinced that unless Deputy Davin's amendment is accepted, and the exempted areas done away with, this legislation will fail, and the whole structure we are hoping to build, of virtual monopoly with reasonable obligations on the railway company, will collapse as a result of the competition and of the chaos which must inevitably supervene, as far as the exempted areas are concerned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, Section 11 (4), to delete all words from and including the words &ldquo;the Minister,&rdquo; line 41, to the end of sub-section and substitute the following words&mdash;&ldquo;the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if the Minister is satisfied that the existing merchandise road transport facilities in such area are inadequate, he shall request such authorised (merchandise carrying) company, as he may select, to provide within such time as he may fix adequate merchandise road transport facilities in such area;</P>
      <P>(b)  if the said authorised (merchandise carrying) company does not within the said time provide merchandise road transport facilities which are, in the opinion of the Minister, adequate for such area, the Minister may, if he considers it desirable in the public interest so to do, grant such licence to such person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>During the course of the discussion on the Committee Stage it was suggested by, I think, Deputy McGilligan that paragraph (b) of sub-section (4) should be amended by the insertion of the words &ldquo;and undertakes&rdquo; so that the paragraph would read: &ldquo;(b) no authorised (merchandise carrying) company is willing to undertake and undertakes the supply of adequate merchandise road transport facilities in such area, and.&rdquo; This amendment is designed to give effect to that idea.  It was not possible to do it with the economy of words the Deputy suggested, but the idea is precisely the same even though it involves the insertion of a two-paragraph amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9 to delete Section 14, lines 3 to 5, and substitute the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  It shall be an obligation on every licensee under a merchandise licence to whom merchandise of a class specified in such licence is offered for carriage between any two places within the area specified in such licence to accept such merchandise for carriage for a reasonable reward between such two places.</P>
      <P>(2)  If any licensee under a merchandise licence refuses to comply with the obligation imposed on him by this section, such licensee shall, unless he satisfies the court that such refusal was in the circumstances reasonable, be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds.</P>
      <P>The exact application of the term &ldquo;common carrier&rdquo; to a person holding a merchandise licence is a matter of some doubt and in any event I think it is better that we should place a clear obligation on such persons in the manner in which the amendment proposes. Section 15 imposes certain obligations and conditions on the licensee, and this section, which it is proposed to substitute for Section 14 in the Bill, merely requires him to accept for carriage any merchandise of the kind he is licensed to carry between any two places in the area in which he is to carry on business.  It makes the matter quite clear and side-steps certain difficulties and legal doubts that might have arisen as to the applicability of the term &ldquo;common carrier&rdquo; to a merchandise licensee.</P>

      <P>The amendment may side-step certain difficulties that the Minister may have in mind but this brings us back to the question of what is a definition of the word &ldquo;area&rdquo; in Section 13 and what obligations a licensee takes on himself when he takes out a licence in respect of the carriage of different classes of merchandise in some area which is a rural area.  The question arose here before as to whether farmers in rural and other areas were to have facilities and it was pointed out that farmers at the present moment were able to get transport as far as their houses even if the houses were some distance away from what were the normal traffic routes.  This section raises the question of what are the routes in an area in respect of which the licensee will take upon himself responsibility for dealing with merchandise traffic. From the discussion that went on here before, I feel that there is considerable difficulty in regard to this question, and I would like to know if the Minister has given any consideration to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was before the House in Committee I drew the attention of the Minister to the implications of using the expression &ldquo;common carrier.&rdquo; I pointed out to him on that occasion that that not only placed an obligation upon the licensee to accept for carriage such goods as were offered to him and were mentioned in his classification but also made the carrier liable as an insurer of the goods. The Minister, with characteristic recklessness, proceeds to surmount that by drafting a new sub-section and abolishing the words &ldquo;common carrier.&rdquo; Now, as a matter of fact, this whole doctrine of the common carrier has grown up through the operation of the common law, and is based on an enormous volume of judicial decisions by which the courts are now guided.  I suggested, and I think on that occasion Deputy McGilligan supported me in suggesting, to the Minister that it might be more prudent to retain the term &ldquo;common carrier&rdquo; and to add some words that would not impose on such <Col N="70" /> licensee any liability for such merchandise as he may accept for carriage.  That would have done away with the owner's obligations of insurer which the term &ldquo;common carrier&rdquo; implied and at the same time it would have preserved the liability of this class of carrier to take as common carrier merchandise that was tendered to him and to take it in conformity with the well-established precedents that have been laid down by common law judges during the last 50 or 60 years.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of this amendment says:</P>
      <P>It shall be an obligation on every licensee under a merchandise licence to whom merchandise of a class specified in such licence is offered for such carriage between any two places within the area specified by such licence to accept such merchandise for carriage for a reasonable reward between such two places.</P>
      <P>It is frightfully difficult on taking up a sub-section of that kind and studying it, to be sure that it will not be interpreted in the law courts in some entirely unexpected way. Peculiar cases might arise with which that sub-section will not be adequate to deal at all, whereas if you preserved the term &ldquo;common carrier&rdquo;, subject to the limitation with reference to the liability as insurer, you would have a guarantee that the common law, acting in the light experience has defined and circumscribed to meet varying circumstances that have arisen, from time to time as the transport trade has developed, would have an elastic degree of liability which the common law courts would keep up to date with the changing circumstances that might arise.  Where, however, you have a statutory liability imposed in a specific way this elasticity vanishes and the courts are bound by the words of the statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At first glance I can see nothing in that sub-section which may give rise to trouble except perhaps this, that if a man is licensed to carry under this Act and says that he is prepared to carry potatoes&mdash;that is one of the items in the Schedule&mdash;what is to prevent me, living seven miles away <Col N="71" /> from that carrier saying &ldquo;I want to send potatoes to the next parish at the rates you quote, say, 1 cwt. of potatoes&rdquo;?  Does that section put upon the carrier an obligation to drive his lorry out seven miles to take 1 cwt. of potatoes, deliver it within his area and come back again?  Is it the intention of the Minister to impose such a liability?  The only ground on which the carrier can escape liability is &ldquo;unless he satisfies the court that such refusal was, in the circumstances, reasonable.&rdquo; Surely that is deliberately shirking an issue with which we ought to deal. We have undertaken to define this carrier's duty by statute, but we are passing it over to the court to say whether his refusal to carry any specific consignment was reasonable or not.  We do not seem to lay down here at all any definite obligation, but say that a man is entitled to refuse to go and collect anything less than a load which shall be a load representing the capacity of his lorry. That man will be discharged from the obligation of taking very small loads as a common carrier.  I think before we accept this amendment, the Minister should tell us clearly what is the position of a licensed carrier who is asked to go a distance to take a very small load.  Is he obliged to go for it, and will he render himself liable to penalties if he does not? If he asks, for his own protection, an exorbitant fee to carry it, does he render himself liable to any penalty under the Act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of Deputy Mulcahy's question, the section, as amended, would impose on the licensee an obligation to carry goods by road in any part of the area where it would be legal to do so, subject to that overriding provision that he may reasonably refuse.  He can avoid a penalty being inflicted on him if he satisfies the court that his refusal was a reasonable refusal in all the circumstances.  Certain routes may be closed to vehicles of the particular kind he owns and operates or there may be other legal barriers and, of course, he is not <Col N="72" /> required by this section to act in contravention of any other statute in that connection, but, as he is licensed to carry goods in a particular area, he must be available for the carriage of those goods between any two points in that area.  That, I think, answers Deputy Dillon's second point, too.  He must do it.  That is the obligation he undertakes in return for the concession that is given to him.  For the licence which gives him the right to carry on that business he is required to provide that facility in the area, bearing in mind that he himself fixes the area and also fixes the class of goods in respect of which the obligation rests on him.</P>
      <P>He is, under Section 15, required not to give unreasonable preference to any person, and if he quotes one rate for one person in respect of a particular class of goods he must quote the same rate for carrying the same goods under the same circumstances to other persons.  As regards the suggestion of the Deputy that we should retain the term &ldquo;common carrier,&rdquo; but attempt to modify it or to modify its application, I cannot see any advantage in that.  I mentioned on Committee Stage that one of the difficulties, if not the chief difficulty, that had arisen out of the insertion of that term in the Bill was the fact that it applied heretofore to persons carrying merchandise over defined routes.  We are not proposing to license persons under this Bill in respect of routes. We are proposing to license them in respect of areas, and it is not at all sure that the term is applicable to such persons or that, if we retained the term, we would not have to attempt to define some system of licensing persons in respect of routes.  In any event the main things we want to insist on are covered by Section 14, as it will be amended, and Section 15, and this obligation to carry the goods, and to carry them except there is reasonable cause for not doing so, and the obligation to give no undue preference as between one person and another, and, if we have provided for those things, I do not think there is any necessity to attempt to go outside unless a clear necessity for doing so is demonstrated.</P>

      <P>I know that we are not in Committee, but a point arises which the Minister has not noticed.  This says &ldquo;offer for carriage.&rdquo; The obligation of a common carrier was never placed on the railway companies in the extremest day except for merchandise delivered at their depot for carriage.  It was never suggested that, if one offered a parcel to the railway company, the company should be compelled by law to go out and fetch it and dispatch it from their railhead.  I am submitting that this sub-section places an obligation on the carrier not only to take the merchandise left in at his depot for dispatch, but if you say &ldquo;I have a parcel,&rdquo; he is bound to come and fetch it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  I do not think it can be regarded as a contentious measure.  It was prepared almost entirely by my predecessor and was in a very advanced stage in the Department when I took up office. Certain difficulties arose which necessitated consultation with other Departments, and a re-examination of the measure and that caused the delay.  It is only now that the Bill finds its way into the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The foreshore of the Saorstát is, generally speaking, the property of the State, and the control and management of the foreshore are in the hands of the Department of Industry and Commerce. Certain portions of the foreshore belong to the lords of the manor but they are very limited.  The boundary line between the property of the State and that of adjoining landholders is generally high water mark at ordinary or medium tides.  Prior to the establishment of the Saorstát, the foreshore was administered under the State Lands Act of 1924.  Early in 1923, the Government were advised that in consequence of Article 11 of the Constitution it would be necessary to have new legislation to regulate and control the administration of the foreshore.  The opinion was held that the State Lands Act of 1924 did not supply the need for legislation for foreshore purposes. Consequently, after a considerable period of examination, this measure finds itself on the Order Paper of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is designed to enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give permission, by licence, for the removal of any beach material from the State-owned foreshore.  Hitherto, except in cases where certain rights existed, by reason of Article 11 of the Constitution, removal of material from the foreshore could not be sanctioned. This Bill is intended to remove that disability and, consequently, it enables the Minister to give a licence of foreshore where, in the public interest, it should be given, either for useful public works or private works.  It also gives power to control the erection of such <Col N="78" /> works and provides for the maintenance of new works as well as those existing there already.  The Bill also enables the Minister to give licences for the laying of cables, sewers or drains or the erection of such similar works as could only be provided before under the State Lands Act of 1924, which was a very cumbersome procedure, and caused very serious delay.  The Bill gives power to prohibit the removal of beach material from any part of the foreshore where it might injure property by reason of the denuding of the shore of natural protection against the sea.  It also authorises control of defence works on the foreshore belonging or not belonging to the State.  It has been found by experience that such works were often placed in such a position as to divert the natural deposit of sand or gravel and thereby cause the neighbouring section of the shore to be subject to erosion.  It also empowers the Minister to preserve the amenities of the foreshore for bathing and wading and sun bathing, by prohibiting the deposit of any substance which might be injurious to the public or the placing of any objectionable material in such a position as would be injurious or offensive to any person.  There is provision for the preservation of the State title to any article on the foreshore that might come in there.  There is power to regulate the public use of the foreshore and to purchase and take on lease foreshore not belonging to the State.</P>
    <P>These are the main sections of the Bill and, as I have said, it is a non-contentious measure.  It is necessary because of the dearth of regulations provided for some of these things and the cumbersome nature of the existing regulation in relation to others. Deputies interested in these matters will, no doubt, have acquainted themselves with the report of the Committee that considered the question of coast erosion in which references to these amenities and the legislation necessary were made.  I do not think it is necessary to say anything further at this stage.  The Bill is hardly one for Second Reading discussion.  Any points that will arise will be better discussed on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I quite agree there is not much to discuss on this measure at the present moment but there is one point I should like to make.  The Minister says the Bill deals in some measure with the question of the amenities of the foreshore, bathing and so on.  I doubt whether that part of the Bill deals with the matter in a satisfactory way.  In Section 8, the Minister takes certain powers if and when he is of opinion that the entry of the public on or the use by the public of any particular area of foreshore belonging to Saorstát Eireann ought in the public interest to be prohibited, restricted, regulated or controlled.  I feel that, when we come to discuss the measure in Committee a clause analogous to that, but extending it to deal with the amenities that may be necessary should be inserted.  It should provide that whenever the Minister is of opinion that entry by the public on, or use by the public of any particular area of foreshore, whether belonging to Saorstát Eireann or not, is desirable in the public interest for purposes of recreation, the Minister might make an order under regulation analogous to those he proposes to take power under this section to take, giving power to the public to make use of the foreshore for these purposes. In connection with that, there should, I think, also be embodied in the Bill power to the Minister to make an order empowering the local bodies, after suitable inquiries, to give access, whether by road or path, to the foreshore for recreationary purposes. There are parts of the country where very serious complaint arises that people are prevented from going to the foreshore or getting access to it without having to pay a fine of 1/- or something like that for passing through some person's field.  I think the proposal could be properly enshrined in this Bill as an extension of the Minister's proposal for dealing properly with the amenities of the foreshore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the debate on the Education Estimates this year has not been quite so full as on previous occasions, we have no reason to complain that the different aspects of educational administration have not received attention from one or other of the Deputies who have spoken.  It is noticeable that not alone does the administration of the Education Department now come under survey in the Dáil when the Estimates are under consideration, but there seems to be also a tendency to charge the Education Office with the general task of the revival of the Irish language.  I would remind those Deputies who asked us in the Department of Education to prepare statements <Col N="82" /> for their information and to let the country know generally what is the position in regard to the language revival, what are the hopes of success, and what is the measure of progress that is being achieved, that our work is confined solely to the work that is being carried out in the schools and, as far as the work of reviving the Irish language through the schools is concerned, we endeavour to give the fullest possible information in the annual report issued by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the language in the life of the country, it is the general policy of the Government to endeavour to develop and extend the use of the language through the Government Departments and through the machinery of government generally; but I do not think that it can be held to be my province to deal with that aspect of the situation here any more than to deal with the general question of the revival of the language, and the problems arising from it, outside the schools.  I should like to say in this connection that, being keenly interested in the revival of the language, I feel that the friends of the language and those who are anxious for its success and for its ultimate revival as the spoken language&mdash;or as a spoken language&mdash;throughout the length and breadth of this State, are apt to place too much reliance upon, and to expect too much from the work in the schools.  While the work in the schools is slowly and surely progressing, we must remember that the natural forces that are at work outside are detrimental to the growth of the language.  In my opinion, the difficulties surrounding the revival of the language outside are growing, because of the influences of the film, and of the Press.  Every influence practically is naturally working against the language with the result that at present, so far as the spoken tongue is concerned, it is confined to a few small areas along the western sea-coast.  I should like to issue, therefore, a word of warning and of friendly advice to the friends of the language and to those in this House who asked that I should endeavour to extend the scope <Col N="83" /> of the work of the Department, and to ask them to agree with me when I say that the work of the State of itself, no matter how thorough or how intensive it may be in the schools, will not be sufficient to bring about such a revival of the language in the near future as we should all like unless it is accompanied by evidence of a strong movement outside which will endeavour to popularise the use of the language and to carry out the necessary propaganda and the necessary organisation and effort amongst the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon again raised the question of the teaching of subjects through Irish.  Even in certain cases, apparently, Deputy Dillon objects to the teaching of even one subject through Irish.  Last year, I went into this subject at some length, and if I trespass, perhaps, upon the feelings of the Dáil in seeming to re-open a question that, I think, has been settled many years ago and that is the general Government policy, both as regards the present Government and as regards our predecessors, with reference to this matter of Irish in the schools, it is simply to try to clear away some misunderstandings that Deputy Dillon, I think, still has in his mind.  Whether these misunderstandings have arisen through the false reports and rumours that have been in circulation in this country for many years past, under which an impression has been sought to be created that unnecessary pressure is being exerted and that something quite unnecessary and quite wrong is being done in connection with this campaign for Irish in the schools&mdash;whether Deputy Dillon's misunderstandings have arisen from reading certain organs of the press or whether they arise from his own personal experience, I do not know; but last year I asked the Deputy to try to let us have definite information, definite evidence, to support the contentions that he made that the Irish programme, as I understood, was definitely doing harm to education in the schools, that the quality of the Irish was not up to the <Col N="84" /> standard that we had a right to expect and that in fact the standard of education generally was suffering as a result of our efforts in the schools.  I asked him to produce definite evidence in support of these statements but I received no substantiation from him. This year he has returned to the subject and in order to make the matter quite clear to the Deputy and to others who may not be conversant with the origin of the present school programme, I think it would be no harm to run over the matter again.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1922, under what was known as the old Dáil, a National Programme Conference was called together composed of representatives of the Department of Education in the old Dáil, the General Council of County Councils, the National Labour Executive, the Gaelic League, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and the Association of Secondary Teachers.  This Conference had the assistance of expert advice, including that of the Reverend Dr. Corcoran, Professor of Education in University College, Dublin.  The Conference prepared a new programme which included a recommendation that each pupil should receive instruction in Irish for at least one hour a day as an ordinary subject and subject to the teachers being qualified in Irish.</P>
    <P>The programme also contained the following provisions: that the work in the infant standards is to be entirely in Irish; that instruction in singing is to be given through the medium of Irish; that songs are to be in the Irish language; and, in the programme for history and geography, that instruction in the history and geography of Ireland is to be given through the medium of Irish.  This programme was accepted by the then Minister for Education, Mr. J.J. O'Kelly, and on the setting up of the Provisional Government the programme was issued for use in National Schools under the authority of Fionán O Loingsigh, the then Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>In order to enable the teachers gradually to put this programme into <Col N="85" /> operation Irish courses were set up all over the country for the teachers and these continued for seven years. In order, however, that the position of the programme generally and the teaching in and through the medium of Irish in accordance therewith be fully considered, the second Programme Conference was called together in 1925, to consider the suitability of the national programme of primary instruction in operation in National Schools, to report to the Minister for Education thereon, and to make recommendations to him as regards any alterations which might seem desirable.  The Programme Conference reported in March, 1926 and the programme recommended by them was adopted by the Minister and put into operation as from 1st July, 1926.</P>
    <P>This Programme Conference, representative of managers, teachers, county councillors, the Gaelic League, Deputies, Senators and educational representatives of various kinds, including representatives of the Department, recommended a revised programme which was then adopted by the Minister and is at present in use.  In the memorandum in connection with the introduction of the programme the Conference made the following remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;One of the leading characteristics of that programme is its insistence on the principle of teaching the infant classes through the medium of Irish.  The members of our conference agreed on the supreme importance of giving effect, as far as possible, to this principle and in confirmation of their belief they received authoritative evidence.  It was argued with much weight that the &lsquo;direct&rsquo; method of teaching Irish, continued during the length of an ordinary school day for a few years between the ages of four and eight years, would be quite sufficient, given trained and fluent teachers, to impart to children a vernacular power over the language, while, in the case of older children, it was shown that such a result would be more difficult of attainment.  The members of the Conference were, therefore, at one in holding that the true and only method of establishing <Col N="86" /> Irish as the vernacular is the effective teaching of it to the infants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to the programme itself, it provided that the work in the infant classes between the hours of 10.30 and 2 is to be entirely in Irish, where the teachers are sufficiently qualified.  All teachers are regarded as sufficiently qualified who hold bi-lingual or higher certificates, but the possession of such certificates is not regarded as an essential qualification.  It is expected the use of Irish for infant teaching will be gradually extended until the stage is reached when in all schools the work of the infant classes will be done entirely in Irish.  Speaking generally, therefore, the intention when the present programme was put into operation in 1926 was that a good groundwork of Irish should be given to the infants where this was possible, where the teachers were sufficiently qualified to do it, and that, gradually, the use of Irish should be extended in the schools until it was gradually extended to other standards.</P>
    <P>In the statements that have been made in which fault was found with the teaching of Irish in the schools it has not been made clear whether it is the programme that is said to be at fault or the teachers themselves. As regards the teachers, I would like to say that, generally speaking, the Department of Education are satisfied with the efforts the teachers have made to equip themselves fully for the task of teaching other subjects through the medium of Irish.  We have at the present time some 14,000 teachers of all kinds employed in national schools.  Of this number, over 6,000 have either the bi-lingual certificate or a higher certificate so that it may be said of that number that they are competent to give instruction through the medium of Irish.  With regard to the other 8,000 teachers, about 5,000 of them have the ordinary certificate for teaching Irish and a considerable number of that 5,000, if not the whole of them, have a fluent knowledge of the Irish language, so that as regards that 5,000 we can say that they have certain qualifications in regard to the teaching of Irish and <Col N="87" /> the speaking of it.  That means that out of the 14,000 teachers we have 6,000 who have the bi-lingual or higher certificate, while we have a further 5,000 who have a fairly good knowledge of Irish.  At least three-fourths of the teachers can be regarded as having reasonable qualifications in Irish.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that some pressure is being exercised by the Department, that we are driving the teachers and the schools into doing more than they really can accomplish. There is no foundation whatever for that suggestion.  So far as I am aware, no penal action has ever been taken with regard to teachers.  A definite provision was made whereby teachers beyond a certain age were left free from the obligation of making themselves efficient to teach through the medium of Irish.  As regards the remainder of the teachers, the figures I have read show that the vast bulk of them are taking steps to acquire the certificates that the Department considers necessary.  It cannot be suggested that so far as the teaching body is concerned it is not doing reasonable and fairly satisfactory work to carry out the programme.</P>
    <P>In the actual programme itself, which I will ask Deputy Dillon or any other Deputy who is interested to read, stress is definitely laid on the fact that while it is our ultimate object to teach all subjects through the medium of Irish, and while we think a definite beginning, a serious and intensive beginning, should be made with regard to children between the ages of four and eight years, the Programme Conference laid it down quite definitely, as practical advice to the teachers, that they should go slowly, and that the teachers who are not capable of doing the work through Irish should simply continue to do it in English.  Even so recently as two years ago the Department of Education issued a further circular to managers and teachers on the question of the teaching through the medium of Irish in which it was stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" />&ldquo;The intention of the programme is that all schools should do their part in reviving the language as a spoken tongue by giving teachers such a mastery of Irish as will go a long way towards securing that revival.  The use of Irish as the medium of instruction will do more than increase the pupils' oral grasp of the language.  It will convince them that the Irish language is a living speech capable of adjusting itself to the needs of modern life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the same time in that circular the Department issued a definite warning in the following words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The schools would, however, be jeopardised by premature attempts to use Irish in unsuitable conditions, and the programme therefore requires a sufficient oral knowledge from both teacher and pupils before the attempt is made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that disposes of the idea that the Department has taken unusual or unnecessary steps to force the position in regard to Irish.  But we feel committed to the task of reviving Irish in the schools, and of making it ultimately the spoken language there.  Consistent with that the Department have used every possible discretion and have been, I think, very reasonable in view of the enormous obstacles and propaganda that have been made and are still being made against the revival of Irish.  The surprising thing to me is that so much progress has been made in all the circumstances.  I think all these concerned in the educational administration have reason to congratulate themselves on having progressed so far.  I trust, therefore, that if statements have been made by persons who, one must assume, speak with a certain amount of responsibility, that the language that has been taught as Irish in the schools cannot be understood by the old people, that the old people laugh at the children who speak it, and further, that Irish is being taught in the schools without reference to the capacity of the children to understand it or to the capacity of the teacher to teach, that such unreasonable statements will not be made in future.</P>

      <P>It is not my job to answer silly criticism and, in future, I will not regard it as my duty to do so. The Deputy stressed the need for concentrating our efforts on the Fior-Ghaeltacht areas.  We are endeavouring, as far as possible, to get Irish-speaking students into our preparatory colleges and into our training colleges.  We are endeavouring to get native Irish-speaking students and as far as possible we shall endeavour to get a larger percentage as time goes on.  I would like, however, to remind the Deputy that we have a definite limitation in regard to the type of student that we regard as a Fior-Ghaeltacht student.  Such students must come from an Irish-speaking home; must attend school in what is known as a Fior-Ghaeltacht area and in that school all the work must be carried out through the medium of Irish.  If these conditions are not fulfilled in regard to the student he does not get the advantages which the Department specifically allows for students from Fior-Ghaeltacht areas.  I would be very glad now to go further and try to extend some such system of scholarships and inducements not alone to the Fior-Ghaeltacht areas but to give further inducements where we can extend them in the Breac-Ghaeltacht and adjoining areas where, though the Irish language is not the prevailing tongue, the old people still have a good command of it and where it is obvious that if the Government could take steps to induce people to use it more than they are doing a great step forward would be taken and a barrier would be erected around the Fior-Ghaeltacht area protecting it from the ravages of Anglicisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there are financial limits to Government action even short of giving grants to each Irish-speaking household and to giving scholarships pretty extensively <Col N="90" /> to a large area of the country&mdash; because the Breac-Ghaeltacht embraces practically the whole of several counties. But to do that would necessitate a very large expenditure and in present circumstances and with the present need for economy I do not see any possibility of having it done.  But with the facilities and inducements that we are giving at present I am satisfied that they have led to a very substantial increase in the use of Irish.  The people in the Fior-Ghaeltacht areas see the advantage of sending their children to Irish schools and of using Irish themselves. They get certain advantages from us for doing that when they send their children up for scholarships.  That has led to a very wide extension and a great demand for further facilities.  But at present we do well to stick to our original conditions&mdash;that the area must be an Irish-speaking area, that the children must come from an Irish-speaking household and that the work of the school must be done in Irish.  If the financial situation should improve, and if it is possible to extend the system of scholarships to what is called the Breac-Ghaeltacht, Deputies can rest assured that so far as I am concerned I shall do everything in my power to bring about that end.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also referred to the question of central schools or what is known in the Department of Education as the amalgamation of schools.  When surveying the Education Estimates Deputies must have noticed that a very substantial portion of the expenditure relates to salaries.  The rest of the money is chiefly spent on administration. But those who have been good enough to interest themselves in the Education Estimates and in the different items have occasionally suggested: &ldquo;Why not unite and bring together several schools in these sparsely populated rural areas, link them up together and have one central school instead?  That will mean less staff, the bringing of the children into one central school and that will undoubtedly bring about a great saving.&rdquo; That is in the view of some people a very obvious way of bringing about economy.  But unfortunately there is a very definite limitation to <Col N="91" /> the progress that can be made in this field of amalgamation.  The Department has been carrying it out for many years.  Before 1928, where vacancies occurred in schools which were either adjoining or in proximity to each other, advantage was taken, where the attendance had fallen below thirty, to amalgamate two schools.  Later, this was carried further and, where the attendance had fallen below forty and where vacancies occurred, the policy of amalgamation was carried out.  In fact, the Department did not wait for the retirement of the principal teachers, in the long run, and it extended the principle of redundancy to the cases of junior assistant mistresses.  That is to say, where schools were amalgamated, the junior assistant would up to then have been considered redundant; under the conditions of amalgamation, the junior assistant was kept on until a vacancy occurred in some neighbouring school to which she might be transferred.</P>
    <P>The result of this policy of amalgamation was that there was a fairly substantial reduction in the number of schools.  I find that in the year 1926-27 there were 5,641 schools in operation.  The number fell in each year following, up to 1931-32, when we had almost 300 fewer schools than we had in 1926-27.  If I am asked why we do not carry this policy further, it will be necessary for me to explain that our schools in rural areas are under the control of the parish priests as managers.  It is obvious that if amalgamation is to be brought about, it must be brought about in the same parish.  There would be difficulty, as Deputies will recognise, if schools in certain parishes were abolished and the pupils transferred to adjoining parishes.  Even if we get over the fact that the parish is the unit for our schools and that the parish priest is manager, we have the question as to whether by abolishing a school we are going to have a saving.  The cases in which amalgamation was brought about were carefully considered, and the Department satisfied itself that undoubted economy could be effected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> Our experience in the running of van services is that whereas it may be satisfactory and economical to run a van service to convey children to another area, for fairly large numbers of children&mdash;for example thirty&mdash;transport would be definitely uneconomic. In addition to that, if we carry the principle much further, we would probably be regarded as definitely reducing the number of rural schools and compelling children to go into the towns and cities.  In mountainous and isolated districts special transport facilities have to be provided, and there is great difficulty in picking up children at widely separated points.  In some of these mountainous and isolated districts there is great difficulty, with the kind of roads we have, in arranging proper transport.  I should be very glad indeed to seek to bring about further economies by amalgamation of schools, but I think that the managers and the public generally would probably have the feeling that we were going to undue lengths if we tried to go farther.  There would also be a question as to whether it was economical.  My information is that the principle of amalgamation has been carried about as far as it can be carried under ordinary circumstances. I shall be only too pleased if Deputies come to me and show me cases where definite economies can be effected in the staffing of schools by the transfer of pupils to other areas.  I should like to tell them that, before doing that, they will have to consult the local managers and they would be well advised to consult the bishop of the diocese.  If they can get them to agree to the establishment of large central schools, then I shall be very glad to go into the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy suggested that we should have a special inspectorate in connection with the Gaeltacht.  I think that what the Deputy means is that we should have an additional inspectorate &mdash;a further body of inspectors to pay special attention to the Gaeltacht areas.  I cannot see any hope, under present financial circumstances, of getting a special staff of inspectors but I am taking steps to have special investigations made in regard to the <Col N="93" /> Fior-Ghaeltacht schools.  I am endeavouring, so far as possible, to see that the Irish language will be used increasingly as time goes on as the medium of instruction in these Fior-Ghaeltacht areas.  It is rather sad that so many of the schools in the really Irish-speaking districts are still mediums for the propagation of the English language but we must realise that the teachers, in certain cases, are not being asked by us, in view of their age, to acquire the qualifications that are necessary.  In the course of time, we expect that the use of Irish in these areas will increase. We expect, furthermore, to have a body of teachers coming out of our training colleges who will be specially equipped for instruction through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill quoted the late Dr. O'Hickey.  I cannot see what the purpose is in quoting what Dr. O'Hickey said in entirely different circumstances and trying to work it into what might be regarded as disapproval of the present programme of Irish in the schools. This policy has been definitely accepted.  This policy is being carried out and, so far as this Government is concerned, there is no going back.  But if Deputies have definite grievances or definite cases, where they can allege harsh treatment has been meted out or that unreasonable things are being done, let them bring the facts before our notice.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any body of educationists would accept the proposal that Deputy Anthony seemed to put up to us, that because the parents at home were unable to correct and improve the children's exercises in Irish presumably we should give up the teaching of Irish.  As &ldquo;Dublin Opinion&rdquo; suggested, if we were to teach in the schools only the subjects which the parents in certain cases were able to correct and to instruct their children in, our curriculum might be very peculiar, very limited or very one-sided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also referred to the question of industrial schools.  I pointed out to him that under the law as it stands at present it is quite true that children can be committed by the justices to industrial schools for failure <Col N="94" /> to attend school.  The number of children, however, who have been committed in connection with breaches of the School Attendance Act is very small indeed.  I think only six per cent. of the total number committed last year were committed in connection with breaches of the Act and in the previous year only five per cent.  The vast bulk of the children are committed for destitution. In the Department of Education we are not satisfied with the state of affairs.  We think that perhaps too many children are being committed to these schools.  But, on the other hand, I must assume, and in fact I know from some of the cases that have come before me, that the consideration is not the mere technical breach of the School Attendance Act; that the consideration is the child's general circumstances, his home circumstances, whether the home environment is suitable, whether the boy or girl is likely to grow up there honestly, be looked after, be well and properly nourished, be kept clean and given a decent education.  In fact, the industrial schools at present seem to me to be more or less in the nature of free schools for destitute children whose parents are not considered fit persons to have the custody of the children. The schools are provided for the education and industrial training of these children.  At the same time, when we consider the large number of committals and the very large number of children that we have in these schools, we are tempted to ask whether perhaps we are not making too much allowance for the parents; whether we should not endeavour to make the parents aware of their responsibilities to their children; whether we should not make these parents, who are too thriftless or too lazy to look after their children but who hand them over to the State, realise their duties.  I wish there could be more of that and I wish that some action might be taken against those parents who, we know, are very often in employment and who can look after their children.  If we are going to accept the principle of taking every child which can be described as destitute, and whose parents are either incapable or do not take the responsibility of looking after their children, we are, of course, going to have a very <Col N="95" /> large population in our industrial schools.  But I would like the other side of the question to be examined and that is, whether sometimes parents should not be reminded of their duty and compelled to carry out their duty, like other citizens, to their children.</P>
    <P>Deputy Breathnach has called attention and so have other Deputies, I think, to the need for an advisory council in education.  That is an old topic.  The Minister is asked to state the reasons why this advisory council on education is not brought into being.  It would be more fitting and more relevant if it were explained to the Minister why such a council is necessary.  What problems that are not being examined already by the Department of Education is it thought this council on education should examine?  In what way is it considered that the advisory council of people selected <i>ad hoc</i> from outside are going to improve the administration of education?  As regards the general problems affecting education every Deputy, for example, is at perfect liberty on an occasion like this to make suggestions to the Minister and to tell him how he thinks in certain ways the administration might be improved.  That is in fact what the House is doing at present.  It might be regarded as a council on education. We are discussing our expenditure for the coming year and if Deputies can show how things can be done better, how better results might be achieved, they, as the representatives of the people, have a very primary responsibility in bringing their minds to bear on the educational problems.  Then again Deputies have certain responsibilities. What a Deputy says in the House he must, I hope, stand by.  He will have to argue his case and so on. But if I were to bring together an advisory council of persons outside, bring them into my office, I fear that instead of improving matters and helping me they would rather be an obstacle.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is made, for example, that parents are not sufficiently represented in connection with educational matters.  Parents have their Deputies. Parents have direct access to the <Col N="96" /> Ministry.  The programme at present being taught in the schools is the outcome of a conference on which most of the representatives who sat and who recommended that programme were parents themselves.  There is nothing whatever to prevent parents or bodies of parents from making their views known to the Education Office any time on any matters affecting them. But I fear that such a council, even if it were established with the best will in the world, with a general roving commission to wander at large over the field of education and to make suggestions, would not be really effective.  They would have no responsibility in regard to expenditure, for example.  The Minister and the House have responsibility in regard to educational expenditure. They know that the things that the Minister can do, or can be asked to do, are definitely limited by the amount of money provided.  A body of that kind could make all kinds of suggestions, carry on a correspondence in the Press to the delight of the newspapermen and to the readers of the newspapers, make quips and jokes about the school programme, and even make a jest of the whole thing, if they were so minded. They would have no responsibility in regard to expenditure.  With regard to administration, if they were to be allowed to make recommendations as to the duties of the officers or as to the policy of the Department, and if the Minister did not happen to agree, we would have a very disedifying spectacle indeed, and one which could not possibly lead to any good.</P>

      <P>We had not in mind any quips or jokes.  We had in mind a body of Irish Irelanders who have Irish education very much at heart and I am surprised that the Minister should make a remark of that kind suggesting that they are turned into a body of jesters.</P>

      <P>We see jests in the Press at the teaching of physical training and of Irish dancing in the schools, and I suppose they emanate from some person who would call himself an <Col N="97" /> educational expert interested in Gaelicisation and so on.  In fact, those who are interested in the Gaelicisation movement have the fullest possible access to the officers of my Department at all times, and we are only too glad and too happy to have their co-operation.  There are many things which we would like to do to further help Gaelicisation, but we cannot do everything that is suggested. There are definite limitations upon us.  I should be very glad indeed if those associations or those individuals outside who are good enough to interest themselves in Irish education, and in the Gaelicisation movement, would occasionally see what could be done by voluntary effort, and not ask the Minister for Education to provide prizes for this Feis or that Feis; not ask the Minister to provide a fund for every play that is to be produced in Irish in this country; not ask the Minister to provide money for every piece of Irish that appears in the Press in the Irish speaking areas, but do these little things themselves and give good example. They would find that it would be far more effective and far more valuable.  They would be giving good example and would be feeling that they were doing the work themselves and not depending on the dry and even occasionally slow method of official action.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon referred in the course of his remarks to the vocational education scheme in Donegal, and I would like to remind the Deputy and the House that it is possible to expect too much from the vocational educational scheme throughout the country. The object of vocational education is to provide transitional training, to carry on the ordinary school subjects and provide some method of industrial training for boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 16 years.  We are endeavouring to do that, but it must not be thought that we can turn out from those schools definitely skilled craftsmen and craftswomen or tradesmen. The Labour Deputies, for example&mdash;and I think other Deputies as well&mdash;will realise that we cannot turn out tradesmen from those schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> Tradesmen have to go through a very arduous apprenticeship before they will be recognised by their trades. The most that we can do is to carry on the ordinary continuation subjects, and give some grounding in handiwork, instruction in metal work, or cookery for girls.  That is all we can do.  We have, as I said in my opening statement, made a special provision that wherever there is a factory or an industry started or about to start, if the factory authorities want to improve the industrial training of their apprentices or workers we are prepared to recoup up to three-quarters of the amount expended on that instruction.  That has not been taken advantage of; I wish it had.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Gaeltacht areas I want to stress the fact that I regret very much that we cannot establish industries, and neither can we turn out tradesmen or craftsmen from our vocational schools.  We can only hope to improve the education and to turn the bent of the boy or girl in a definite direction&mdash;towards handiwork, towards becoming ultimately a craftsman in some branch or other of work.  We cannot hope to establish industries or to train the people in those schools in the way that is sometimes suggested.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister leaves that point I want to ask him, as a member of a vocational education committee, do I understand from him that the chief executive officers of the various vocational education committees in Ireland are being made aware of the fact that if and when it is found necessary that some extra expenses must be undertaken in order to provide facilities for those who are establishing factories in this country, for instance hosiery factories, the Minister's Department is prepared to subsidise the various vocational committees by making a grant towards the installation of machinery or plant in order to teach those people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the finances of the vocational education committees would not be sufficiently great to enable them to put in big machinery.  I think the machinery <Col N="99" /> that even the strongest of our vocational education committees could instal would be on a very limited scale indeed.</P>
      <P>The general condition of the schools was referred to by Deputy Anthony. I have only to say that there again, within the financial limits that are imposed upon me, I am endeavouring to provide suitable school accommodation in all parts of the country.  There is a certain difficulty about getting sites in all places, and particularly in the City of Dublin.  There is also the further difficulty of getting the local contribution.  Deputies know that one-third of the money necessary for the provision of a new school has to be provided locally.  In the present state of the country there is great difficulty in getting that money, but within those limitations we are endeavouring to go ahead with the building of schools.  We have made fairly good provision in the present year, under the Board of Works Vote, for the provision of new schools.  I shall always be glad to have the co-operation of Deputies in endeavouring to provide this accommodation, and any other measures that can be taken to provide amenities or recreation or to provide means whereby the health and education of our children can be improved will have the support of the Department and of myself.</P>

In reply to Deputy Dillon I made some reference to the position of industrial schools, and our attitude towards the committal of children.  As regards the curricula of the schools, we have brought about improvements recently, whereby more attention is given to the teaching of ordinary school subjects to the younger children.  We have succeeded in making definite improvements in that connection.  It was suggested that a commission should be set up to go into the whole question of industrial and reformatory schools.  I think I can tell the House definitely that the result of that commission would be to impose heavy liabilities on the State, because, in fact, the managers of the schools are not able to pay the expenses out of what they get from the State and from the local authorities, at the present time.  In fact, they are not paid, and one of the first results, I feel, would be to ask the State to make further very heavy contributions to the maintenance of these schools, or to take them over altogether.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the National Health Insurance Bill, 1933, be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to amend the machinery through which the benefits of persons insured under the National Health Insurance Acts are administered.  Lest there should be any misapprehension in the matter, I would like to make it clear at the outset, that the Bill does not in any way affect the liability of <Col N="103" /> employers and insured persons to pay contributions under the Health Insurance Acts, and that such contributions must continue to be paid in the same manner and under the same conditions as heretofore.  The matters dealt with in the Bill are not new.  They have been the subject of frequent discussion since 1924 when the Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance and Medical Services was appointed.  That committee issued an interim report in 1925 and a final report in 1927.  Most of the recommendations of the committee have since been put into force by the 1929 Act, and the present Bill proposes to give effect to a further and important recommendation&mdash;the unification of approved societies.  The committee said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have come to the conclusion that unification&mdash;if feasible&mdash;affords the best method of simplifying National Health Insurance in the Saorstát and in effecting very considerable economies in the cost of its central administration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;if feasible&rdquo; seem to indicate that the committee had some doubts, which they did not amplify in the report, as to whether unification was possible.  The matter has been given very full and careful consideration by the present Government, and they are satisfied that unification is not only feasible but that it is necessary, and that the present financial condition of a number of societies is such that they cannot continue in existence if the administration of benefits is allowed to continue on its present basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at present in the Saorstát 65 societies, one of which has 18 branches, so that there are in effect 83 separate bodies administering health insurance.  These bodies vary very much in size.  They range in membership from 90 to 90,000.  They also vary very much in character, insured persons being grouped according to trades, skilled and unskilled, professions, religion, temperance, politics, and so forth.  These groupings have no relation to health insurance, and the result has been that the membership of very few societies is representative <Col N="104" /> of the general body of insured persons, and that the whole scheme, instead of being a national scheme, is composed of a number of separate units, differing widely from one another in their experience, as regards the two main factors of insurance, contribution income and sickness experience.</P>
    <P>Those societies which are composed of members with steady employment producing a good contribution income, and with healthy occupations, resulting in a small sickness experience, naturally show much better valuation results than those where employment is uncertain and the conditions of employment detrimental to health. Moreover, the divergence between the two classes of societies tends to become more and more marked as time progresses, and the actual position now is that certain societies will show such large deficiencies at the next valuation, which is due at the end of the current year, that the existing provisions in regard to reserves, the moneys in their own contingencies funds, and in the central fund, will not be sufficient to ensure their solvency.</P>
    <P>There have been three valuations since the inception of the Act, at 31st December, 1918, 1923 and 1928 respectively.  At the 1918 valuation many Irish insured persons were members of British societies and <i>vice versa</i>, and that valuation does not, therefore, give a clear indication of the financial position of the Acts in Ireland.  After the Treaty, however, a clear cut was effected and the valuations at 31st December, 1923, show the position as regards all insured persons in the Free State.</P>
    <P>At the 1923 valuation 72 societies and 20 branches with a membership of 378,821 disclosed a surplus of £626,811.  Seven societies with a membership of 29,213 showed a deficiency of £13,163.  The net surplus was, therefore, £613,648 for a total membership of 407,944.  Of this surplus about £370,000 represented the accumulation with interest of the amount carried forward from the 1918 valuation, and £155,000 represented the net surplus transferred from British <Col N="105" /> societies in respect of their Free State members.  £35,000 represented a margin in Reserve Values created under the National Health Insurance Act, 1920, so that the actual surplus earned in the five years period 1918-1923 was £50,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Attention called to the fact that a quorum was not present.</i>

      <P>At the 1928 valuation 73 societies and branches with a membership of 291,660 disclosed surpluses amounting to £513,626, and ten societies with a membership of 117,152 were in deficiency to the extent of £51,268.  The net surplus was, therefore, £462,358.  £440,000 had been carried forward from the 1923 valuation and this with interest would have amounted to £510,000, so that on societies as a whole there was a loss of £50,000.</P>
      <P>There was clearly a serious deterioration in the financial position as between these two valuations, and as this deterioration was accompanied by a steady increase in the expenditure on benefits, it became necessary to consider whether a financial breakdown was approaching, and, if so, what steps should be taken to avert the danger. For this purpose an actuarial estimate has been made of what the valuation at the end of the present year will disclose if the system is not changed with the following results: Certain societies will show surpluses of £335,000, while other societies will show deficiencies totalling £510,000.  The contingencies funds of societies in deficiency will amount to £110,000, and the central fund to £120,000, so that even if these are used to the maximum there will still be a deficiency to be met in these societies of £280,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these conditions it would be necessary under the existing provisions of the Acts to increase the rate of contribution, or decrease the rate of benefit for the members of the societies concerned; in other words, although the scheme as a whole will be solvent at 31st December, 1933, it will be divided into two groups of societies, one of which will have more than is <Col N="106" /> required to pay the statutory benefits, whilst the other will have to impose reduced benefits on the members.  As has already been stated, the direct cause of this anomalous position is that insured persons instead of being units in a single national insurance scheme were allowed to group themselves at will under all kinds of heads which had no concern with insurance, and that as a result of this policy the character of the membership varies from societies with good lives and with good conditions of employment, to societies with bad or indifferent lives and an undue proportion of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to set aside this anomalous grouping by providing that all insured persons will be members of the same society and that the existing societies will cease to function.  The advantages of unification are twofold. For the first time there will be a really National scheme in which all insured persons will be on precisely equal terms.  If a surplus is disclosed on valuation they will all share alike in any additional benefits provided. Secondly, it will be possible to have a more efficient and more economic system of administration under one society with one central staff instead of 65 societies each with its own officials, in some cases, only part-time. The administration of benefits will be uniform and governed by the same standards for all insured persons.  The small part-time agency system will be reorganised so as to allow of a large number of whole-time agents permitting better supervision of and closer and earlier attention to members.  In the cost of central administration substantial economies will accrue not only in the headquarters staff, but also in allied services including audit and valuation.</P>
    <P>With one small exception, which I will refer to later, the Bill is confined in scope to the provisions necessary for bringing about this change.  It establishes a unified society to which the engagements of all the existing societies and branches will be transferred and of which all insured persons will be members.  During a transitional period of not more than 3 years, the society will be governed by a provisional <Col N="107" /> committee of three persons appointed by the Minister, and to them will fall the duty of setting up the society and taking over at convenient dates the assets and liabilities of the various societies.  It will not be practicable to take over all the societies at once and different dates will be fixed for different societies.  They will arrange for the acquisition of premises which will be the headquarters of the society, and will appoint a secretary and treasurer, subject to the sanction of the Minister.  They will also draw up rules for the administration of the affairs of the unified society, and will provide for the election of representatives of insured persons on the committee of management which is to succeed them in the government of the society at the end of the transitional period.  As soon as the unified society is in full working order the provisional committee will hand over the administration of the society to a committee of management composed of 15 persons, namely, three trustees appointed by the Minister, nine persons representative of insured persons and three persons appointed by the Minister to represent employers of insured persons.</P>
    <P>The next valuation is due to take place as at the end of the present year and although it will not be possible to have all the existing societies transferred to the unified society at that date, the Bill provides that the valuation will be made on the same basis as if the transfers had been effected.  In other words the members and the assets and liabilities of all societies whether transferred or not will be deemed to be assets and liabilities of the unified society at the date of valuation and any surplus or deficiency disclosed will be dealt with as a surplus or deficiency of the unified society.  As regards societies which have at present additional benefit schemes the rights of members to such additional benefits are preserved until the date at which the schemes will ordinarily terminate.</P>
    <P>In the process of unification certain officials of existing approved societies will necessarily be displaced and the <Col N="108" /> Bill enables the unified society to pay compensation on reasonable terms to persons so displaced who fulfil certain qualifying conditions, and who are not taken into the employment of the unified society.  The compensation will be by way of gratuity and will be on a basis similar to that provided for Insurance Committee officials by the 1929 Act.  Qualified persons who have less than ten years' service will get 1/8th of their annual remuneration for each year of service.  Those who have ten or more years' service will get 1/6th of their annual remuneration for each year of service, subject to a maximum of three times the annual remuneration. The payments for compensation will be a charge on the administration account of the unified society and the amount required may be borrowed from the Health Insurance Fund and repaid with interest by instalments over a period of years.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains clauses of a technical nature dealing with the St. James's Gate Health Insurance Society and the Dublin United Tramways and Omnibus Employees' Health Insurance Society which were approved as Employers' Provident Funds, and which require special treatment in view of the fact that the employers were responsible for the solvency of the societies' funds.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that health insurance will in future be entirely divorced from all forms of commercial insurance.  The unified society will deal with no business other than that of health insurance, and the Bill requires that all persons connected with the society whether as members of the Committee of Management, as officers or as ordinary employees will transact no insurance business of any other kind. It is to the best interest of insured persons that those who are directly dealing with their health insurance should give undivided allegiance to that business and should have no occasion to further the interests of commercial insurance.</P>
    <P>The only other matter dealt with in the Bill is a change in the powers given to referees who hear appeals under Section 67 of the National Insurance Act, 1911.  Under that section the referee appointed is given power to hear and decide any appeal submitted <Col N="109" /> to him.  It is proposed that in future the power of decision shall vest in the Minister.  I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton was anxious to have an opportunity of considering the arithmetic that was referred to by the Minister in the course of his statement.  I think that even if he had an opportunity of considering, and reconsidering, the arithmetic referred to by the Minister that would not help him or any Deputy in the House to make up his mind, if he came into the House with an open mind, on the principle of unification contained in the Bill as to whether he should or should not vote for the principle because in so far as the speech gave us any information at all it merely tended to show that in connection with the administration of the National Health Insurance Acts there was a problem to be dealt with, a problem arising out of the financial circumstances of the approved societies.  But so far as I could learn from carefully listening to the Minister he made no case whatever for the solution of these problems along the lines of unification which are contained in this Bill.  That is the big principle that is contained in this Bill, the principle of the solution of the financial difficulties of approved societies along the lines of unification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be admitted, as I have said, that there is a problem arising out of these financial difficulties and what we have to decide is what is the best and most just method, having regard to the interests concerned, of solving that problem in present circumstances.  Our view is that the principle embodied in this Bill, namely, the unification of approved societies, is not the best method in present circumstances of solving those difficulties but that, in point of fact, it is the most unjust method that could possibly have been devised.  Our objection to the principle of unification is based on the injustice that it will work in various directions.  It will work an injustice on the employees of approved societies. It will work an injustice on insured persons whose contributions have been husbanded by these small societies which are scattered round the <Col N="111" /> country and which have done very useful work during the last 20 years. It will be an injustice because it fails to recognise the work done by those people who, voluntarily, for a long period of years, gave their services to working and to helping in the working of approved societies in connection with the National Health Insurance schemes.</P>
    <P>Everything that could possibly have been said by the Minister, had he said anything, in favour of unification at the present moment would have been equally valid as an argument in favour of unification twenty years ago when this scheme was put into operation.  There are no different circumstances, even in this country at the present moment, which call for the application of that principle of unification to the solution of the problems that arise now because, in our view, those problems arise not from any lack of efficiency on the part of the approved societies in the administration of the Acts, not from any lack of organisation or lack of skill on the part of the officials and not from anything inherent in the scheme itself, but solely by reason of exceptional circumstances and exceptional times.  The finances of these approved societies have been put out of joint, not by reason of the scheme which was set up twenty years ago, but because of the greatly increased unemployment that exists in this country for the past couple of years. A solution is to be found for the problem, but there are other schemes which could have been applied equally effectively in the solution of these problems and which would have caused less injustice and less hardship than will be inflicted under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The great objection I have to this particular scheme of unification which may possibly, theoretically, be the most sound, but which I think, in practice, will be the most unsound scheme that can be devised to meet the situation, is the sudden reversal of the whole principle on which the machinery of national health insurance in this country was based at its inception and on which it worked <Col N="112" /> during the last twenty years, and worked, taking it all round, efficiently and satisfactorily, so far as insured persons, who are, of course, primarily to be considered, are concerned.  It was the policy of those who started this scheme of national health insurance in this country to foster the foundation of large numbers of small approved societies on the principle that it was right and proper that the insured persons themselves should have placed on them the responsibility for the working of the Act and the schemes under the Act and that small territorial or sectional approved societies would form the best protection for insured persons and that, under such a scheme, some sympathy would be shown in the administration of the Acts and in the giving of the benefits that insured persons had a right to consider they would get.  In accordance with that principle, numbers of insurance societies were set up here and a number of those diocesan and vocational and approved societies have been worked with extraordinary success and quite a number of philanthropic individuals have given their time on a voluntary and free basis to assisting in the working of those Acts for the sole purpose of benefiting the insured contributors.</P>
    <P>Their services under this scheme of unification are to be scrapped.  The system under which responsibility for the administration of the Acts in the proper way and in the proper spirit was placed on insured persons, or groups of insured persons, is also to be scrapped and, instead of that, one large unwieldy society is to be brought into being which will have all the disadvantages without any of the advantages of being a big civil service department.  I have little doubt that, in the administration of these Acts by such a department, which, though not, in name, a civil service department will, in fact, work as such, insured persons will undoubtedly not benefit.  The sympathy which local committees can show towards their sick members and towards their disabled members will be entirely lacking and red tape will be the rule.  Every little technicality, every little advantage <Col N="113" /> that may possibly arise will be taken in the interest of an incorporeal entity which will probably be known as &ldquo;the fund&rdquo; or &ldquo;the reserve.&rdquo; The human element, which is so necessary in connection with a scheme of national health insurance, will be entirely absent but, apart from the question of principle as to whether unification is or is not a proper remedy, surely a sudden reversal of the entire principle on which the system has been built up over a long period of years could have been taken in stages.</P>
    <P>An experiment of a very serious and grave nature is being tried in this Bill. It may be, as I say, that, on paper, arguments could be adduced&mdash;they have not yet been adduced&mdash;in favour, theoretically, of unification, but the human element and the practical element are completely left out of the situation under the scheme embodied in this Bill, and it would have been better if some even preliminary stages towards unification had first been attempted and if it had been recognised that this problem is not really&mdash;at least, it is to be hoped that it is not&mdash;a permanent problem and that the breakdown, if there is any breakdown, in the scheme is due merely to exceptional circumstances. It could have been, I think, tried in easy stages instead of initiating such a completely revolutionary scheme all at once as is proposed to be done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as I say, will work injustice in many directions but, above all, it will work injustice on the people whose livelihoods are dependent on the pay they have been getting from the approved societies.  It is apparently only another manifestation of that feature of Government policy which is so characteristic of their policy&mdash;this introduction of uncertainty and insecurity into practically everybody's life, State interference with people's employment, with the people's salaries and with the people's livelihood.  This is only another instance of that particular manifestation of Government policy.  Everything that could be said for unification to-day could have been said 20 years ago but a different scheme was adopted and the people's livelihood depends on the continuance of that <Col N="114" /> scheme.  Under this Bill, they will be ruthlessly taken away, and taken away, in many instances, without compensation, and in every instance without adequate compensation.  I am sure that every Deputy in this House knows that there is not a single member of an approved society who has given his benediction to any portion of this Bill and it would be interesting to know how many people really are behind the scenes in favour of this principle of unification or whose child the principle is, but, at all events, in the compensation clauses of this Bill, there is no provision made for the number of people whose livelihoods practically depend on their earnings under approved societies.  There is no provision in the Bill for part-time members of approved societies.  Everybody knows that even 15/- a week, made by an agent in the country, makes all the difference, sometimes, between ordinary comfort and penury. The discussion of the particular clauses of the Bill dealing with compensation, is more a matter for Committee, but it is apparent that even the drafting has not been properly thought out and that full discussion will have to take place.  In the meantime I oppose the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals, as everyone with any practical experience of national health insurance knows, with a very difficult situation.  Everyone who has had any experience of national health insurance, or is interested in the work of national health insurance, is perfectly well aware that the present financial and actuarial position of the societies is very far from satisfactory.  The fact is the position of the insurance societies is very far from being satisfactory.  But that is not due, I say at the outset, to any mismanagement on the part of the officials of those societies, or to any want of foresight on the part of the committees for guiding the policies of the societies.  Rather is it due to the very exceptional circumstances, well outside the control both of the committees and the officials of the insurance societies, if they were to be carried on in a humane manner towards the members of those societies.  The <Col N="115" /> plain fact of the matter is that the existing rates of contribution, paid under national health insurance, are not adequate to meet the heavy cost of present benefits on the basis of the constitution.  There is a growing increase in the number of persons claiming benefit during periods of illness, and, generally, this has brought about the very serious position in which every insurance society finds itself to-day.  A difficulty therefore exists at the moment.</P>
      <P>Anyone with any practical experience of the position knows that that difficulty is there.  It can be met by this Bill.  It could be met in some other patchwork way, we know, not going so far as this Bill, or, it could be met, in the manner that I would like to see the situation met, namely, by dealing with the whole question of national health insurance, not as an isolated piece of legislation concerned solely with national health insurance but on a basis of making some effort to co-ordinate and codify the existing social legislation of the country.  I do not see any reason why in this country, unless it is merely to follow our neighbour, national health insurance should be divorced from unemployment or why it should have no relation to benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, and take no cognisance of the Old Age Pensions legislation which we have had in this House.  My complaint is that we are following the specialised and departmentalised methods of our next door neighbour.  It is to be regretted that the Minister, in this case, has not seen fit to depart from that method and look at our social problems in this country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, in the existing position of things, amalgamation is clearly desirable.  I can see no other way in which the societies can effectually get over the present difficulties except by way of amalgamation.  There are 65 societies in the country to-day.  If any section of the membership of these societies were to secede and to make an endeavour to establish separate societies not managed officially under committees of the parent society they would be told: &ldquo;You are frittering <Col N="116" /> away your energy and making for waste and inefficiency by multiplying the number of the societies.&rdquo; Now if 65 societies are better than 165 societies, then on the same principle one society is better than 65 societies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello made a most extraordinary speech.  He said he is opposed to unification and amalgamation.  I was wondering, during his speech, whether Deputy Mulcahy would remind him of the fact that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, under the Railway Amalgamation Act, amalgamated 22 companies into one.  Still the Deputy is opposed to amalgamation even though he is a member of a Party that amalgamated 22 companies into one. Some of these railway companies had more directors than engines.  If Deputy McGilligan were here he would not have forgotten to remind Deputy Costello that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government also amalgamated under the Shannon Power Act all the electrical undertakings in the country. Now we have Deputy Costello, a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, declaring against unification and against amalgamation although that same Party amalgamated the railways and amalgamated the electrical undertakings in the country.  But the electrical undertakings in the country were not in the position that the National Insurance Societies are in.  At the time of the amalgamation many of these electrical undertakings were prosperous from the point of view of finance and some of them had surpluses.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello forgot what his Government did over these important matters.  The original Insurance Act of 1911 brought about insurance on an actuarial basis for both sickness and disablement purposes.  It provided also for the insured person a choice of the society of which he would become a member.  Inevitably the result of that choice was to enable certain occupations, having regard to the origin of the scheme, to go into certain societies.  Some were organised on the basis of craft, others on the <Col N="117" /> basis of profession, and others on the basis of locality.  Inevitably that brought about a position where in one insurance society you had members who were good economic units for the purpose of insurance, and in another society you had members who were bad economic units for the purposes of insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happened, at one time, to be secretary of a National Health Insurance Society, run in connection with my own organisation, and I have no hesitation in saying that from an actuarial point of view that society was one of the strongest financially per head of membership in the country because there was no unemployment amongst them. It paid not merely the statutory benefit of 15/- but it also provided dental, optical and surgical treatment, and included, in one instance, provision for an artificial limb which cost £25.  It made provision for tuberculosis treatment and the cash benefit was 19/-instead of 15/-.  But there were other societies which found it difficult to pay the mere statutory benefit of 15/- a week.  They could give no extra benefit in the form of dental, optical, surgical or hospital treatment, and they could give no extra cash benefits.  In that position you have the realisation of the fact that the State passed their Insurance Act for the purpose of sickness and disablement.  It left the choice to the member as to which society he would belong to.  Everybody knows that that led to canvassing for the different societies to secure members. But the upshot of the whole position was this, that although the rate of contribution was the same you had one member in a society receiving benefits vastly superior to the benefits received by a member of another society, not because one society was more efficiently managed than another, but because certain occupational and economic reasons made it possible for one society to be actuarially much stronger than another.  That position was clearly undesirable.  It meant unequal benefits.  Inevitably, as circumstances developed, it meant some societies maintaining a certain financial soundness and others just managing to struggle along, but clearly it meant <Col N="118" /> bankruptcy for many societies who were organising a class of insured person who was liable in his occupation, or more liable, in his occupation, to sickness than others, and who was liable also to frequent unemployment. Everybody knows perfectly well that that position and these causes have brought about the inequalities which have existed as between one society and another.</P>
    <P>Faced with a position of that kind, it was obvious that something had to be done.  The Government has decided on unification.  I am sorry that they have not decided to go very much further.  Unification has many benefits over the present position, but I think that the whole position of national health insurance, unemployment insurance, workmen's compensation, old age pensions, and widows and orphans' pensions, if we are to get them, ought to be codified in such a way that we should have one single piece of social legislation dealing with all these Acts. A position somewhat similar to the one I advocate here is in operation in many Continental countries.  It works out satisfactorily there and a discussion with citizens of those countries will enable anyone to ascertain the measure of satisfaction given.  Contrary to Deputy Costello's view, there is not a fraction of the complaint against these schemes that there is against the present 65 individually controlled National Health Insurance Societies in this country.</P>
    <P>There is one phase of the Bill which, in my opinion, is particularly unsatisfactory. That is the compensation provision as set out in Section 21 of the Bill.  In Section 21 it is proposed to pay a gratuity, calculated on the basis of one-eighth of annual remuneration for every completed year of qualifying service in cases where the person has up to ten completed years; and where he has ten or more completed years of qualifying service it is proposed to pay a lump sum by way of compensation calculated on the basis of one-sixth of the person's annual remuneration for every completed year of qualifying service. In addition, it is proposed to pay compensation to a part-time employee only where he proves to the satisfaction of the provisional committee <Col N="119" /> that his earnings from such society were his principal means of livelihood.  I suggest to the Minister that that compensation is utterly inadequate, and if the Minister will look up his own speeches on the 1929 Insurance Act, where he advocated generous treatment for the part-time secretaries of insurance committees, he will see that in these cases he was urging very much better compensation than that which he is urging for full-time and part-time employees in this Bill.  Many of these officials have 21 years' service.  They cannot even secure compensation for the whole 21 years' service because, according to the Bill, the compensation is limited to three years' salary, meaning that at the most they will get compensation for 18 of the 21 years they have served. They ought to get compensation for every year they have served.  Besides, the method of compensating people on the basis of a gratuity has many disadvantages. It means that, under this Act, certain full-time people will lose their employment.  They have been at this business all their lives.  Twenty and more years, perhaps, have been devoted to study of the 11 Insurance Acts that have been passed and of the thousands of regulations under these Acts.  That person will not find it easy to secure employment again in the open market.  The provision of three years' compensation is not adequate, in my opinion.  It gives a certain sum of money at the time, but it makes no future provision for the man himself or for his family and, in my opinion, the terms of compensation, as set out in this Bill, are very much behind the terms of compensation set out in previous Bills.</P>
    <P>If the Minister examines the relative positions he will find, I think, that the compensation set out here is less than that set out in the Act of 1929 and certainly much less than the compensation provided for in the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tram (Abandonment) Act, and although these people will be in the position that their livelihood will be interrupted, almost at a moment's notice, there is a departure from the well-beaten track of adding abolition years in cases where a <Col N="120" /> person's livelihood is taken from him in that manner.  I suggest that the provisions are very scanty indeed. Without being very magnanimous, the Minister might have gone very much further and in respect of the part-time employees in the insurance societies, I think that they are entitled to much more generous treatment than they will receive from the Minister in this Bill. Compensation will only be paid where a person proves to the satisfaction of the provisional committee that his earnings were his principal means of livelihood.  Suppose a man is earning one pound a week in some other occupation. He is earning 15/- as an agent, but that is not his principal means.  Is he to get no compensation for the 15/- although it is almost half his total income, simply because the one pound will be his principal means of income and the 15/- disregarded?  Let the Minister remember that these agents generally are people in very poor circumstances. The Minister or the Department may take the view that you cannot compensate people with 15/-or 10/- a week.  In the domestic economy of these people that 10/- or 15/- is probably worth hundreds of pounds and means hundreds of pounds, relatively, to what it means to people in other walks of life.  Much more generous provision should be made for part-time officials of societies, or full-time officials of societies, and there might be a more generous appreciation of the position in which part-time agents will find themselves as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister will give any indication now that he will improve the position.  At any rate, we, in this Party, regard the provisions as niggardly in the extreme, and we propose, on the Committee Stage, to introduce amendments such as will aim at providing these people with reasonable compensation, having regard to the fact that they are losing their employment, not through their own own fault, but because the State has decided on unification.  If the State wants unification in the national interest, it ought, in the national interest, to pay for unification, and it ought not to ask people to suffer, without compensation, the hardships they <Col N="121" /> will suffer if the Bill is passed in its present form.  The State ought to make generous provision for those who will lose their employment as a result of unification which has been decided upon in the State interest.  In any case, the Minister cannot plead that reasonable compensation will impose an unfair burden on the State or on the insured contributor, because it is set out in Section 22 of the Bill that the compensation is to be provided by advances out of the National Health Insurance Fund and, presumably, will be repaid to them by economies effected in the administration of the unified society.  In view of the fact that the State is not being asked to pay compensation, that the insured person is not being asked to pay compensation, that the employer is not being asked to pay compensation and that the terms of compensation provided in the Bill are extremely bad, I suggest to the Minister he has no case whatever for dealing with compensation for these officials in the niggardly way proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton took Deputy Costello to task in that his criticism of the Bill was mainly nugatory. I think Deputy Norton was guilty of that same sin, if it is a sin. We certainly learned very much more about the position of national health insurance in this country, and what it means to the people, from Deputy Norton than we did from the Minister. I would like to remind the House that this Bill affects every employer and employee in the State.  I doubt if, during the lifetime of this Government, any piece of legislation was introduced which will have more far-reaching results or which will affect more people than will this measure.  The Minister, as Deputy Norton said, read out a number of figures and he told us that as a result of the last valuation of societies they were found to be in a certain position.  That was the whole case the Minister made for this unification Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, to my mind, made a much better case for unification on the amendment he moved in this House to the 1929 Bill.  He was then in opposition. It may be that the Minister had <Col N="122" /> then more time to go into the matter or it may be that his enthusiasm for unification has abated somewhat because of the knowledge which he has been able to obtain of the working of national health insurance since he became a Minister.  In any case, it is quite clear to anyone who listened to the Minister this afternoon and who listened to him when he was moving his amendment in 1929 that he is not at all as enthusiastic now about unification as he was then.</P>
    <P>One would have expected on a Bill such as this, a Bill which in effect repeals eleven Acts of Parliament and which takes away, as Deputy Norton says, the choice from the insured person, that the Minister would have given the House some little bit of the history of national health insurance here during the last ten or twenty years. We ought to realise that the main basis of national health insurance as first introduced and as carried out in this country was that it was on a voluntary basis.  We must remember that no State action of a social nature which was taken within the last quarter of a century has secured more effective voluntary co-operation or assistance than national health insurance has.  I think I would not be far wrong if I were to say that the actual cost in cash for the administration of this very intricate, involved and technical legislation would not be more than ten per cent.; probably it is very much less.  The real value of the Insurance Acts that are in operation was brought about by the humane way in which they were administered and brought to the very doors of the unfortunate sick poor.  I think that this House should not lightly, by a stroke of the pen, so to speak, wipe out all that voluntary assistance which has been given and which would be given under National Health Insurance Acts in the future.</P>
    <P>I am not going to say that the position to-day is anything like what it should be, but as Deputy Costello and also Deputy Norton pointed out, the present position has been brought about, not through any fault of the societies, but by reason of the abnormal circumstances which have <Col N="123" /> adversely affected every other service in the State, be it public or private. The Minister is quite well aware that the real reason of the unsatisfactory position disclosed at the last valuation was the abnormal unemployment in the country.  First of all, you have not the income.  You have not cards stamped because men and women are not employed and therefore your income is reduced.  Further, we know quite well that when men and women are unemployed and are run down in health as a result they are more likely to become ill and to become a charge upon their societies than when they are working and are fairly well nourished.  When a man is unemployed if he gets a slight attack of, say, lumbago, he goes to the doctor for a certificate, whereas if he were in employment he would be inclined to carry on for a few days and the attack might wear away.</P>
    <P>You are much more likely to have malingering, with a consequent unfair charge on the funds of societies, when you have abnormal unemployment. Does the Minister consider that he is going to secure a greater compliance by unification or that he is going to have less malingering by centralising the whole thing in Dublin?  The position of societies would be much worse than what it is if it were not for the services of local committees and the close supervision exercised by local secretaries and assistant secretaries of societies.  In the case of a local society the members of the committee of management are drawn from a wide radius and they would know at least fifty or sixty per cent. of the members. If they saw a man malingering they would report it.  A much better check can be got in that way than the Minister will get under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one point in which I am very much interested.  I have been a member of a committee of management of a society for the last fifteen years. During that time I have taken a very keen interest in the work.  It is not a society that caters for any sheltered trade.  It is an ordinary rural society. Our members are made up of ordinary agricultural labourers, road workers, shop workers, domestic servants and so <Col N="124" /> on.  They are the very class that are most likely to be unemployed from time to time.  I am glad to say that because of good management, because of the very great interest taken by the committee and because they watch very closely the expenditure of the funds our society&mdash;and it is probably known to the Minister's officials&mdash;is one of the best societies of its size in the State.  Deputy Norton told us the benefits which his society was able to pay.  His society was catering for a sheltered class of worker, a class of worker in very good employment.  Our society, and this is true of very many other rural societies having in or about the same membership, were able to pay 18/- per week in cash benefits.  We gave optical treatment, free dental treatment and provided where necessary artificial limbs.  I would like to put this to the members of the Centre Party that where our members were sent to the county hospitals we paid for them ourselves.</P>

      <P>If you can get more money by unification wait and see, but I want to make this point that it was the small societies that were able to pay more than the statutory benefits. In every place where you had large societies they were not able to pay more than the statutory rates.  The large benefits were paid in every case by the small societies.  We have been told that some societies are in a very bad way.  We have been told through the usual Government publicity channels that it is unfair.  Deputy Norton made the same point this afternoon, and I was surprised he made it, that some workers got 15/- a week and others 18/- a week.  I agree if it were the purpose of this Bill to give the 15/-a week people 18/- that that would be desirable, but the effect of this Bill will be to make the minimum the maximum.  The effect will be to bring the 18/- members down to 15/-.  That <Col N="125" /> is the real point.  The Minister did not deal with any of these matters.  He did not deal with that side of the question in any way.  He did not justify in any way in this Bill the principle of unification.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not tell us why he chose unification instead of amalgamation. The Minister did not tell the House that the number of societies was going down gradually.  The Minister did not tell us about the scheme which was submitted to him by the approved societies.  The Minister did not tell us why there were 85 societies some time ago as against 65 now.  I think the Minister should tell the House why the Government chooses unification as against amalgamation and why they stop short at unification. Why not amalgamation?  Personally, of the two, I would prefer nationalisation, but I have a very shrewd idea the reason the Minister did not go the whole hog for nationalisation was that, if he did, the State would be responsible for the effect of his particular scheme.  The Minister has to set up machinery, but the insured workers will be made responsible for whatever may happen as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point and that is the question of benefit.  We know quite well at present and it is perhaps one of the best features of the machinery at the moment that so far as the vast majority of insured persons are concerned they can get their benefits within a very short time.  In many cases when there is urgency they can come into the office and be handed their money as soon as they have satisfied the secretary in charge that they are entitled to the benefit.  That is in cases where there is urgency.  I wonder what is going to happen when we have this service centralised?  It seems to me that for every day's delay now there will be a week's delay then. Let me give the House one example. Speaking from my own experience as a member of a committee of management, I want to put this to the House. Let us imagine an application for maternity benefit coming from a very poor worker.  We know in that type of case the money is wanted almost <Col N="126" /> immediately.  It can be got in many societies in the country immediately. The member has not to wait until the ordinary pay day, the ordinary day on which the society pays out the cheques, but when it is a case where the money is urgently required all that need be done is to satisfy the clerk in charge and the money is paid there and then.  That has been a great benefit to those very poor people. Those are matters that I would like the Minister to take into consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say very much with regard to the question of compensation. Deputies Costello and Norton have covered the points that I intended to make, much better perhaps that I could deal with them. But I would like to say this that I cannot understand what was the reason for fixing the limit at 18 years.  I would like to hear from the Minister his reasons for that.  It is a completely new principle.  The man who has 21 years service will be compensated the same as if he had 18 years.  That is contrary to the usual practice.  The usual practice is that if a man has 18 or 20 years' service and if that is not enough to secure for him the maximum compensation or superannuation, some years are added to his services.  In this case the Minister is reducing the years of service.  A man of 18 years' service gets the same compensation as the man with 21 years' service.  I would like to hear from the Minister on that point his reasons for it.  We will go more fully into that on the Committee Stage.  So far as the Bill is concerned, unlike Deputy Norton or any of the other speakers, whilst I agree that the present position is not as satisfactory as I would wish to see, I am satisfied that this is the wrong way to go about remedying it.  I am satisfied that this Bill if passed by the House will make the position much worse than it is and will go a long way to smash the service in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal of unification is in my opinion a mistake.  It shows that after the study the <Col N="127" /> Government has given to this question they have not clearly faced the difficulty.  They are trying to take a short cut out of what is a temporarily awkward situation.  The Minister maintains that this has become necessary as a result of the actuarial insolvency of the National Health Insurance system in this country.  Everyone who knows anything about it admits that there is at the moment a serious difficulty to be overcome.  One would have imagined that the Minister in introducing this Bill would have examined the situation with which we find ourselves face to face now and in the light of this case would have explained the reasons for the course of action which he now proposes to pursue.  So far as I am aware the principal cause for the insolvency of the National Health Insurance system in this country comes under six heads.  First, for the purpose of comparison with England and Northern Ireland where the situation has been materially relieved through the granting of the old age pensions at 65 years instead of 70, I understand that in this country there is a very serious drain on the funds of approved societies by persons claiming sickness benefit at 65 years of age.  The experience generally is that a sickness benefit claim deteriorates into a permanent disablement claim after 65 years of age. You have apparently in our country an undue proportion of workers falling ill at about 65 years of age and benefits have been provided for them. The disability benefits become old age pensions in the interval between 65 and the grant of the pension at 70 years of age.  There is an obvious way open to the Government and one which I hope some day they will be in a position to pursue to remove that difficulty.  That is, by following the example of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and introducing old age pensions at 65.  The second head under which our difficulties have arisen was an actuarial error made by the people who first drafted the National Health Insurance Scheme. If my information be correct, they <Col N="128" /> anticipated an average of 48 contributions per annum.  In practice, the approved societies here are receiving an average of from 38 to 39 contributions. The result of that must have been manifest to Deputy Mulcahy when Minister for Local Government.  He must have known what would happen sooner or later if that went on.  That difficulty has been gravely aggravated by the widespread unemployment which neither he nor anybody else could have anticipated.  That is embarrassing national health insurance in every country in which it is in force. A third difficulty I see&mdash;perhaps the Minister will explain this away&mdash;is that a man's sickness benefit was fixed at 15s. and his disability benefit at 7s. 6d., whereas a woman's benefits were based on 12s. and 7s. 6d.  That suggests that there was some kind of actuarial miscalculation.  I think that has contributed somewhat to the difficulty in which we at present find ourselves.  I feel that the reduction of the contribution by the last Government was an ill-judged experiment and a most imprudent course to pursue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that with a view to hearing from the Minister if that had been done.  One thing the Government did do and that was to bring about the suspension of the central fund which was a fund used actuarially for the purpose of helping out small societies who were in embarrassment at the expense of the unnecessary surpluses of larger and more prosperous societies.  I should be interested to hear the Departmental view in defence of that procedure.  I believe it very seriously aggravated the position with which we are at present faced <Col N="129" /> and I think it was not a prudent thing to do.  With those facts in mind, I imagined that the Minister would have addressed his attention to an overhaul of the existing system with a view to seeing if he could not make it meet the difficulties that have arisen.  I should have expected that, because the approved societies system has been administratively so successful.  The cost of management generally has been admirably low.  The general trend of opinion in Great Britain and Northern Ireland&mdash;the other country and portion of our country where the approved society system is operating&mdash;favours that system of administration as the best, most economical and most advantageous for insured persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competition is the life of trade. Every society was jealous of its own reputation.  Every society was anxious to create a situation in which it could give better benefits to its members than the next society.  The result of that was that, with every approved society you had in the country, you had a watchdog on the funds of national health insurance constantly vigilant to see that there was no malingering, to see that the various provisions of the National Health Insurance Acts were carried into effect and that the funds of the society were adequately protected. Sometimes a society tried to be a little bit too generous, but that was a difficulty which I did not think ever became serious.  It was always capable of correction by the National Health Insurance Commission.  You had the very desirable situation that the medical profession were, to say the least, lenient towards people whom they believed to be sick.  If anything, they erred on the side of generosity in the matter of certificates.  As a corrective, you had approved societies pressing all the time for strict examination and for early removal from the list of disabled or sick persons.  A nice balance was kept in this way between the interests of the insured persons and the funds at the disposal of the Commission. Experience and those facts should have influenced the Minister very strongly against any proposal to tear down that considerable organisation which took 21 years to build and <Col N="130" /> to substitute something of which he has no experience and which everything tells us will be more extravagant and less efficient.  Unlike Deputy Norton, I do not believe in nationalisation or anything that smells of nationalisation (interruption).  I do not know why Deputy Kelly objects from behind the barrier&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon.  I do not believe this system will be as efficient as that which is at present in operation, and I do not believe that the Minister is enthusiastic for any system which smacks of nationalisation.  The only excuse for it would be that it would mean economy in administration.  Unless the Minister is able to put up a very, very convincing case of that kind, I think he does less than justice to the House in asking it to accept this Bill.  However, I believe in making the best of a bad job.  If the Minister has definitely made up his mind, after considering all the relevant facts, that unification is inevitable, I believe that our duty is to do what we can to make it as successful as it can be made and to help him, so far as we may, to remove anomalies and what we may be able to persuade him are injustices from the Bill.</P>
      <P>The first matter to which I should like to draw his attention is a very trivial one, which might more properly arise on Committee Stage.  Section 6 relates to the powers of the trustees to sell or lease land on behalf of the unified society and to purchase or take land on lease on behalf of the society.  I think it would be worth while examining, between now and the Committee Stage, whether that provision includes houses.  The probability of the unified society deciding to take land is remote, but the probability of their proposing to acquire houses is not so remote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I pass to Section 8.  I should like the Minister to deal with this matter when he is winding up the Second Reading debate.  I <Col N="131" /> should like to know the principle which guided him in providing that &ldquo;a member of the committee of management of the unified society or an officer or employee of the unified society shall not, while he is such member, officer or employee, be a member of the committee of management or board of directors of any society or company transacting insurance business or be employed as an officer, agent or employee of any such society or company.&rdquo; I do not see why a man who has a wide experience in insurance business which is closely analogous to the business of these approved societies should be excluded.  Perhaps the Minister will ventilate that when dealing with the Bill at the conclusion of the debate.</P>
      <P>I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMichaelBurke" hpid="Mr. J.M. Burke Mr. J.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When the timely intervention of the clock cut short this debate some time in the Dark Ages I had remarked that the members of the Executive Council, with one or two exceptions, had very little knowledge or experience of agriculture.  It was written once of a well-known and notable Irish politician, who had settled across the Channel, that he sometimes saw this country on the map of the world.  I have no doubt that some Ministers, in the course of their duties, see fields now and again on the ordnance map, but, honestly, I would not entrust them with the management of Mrs. Wigg's cabbage patch.  I am sure that most of them could not tell me, or could not distinguish between bonnckeeon and mackanthau how, and that they surely could not differentiate between <Col N="132" /> praiseach bhuidhe and starters.  They neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, but they lay down rules and regulations with an assurance that would put Liebeg, Baldwin and Wibberly into the halfpenny place.  I am inclined to think that the Executive Council, possibly under the influence of the Minister for Agriculture, who is a medicine man, are adopting towards the farmer a system of treatment which was in high favour with physicians. It was called the antiphlogistic treatment. It consisted of purging, starving and bleeding.  I remember reading the diary of an old Italian leech in which he notes: &ldquo;I treated Ludovicus for 12 days, during which time I consistently starved, bled and purged him, and still the fellow died.&rdquo; A most ungrateful and most unappreciative patient.  In the same way the Government has cleaned the pockets of the farmer.  They have bled him white; they have put him on starvation diet, and still he is grumbling and grousing and growling.  The only answer of the Government is: &ldquo;Away with him; away with him; crucify him on the cross of economic folly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very sorry that the House is to-night without the stately presence of Deputy Hugo Flinn.  On the last occasion he solemnly told Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that he was elected not as a prophet, but as a Deputy. Having delivered himself of this great message to humanity, he proceeded forthwith to predict the immediate death and dissolution of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and he consigned them to an unglorious grave, unwept, unhonoured and unsung, unhouseled, disappointed and unaneled.  In the course of his speech he used on several occasions the phrase, &ldquo;A nation's ransom.&rdquo; Oh, the blessed word &ldquo;Mesopotamia.&rdquo; He evidently has a copyright of that expression.  More than once I heard him use it in Cork. It is evidently clinging on to him.  It is like asthma.  He tries to get it off his chest, but he cannot.  As he is not here, I shall part with him with this remark:</P>
      <P>In all his humours, whether grave or mellow,</P>
      <P>He is such a touchy, testy clever fellow;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> There's so much skill and so much spleen about him,</P>
    <P>There is no living with him or without him.</P>
    <P>I should like to add by way of prayer, &ldquo;May perpetual lime-light shine upon him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there was brought into action to assail Deputy O'Donovan one of the Government &ldquo;Long-Toms.&rdquo; I refer to my colleague and my friend, Deputy Tom Hales.  Deputy Anthony described his speech as high falutin'.  Deputy Dillon would probably call it &ldquo;ballyhoo&rdquo; and I have no doubt that the ex-Mayor of New York, Mr. James Walker, would call it &ldquo;boloney.&rdquo; I call it poetry.  Deputy Hales is a dreamer.  He lives in a past that was never present, and he is thinking of a future that never will be past.  He was very much exercised by some unknown person who was laying the axe at the root of some mysterious tree.  I have been thinking since what the tree was. I wonder could it be the tree whose forbidden fruit brought death into the world and all our woes; or was it the dreaded Upas tree; or was it one of those trees of liberty that flourished so mightily during the French Revolution amid red flags, red caps, the Carmagnole, Ca Ira, and Fouquier Tinville justice and all these things? But after deep consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the fact is that the Deputy is up a gum tree, that he is too proud to climb down, and that he is afraid somebody may cut it from under him.  The spirit of prophecy being in the air the Deputy caught the prevailing infection and forecasted that we should win the economic war.  I hope that events will justify his forecast. I do hope that when we emerge triumphantly from the struggle we shall not be in the position of the litigant who won a Chancery action and thereby lost all his property.  I beg the House to approach this motion of Deputy O'Donovan's in a spirit of sweet reasonableness, to put aside passion and politics and prejudice, and to face up to facts and realities.  Some people will say that the country was never better off.  Of the man who says that I can only say in the words of the Gospel that &ldquo;the truth is not in him.&rdquo;<Col N="134" /> The country blooms a garden and a grave, but I am afraid that, as regards a large part of it, it is mainly a grave as far as agriculture is concerned.  I am against the policy of dole and dope of bread and circuses.  I consider that bounties on exports are vicious, but in a national crisis and in the emergency which has now arisen, it is necessary, in my humble opinion, if you want to save the key industry of this country to take measures which in ordinary circumstances would not be justified.  I think it is up to this House to do everything in reason to help the farmers to tide over their present difficulties.  Can anybody gainsay that the farming population at the present time is deplorably badly off?  The other day the respected Chairman of the Dublin County Council pointed out how badly off they were.  They refused even to strike a rate.  The same story comes from every part of the country.  There must be some foundation for a story which is so widespread, and which is coming from every single district throughout the whole of the Free State.  The farmers of West Cork are about as hard working and as thrifty and as honest a lot of people as can be found in any country throughout the world.  They have always honoured their bonds; up to this they have paid their annuities regularly; they have always paid their rates, but at the present time it is a well-known fact that they are in such a position that not only can they not pay their rates and annuities but they cannot even meet their ordinary obligations. As was pointed out here on a previous occasion some of them are afraid to come to town lest they should meet their creditors.</P>

I am not referring to anybody in particular; I am only laying down a general rule. I am not a bit upset by those interruptions. I agree with the Deputy, as I have said, that other people in the country are hit, but it is in consequence of what the farmers are suffering at present.  I do not care what caused it; I do not care whether it is due to world-wide circumstances; I do not care whether it is due to universal depression or to the economic war; that is a matter upon which we can all form our own opinions, but one thing is quite certain and that is that farmers were never in such an appalling condition since the year of the famine.  It is up to this House in view of the importance of the farming industry in this country to come to the assistance of the farmers in every reasonable way they can, and I am sure that they will do so.</P>

I would like to start by drawing attention to the fact that just before this House <Col N="136" /> adjourned we had discussions on the Economies Bill and on unemployment, in which the Labour Party took a very active part.  I would like to express the hope that on this motion they will show for the farmers of the country some of the zealous consideration that they were ready to bestow on those who were hit by the Economies Bill, and upon the sufferers from unemployment largely due in my opinion to this so-called economic war.  I support this motion on the grounds of expediency, because I believe in facing facts.  I do not believe that the annuities next December will be paid.</P>

      <P>Because I do not believe that the people will be able to pay them.  The Fianna Fáil Party have some ground for mistrusting their own judgement about such matters as this, because for a very long time they persisted in saying that they would be able to collect from the farmers the whole of the land annuities, even after the economic war had broken out. The President of the Executive Council made speeches in various parts of the country, after winning the 1932 General Election, in which he insisted that the land annuities must still continue to be paid, and that it was a patriotic duty to pay them.  In spite of many prophecies to the contrary the Fianna Fáil Government persisted in thinking for some time, or professed to think that the land annuities would be paid in full.  Have they been paid in full?  If they have not been paid in full is it due to any sinister activities on the part of opponents of the Fianna Fáil Government?</P>

I say that the President of the Executive Council and the Fianna Fáil Government, as a whole, were deceived in thinking that people would be in a position, or would be willing, to pay the full land annuities after the economic war had once begun.  They had to go back on everything they said.  There was a time when the Fianna Fáil Party used to say that not to collect the land annuities, or any proportion of the land annuities would be an entirely unjust way of dealing with the matter; that the just way would be through a remission of rates, for the reason that that would give relief to all farmers affected by the economic war, whether they were farmers who had to pay land annuities or not.  Now they have completely departed from that principle, and when called upon to explain their lack of interest in the injustice, to the, perhaps, somewhat limited class, still a class of farmers who have not to pay land annuities, but pay, perhaps, some other form of rent, or who may be freeholders, their only reply is that that is only a small class and that that small class did not matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the Fianna Fáil Government miscalculated the situation completely and were <Col N="138" /> brought by force of circumstances, to release the farmers from paying half the land annuities, not because they believed that was a just way to deal with the situation, but because it was forced upon them, owing to the fact that the farmers were not paying, were obviously not going to pay, and that their own supporters were the foremost of the farmers determined not to pay, or unable to pay.  Is it not possible that they may be making a similar miscalculation at present?  They profess to believe that the rates can and will be paid.  They profess to believe that next November and December the instalments of the land annuities then due at the lower rate will be paid.  I venture to predict that the bulk of that money will not be paid.  I say that, having resolutely for the past year, in spite of great pressure to the contrary, refused to advise not to pay those who can pay.  I have always resolutely refused to do that, in spite of great pressure.  Nevertheless I feel that it is only sensible to realise facts, and that it is a duty to point out that, so far as one can judge from going through the country, and looking at the condition of the people, looking at traders' books, hearing what farmers have to say about the situation, it is very unlikely the bulk of the rates can be paid or that next November and December the land annuities can be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I am right in that I say that expediency requires us to take cognisance of that situation at once, for two reasons.  First of all it is up to the Minister for Finance to have accurate knowledge of the financial situation and to budget accordingly. It is desirable that the Minister for Finance should see the facts as they are, and not live in a fool's paradise. The other ground of expediency is this, that we do not want to compel men to be criminals.  We do not want to create more disrespect for law than there is already, in a class of the community that are in danger of being turned into law-breakers by the present situation, and by the attempt to exact payments which cannot be made from a class of the community normally most averse to <Col N="139" /> law-breaking, and most desirous that peace, order and decency should be maintained in this country.  I am afraid the whole standard of respect for law in this country is going to be lowered, and lowered for a long time to come, unless the Government are aware of the true facts, and take measures accordingly.  So much for expediency.</P>
    <P>Now what about justice.  Before I proceed to the main matter as regards justice, I wish to allude again to the fact that, as between the various classes of farmers, there is considerable injustice at present being inflicted by the Government's method of procedure, and that ought not to be forgotten.  Deputy Corry alluded to this question a few weeks ago, and said that the only people left out of the relief schemes, so to speak, were the people who had their pockets bulging with loot, and for them he had no consideration.  The people who would be affected by relief through the rates would be, in the main, people whose pockets were bulging with loot.  I want to express complete dissent from that statement, and not only as regards small men but as regards big men too.  I do not know whether Deputy Corry and others are aware, as I am aware, of the number of large land-holders who remain in this country because they love it, and because they love the places in which they were born and brought up, and not because they make any money out of being here.  I know many people within my own range of personal acquaintance who financially would be far better off if they walked out of their Irish estates and went across the water to live&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think something has been already said by the Chair regarding interruptions.  There are many large land-holders who remain in this country because they love Ireland, and because in addition to loving Ireland, they love the places in which <Col N="140" /> they were born and brought up. They have investments overseas, and a certain amount of unfortunately rapidly diminishing capital which enables them to give employment here which the Labour Party and others ought to be pleased they give. By driving these people out you diminish employment.  I know there is a class of mentality unfortunately, in this country, in certain parts, and especially in the Fianna Fáil ranks, that cannot endure to see people with any sort of capital saved that enables them to give employment.  All I can say is that that is a narrow, selfish Bolshevist outlook, very far from having any connection with true democratic feeling, or true regard for the welfare of the people of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>So much for the question of injustice to farmers with pockets bulging with loot.  But, as regards injustice to the general farming community, I do not think any honest person can deny that the policy of the Government has inflicted infinitely more loss on the farmers of the country as a whole than any relief by way of bounties or reduction of the land annuities that the Government have given.  The Government's policy has definitely inflicted frightful suffering on the farmers.  Now the Government, especially through the medium of Deputy Hugo Flinn, have defended themselves by saying that they are more far-seeing than anybody else in the country: that they have thought out an original economic policy of their own, that they have, with their profounder minds and acuter vision, wakened up to facts that were concealed from the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and from the country as a whole. The first thing that occurs to me about that is this: I do not believe the Government's economic policy was evolved as the result of economic thought at all.  I do not believe that they wrapped wet towels round about their heads, thought out problems about economics and came to conclusions as to the course to pursue on that basis.  The economic policy of the Government flows from their political <Col N="141" /> policy and nothing else, and their political policy flowed from the desire to get into office.  When I heard the Labour Party say, as they said the other day, that the Government are just a set of departmental heads&mdash;that they ought to have an economic general staff because they are not capable of thinking out economic problems for themselves as a Government&mdash;I could not help feeling that it was a great pity the Labour Party did not make that discovery sooner: before they put the Government into office to embark upon the appalling economic gamble that this Government have embarked upon.  However, let us hope &ldquo;better late than never&rdquo; and that even now the Labour Party may do something to turn the Government back from the courses on which they have embarked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present moment negotiations are going on in England&mdash;I understand that in one case they have concluded&mdash; for trade agreements with various foreign countries: with Denmark, the Argentine and others.  I understand that in the case of Denmark they are as good as concluded.  When Deputy Hugo Flinn points to the injury that has been done to Irish agricultural exports in recent years by competition from such countries one cannot help feeling that the real lesson to be drawn from such facts as he points to is that the Government ought to have taken the obvious course of going to Ottawa in a position to make such economic arrangements with Great Britain as would have changed the situation to our advantage and to the disadvantage of such countries as the Argentine and Denmark.  It would have been perfectly possible for them to have made common cause themselves with the English farmer instead of having the situation that has arisen now when the English farmer is becoming anxious to see our stuff kept out and when the English Government is making arrangements with Denmark and the Argentine to take British exports that we perhaps will no longer take.  One cannot help feeling that it is absolutely unreasonable and disastrous that our Government did not take such steps as would turn the course of British <Col N="142" /> economic policy in a different direction and secure for the Irish agricultural producer in the British market a better standing and better prices there than he ever had before.  I honestly believe that could have been done except for politics, and when I use the word &ldquo;politics&rdquo; I mean it in its worst sense.</P>
    <P>The Government may maintain that no question of injustice to the farmer can arise inasmuch as at the general election the farmer assisted in returning them to office.  In the first place I suppose the answer to that is: that on legal technicalities with regard to the land annuities or even with regard to the mandatory character of the Oath a democratic electorate in this country, or any other country, is not capable of weighing such matters carefully and coming to a measured decision on them.  The general attitude of the electorate who voted for Fianna Fáil was this, I suppose: that in what was represented as a patriotic conflict against England they were prepared to take the word of President de Valera as to what was just and what was not&mdash;that he was in the right.  But, over and above that, it was represented to the electorate over and over again at the last general election that if they returned a Fianna Fáil Government to office this time it would mean final victory.  What exactly was meant by final victory, I do not know, but I presume final victory was intended to include a victory in the economic war &mdash;that England would strike her colours.  Within a few weeks of the general election in my own constituency the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs came down and told the people he was happy to inform them that he already saw signs on the horizon of a settlement of the economic war as a result of the verdict given in favour of Fianna Fáil.  If he saw those signs I did not see them.  I did not see them then, and still less do I see them now.  So far as I can ascertain absolutely no steps whatever have been taken since the general election for settling with England or bringing the economic war to an end, and to that extent at any rate I suggest that the farming electorate were deceived just <Col N="143" /> as in the 1932 election they were deceived into thinking that we could repudiate the Oath and repudiate the payment of the land annuities and that still England would take no retaliatory action.  In view of the fact that the situation was put before the electorate in that way I suggest that it is not open to the Government to plead that there can be no injustice to the farmer inasmuch as the farmers supported them in the general election.</P>
    <P>Now a question that is very material to ask and consider is this: how long is this economic war going to last?  I am afraid that we have got to the stage where it ought not really to be called an economic war any longer.  It is something that is no longer dynamic but static.  We have got a sort of wasting disease fixed on us and apparently fixed on us permanently.  What is the thing that is really at the root of the economic war?  We have got to get at that if we are going to decide how long it is likely to last and what it really amounts to.  It cannot be too often repeated&mdash;it is relevant to such a motion as this&mdash;that the thing that is really at the bottom of the economic war is our constitutional relationship with Great Britain.  British Ministers in their speeches have indicated over and over again that as far as finance is concerned they are open to a reasonable deal.  The main question is the sanctity of agreements and the attitude that we choose to take with regard to the constitutional relationship of this country to the British Commonwealth. People go on talking and writing as if some sort of financial arbitration, some sort of financial negotiations purely restricted to questions of finance, could bring this matter to an end.  They obviously cannot bring this matter to an end.</P>
    <P>The main question is simply this: Are we prepared to recognise that the Treaty is morally binding on us until such time as it has been revised by consent of both sides?  If we are prepared to take that view there is no difficulty, certainly no insuperable difficulty, about the financial position. If we are not prepared to take that view, if we take the line that the <Col N="144" /> President of the Executive Council took the other day in Arbour Hill, that the guiding principle of Irish statesmanship should be the proclamation of a Republic, a line which seems to me in complete contradiction with the acceptance of our motion in the last session, to the effect that the unity of Ireland on the basis of goodwill should be the guiding principle of Irish statesmanship and that nothing should be allowed to interfere with that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps so.  I shall abbreviate my remarks.  I am just about to conclude.  I felt that I could not conclude on the motion without pointing out that until a rational attitude is arrived at on the subject of our constitutional relationship with Great Britain there seems to be no chance whatever of a settlement of the economic war or of a cure for the fatal disease from which Irish farming is at present suffering.  As far as I am concerned I have absolutely no sentimental feeling on the subject of whether or not we ought to belong to the British Commonwealth, but so long as the prosperity of Irish agriculture and consequently the prosperity of Ireland depends on that relationship with the Commonwealth, still more so long as the prospect of the unity of Ireland depends on that relationship with the Commonwealth, then I am wholeheartedly in favour of maintaining it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech which we have just heard from the Leader of the Centre Party is one of the most illuminating delivered in the House for a long time in so far as it revealed not merely the attitude and the policy of the individual who spoke, but presumably the attitude and the policy of his Party, something which was hitherto shrouded in mystery.  We are glad to get this revelation.  We are now much wiser in regard to the philosophy and political outlook of a not inconsiderable body of the members of the House.  The peculiar point of view expressed is one that I hope the sub-leader of the Party will develop because it seems to me it is one <Col N="145" /> that he is particularly fitted to. Apparently Deputy MacDermot starts from this point of view, that everybody who disagrees with him either does not understand the questions involved or else has been misled concerning them.  He referred to the general election and he explained in a few sentences the success which the Fianna Fáil Party achieved in that election.  The farmers of the country were too ignorant to understand the issues at stake, they they could not follow the legal argument involved in the annuities dispute, they did not appreciate the significance of the Oath or the legal arguments in regard to the Constitution and in their ignorance they voted for Fianna Fáil! Even if they were capable of understanding these questions they were misled and that explains the majority on these benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say the farmers could not appreciate the significance of the Oath.  I said they could not be expected to understand the question whether or not the Oath was mandatory in the Treaty, which was a legal question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party got ten votes for every one vote cast for the Centre Party, but apparently only the one man who voted for the Centre Party understood these questions.  That particular man looked in appearance no different from the other ten.  He followed the same occupation.  He worked the land, paid his annuities, paid his rates, went to the same church and read the same newspapers. For some peculiar reason he was able to understand these questions.  He could appreciate the significance of the Oath and the Constitution.  He could understand the legal arguments involved in the annuities dispute; he could not be misled; therefore, he came out to support the candidates of the Centre Party and pitied, on his way back from the polling booth, the ten misguided voters who went out to vote for Fianna Fáil.  I suggest to Deputy MacDermot, even if each individual farmer in the country is not quite as intelligent, quite as capable of grasping legal arguments as he is, <Col N="146" /> that we must conclude that the general level of opinion, the general average of common sense in the country is not quite so low as he would represent.  In any case, whether the farmers of the country or the workers of the country are as ignorant as he says they are, are as capable of being as easily misled as he says, they are nevertheless the people of the country and so long as democracy is to be the principle upon which our system of government is based they are the people who are going to decide and they have decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's whole speech up to this point was based upon the sufferings that the Government's policy has inflicted on these people.  He said they could not pay their annuities, that they could not pay rates, that they were never in worse circumstances than they are at the moment.  The Deputy may contend that the Irish farmer does not appreciate the legal significance of the Oath or the Constitution or that he cannot understand the legal questions involved in the annuities dispute, but the Deputy cannot convince the House that the Irish farmer does not know when he is badly off.  If he is badly off, if he has been rendered destitute by Government policy, the Irish farmer knows that. It was with a full knowledge of that, a full knowledge of the truth in relation to his own conditions, that he went out and voted, and even though he may not be able to appreciate everything the Deputy appreciates, he was able to take due stock of the economic conditions prevailing in his neighbourhood and the economic reactions upon himself of Government policy.  He took due stock of the prospects held out to him by Deputy MacDermot and his colleagues and the other Parties contesting the election, and deliberately he chose to support the policy of the Government and to support it with considerable emphasis.  That is a fact that has got to be appreciated.  It is not the intricacy of the legal arguments in regard to the land annuities or the legal arguments that might be advanced about the Oath and the Constitution that really matter.  It is the effect of Government policy in the past and the prospects of Government <Col N="147" /> policy in the future, and the majority of voters in this country, with the knowledge they possessed, the very intimate and personal knowledge they possessed in relation to both these things, recorded their votes three months ago in support of the Government's policy, and if the Deputy has any doubt as to what they would do to-morrow, I for one would be glad to give them another chance.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the rest of the case upon which the Deputy has based the policy of his Party.  I think we shall find it equally fallacious.  He said of course that the economic policy of the Government flowed from its political policy.  I do not think that is true; in fact I think that the reverse is true&mdash; that the political policy flows from the economic policy.  The majority of Fianna Fáil Deputies or indeed anybody who, at any time in Irish history, attempted to change political conditions here did so with the main idea of improving the economic conditions existing here.  If the Deputy gives a little more examination than he appears to have done to this question, I think he will find that is the case and that it is true not only in relation to the Fianna Fáil Party but in relation to every political Party in the world&mdash; that their political policy and outlook are influenced by the economic aims. The Deputy's conclusions as to the consequences of the economic war also require a little explanation. The farmers of this country are not in a prosperous condition at the moment, any more than the farmers of Great Britain, Germany or the United States.  Not merely the farmers but industrialists and workers of all classes in this and other countries are not as prosperous as they would like to be or as prosperous as they might be under different conditions! It has got to be demonstrated to us, however, that by settling the economic war in the manner in which the Deputy suggests, the economic conditions of the farmer are going to be improved.</P>
    <P>Before the Deputy counsels surrender, counsels the acceptance of the English interpretation of whatever <Col N="148" /> agreements, open or secret, or whatever clauses of the Treaty are involved, I think he should demonstrate to us that such substantial economic advantages are likely to follow for the farmer, assuming his outlook to be entirely materialistic, that he should try to influence the Government in that direction.  He has not shown it.  He has assumed that a settlement of the economic war on his basis, that is, the restoration of the position that existed this time last year, is going to improve the economic condition of the farmers but that requires proof.  I submit that it is something which cannot be taken for granted.  The farmers of Northern Ireland do not appear to be very pleased with the condition in which they find themselves.  There is no economic war on there and, presumably, there is some reason, therefore, other than an economic war, which has produced, or helped to produce, the economic conditions that exist amongst the farmers.</P>

We could not because, in order to have achieved that position, we would, as he suggested, have had to surrender on the question of the land annuities, to pay the land annuities to Great Britain which the Northern Ireland farmer does not do.  The Northern Ireland farmer does not pay the land annuities to Great Britain.  The annuities are retained there and used to finance the derating of agricultural land there and yet, with that advantage, the Northern Ireland farmer does not seem to be quite pleased with his position.  If Press reports are anything to go by, he is distinctly displeased and some allege that the position is much worse than that of the farmer in Southern Ireland in certain respects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us try to get this discussion on a basis of intelligence.  I know that that will be a bit of a difficulty for Deputy Dillon, but he can do his best.  Assuming that we got for the farmers of the Free State every advantage in the British market that the farmers of Northern Ireland possess at the moment, we could at most have put our farmers in the same position as the farmers of Northern Ireland and in fact we would put them in a slightly worse position because the farmers of Northern Ireland would continue to enjoy the benefits resulting from the retention of the land annuities there, whereas we would be paying them to Great Britain.  To get back to the original point, I want it demonstrated that a settlement of the economic war, on the basis of the restoration of the pre-war conditions, is going to improve the economic conditions of the farmer, so improve them in the present that he should in return for that immediate benefit sacrifice whatever prospects there are for the <Col N="150" /> future arising out of the policy of this Government.  That has not been demonstrated.  The Deputy did not attempt to demonstrate it.  He just spoke as if it were an acknowledged fact.  It is not merely not acknowledged but it is actually denied, and I say to the Deputy that the farmers of this country would in no way be better off, and would in many ways be much worse off if we were to try to achieve peace on these terms.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said that we cannot achieve peace on these terms.  The Deputy said that this whole question is not merely a matter of finance and not merely a question of the payment to Great Britain or the retention in this country of a sum of money but that it is also a constitutional question and one affecting our political status. I wonder why the Deputy did not tell us his authority for that assertion.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy's assertion is correct, however, the position is this, that these duties on our exports are being maintained, and these penal measures against us have been adopted, not for the purpose of enforcing the British interpretation of whatever agreements relate to the land annuities but for the purpose of enforcing in this country the acceptance of those political conditions which the British Government want to see. In that case, the Deputy is quite right in saying that we should stop calling this an economic war.  It is the old fight that has been going on for hundreds of years.  If the British policy has been designed, and the various tariffs imposed, for the purpose of compelling the people of this country to agree to a political status which they do not want, then, we have a much clearer position than we had heretofore and, on that issue, I should like very much to have the opportunity of meeting Deputy MacDermot or any of his colleagues before the people of the country in another general election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am allowed to interrupt&mdash;I am sorry I did not make myself clear&mdash;I will state it.  My contention is this, that the English are absolutely uninterested as to whether we declare a Republic or not to-morrow, but, so long as we do take that attitude with regard to the Treaty and with regard to the Republic, they have no motive for making concessions to us which seem to them, in themselves, generous, and unreasonably generous, except on the understanding that we are all going to be friends and colleagues in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asserts&mdash; again I do not know what his authority is&mdash;that the English do not care whether we establish a Republic or not, but he said, however, that, if we agree not to do so, if we agree to accept the political status that they have marked out for us, we might get from them certain concessions on the financial issues.  The Deputy's line of thought is so completely divorced from my own&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and from that of the majority of the people of this country, even members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, that it is very difficult to understand it.  He, of course, considers that anything given by Great Britain to us must be a concession.  It is a financial concession that we are to get, and, in order to get it, we are to agree to abandon what we may regard as our political rights.  That is his line of reasoning.  If we had gone into this business for the purpose of getting concessions, I am quite prepared to admit that we have mismanaged the whole thing, but we never approached it from that point of view.  There was no question of concession in the matter at all.  We came to the conclusion that, in law and in right, we were entitled to retain in this country certain sums of money formerly paid <Col N="152" /> out of it and we asserted that right and it is the assertion of that right, we have been told, that led to the situation that now exists.  I have no doubt whatever that we can end that situation by abandoning that right and ceasing to assert it, but the Deputy tells us we cannot.  The Deputy tells us that, because of developments that have taken place since, it is no longer a matter of a legal right to certain moneys but a matter of political status and constitutional procedure and that we are being penalised by these tariffs and by the other steps taken by the British Government for the purpose of making the majority here prepared to accept a political status less than that which they think they are entitled to enjoy.  That is obviously what it means.  The Deputy can shake his head if he likes, but that is what it means and he cannot get away from it.  If the people of this country are prepared to accept a political status less than we now have, or less than what we wish to achieve, then we can go to Great Britain seeking this concession.  If we do that and beg properly and nicely, and humbly; if we go to them touching our hats, bending at the right angle, I have no doubt we would gain a considerable amount.  The Deputy's contention is that if we are not satisfied with our present status and if we will not be content without something higher&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to examine that statement, also.  Perhaps the Deputy would tell us on what authority he speaks when he <Col N="153" /> says that if we were to declare a Republic we would be treated as a foreign country.  Where did he get that statement from?  Was it from Great Britain or is it that we are being treated as a foreign country at the moment?  If we were to declare a Republic, and, as a foreign country, were to secure from Great Britain the same treatment that it has given to Denmark and the Argentine there would be no necessity for these bounties.  The position would be very greatly improved with regard to our exports into the British market.  We are not getting the same treatment as these foreign countries get.  If Deputy MacDermot assures us that the establishment of a Republic would get us the same treatment from Great Britain which she gives to other countries we would get a unanimous vote from this House in favour of such a course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the whole purpose of the Deputy is to lessen the duties which we have to pay to Great Britain in reaching the British market, or that our goods should go free into the British markets, we could work towards that end by establishing a Republic for the Twenty-Six Counties to-morrow if we were assured that we would get the same treatment from Great Britain as Denmark or the Argentine or the French or the Republics of the Baltic get.  We cannot get that assurance.  Perhaps Deputy MacDermot would direct his energies to that end and see what he can get by way of promises from British Ministers, whose sole desire is to please the Irish people, and to lead them back to the paths of reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are to take up a reasonable attitude upon our status question; that is what the Deputy wants; that is what the British want.  All through our war with Great Britain in the past the demand of the Irish people for political freedom, or self-government or any of the things that agitated our people, were denied on the ground that they were illogical.  We never could <Col N="154" /> appear to be logical.  If we had been logical we would, of course, have realised the great advantage we derived from the British connection. If we were logical we would have recognised that we were part of a far-flung Empire, and that that brought us our share of the benefits derived from British culture and British industry. That is reasonableness as expounded by the Deputy and those of his mentality, and those with whom they associate in Great Britain. That is the rational outlook as it appears to British Ministers, and to those in this country who, in the past, fancied they were empowered to interpret British policy to the Irish people.  But we held that point of view was irrational and we say so still.  We can discover, as we have discovered at present, that there is a sounder logic, and a wider basis of commonsense and that the remedy, even from the narrow material point of view, lies in production and wealth and the employment of our people and the increasing of national income.  That sound logic and better commonsense are what we are trying to follow to-day. The old rational policy did not seem to work so well here.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy MacDermot still asserts that the last hundred years has been a century of progress for us.  If so, I do not know by what means he measures progress. Our population has gone down.  We were the only country in the world inhabitated by a white race whose population had declined.  Our industrial development had stopped, and the few remnants of industry that we were left were disappearing.  Our cattle and tillage and agricultural production of all kinds were going down.  But we had a unique position in regard to emigration statistics. We were sending out a much larger proportion of our population every year than any other country in Europe. That was the only point in which we excelled, that was the only result of the rational policy to which Deputy MacDermot is trying to get us to come back.  We deserted that policy some time ago and we have reversed it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>That has all been <Col N="155" /> the result of the policy of the Irish Nationalist Party, and that is the policy that I want you to come back to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am more thoroughly fogged now than ever.  The policy of the Irish Nationalist Party is what the Deputy wants us to come back to.  That Party attended the British Parliament and urged certain minor reforms upon the British Government without success for a number of years.  I am not quite clear how that is going to benefit us.  We decided to reverse the old economic policy and despite the adverse circumstances of the past year the decision to reverse that policy has been shown to be justified.  We succeeded in doing last year what was not done for the last fifty years.  The area under tillage increased.  Many farmers are badly off but some things have happened which indicate a complete reversal of preexisting conditions.  Last year the population of the country increased and industrial development went ahead.  We may not be satisfied at the rate of progress but we have moved forward where we previously had been moving backward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>What about unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It exists, and it is largely a legacy which we inherited from the old policy.  If the Deputy knows any other policy for ending unemployment except by giving work to the unemployed let him tell us what it is.  I do not know it.  The only way of giving work is to employ people to produce the tools, the machinery, the clothes, the houses we require.  Those who want that done must reconcile themselves to the economic policy in operation now because there is no other policy by which to get the unemployed people to work.  Other policies have been tried.  We have long and bitter experience of the policy the Deputy advocates.  It has been in operation here.  We can judge it by its results over a number of years. We can judge it by its results under the most favourable possible conditions. We have seen it operated by <Col N="156" /> men who were undoubtedly able men and backed by financial resources of considerable size and under circumstances when world conditions were altogether different from now; and yet the results produced here were wholly bad.  We are reversing that policy, and we are reversing it under circumstances of considerable difficulty. Those of us who were looking forward to the day when an Irish Government would set out to develop Irish industry, reorganise agriculture, and develop the resources of the country generally for the benefit of the people, never contemplated having to do it under circumstances like the present&mdash;circumstances of world-wide depression and during an economic war with Great Britain.  Despite these abnormal conditions and these special difficulties which have brought down countries that were highly industrialised for over a century and that possessed vast resources&mdash;brought them down until they had to abandon the very things they held most dear&mdash; we are getting results here.  We have seen the British Government abandon its traditional policy of Free Trade and divorce the pound from gold.  We have seen the American State adopting various and extraordinary measures to enable it to weather the storm. We have seen countries which were regarded industrially and economically, as the soundest in the world, having to take all sorts of emergency measures to try to alleviate the hardships brought upon their people by the present world-wide economic depression.  It is in these circumstances that we are trying to bring about the economic revolution here, and the fact that we have succeeded in a very great degree is the surest indication that our policy is sound and that when, by the development of international action, better conditions shall exist in other countries, we will get here the conditions we contemplated and under which everybody who is willing and able to work will have work for him to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit to the Deputy that he will be doing much more to help in adjusting the material conditions here, which concern him so much, by making <Col N="157" /> constructive suggestions in relation to the policy that we are operating and by trying to help us along the road we are going instead of by talking what seems to me to be completely unintelligible nonsense about the economic results of the British tariffs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear all the Minister's speech.  His last words were something about talking rot about our political status, but what I did hear the Minister say was obviously rot about our political status.  What is the difference between our present status and any other status the Minister can conceive of?  This State is sovereign and independent and if the Minister thinks that, say, Spain achieved a higher status by becoming a Republic than by being a monarchy, he completely misunderstands the word &ldquo;status.&rdquo; The Minister says that the present economic war is for the purpose of compelling us to a political status that we do not want.  As far as I can understand the various statements from England, it is nothing of the sort.  The economic war was imposed because this Government refused to hand over certain moneys that it was assumed they were to pay. Certain responsible men have stated that it was merely a matter of money. The Minister tries to make out that the implication of the words was that they were trying to use this weapon to force us to be satisfied with a certain form of government here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not attempt to quote any British Minister.  I was talking of what Deputy MacDermot said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of what the Minister said.  It is the sort of stuff which the Minister puts out for his supporters.  The British statements have made it clear, whether they mean it or not, that they are not so very much concerned with the actual matter of money that was held to be due to be sent over, but they have said that they cannot tolerate a position whereby they make an agreement with another country, and that country, without in any way seeking their agreement to a <Col N="158" /> change in it, wantonly repudiates that agreement.  That is the British position on which the Minister tries to misrepresent.</P>
      <P>The Minister then says that he understands that the Northern farmers are not so happy in their present condition. The civil servants are not very happy about the &ldquo;cut,&rdquo; and neither are the unemployed very happy about their present position.  I have no doubt that a great number of the unemployed would be very happy to become civil servants even with the &ldquo;cut,&rdquo; but the Minister says that because the Northern farmers are suffering that, therefore, he takes it as proof that they are in no way better off than our farmers are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to an agreement with England, the Minister will admit that the agreement that is talked about is one that would remove the tariffs operating against us in Ireland.  One item, with regard to cattle, would mean that if our farmers are now in the same position as the Northern farmers are, our farmers would be much better off. That would not mean that the Government would give up its bounties, but as far as the agreement would go, it would affect the price of cattle.  With regard to two year old cattle it would mean that the farmer would get £6 more per head.  The Minister, when he talks about the farmers in the North not being happy, is merely trying to mislead the people in this country.  He knows perfectly well that the farmers here, with regard to every beast over two years old sold to England, would be £6 better off minus the 35/- given in the way of bounty out of taxation. The Minister asks us to prove that the agreement would be an improvement on the present situation.  What happened here?  There was an agreement that we would send over certain moneys to England.  This Government repudiated that, with the result that the British Government have proceeded to impose a tax direct upon our farmers by, in effect, seizing upon their goods in British ports.  This Government has created that position.  When it did that the Minister talks and demands that we shall demonstrate certain things.  The Government had a clear duty and that was to take every <Col N="159" /> possible measure to put an end to the condition whereby the British Government were not only claiming but taking from our farmers moneys that our own Government denied the British Government was due to get.  It was the Government's business to prove clearly that no agreement could be come to and that it meant that it would leave us paying this.  It is the Government's business to make it clear to the people of this country that there is no possible means of getting agreement with the British except on the terms of the full payment of the moneys claimed to be due.  We are satisfied&mdash; and if not it is the Government's business to prove that we are wrong&mdash; that an agreement would be possible with England which would produce not merely the pre-economic war conditions, but which would remove the tariffs at present operating against our farmers and which would not at the same time impose the paying over to England annually of the same amount of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is not so, it can be quite clearly proved that we are wrong by the Government carrying out its obvious duty and making it abundantly clear to the people that no such agreement is possible.  This Government has never attempted to do anything of the sort.  We have a clear case.  Our economic position here is something totally different from what it was two years ago.  Outside nations clearly recognise that the world economic depression is a very serious problem.  It is a factor which has to be faced by every country and in those circumstances our liability to pay is a thing which would have to be taken into account.  The last time the Government delegation went to London they were talking about thousands of millions of pounds in gold ounces.  They did not base any case at all upon our inability to pay. They referred to this thing that the Minister has just assumed about our right to retain the land annuities. <Col N="160" /> The very legislation brought in by this Government was an admission that the Government knows we have not a right to retain the land annuities on legal grounds.  But we have a moral right to propose to the British Government that they should be prepared to forego the full claim that they have against us on the grounds of our inability to pay.  This Government has never attempted to do any such thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has suggested that it is up to us to act. The Government has failed calamitously in its duty.  There is only one way to prove it and that is, by the body which has power to negotiate, entering into negotiations.  If, as a result of the negotiations, they find themselves in a position to say: &ldquo;We have taken every possible step and we find the British Government immovable and we only have a choice between the present position with the tariffs or the pre-retention of the land annuities position,&rdquo; then we might discuss whether or not the previous position was better than the present position. I say that the Government is failing to do its duty.  It is refusing to do its job.  It merely turns to us and says: &ldquo;Prove that an improvement can be made.&rdquo; There is no one in a position to prove that except this Government, and it should have the courage to take the proper steps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only can the tariffs be abolished <Col N="162" /> but they can be abolished without imposing on our people the whole amount that was previously paid.  The Minister declares that we are penalised through the medium of tariffs in order to make the majority of the people agree to a political status less than the country is entitled to enjoy.  I do not know what the Minister means by that.  Does he suggest that we are entitled to enjoy a political status under which we will be in a position to make agreements with other countries, that we will insist on other countries fulfilling their agreements, but whenever it suits us we will turn round and refuse to recognise our agreements? What is the political status the British Government are trying to deprive us of?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that things would be splendid if the British treated us as a foreign country, like the Argentine.  The British people have money to the extent of £500,000,000 invested in the Argentine and upon that sum interest has to be paid.  The Argentinians have to recognise that that £500,000,000, while invested in their country, belongs to Britain.  The land annuities in this country represent, roughly, £70,000,000. The British people invested that money in this country by lending it to the Irish farmers to enable them to buy out their land.  The Argentine is indebted to England and it pays interest upon a sum of £500,000,000. Even if we are a foreign country or a member of the British Commonwealth we must recognise that the British people have invested money in our country.  They lent it to the Irish people for the purpose of buying land or other concerns and we are bound to <Col N="163" /> repay that money, just the same as the Argentinians.  If the Argentinians were to turn around to-morrow and say to the British &ldquo;You have £500,000,000 invested here but it is an awful burden on us to have to pay interest upon it,&rdquo; I doubt if the British Government would treat the Argentinians as favourably as they do now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real analogy is the Argentinian analogy.  When we talk about the enormous burden upon our people, let us consider the position of other countries.  We have not any war reparations operating against us.  We are in an analogous position with the Argentine.  The British and some Irish people advanced to this country a sum of £70,000,000.  They claim that that capital belongs to them and they are <Col N="164" /> due that amount, or the interest upon it.  When you talk about the appalling burden on us, think of the appalling burden upon the Argentine.  The Argentine is bound to pay to this base, brutal and bloody English people the interest upon the money invested.</P>
